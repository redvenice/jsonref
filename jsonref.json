He took it up when he was forced to give up polo in 1971 due to an arthritic wrist.

He died in 1919 aged just 13.Wood Farm had been occupied by a tenant until it was turned back into a Royal residence.Mr Vickers added: \u0027Wood Farm is more practical than opening up Sandringham.

The New York Times Book Review called it “painfully beautiful”.Publishers credit the endorsement of Witherspoon’s Hello Sunshine book club for the delayed surge. Sales peaked in March at 75,000 copies in one week.Last week, the book landed back at No 1 on the New York Times’ fiction bestseller list, a return to the top spot it previously held for 30 weeks. And now Witherspoon plans to produce and star in a feature film based on the story.Owens, who was born in Georgia but lives in Idaho, said her mother encouraged her to venture far into the oak forests, saying: “Go way out yonder where the crawdads sing.”But according to some, Crawdads has a clouded genesis.According to Slate, after spending 22 years in Africa with her husband, Mark, Owens were advised never to return to Zambia after they were wanted for questioning in connection with the murder of a poacher. The murder, which took place in 1995, was filmed by an ABC camera crew.Owens is not implicated, but her stepson and her husband were identified by some witnesses. The crime later became the subject of an 18,000-word story written by Jeffrey Goldberg and published in the New Yorker.Goldberg told Slate’s Laura Miller he was surprised how Owens and her publishers have brushed over the episode.“I got a copy of Crawdads and I have to say I found it strange and uncomfortable to be reading the story of a southern loner, a noble naturalist, who gets away with what is described as a righteously motivated murder in the remote wild,” Goldberg noted.In an interview last year, Owens said she reads more non-fiction – biology and physics – than fiction.She said: “There is too much great, real science to be had. So when I read novels – to break away from the precision of science writing – I choose those with compelling story lines written descriptively.”When sales surpassed a million this summer, Owens posted on her website that her connection with readers “has filled my life”.She said: “Booksellers, giant ones and tiny ones, recommended Crawdads. And then came my readers. I treasure the connection I feel with you all. I cannot even express my gratitude, but I’ll try with a simple thank you!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e27e9bb4a57953a7d5a8a03a08e83c7a354a50a6/196_687_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=1125\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21e90e1de61335fbd2d2ba1a3af880d7 1125w","title":"raymond briggs interview time for lights out","story":"His frank new illustrated memoir Time for Lights Out may be his last. The Snowman author talks about his love for ‘bogeydom’ and why he’s ‘fed up’ with his festive creationFamously, Raymond Briggs hates Christmas it’s one of the ironies of modern publishing that this self-described “grumpy old man” has become inextricably linked with the juggernaut of the festive season. The animation of his picture book The Snowman, first screened in 1982, is now as traditional as mince pies and family rows. Stage shows, adverts, toys, toilet paper – “it’s a worldwide industry,” he marvels. “China, Japan: a world of Snowmen. The whole blessed world.” Time has done nothing to soften his irritation with the cheerful satsuma-nosed figure. “I was fed up with it years ago. I’m even more fed up with it now it’s been going on for nearly 40 bloody years.”Of course, there’s not a frond of tinsel to be seen in Briggs’s original, which ends with a mournful heap of melted snow. It was the animation that brought in troops of dancing snowmen around a jolly Santa Claus – and it took many “liquid lunches” before Briggs agreed to sell the film rights to producer John Coates. “Every five minutes he’d raise the topic and I’d say no because I knew he’d commercialise it. Which he did. Done very well, at the same time.” Briggs had already conjured a far more characteristic vision of the festive season in 1973’s Father Christmas, which featured a solitary old curmudgeon toiling through bad weather on his sleigh in oilskins, complaining all the way. “Bloody awful job,” Briggs says. “He’s going to be a bit grumpy.”The fact that the Snowman book and film have merged in the public imagination is a further source of frustration. “It annoys me that people think the book’s success is based on the film. It’s the other way around, for God’s sake! Not that I care,” he adds rather unconvincingly. The Snowman film is what’s responsible for all the “piles of Snowman tat” he’s been sent over the decades (a neighbour used to sell the overflow on eBay for charity). “Snowmen creep in everywhere!” he says. His reluctant fondness is perhaps indicated by the souvenir mug that crops up in a drawing for his new book, Time for Lights Out.You could call it an autobiography in his own words it’s a “hotchpotch” of drawings and verse, still lifes and scribbles, observations, memories and quotations. All of them face head on, with unblinking clarity and a certain grim humour, the universal drama of ageing and death. Nearly 86 and frail but chipper, Briggs is now contending, as he gallantly puts it, with “a touch of Parkinsonism”, and has a live-in carer (“wonderful woman, I couldn’t do without her”). He has been working on the book over the past decade and a half, setting it aside for long periods while caring for his long-term partner, Liz Benjamin, who died in 2015.The book concentrates as much on words as images. “It just happens sometimes, you’re writing and it starts turning into verse. I was amazed, really. I don’t call it poetry because it’s not.” Drawn entirely in soft grey pencil, it begins with the shared domesticity of old age and the joys of a daily walk (“Great clots of primroses everywhere! Good job this book’s not in colour. I’d have to paint the bloody things”). It goes on to investigate the mysteries of old men’s hair, the frailties of age and ill health, the passing of time and the stubborn endurance of objects (“the breadboard I use today, and the knife, have been with me all my life”). Briggs returns to his childhood during the second world war to his evacuation to the countryside, and to his parents, previously immortalised in the 1998 graphic memoir Ethel and Ernest.There are memories of his wife, Jean Taprell Clark, whose schizophrenia meant that they decided not to have children, and who died of leukaemia in 1973. Briggs includes heartbreakingly beautiful photographs and a love letter she wrote to him from hospital. In a section called “Soon” he thinks ahead, to the inevitable care home and even to the grave, but always maintaining a mordant humour. “Future Ghosts” imagines his house being cleared after his death: “There must have been  some barmy old bloke here  long-haired, artsy-fartsy type,  did pictures for kiddy books  or some such tripe.” Sweet sketches and verse about his step-grandchildren – “a shaft of light amid the gloom of old age” – are a welcome interlude.He’s publishing it, he says, as a work in progress. “I wasn’t ever going to have enough life to finish it properly, so I thought I’d better get it out now. Bit of a dodge, really.” With more time and energy, “I’d finish off some of the drawings that are only scribbles. You start drawing it, then you leave it, but you never get round to finishing it off. Everything takes so bloody long when you’re old. I’ve just spent half an hour getting dressed. Ludicrous!”But any raggedness seems entirely fitting for a book created from a vantage point of both magisterial confidence and profound uncertainty – looking back on a life of extraordinary artistic achievement from the vulnerability of old age. There are smudges and rubbings out, feints and wavering handwriting impressionistic scribbles, in which the dog Jess is a joyous scrawl of life-force energy, contrast with calm vistas of landscape. In studies of that long-lived breadboard, or a light switch or door handle, decades of wear and emotion are miraculously made visible.Briggs is delighted to have it out in the world - though he does manage to summon some customary annoyance about the misty drawing of a man reading to a small child beneath the first piece, “Once Upon a Time”, which riffs on the contrast between childhood bedtime stories and life’s final “lights out”. “You can hardly see the bloody thing it’s so badly printed,” he complains. I counter that presumably it is meant to be faint. “Not THAT faint,” he snaps back. “It’s too fucking faint we could say! Oh dear.”Time for Lights Out is also extraordinarily frank about the physical indignities of old age – at one point, he is post-op in hospital at 3am, weeping, “with a Dr White’s sanitary towel  stuck up my bum”. (A nurse comforts him with a cuddle.) In a society that tends to shy away from the realities of death and decrepitude, the honesty is shocking. The emotional nakedness of the book is startling, too – there is no filter on his most raw, self-betraying memories. He writes about his impatience with Jean, or thinking at his father’s deathbed, “Don’t sit swinging your legs like a little boy. Get on with it, and die.”But then Briggs has been breaking taboos from the start of his career, even in his children’s books showing Father Christmas on the toilet, then rejoicing in the yuck factor of his fantastical 1977 grimefest Fungus the Bogeyman. “I was going to do an alphabet book – A is for apple. And then I thought, why does it have to be so perfect? Why can’t the apple have a maggot sticking out of the top? And that’s how I became immersed in bogeydom.” In Ethel and Ernest, he was strikingly matter-of-fact about his wife’s mental illness – and no reader will forget the stark, devastating drawing of his mother’s dead body on a hospital trolley. That same readiness to look horror in the eye, and get it down on paper in a domestic context, was what made When the Wind Blows, his 1982 graphic novel about an old couple during nuclear war, so powerful. (He’s left politics behind now: “I thought a United States of Europe was rather a nice idea, but I don’t think about all that now. Too old.”)I wonder if this frankness is a reaction against the buttoned-up decorum of the previous generation, and in particular his mother, a former lady’s maid who prized euphemism above unpleasantness and would chase her long-haired son around with a comb, but Briggs has never liked dwelling on his motivations. “It’s not a campaign. I just do what I want to do.” The closest he’ll come to a self-diagnosis is the definition of a “creative sociopath” that he seized on some years ago and still has pinned up on the wall. “‘Artistic people … can appear self-absorbed, impulsive, impatient and intolerant’,” he reads aloud. “Brilliant. That’s me to a tee.”Briggs grew up in Wimbledon with his mother and milkman father, and initially wanted to become a reporter. Then, inspired by Giles and other cartoonists, “I became interested in drawing as well. All the things I wanted to do even at that early age were to do with print – printed writing, printed drawing, the press. I wasn’t interested in daubing oil paint. No good with the damn stuff, sticky and awkward.” His ambition to become a lowly cartoonist met with outrage at an interview for the Wimbledon School of Art, but they let him in anyway. “It was all Italian Renaissance – I always preferred the northern school, Bruegel and Rembrandt and whatnot. The Italians were mythical I preferred the ordinariness.”After being conscripted as a draughtsman for his national service, and then a spell at the Slade, Briggs began to work as an illustrator. He brought a touch of Bruegel to his first big success, peopling the 1966 Mother Goose Treasury with sturdily everyday folk, and began to write for children after discovering how bad most kids’ books were. His success, as he puts it now, was simple: “I liked to find fantastical creatures and treat them realistically – I think that’s quite a good idea.” An endlessly fascinated eye for detail and refusal to dissemble made him an instinctively brilliant children’s writer, but he’s never differentiated between his audiences. “I don’t see any difference between doing children’s and adult books. My attitude is exactly the same. I just do the book as I want it to be.”Mortality and the piercing nostalgia for vanished times have been a constant in all his work: the snowman melts Father Christmas cooks his lunch in a loving replica of Briggs’s battered childhood kitchen. In Time for Lights Out, which from the title on explores the correlations between childhood and old age, the subjects that have moved him all his career become only more intensely felt. Not least is the fascination with his parents, whose possessions endure as much as their memories. We discover that the mirror his dad brought home on the back of his bike before Raymond was born, mounted on the mantelpiece with such pride in Ethel and Ernest, now lurks in Briggs’s garage, nearly nine decades on. “Clumsy and ugly  not even quaint or kitsch … How can I throw it away?”“I think you’re a bit obsessed with your parents,” accuses his contradictory alter ego Prodnose, who pops up throughout the book telling Briggs off for being bad-tempered or a dirty old man. How does he explain that obsession now? “I was an only child, and my mother had me very late – most unusual for those times. She absolutely, totally worshipped me. It was awful, I think, the way she treated my dad. Once my dad bought this car as a great treat, for the first time in his life, and she made him give it to me. I didn’t want the damn thing anyway! There were no quarrels between them, it’s just that I came first for her.”The stretch of time that has elapsed since his parents’ death in 1971, two years before his wife Jean, now astonishes Briggs. If you haven’t had children, he says, “deaths are the biggest event of your life”. And once you reach old age yourself, as he quotes from Muriel Spark’s novel Memento Mori, it’s like living on a battlefield, with friends either going or gone. But Briggs has also made space in Time for Lights Out for Spark’s pointed remark on the importance of facing up to mortality: “There is no other practice which so intensifies life.”• Time for Lights Out by Raymond Briggs is published by Jonathan Cape (£18.99).

Or were Stalin’s policies made on the hoof?European politicians seeking to rebuild their ravaged societies in the immediate aftermath of the second world war had their work cut out for them. The conflict had devastated the continent, levelling cities, destroying economies, and uprooting 40 million people. It had spawned a series of civil wars in which occupiers and collaborators fought resistance movements for control of soon-to-be liberated territories. But Europe’s new leaders had to contend with more than just material ruin and blood-soaked politics. The Red Army had won the ground war in Europe and by 1945 its soldiers had liberated Warsaw, Prague, Berlin, Vienna and Budapest and were a presence from the Danish island of Bornholm to the Bulgarian littoral of the Black Sea. Looming over the political efforts at stabilisation and reconstruction, amid escalating tensions between Moscow and Washington, was the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin.Stalin’s ambitions for postwar Europe have been the subject of extensive debate. Some have argued that the Kremlin had a clear ideological commitment to projecting Soviet power as far and as ruthlessly as possible others have maintained that Soviet policies were made on the hoof – improvised reactions to the introduction in 1947 of the Truman doctrine and the Marshall plan. Norman Naimark cleaves to the second of these views. “There is very little evidence,” he writes, “that Stalin had a preconceived plan for creating a bloc of countries in Europe with a common Soviet-style system.” In Naimark’s account, Stalin was no dogmatic tyrant determined to foist communist dictatorships on hapless and exhausted countries but rather a “hyperrealist”, who was ready to endorse governing coalitions of communists with other parties of the left and even the right just as long as they did not become hostile to the Soviet Union. The cold war emerged because Soviet geopolitical ambitions (and anxieties) were ultimately at loggerheads with those of the western powers.Beneath the familiar narrative of a continent inexorably pulled apart by mutually hostile superpowers, Naimark zooms in on the political history of seven countries and cities to argue that they were not simply squares on the chessboard on which the Americans and the Soviets competed for supremacy. He shows that, in the years between 1945 and 1949, the future of the continent was also wrought by national politicians who picked their way through the political and diplomatic rubble of their own wartorn societies in a bid to (re)assemble fragile but ultimately enduring governments. These “capable and perspicacious” politicians played their often weak hands remarkably well, skilfully and doggedly resisting or circumventing Soviet influence, as they “sought to protect and, in some cases, strengthen their country’s sovereignty, meaning the right of their nations to govern themselves.”In the wake of the 1944 armistice between his country and the Soviet Union, the wily 74-year-old Finnish Prime Minister Juha Kusti Paasikivi succeeded in walking a fine line between an inevitably Kremlin-friendly foreign policy and national sovereignty in domestic affairs. He gave in to the Soviet demand that Finnish leaders who had sent their armies to join the German assault on Leningrad be tried as war criminals, but also resolutely insisted on the right of Finns to govern themselves as an independent nation. In Italy, the Communist leader Palmiro Togliatti, who had spent the war years in Moscow and enjoyed Stalin’s confidence, oversaw the peaceful transformation of an underground army of resistance fighters into a mass political party, steered the country away from the abyss of a civil war, and even entered into coalition governments with the Christian Democrats. If the political dramas in Helsinki, Warsaw, Vienna, Rome and Berlin played out in the shadows cast by Soviet and American power, they were, nevertheless, “European history, in the sense that … the agency of Europeans mattered and mattered a lot”. Berlin was a case in point. When Stalin blockaded allied access to the city in June 1948, the charismatic mayor, Ernst Reuter, emerged as a resourceful and resilient champion of the western Berliners. As the shortages began to bite, he rallied them not to give in to Soviet pressure, declaring “cruel, brutal, aggressive powers will not beat us to our knees”. On the international stage, he cast Berlin as a vital outpost of freedom that had, both morally and strategically, to be defended. Thanks to the ensuing allied airlift, the blockade not only failed but served to rehabilitate the Germans in the eyes of western powers and to destroy any lingering attachment to the idea that the Soviet Union was an ally. At the founding of Nato in 1949, US President Harry Truman declared: “Berlin had been a lesson to us all.”But even if the Kremlin lacked a clear game plan for Europe, the latitude it was prepared to offer reflected its own strategic priorities. As long as neighbouring Sweden remained a neutral power, Finland was spared the fate of a “frontline nation” and could be allowed to manage its own affairs Poland, situated directly on the Soviet Union’s western flank and the springboard for two invasions in the first half of the 20th century, could not. So the Communist leader Wladyslaw Gomulka’s attempts to pursue a “Polish road to socialism” were thwarted by the Kremlin and he found himself arrested for “rightist nationalist deviations” (even if he did go on to enjoy a comeback in the years after Stalin’s death). Postwar statesmen all struggled for sovereignty but on a playing field that was heavily tilted one way or another by Moscow’s commitment to controlling the shape and outcomes of national politics.Some will find Naimark’s treatment of Soviet policy in Europe rather too selective. He passes over the ruthless Moscow-backed communist takeovers of Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, eastern Germany and Romania in favour of states (Austria, Italy, Yugoslavia, Denmark and Finland) where any Soviet attempts to engineer such a takeover would have faced almost insurmountable political, diplomatic and military obstacles. But he shows convincingly how, in key parts of the continent, Soviet policy was a tentative series of improvisations and concessions to the presence of atomic-powered US military superiority and the shrewd machinations of European politicians.Stalin and the Fate of Europe details the negotiations, the intrigues, and the showdowns that dominated the febrile politics of the postwar years but at the cost of a wider discussion of the ravaged and ided societies themselves. There are only glimpses into wider political culture: Naimark mentions popular support for the Finnish leaders tried for war crimes and the anti-communist proclamations of the Catholic Church in the crucial Italian elections in 1948, when priests declared the ballot a vote “for or against Christ”, but he has precious little to say about what Finns, Italians, Albanians and Poles themselves actually made of the precarious new architecture of their postwar states.Stalin’s attempts to constrain the sovereignty of European states in the aftermath of the war inevitably evoke parallels with Russia’s recent annexation of Crimea, backing of insurgents in eastern Ukraine and support for right-wing populist parties across the EU. Those endeavouring to defend the independence of their territories and governments today would do well to look to the pragmatism, dexterity and resourcefulness of the politicians of the late 1940s. The book is a timely and instructive account not merely of our own history but also of our fractious, unsettling present.• Stalin and the Fate of Europe is published by Harvard (RRP £23.95).

It has extensive contracts with the British military and also manufactures electronic warfare and communications systems for military vehicles.Advent’s offer to purchase Cobham was approved by shareholders in August, but delayed in September when the government intervened on national security grounds.On Friday, however, the business secretary, Andrea Leadsom – who led the consultation over the deal – gave the go ahead. It came after Advent proposed a series of legal undertakings designed to mitigate potential national security concerns, including protecting sensitive government information and giving notice to the government over future sale plans.Lady Nadine Cobham, the daughter-in-law of the company’s founder Sir Alan Cobham, said: “This is a deeply disappointing announcement and one cynically timed to avoid scrutiny on the weekend before Christmas.“In one of its first major economic decisions, the government is not taking back control so much as handing it away.“In Cobham we stand to lose yet another great British defence manufacturer to foreign ownership, through a takeover that would never have been approved by the Americans, French or Japanese, all of whom have taken steps recently to raise protections for their own defence sectors.”Boris Johnson defended the sale. He said: “I think it’s very important that we should have an open and dynamic market economy.A lot of checks have been gone through to make sure that in that particular case all the security issues that might be raised can be satisfied and the UK will continue to be a very, very creative and dynamic contributor to that section of industry and all others.” The business, founded in 1934 as Flight Refuelling Ltd, was floated in 1985 but the family maintained a large stake. The firm’s air-to-air refuelling technology played a key role in the 1982 Falklands war.Leadsom said: “This decision has been meticulously thought over, and I have taken advice from the defence secretary, the deputy national security adviser and government officials across multiple departments. I have also met with both of the companies on several occasions, as have several senior members of my department.“Having considered the consultation responses and further advice from the defence secretary, I am satisfied that the undertakings mitigate the national security risks identified to an acceptable level and have therefore accepted them and cleared the merger to proceed.“While trade and investment play an important part in the UK economy, when intervening in mergers on national security grounds, I will not hesitate to use my powers to protect national security, if it is appropriate to do so.“Separately, the companies have given a legally binding commitment that there will be significant protection of jobs and have also agreed with the takeover panel that Cobham’s headquarters will remain in the UK, that the Cobham name will continue to be used and that there will be a guaranteed level of R\u0026ampD spend. This will secure the future of Cobham and the important role it plays in our world-leading defence sector and economy.”Ed Davey, the acting Lib Dem leader, joined in criticism of the merger. “It is deeply concerning that the Conservative government is allowing this sale to go ahead, despite previously cited concerns that it could undermine our national security. While Andrea Leadsom claims these concerns have been mitigated we have yet to see evidence of this,” he said.“If Boris Johnson’s government are happy to sell off a leading UK defence and aerospace company to Trump’s America, how can we expect his government to protect our defence and manufacturing sectors, not to mention every other sector of our economy, as they negotiate trade deals after Brexit?”David Lockwood, the chief executive of Cobham, said: “We are grateful to the secretary of state for her diligent handling of the process over the last few weeks and the certainty she has delivered for all stakeholders, most importantly our employees, before the Christmas break.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e44a25bfe4d6b5c427b926c5d669248c0da84fb7/0_121_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71a3cce3c58918c0ad0af5b2853a2fbd","title":"bank of england audio leak followed loss of key cybersecurity staff","story":"Exclusive: ex-employees say at least 20 security staff were reassigned or left in past yearThe Bank of England restructured its security department and lost multiple senior employees in charge of protecting some of Britain’s most critical financial infrastructure shortly before it suffered a major breach, the Observer can reveal.After the central bank admitted that hedge funds had gained early access to its market-moving press conferences via a backup audio feed, multiple former employees contacted the Observer to warn that the Bank was struggling with the departure of key staff responsible for protecting it against external threats.The sources said at least 20 of the Bank’s staff tasked with information security had left or been reassigned elsewhere within the bank within the past year, raising questions over the protection of the nation’s payment systems and other critical infrastructure vital for the British financial system. The Observer was able to verify 13 of these departures using information from social media and other sources.The revelations come at a sensitive time for the Bank as it prepares for the handover of power in March from Mark Carney, the outgoing governor, to Andrew Bailey, the current chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority.Threadneedle Street has also played a central role in efforts to improve the safety and integrity of the financial system since the 2008 banking collapse, including warning the industry to improve its cyber and information security operations. It is responsible for key parts of the nation’s critical infrastructure, including the payments systems that carry every bank transfer made in Britain, the wages of millions of people, cheques, and payments between businesses of all sizes. On an average day in 2018, the Bank’s real-time gross settlement system (RTGS) settled transactions worth £651bn.According to the former employees, the Bank’s chief information security officer and two deputies have left in the past year.Multiple former employees described the organisation as beset by budget cuts before Carney’s departure, against a backdrop of concerns over cost efficiency. They said there were problems with staffing given the departures and low staff morale.Much of the disquiet stemmed from a move to dismantle the Bank’s “security and privacy” directorate, the people said. The team, part of the central services ision, previously had oversight over cyber, personnel and physical security matters, as well as privacy. Staff and responsibilities were instead spread across other parts of the organisation.It is understood that many of the people now sit under the Bank’s technology, security and risk directorates, in a move designed to make the organisation safer. The Bank has about 70 cybersecurity professionals.A Bank of England spokeswoman said: “The Bank operates the highest standard of information security and is confident in our ability to recognise cyber threats and defend our systems appropriately. Earlier this year, the Bank completed a review of its central services target operating model and, as part of that, reinforced the arrangements for first- and second-line information security. This change was fully supported by the Bank’s audit and risk committee.”The Bank admitted late on Wednesday night that it had suffered a security breach, with a provider of a backup audio feed of the governor’s market-sensitive press conferences selling early access to unnamed investors without its knowledge. Those investors could have used the few seconds’ advantage to profit.It was alerted to the breach by the Times newspaper, conducted a rapid internal investigation and passed the matter to the FCA. The City watchdog has confirmed it is investigating the issue, and it is understood that Bailey will recuse himself from all discussions of the matter to avoid any suggestion of a conflict of interest.The Bank’s chief operating officer, Joanna Place, is the most senior manager responsible for physical and information security, and faced calls to resign from a former member of the Bank’s monetary policy committee, Danny Blanchflower, following the breach. Place, who was appointed in July 2017, reports directly to the governor, and has an equal status to the Bank’s deputy governors.Multiple sources said the Bank was under pressure to cut the budget of the central services ision, which was managed by Place. They said the government spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, warned in December 2018 that the Bank needed to deliver better value for money.Place told the Commons’ public accounts committee in January that the Bank did not “have any gaps in cybersecurity”. However, her chief information security officer, Cameron “Buck” Rogers, resigned little over a month later. Multiple other security experts followed him.A spokeswoman for the Bank said Rogers resigned on 23 February and that Place was not aware he was going to quit when she gave evidence on 21 January.At the hearing, Meg Hillier, the Labour chair of the committee, expressed surprise at Place’s answer, given the difficulties other public-sector organisations had with recruiting and retaining cyber security staff, and asked again if there were any vacancies.Place responded: “Offhand, I do not know whether we have any vacancies, but we do not have a problem with recruiting and we do not have a problem with retention in cyber, either.”There was widespread unease within the Bank following her testimony, multiple sources said, and in the months after her appearance the cybersecurity function suffered the outflow of staff.The public sector struggles to retain staff in cybersecurity roles because of intense competition from the higher-paying private sector. However, the reputation of the Bank and its important role in protecting financial stability are attractive for potential candidates, and the sources said they believed it was in the public interest to shed light on the problems it was facing.A Bank of England spokesperson said: “The incident relating to the misuse of a backup audio feed from the Bank’s press conferences by a third-party supplier, which the Bank has referred to the Financial Conduct Authority for further investigation, was not a cyber security issue.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfc217bd8c2c3a89dc6191540fa8ed173f8ebfcc/102_182_1053_632/master/1053.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65138c6dba6d0043fdd1f66dffbdde1c","title":"how do you stop a megacity grinding to a halt a cartoon","story":"Until four years ago Dar Es Salaam had no public transport.

It is only 10 days since the party lost a fourth consecutive general election and it is already preparing for its next defeat.Despite the obvious truth that Jeremy Corbyn must take the blame for the worst result in almost 100 years, Rebecca Long Bailey, his anointed successor, is the favourite to succeed him as party leader. Her election, which is close to being certain, would be the public statement that Corbyn has gone but Corbynism lives on.Labour supporters, who want to win the next election, should not despair. The party’s future success, perhaps even its survival, depends on the genuine democratic socialists in the parliamentary party seizing control of the political agenda. The elevation of Long Bailey would provide an early opportunity to demonstrate that they mean business.The cause would be best served by an outright refusal to accept the imposition of a leader who does not command their confidence. A formal protest with a recorded vote would be almost as effective. Emboldened, they must then insist that the shadow cabinet is, once again, elected – giving its members an independent authority that they would not possess as the leader’s nominees. With their status restored, they would be free to challenge the strategy and tactics of both the leader and the advisers who, with Corbyn, must take some of the blame for the bloodbath of “black Thursday” and are, even now, arranging to remain surrogate leaders in the new regime.Labour MPs are notorious for their reluctance to fight the ideological battle for democratic socialism. The common response to the complaint that they have watched, but not opposed, the triumphant progress of the far left is the claim that at least they “stayed and fought”. More often than not, they stayed without fighting.If they fight now they will, of course, be accused of splitting the party. In truth they will be preventing, or at worst postponing, the real split that is bound to follow a further drift to the unelectable left. The second accusation will be the creation of a “party within a party”. A distinct and separate party of the far left has been a cuckoo in Labour’s nest ever since Ed Miliband’s invention of cut-price membership. Men and women who had spent long, dark nights outside Labour meetings hawking revolutionary newspapers came in from the cold – bringing their sectarian intolerance with them.They became the pathfinders for the most extensive and, it must be admitted, most successful takeover bid in Labour history. At its heart was Momentum, which began life under the guise of Corbyn’s Praetorian Guard but swiftly evolved into a vehicle for moving the party to what turned out to be the unelectable left. Momentum infiltrated constituency parties, enrolled enough delegates to successive annual conferences to gain a stranglehold on party policy, took effective control of Labour’s national executive committee and attempted – with a measure of success – to “deselect” Labour MPs who did not share its prejudices. Momentum found natural allies in recent conversions from Marxist and Trotskyite factions who, encouraged by the hope of colonising a real and functioning political party, suddenly saw the light.Compared with Momentum, the Militant tendency – which attempted to subvert Labour in the 1980s – was a ragbag of second-rate conspirators who took corrupt control of Liverpool but were only an irritant in other parts of the country. No Militant sympathisers were employed in the Labour party headquarters or in its regional offices, and no major trade union leader supported Militant’s aims. Now full-time officials openly boast of their Momentum membership. Militant remained an obscure sect.Thanks in part to Momentum, the Corbyn project was endorsed by thousands of good democratic socialists. The radical rhetoric obscured the fatal flaws of Corbyn’s philosophy – the blanket opposition to private enterprise, the support for any tinpot dictator who called himself a socialist, the intolerance of disagreement, the failure to cleanse Labour of antisemitism which proved that, although he hated racial prejudice, there were some racial prejudices that he did not hate enough. There is no doubt that there is still an army of Labour party members who cannot bring themselves to believe that the Corbyn project was destined to end in disaster. They have to be persuaded that Corbyn’s way could only ever lead to the disappointment of defeat and the betrayal of the millions of families who need a Labour government. No doubt Momentum’s leaders are still rejoicing about the control they achieved over the party machine. The celebrations are not being replicated in the food bank queues that, following Labour’s defeat, will only lengthen.Before the brilliance of Neil Kinnock’s Bournemouth conference speech in 1985 extinguished the hopes of Militant, outriders spent two years preparing the ground for his final assault. For Labour to become a party of government again it needs another army of genuine democratic socialist MPs mounting a similar onslaught on the great ideal’s false friends. Their task will be more than the recruitment of new party members to become a counterweight to infiltrators from the unelectable extremes. They must convince floating voters that democratic socialism is alive, well and ready to wake from its slumbers – and is worth voting for. Thanks to the Corbyn project, few people believe that today.It may be that the parliamentary party is not in a mood to heed the calls to arms. The self-styled “moderates” have always suffered from an excess of caution.

Either way, it’s another grey, rainy day. Tired of being indoors, you head out for a walk, striding south along the seafront. You go past Graham Ibbeson’s statue of Les Dawson and past, too, the town’s pier, whose entrance pavilion has half-timbering and an oriel window.Finally, you enter Promenade Gardens. At this time of year, its flowerbeds are not quite so richly planted as in the height of summer, but this hardly matters. Ahead of you is an exotic bloom of a wholly different order, in the form of an elaborate fountain – and here you pause for a moment. Made of cast iron around 1900 by Walter MacFarlane and Co of Glasgow, it is bright green, turquoise and coral and decorated with a relief featuring a pelican, a dragonfly and a squirrel. It is topped by a putto (a cherubic child). He wears a flower as a hat and sails a little boat made from a leaf. Noticing this makes you smile and suddenly the day seems a lot less dreary.Writing in 1969, Nikolaus Pevsner, the architectural historian whose Buildings of England series constitutes one of the great demotic achievements of 20th-century scholarship, wasn’t very kind about St Annes (he favoured nearby Lytham, seemingly because “one might well forget that it also has a seafront”). In his guide to north Lancashire, he says of it in the section headed “perambulation” that “none is needed”.But to love Pevsner is to argue with him. While he was right about lots of things – it must, indeed, have taken some courage to construct the Fairhaven United Reform Church, which looks for all the world as if it has been transported brick by brick from the Mount of Olives – he got plenty wrong, too. He neglects not only to include Promenade Gardens and its fountain but also the town’s bandstands and seaside shelters, more than one of which are listed now, not to mention the monument dedicated to the crew of the lifeboat Laura Janet, lost in a rescue attempt in 1886. Perhaps the gravest of his omissions, however, is Burlington’s Bar. Thanks to its Victorian tiled interior, Burlington’s rivals the Philharmonic Dining Rooms in Liverpool when it comes to truly beautiful places in which to get quietly pissed.Last week, Historic England revealed details of the more than 500 buildings and other constructions to which it awarded new or enhanced status in 2019. In addition to St Annes’s Technicolor fountain, the roll call includes a Victorian chemist’s shop in Lowestoft, its wooden cabinets and gilt labels (“poisons”, “surgical appliances”) still intact a pressurised vertical tunnel in Bedfordshire, built between 1948 and 1955 as a device to enable pilots to test how they might overcome potentially fatal spins a nursemaids’ passage in Regent’s Park, London, built in 1821 to enable children and their nannies safely to cross Marylebone Road and a K1 telephone kiosk near Keighley in West Yorkshire (the K1 was Britain’s first national phone box), which stands sentry by a rural beck, and ever since I clapped eyes on a photograph of it, I’ve fantasised about doing a walk that takes it in.I find that I look forward to Historic England’s listings more intensely with each year that passes. They grow not only ever more surprising – our sense of what constitutes our built heritage is expanding incrementally – but more joy-sparking, too. What loveliness, and what fascination. Look at the buildings that have made the grade and not only does the sweep of history wash over you in an invigorating wave you picture, too, all those iniduals, communities and experts who campaigned long and hard for their cherished lido or lychgate to be protected and somehow it gives you hope.People who notice: isn’t this what society needs? And isn’t noticing a kind of baton, one that may be passed on, as cheering as sunshine, as revitalising as a breeze? We cannot be reminded often enough to look more closely at the world as we move through it. The more we look, the more we see the more we see, the happier we feel. Gaze only at the pavement and it will do your soul no good at all.Pevsner, a German by birth, thought that art history in Britain was too class-ridden at its worst, it was “an activity a bit like stamp collecting”. But he also believed that of all the arts, architecture was the most important being the stuff that surrounds us, it is the form most closely connected to life.For a while we have been told that the arts may improve our mental health. Last week, however, it was reported that their beneficial effects may extend to our physical health: according to research carried out at University College London, and published in the BMJ, those who visit museums, galleries and the theatre may have less risk of dying early. If this is true, one can only imagine the benefits that could come with knowing something about the built environment – or even from merely being open to experiencing it.What I’m talking about is a world away from the bland fixations of glossy design magazines. It’s about the old as well as the new. It’s about murals and stained glass windows, cabmen’s shelters and municipal libraries: all the stuff, in other words, that’s already there.Not so long ago, I was invited to a party at a place hitherto unknown to me: the Fitzrovia Chapel in London’s Marylebone, which is all that remains of what was once the Middlesex Hospital. Built in 1891, its style is Italian Gothic. But on the night in question, all I knew – all I needed to know – was that its opulent mosaics of blue and gold were doing more for my mood than the wine I was drinking. In the moments before I entered the fray, I raised my eyes (and not my phone) to its shimmering vaults.

It has a erse landscape of tropical forests, flooded grasslands, dense coastal mangroves and mudflats.It is also a stop-off point for a number of migratory birds, including American flamingos, osprey and cuckoos. Fishermen say they have seen jaguars – as well as deer, anteaters and buffalo – swimming between the island and mainland.There are 27 jaguars on the island and five to six cats per 100 sq km in some parts. Normally only two to five jaguars would share a territory of this size. The island’s jaguars are believed to hunt deer, buffalo, lizards and monkeys, but a plentiful supply of fish could be the secret to their success, researchers say.Iranildo Coutinho, head of the ecological station on the island, describes it as a “kind of nursery or sanctuary” for jaguars because it may be fuelling populations on the mainland. “The fishermen often say that the island produces jaguars. It is the only coastal island along the coast of the Amazon and this is why it holds very important samples of fauna and coastal vegetation that are very well preserved and act almost like a live laboratory,” he said.The area of mainland adjacent to the island is dangerous for jaguars as there are several buffalo farmers who feel threatened by the presence of the cats. At the end of 2018, a female jaguar was killed with her cub after attacking dogs in the village of Sucuriju, 30 miles (50km) from the island.Jaguars are near threatened according to the IUCN red list, with sharp declines caused by deforestation and the illegal wildlife trade, which targets them for their skin and body parts.The Amazon is the single largest remaining stronghold for jaguars, but it is estimated recent wildfires have destroyed the habitats of 500 iniduals. These cats are one of the largest predators in South America and are often seen as a litmus test for forest health.The satellite technology fitted to the collars of the jaguars on Maracá-Jipioca provides researchers with hourly updates on the animals’ movements. The camera traps have already taken more than 30,000 pictures. Understanding how a predator uses its territory will help researchers learn how to limit inevitable conflicts with humans.WWF conservationists also collected blood samples from the collared jaguars to work out if they are crossing onto the mainland to breed – if not, then they are likely to have a very small gene pool, which could pose a problem for the long-term health of the population.Dr Chris Carbone, a senior research fellow at the Zoological Society of London who is an expert on predator-prey relationships, said the research (in which he was not involved) shows how versatile these cats are. “It is good to see jaguars showing such adaptability, as wildlife in general are increasingly exposed to reductions in their habitats and this ability to adapt may be critical for the future survival of such populations,” he said.“That said, we shouldn’t be complacent. We don’t know how long jaguars have been fishing on these islands. If it is a long-standing behavioural adaptation, it may be that many species are experiencing changes in their habitats which are too sudden to allow for them to adapt.”The research is being carried out in collaboration with the Jaguar Conservation Fund and Chico Mendes Institute for Bioersity Conservation. Jaguar conservationist Lailson Ferreira, who works with WWF on the island, said: “It’s important to preserve this island because this place is a treasure. There are very special creatures here, like the spotted jaguar and many others.”Oliveira added: “Months of meticulous planning went into the mission, but we can never guarantee collaring a wild animal. To have collared three jaguars on this first WWF expedition is an amazing result.“The satellite technology fitted to the collars is providing us with hourly updates on the animals’ movements for up to eight months, resulting in a bank of information on how the jaguars use the forest to live and flourish.”Next year, researchers are setting up more camera traps and in June 2020 they will collar two more jaguars."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de5cc2ba4160c6278b9bb3ad7f2c5d880850c445/0_828_6083_3650/master/6083.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c50a79452b6d358251e37f3103253bd","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"The pick of the best flora and fauna photos from around the world, from fighting sloths to rescued orangutans"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81c93291d7def1550a69b5ed2c0277d26095375c/0_150_700_420/master/700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb9b8e6a3de330ff9cdba7cd17c269cf","title":"return of the scunchie","story":"No self-respecting updo in the 1990s was complete without one, and now they’re back on catwalks and the high streetThey were once hailed by Carrie Bradshaw as a failsafe way to spot tourists in Manhattan.

In court documents filed on Thursday, Sokola, 33, told how she was introduced to Weinstein in 2002 at an event associated with her model agency a month after arriving from Poland aged 16.Weinstein told her he had made the careers of Penelope Cruz and Gwyneth Paltrow and that if she wanted to be an actress, she would have to be comfortable “losing her inhibitions and getting naked”.According to the complaint, the producer then asked her to lunch in the interest of helping her pursue an acting career. She agreed but alleges his driver brought them to Weinstein’s apartment instead. There, she claims “he terrified and sexually abused her”. Afterwards he insisted “what had just happened was normal”.When Sokola initially came forward with her claim as a Jane Doe in 2018, Weinstein’s lawyer dismissed them.“Like so many other women in this case who have already been exposed as liars, this latest completely uncorroborated allegation that is almost 20 years old will also be shown to be patently false,” said Weinstein’s then counsel, Benjamin Brafman.But Sokola, David and Doe’s accounts are strikingly similar. David claims Weinstein raped her in 2016 and masturbated in front of her both that year and a year earlier, including once during a meeting about a prospective acting job at the Montage hotel in Beverly Hills.Doe claims that Weinstein sexually assaulted her under the premise of discussing acting opportunities in 2002.Weinstein has consistently denied all claims of non-consensual sex, and pleaded not guilty to criminal charges against him.So far more than 80 women have accused him of sexual assault or harassment, including Rosanna Arquette, Ashley Judd, Rose McGowan, Gwyneth Paltrow and Mira Sorvino.But the latest court filing on behalf of Sokola, whose allegations (under a Jane Doe) first appeared in the 2018 class-action lawsuit that accused Weinstein and the board of his former film company of a pattern of sexual misconduct, point to a split in approaches.Under the current settlement deal being offered, Weinstein is not required to put up any of his own money or offer an admission of guilt. Additionally, company executives would be shielded from further claims and just $6.2m of the $47m would go to 18 of the alleged victims, with no one inidual receiving over $500,000.But newly enacted child victims legislation, which extends the age at which a victim can bring a claim for past crimes to 55, has reinvigorated efforts to hold Weinstein to account – as well as The Weinstein Company and its executives and Miramax’s parent firm, Disney – on the grounds that all of them had acted to protect the movie producer despite knowledge of his conduct.The complaint goes on to claim that “numerous employees and executives of Miramax and Disney were aware of Harvey Weinstein’s pattern of misconduct, but the companies that employed him utterly failed to supervise him, and they continued to empower him with their prestige and resources and allowed him to find more victims, including Kaja Sokola.”Disney did not reply to a request for comment at time of publication.Unlike many claims against Weinstein and his employers in the class-action suit, Sokola and Davis’s claims fall within the civil statute of limitations. Doe, a 16-year-old at the time of the alleged assault in 2002, is able to claim against Miramax’s then owner, Disney, as well as under the Child Victims Act.The company, says Wigdor, “bears responsibility legally for the negligence that ultimately permitted Harvey Weinstein to sexually assault our client”.In breaking away from the proposed class-action settlement, Sokola, Davis and Doe’s attorneys described it as “offensive and one-sided” and called on other victims and the New York attorney general to abandon the settlement and join their effort.“Where companies had actual knowledge of the sexual predator’s acts, then took steps to hide those acts from the larger public and enabled that person to continue by keeping them employed or building penalties for future transgressions into Harvey Weinstein’s contract, that sets reasonable grounds to hold those companies responsible,” Wigdor said.And that, Wigdor said, should also be seen in the context of a post-#MeToo environment in which employers and board members can be held accountable for the actions of a sexual predator or for permitting a sexually predatory environment to develop.“One of the ways of trying to minimize or curtail these power-dynamic situations is for companies to take greater control of, and responsibility for, the acts of its executives. That’s really what we are trying to do in addition to holding Harvey Weinstein accountable.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbaf341bdf7397863a8a37ade103df8a73f069e8/0_71_1797_1078/master/1797.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aab4d2f69d1567bdd9b0ac38b8d47d6b","title":"chelsea spurs frank lampard jose mourinho bond players","story":"Frank Lampard has said that José Mourinho’s ability to bond with his players and fill them with self-belief are skills he has looked to adopt since becoming a manager.Lampard has never forgotten how Mourinho’s encouragement boosted his confidence during the Portuguese’s first spell at Chelsea and he has tried to take a similar approach with his young players. Chelsea’s manager, who faces his former boss when his side visit Tottenham on Sunday, wants to build connections in the way Mourinho did.“When he first came to Chelsea, he was the first manager day-to-day who made me feel very close to him, working on the mental side, giving me that confidence,” Lampard said. “You form a bond. Working with the younger players now, it’s my duty to forge that same bond with them. They’re starting their journeys, their careers, and need to look up to me and the staff. I love all the young boys here.“They’re good lads, really good players. It’s a constant. How you are with them every day. How much you want to work with them on the training ground. How much you delve into their personal lives, and how they interact with you. That’s huge.”Lampard was asked whether it felt scripted when Mourinho, who returned to Stamford Bridge for a second spell in 2013, turned up in the showers at the end of the club’s 2004 summer tour to tell him that he was one of the best players in the world. “It felt instinctive,” Lampard said. “You’d have to ask him if it was planned. It made me feel great. Moments like that, it doesn’t need just to be best player in the world, but positive things. It was about drive, drive, drive and try and win titles. I’d try and do that with my players.”Lampard refused to accept that it is difficult for older managers to connect with young players. “If you’ve got it, you’ve got it,” he said. “You don’t lose it as you get older. I’m more aware of social media. Maybe it’s slightly easier for a young manager to be aware of it. I was aware of it as a player. But if you’ve got it personality-wise, you’ve got it.”The former Derby manager added that the trick is not getting too chummy with his players. “That’s the line you have to get right,” Lampard said. “I’d love to think I do. You’ll have to ask the players. I’m not hanging about with them playing PlayStation or stuff.”While Mourinho gave Chelsea a winning mentality when he joined them in 2004, Lampard pointed out the club’s success is also down to the ownership of Roman Abramovich, who bought the club in the summer of 2003. “It’s hard to say for sure,” he said. “It wouldn’t exist without Roman Abramovich, for sure. José Mourinho played a big part. He’s been successful twice here now. Who knows, though?”It was pointed out that Mourinho’s influence hung over the squad after his first spell ended in 2007. “It’s hard to manage a club when you’ve left it,” Lampard said. “Once he left, the legacy was up to the players. It was a strong group, different managers pushing that agenda. The credit for the longevity and how we won things afterwards goes down to the core of the squads we had at the time and our will to win.”Chelsea have lost four of their last five league games and another defeat would see them relinquish fourth place on goal difference to Spurs, who have chipped away at a 12-point gap since replacing Mauricio Pochettino with Mourinho last month, winning four of the Portuguese’s five league matches in charge."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/207c3ff4254f48e435af33f6b3a1e7933122df42/121_152_3367_2021/master/3367.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6a7f11ab54cea56aa42c70d3c1a4df9","title":"liverpool flamengo club world cup final match report","story":"“We’ve conquered all of Europe, we’re never gonna stop,” goes the opening line of Liverpool’s version of Allez, Allez, Allez. The song needs updating along with the list of honours on the champions’ wall at Melwood. Jürgen Klopp’s European champions never stop and, on a night of high drama, quality and controversy in Doha, they conquered the world, too.Roberto Firmino broke the hearts of his compatriots from Flamengo with the decisive goal in extra time as Liverpool triumphed in the Club World Cup. The Brazil international missed two clear openings in normal time but finally secured a title that had eluded predecessors in 1981, 1984 and 2005. Klopp’s team have achieved what no other in the club’s illustrious history have managed before. Plus a little pay-back for defeat by the Brazilian club in the final 38 years ago.Then, Liverpool had travelled to Tokyo on a jolly. This time they came to Qatar determined to write their names in Anfield folklore and validate the decision to bring a full-strength squad at the expense of the Carabao Cup. Klopp’s players delivered. Champions of Europe in June and champions of the world in December and, as things currently stand, champions of England next spring a glorious hat-trick beckons.The importance of victory could be heard as Jorge Jesus, the Flamengo coach, was claiming in his post-match press conference that the Brazilians were the better team in normal time. His words were drowned out by the sound of “Campiones, campiones, campiones” bellowing from the Liverpool dressing room. The only setback was an ankle injury to Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain that resulted in the unfortunate midfielder leaving the stadium on crutches.It was an enthralling final between two well-matched, positive and high-calibre teams. Flamengo had their chances too but, before being punished by one Brazil international in Firmino, they were thwarted by another in the imposing form of Alisson in Liverpool’s goal.The Club World Cup was decided not only by Brazilians, however. Jordan Henderson was outstanding in Liverpool’s midfield and supplied the cutting pass that led to Firmino’s winner. Behind him, Joe Gomez produced his best display of the season and a key role in a crucial clean sheet.Normal time ended in bewildering fashion when the Qatari referee, Abdulrahman al-Jassim, awarded Liverpool a stoppage-time penalty for a foul by Rafinha on Sadio Mané as he shaped to shoot. VAR showed Mané had been clipped a fraction outside the penalty area and, following a lengthy review by the on-field referee, the penalty and the booking for Rafinha were overturned. Mané may have shot before contact was made but that did not explain the drop ball that followed from the referee. Flamengo were unable to make the most of the reprieve, although the substitute Lincoln missed a fine chance to equalise in the final seconds of extra time.Liverpool knew what they were up against from the moment they emerged for their warm-up to piercing whistles from the estimated 15,000 Flamengo fans who had travelled. The noise from them was incessant, although all that really mattered to the European champions was Virgil van Dijk being present to hear it. The commanding central defender was back in the side having missed the semi-final through illness. His first touch sent the ball quick and high over the top of the Flamengo defence. It was no accident. Liverpool were clearly under instruction to exploit their opponents’ high defensive line at every opportunity and should have punished it twice inside the opening five minutes. Firmino, however, squandered a clear opportunity when sent clean through by Trent Alexander-Arnold and Naby Keïta did likewise when teed up by Mohamed Salah.When Alexander-Arnold flashed a low drive just wide of Diego Alves’s goal from over 25 yards seconds later it seemed only a question of time before Liverpool’s commanding opening paid idends. It was a false dawn. Flamengo always looked dangerous given the quality of Bruno Henrique, Éverton Ribeiro and the prolific marksman Gabriel Barbosa but were contained in the opening exchanges by the relentless pressing of Liverpool’s midfield three. Gradually, however, they began to turn the tide, with Gerson and Willian Arão increasingly influential in midfield. Klopp’s visible anger on the sidelines was not solely the result of al-Jassim’s erratic refereeing. The Liverpool manager’s sprint down the tunnel as soon as the half-time whistle blew was a clear sign of irritation with his team too.Liverpool’s frustration had mounted as the first half progressed. Salah copped an earful from his manager for squandering a glorious chance to punish Flamengo on the counterattack. They were refused a clear free-kick on the edge of the penalty area when Keïta played a one-two with Salah and was taken out by Filipe Luís and Mané, uncharacteristically quiet until late in the game, was booked after tangling with Rafinha.The second half opened with a flurry of chances and a repeat for Firmino. Collecting Henderson’s chip forward the striker flicked the ball over the head of Rodrigo Caio and steered a half-volley beyond Alves. It would have been a beautiful goal but Firmino’s shot struck the inside of a post and rolled across the goal to safety. Salah went close with an improvised touch on Alexander-Arnold’s driven cross into the area before Flamengo responded strongly. Alisson produced a superb save when Ribeiro created a first chance of the night for Barbosa. His powerful shot was destined for a bottom corner until Alisson’s strong right hand tipped the ball wide.Alisson thwarted Barbosa again when the Brazil forward executed a spectacular overhead kick but Liverpool finished stronger and, in extra time, Flamengo’s 79th game of 2019 caught up with them. The decisive moment was created by Henderson’s superb ball through the heart of the Brazilian defence to Mané. He squared for the unmarked Firmino, who cut back inside Caio and Alves before beating Rafinha’s despairing e on the line with a cool finish. The booking he received for removing his shirt in celebration was worth it. “Blessed” read the tattoo across the goalscorer’s chest. Liverpool know exactly how that feels."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e978c213022f2f23de7b9a27a05a8f241996e3f/7_3_4201_2520/master/4201.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9dc33e72a7b76862caa248593582bd8e","title":"martin peters all time great","story":"Martin Peters, who has died age 76, played in an era when everyone looked slim and elegant. He glided over muddy turf in crisp kit and heavy boots, a sodden ball never too far from his feet, as his football matched the uncomplicated rhythm of the day.In a playing career that stretched from 1959 to 1981, few were harder to pin down, on or off the field, than the softly spoken Cockney, known as The Ghost for the stealth and art of his contributions from midfield to the front line. He was, his England manager, Sir Alf Ramsey, once said, a player “10 years ahead of his time”.In other ways, Peters reflected perfectly the values and mores of post-war Britain. Born in Plaistow in London’s East End on 8 November 1943, the son of a Thames lighterman, Peters grew up in an era of respect and deference. As he ascended the famous 39 steps to the royal box at Wembley behind his friend and captain, Bobby Moore, to accept the Jules Rimet trophy for helping England win the 1966 World Cup, he wiped his hands on his shorts, so as not to muddy the Queen’s white gloves.Peters, a goalkeeper in schoolboy football, was scouted by the legendary Wally St Pier and joined West Ham as a 15-year-old apprentice in the summer of 1959. Seven years later, just eight weeks after making his England debut in a friendly against Yugoslavia, he was a World Cup winner. It was a gilded rise in an era when international caps did not come cheaply.Peters was well worth his place. A year earlier on the same ground, he was part of the West Ham team who beat 1860 Munich to win the European Cup Winners’ Cup, alongside Moore and Geoff Hurst.Hurst, who scored a hat-trick in the 4-2 win over West Germany, said on Saturday night: “Today is a very sad day for football and for me personally. Martin Peters was one of the all-time greats and a close friend and colleague of mine for in excess of 50 years, a fellow World Cup final goalscorer and my West Ham partner for years along with Bobby Moore. RIP old friend.”Peters scored in the 78th minute of the final and would have been remembered forever as having hit the winning goal but for Wolfgang Weber’s last-minute equaliser, which took the game into extra time – where Hurst famously finished the job.When Ramsey’s squad moved on from formal celebrations at the Royal Garden hotel in Kensington for more riotous afters in West End nightclubs, Peters and his wife, Kath, who had met as teenagers at a bowling alley in Dagenham, settled for a quiet cup of tea.Peters returned to the embrace of the Upton Park fans, scoring a hundred goals in 364 games before trading places across north London with Tottenham’s Jimmy Greaves in 1970 in a deal that made him the game’s first £200,000 player. It did not visibly affect his demeanour. Peters helped Spurs to the 1971 and 1973 League Cups and the Uefa Cup in 1972, his game memorable for his calm passing with either foot and commanding presence in the air.Peters was part of Ramsey’s team at the 1970 World Cup and scored to put England 2-0 up in the quarter-final against West Germany, but was substituted nine minutes from the end, with England leading 2-1. The Germans won 3-2 in extra time. Peters was inconsolable.He was awarded the England captaincy towards the end of his 67-cap career – in which he scored 20 goals – but could do nothing to help England qualify in 1974.After five years at Spurs, he had decent spells at Norwich, Sheffield United and non-league Gorleston. With the help of Hurst, Peters later worked with a car warranty firm, although he had to sell his World Cup memorabilia in 2001. Peters, who was awarded an MBE in 1978, shunned publicity and attention, but was always warmly acclaimed when he returned to White Hart Lane or Upton Park as a guest.In 2016, he was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. Mike Collett, who was the global football editor of Reuters at the time, remembers the 50th reunion of the World Cup winners that year with sadness. “I had met and interviewed Martin a number of times, especially during his years at Spurs,” Collett recalled on Saturday night. “He was always so insightful and charming with the media. But in 2016 it was heartbreaking. He was struggling to remember anything about the World Cup, and was being prompted with names of his teammates. In the end, as is the way with these things, the reporters cobbled something together, but he was clearly very ill. It was an extremely sad realisation for all of us.”Peters died peacefully in his sleep in the early hours of Saturday. He is survived by his wife, Kath, their children, Leeann and Grant, and granddaughters Hannah and Meg."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95f23503b759a327702a224e0a3ae871c079cda1/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b603043c673edf6367452e742394c286","title":"dave rapper marcus rashford music and football go hand in hand","story":"The Mercury prize-winning rapper and the Manchester United striker discuss hype music, family and fameIn a hard-to-find studio in north London, there is a small encounter between two big names. Dave arrives first. The south London rapper, 21, moved into the mainstream this year, winning the Mercury prize with his first album, Psychodrama, and making an explosive acting debut in Netflix’s Top Boy, as the thoroughly terrifying Modie. His sellout tour and Glastonbury show made news, too: remember the viral footage of the bucket-hatted kid who joined him on stage to rap on Thiago Silva (11m views)? Dave is cool and quiet, shaking everyone’s hand before taking himself off with his phone until Marcus Rashford appears.Rashford is a little late. Understandable, perhaps: it was Manchester United’s Christmas party last night, and he’s recently played vital, hard-fought games against Tottenham and City. But, despite being only 22, United and England’s young forward isn’t known for partying, and when he arrives he’s fresh and relaxed. Slighter than you might expect, and taller, he’s not flash, though his jeans have diamante sprinkled across the rips. He and Dave are months apart in age, but Rashford has a younger, less wary air. When he smiles, he looks like a kid.Dave is a huge United fan and Rashford likes his rap and grime, but at first both stick to their small entourages, check their clothes, worry about the photos. There is discussion of trainers: both have brought a brand new pair to wear. Dave’s are orange Air Max Rashford’s classic white Air Force 1s. They are both naturally shy, you realise, and deliberately low-key in the manner of those for whom fame is a side product of their job. Why attract attention when you get so much in everyday life?Rashford is coming up to the toughest part of his season. “December is hard,” he says, calmly. “We’ve got two matches this week.” Dave is not in work mode. Supposedly he went straight into the studio after winning his Mercury prize, but at the moment he’s happy to be out and about. And very happy to talk football. “It’s what I do my entire life when I’m not doing music,” he says. “If I’m in a hotel room in Sweden, or on a plane to Vancouver, I’m watching football. I’ll try to talk about other stuff, too, but football is a lifestyle.”Marcus Rashford What year were you born – 97?Dave 98. What were the big tunes at school that you can remember?MR Everyone was into Drake, Tinchy Stryder, Kano.D But Kano felt like he was more primary school than secondary school. I feel like 13 and 14 was Krept and Konan, Yungen and Cashtastic… I remember the dances, too. Do you dance?MR Nah, I don’t dance. When I was younger, I was either playing football, or when I was listening to music I was always on my bike. On my earphones.D I don’t dance, either. I remember people jerking and doing the Dougie – that was some American dance, the Dougie. Moving like you have a migraine. Your hands up here by your head. That was a real thing at school.MR There were a lot of underground artists I listened to. One of my brothers has a friend called Meena and if he was at my house seeing my brother, I was playing Fifa and they’d just rap all day. So I was around music.When did you start rapping?D When I was 14. It didn’t go well. I remember putting out a video and it got 41 views in the first day. And I’m going into class, and I’m thinking, “Rah, this is mad, I’m fucked, I only got 41 views.” But the positive of it was, “All right, I only got 41 views, so no one’s seen it.” Unfortunately, 30 of the 41 views must’ve been my classmates. So I could not live it down.There was a sort of chain in school. I wasn’t, like, mad at the top, but I wasn’t right at the bottom, either. I was a laughing stock. Walking past girls, they’re whispering, they’re laughing. You’re thinking, “Nah, I want to disappear, I never want to feel like this again.” I remember thinking, “Yeah, I’m retiring.”D Kaylum filmed it and I remember the video cost £40. That was everything I had. At 14, to amass £40! I was getting £2 a day for dinner money. The pasta in school was £1.60. I used to spend 50p to buy Skittles every morning, because I never had breakfast. So I’d always be 10p short for the pasta. Anyway, I remember thinking, “All right, cool, I’m going to miss dinners, put everything into this video”, and then that happened. So I retired.MR I’ve never picked up a mic – football was the focus. But the link between music and football is interesting for me, the two go hand in hand. We’d never play football without one of my friends bringing a speaker. Your upbringing definitely affects what music you like. A lot of people I know can relate to musicians because when they were younger they had nothing, same as me.D Music and football are two industries where black people excel, because talent is undeniable. You can’t deny an amazing voice. You can’t deny amazing athletic prowess. Physically, it’s evident. But in other industries, circumstance is more of a thing. Where you grew up, where you studied, the opportunities you got, where you’ve done work experience. When you’re talking about sport and entertainment at the highest level, you’re talking about an industry that grosses billions every year on a very select few people’s talent.MR For me, football brings people together. Where I grew up, I know the whole community from playing football in the park. I have the same friends from when I was six, seven years old. If some of my friends weren’t at the park, then they would have probably been getting into trouble. Football definitely helps communities, and you want to spread that message. Because I think sometimes people get caught up in, “Oh, he’s made it, he didn’t make it.” I don’t like to discuss that.D How do you feel when you walk on to the pitch?D Can you hear everything and everyone around you, or is it on mute?MR At first, when I played, it was mad. I remember looking at a section of the crowd and I must have seen about 10 or 15 people I knew. That’s when it hit me, in the first game, and I was like, “Wow, this is a bit weird – he lives there, he lives there, my mum lives five minutes away from him.” These things are going through my head. I needed to block it out and just focus on the game, and that’s what I did. And in that first game, honestly, I didn’t feel any fatigue, I was just running about on the pitch. When you lose yourself in the game, you always play your best football. You can hear the noise, you can feel the energy, but... Something’s there, but it’s not there. That’s the best way to approach it.D Is it different at home games?MR At home, if it’s positive energy, it drives you through your games. Your legs might not be there, but those games can be your best games, and it’s just because of the fans. If you played with no fans, there’s no way you’d be able to play 55, 60 games in a season. It’s not possible.D When I’m performing, the crowd just disappears, it’s like everyone merges – one big person. You just say the words and people will say the words back to you. And it’s just so rehearsed. I have a lot of songs I couldn’t forget the words if I tried. So you get in there, you lose yourself and it’s all good.MR So you don’t feel pressure?D Where I feel pressure in performance is when I’m being filmed and I’ve got to play and rap – I know if I drop a chord, I’ve dropped a song. If I’m playing a song on piano, if I miss a note I have to go back, because certain scales only make sense when you have the note before. So I have to bring the lyrics back. So everyone knows, yeah, he’s messed up.I did NPR’s Tiny Desk, this performance in America to a few people, and it’s the most nervous I’ve felt, because I can see the people who are judging me. When things are up close and personal, then you start to feel the pressure.MR No teammates to help.D Yeah. But I wouldn’t have it any other way. Because I know, if it’s a great show, it’s on me.How are you with your social media?MR There’s too much negativity. For me, you should only use your social channels to better the things around you. The rest of the time, I don’t look at it. If you go on Twitter, you’re going to see something bad, something good. You just don’t really need it.D I have to use it, because everything that I do is through social media. If I upload a video, I have to tell you: this video is up. I’m performing on stage here, blah blah blah. Certain times I’ll come off.I remember there was a period where I woke up and I saw something negative about myself on my social media every day for 91 days. And it doesn’t have to be mad negative – the smallest thing can ever so slightly change your day. But once you start to believe in yourself, you can start to tune everything out. Things affect you less. I’m sure it’s the same with footballers. I just know that, in the industry I’m in, I’m a trier. There’s people in the world that try, and there’s the people in the world that talk about the people that try.D Yeah, fast. For me, I think it was after Drake remixed my track Wanna Know. Though people still don’t know my face. You can’t watch football without seeing someone, but you can listen to music without seeing someone. I think Top Boy really changed that. When I was on tour in America, people would say, “Oh, you’re that actor!” Those two moments I felt a massive change.It’s funny, though, what you said about daily activities, how long they can become. Those are things I would still try to do. My manager’s always saying to me, “Why are you in Selfridges all the time?” I don’t even like shopping. But it’s the transaction of getting out of my car, walking and seeing people I don’t know. I think it’s important, even if it does take a long time, and even if you do have to smile and take a picture in this weird, awkward place, it’s important.I try to be outside often. When there were hard times and things were dark, when there were a lot of people I’d fallen out with, I was out every day, feeling the love, and sometimes the hate. When I walk around in LA, I’m less than nothing, and that is an invaluable feeling. It reminds you of the scale of what it is you’re trying to do.MR Manchester’s very, very small. I have quite a big family. I have two brothers, two sisters. So more often than not, somebody I’m speaking to knows my mum, or my nana, or my brother, or my brother’s friend, so everyone’s connected. Everyone’s family. But it’s the only place I can feel normal. If I didn’t go back to where I grew up and do normal stuff, see the same guy that used to serve me sweets when I was a kid, go and see my friend’s mum and dad, if I didn’t do those things, I’d be sat in my house.MR I think there’s a difference. It’s difficult, but you have to find what it is you’re talented at. I like to play basketball and stuff like that, but I’m not talented – it’s just a hobby. Do your hobby, enjoy it – but put your hard work and time into your talent.D I agree. I’ve played football my entire life, and I’m not a bad player, but it’s not moving me and my mum out of Streatham in this lifetime. But there was a point where Juss, who’s always with me and raps, and a few friends turned around and said: rap is something you’re good at. My friends helped me find that. But you gotta work mad hard at it.I remember being in college and girls would say: “Oh, he’s cool, but he doesn’t make the music that I would listen to, you wouldn’t hear him in a club.” It’s not my strongest point, singing or melody or rapping upbeat, uptempo, I’m not some crazy, hype, off-the-wall, flashy type of guy. But I learned quickly that collaboration and putting yourself out of your comfort zone, that’s the stuff that takes you further. Like going on Headie One’s track, or J Hus. You have to really push yourself. D I rate you so highly, not just in terms of football, but because I can see you take it seriously. I can look to you and say, “Wow, this is someone who’s got an opportunity and he’s running with it. He’s not coasting, he’s really going hard.” I love footballers – I see them out at a show or on holiday. But Marcus, I don’t see you anywhere. And that’s in itself a way of life.MR Well, as a player, you have to take yourself out of the emotion. It’s natural, if you’re a fan: if the team wins, they must have done well if they lose, they’ve done something wrong. But once you get caught up in that, as a player, you’re finished. It’s too up-and-down. You have to have a middle. If you win, it doesn’t mean you go crazy until the next game. If you lose, it doesn’t mean you sit moping. You have to find a balance, and you always go back to what you know.D So you don’t go mad when you lose?D Yeah, I’m going to vote.D When I look at politics, I think that everything is all just words. People say, “Oh, the problem that you have in your life is because of this person, so we’re going to take this person away, and your problem’s going to go.” It’s about ision, coming up to an election. And I think, as a person, what type of person could I sit in a room with? Ninety-nine per cent of politicians I probably couldn’t sit in a room with. If I feel like there’s someone I can relate to, then that’s the person I’m going to side with. Over the last three years, I feel like evil had a chance for the first time, overtly, not just in this country, but worldwide. People voted for some really dark, crazy stuff. So this might just be the world we live in. All you can do is try to make the world a better place.This might sound random, but seeing Cristiano Ronaldo when I was young, that did a lot for me. I used to watch Ronaldo videos every night before I went to sleep. Skills, compilations, shots, left-foot goals, all of this stuff. My life for a long time, even though it was nothing to do with football, was based around him. You can have that much impact, on someone who doesn’t even play sports.MR I’m sort of the same but with music: I need people to give me messages. There’s only certain people I can listen to leading up to games. I can’t listen to hype music because if I go on to the pitch pumped up with raw emotion, I’m going to get a red card. I listen to the same group of people. You, Stormzy. People who are spreading messages with the words.On the speaker, in the changing room, before a game, it’s pure hype music playing. I just sit down with my headphones. I need to be clear-minded on the pitch, because as a forward player you might not see the ball the whole game, just that one time. And the game could be 0-0. Now imagine it’s the Champions League final or the World Cup final…D Is it more pressure being a striker than a midfielder?MR You need a different mentality. I made my debut at 18. The beginning of that season was my first year as a striker, ever in my life. Before that I couldn’t understand how somebody can enjoy a game of football without touching a ball. Where you could have one chance and that’s it. I’ve always been a person who needs the ball – I need to express myself and make things happen.Then all of a sudden, a coach I liked changed my mindset. Then six months later, I made my debut with the first team. The bit I needed to work on was switching the mindset. That’s what I’ve improved on a lot, but I’m still so far off where I can be. Everyone can say I scored a few goals and I’m in good form – but it’s nothing to what I can achieve.D This new generation of footballers, I don’t think it’s ever been this expressive. The kids – I saw flair in everyone. So much competition, so much talent, and they’re all from similar age groups. This is an amazing time to be an English footballer.MR The first time I was ever nervous was England under-16s against Ireland away. I was taking kick-off and my knee was shaking, and this had never happened before. I didn’t play as well as I could have. Since then, the word pressure has changed for me. I see it as an opportunity. At the end of the day, if you take a penalty, the keeper can save it. I could have a perfect penalty, and the keeper could just save it: it’s out of my control. In football you can’t always control the outcome or results – it’s a team sport, and anything can happen at any moment. Why this generation is good is because that’s what everyone’s mindset is like. There are so many young players nobody knows right now, ready to come on to the scene. I’m trying to get them to understand how talented they are. Then if you work hard at it, don’t put a limit on how good you can become. Because England can definitely win something. We already know that, on our day, we can beat any team in the world – but we want to get to the level of what Germany was in 2014, and Spain for many years - that consistency. If we don’t win something with England, at the end of my career, I’d feel like something went wrong somewhere.• If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine’s letters page, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ebaf50a984ecff7dd269e059f36b5742a6d15ee/456_211_2104_1262/master/2104.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55157a150af222cd85d17063a0e10c67","title":"genevieve fox our first christmas empty nest syndrome","story":"The kids have left home, and we’re not really coping, so this seems like the perfect chance to lure them backMy husband and I don’t think we have the condition until, one day last month, hundreds of miles from home, we find ourselves outside our younger son’s university accommodation at 11.30 on a Sunday morning. I am clutching supplies in a little brown paper bag. Our son knows we’re in town, but isn’t expecting this rude awakening. It’s a surprise.“Do you think we should have called first?” I say as we approach the entrance, the inappropriateness of what we’re doing dawning on me only now.My husband pulls a face it’s his moment of awakening, too. “Call now,” he says. “Tell him we’re on our way.”We both suddenly see what we have become: two newbie empty-nester weirdos. For anyone to pitch up at an 18-year-old’s gaff on a Sunday morning is never a good idea. For the parents to do so is intrusive and insensitive. I call anyway. We’ve rustled up two blueberry muffins and an apple from the hotel breakfast buffet and picked up some fresh orange juice. Plus, we’ve spent 20 minutes walking here. And he needs to know we care.At first he does not pick up. When he does, he says in a sleep-strangled drawl: “Maybe could you just go away and come back later.”Fair enough, even quite polite, in the circumstances. But I say: “Well, actually, we’re already outside. Maybe you could just nip to the door and then go back to bed?” Cue a heartfelt groan. A few minutes later a hand appears through the opened door. The bag disappears.So, it’s official then. We have Empty Nest Syndrome (ENS). Since our second son left for university in September we have joined “the left behind”, to coin a spooky-sounding term from a 2018 study of this non-clinical condition, conducted in China. It sounds like a six-part TV drama: One empty nest and two parents who will stop at nothing to clip their children’s wings.Episode one starts this Christmas with me pimping the nest within an inch of its life so that the boys weep at the downy, desirable thing called home and never want to leave again. That was the plan until, earlier this month, two different friends poisoned my ear within 24 hours of each other, casually remarking that this might be the last time my sons came home for Crimbo. Sorry, what? They might choose to have it elsewhere in the future, one said breezily, or with friends or squeezes, said the other.I am fully aware that children leave home, with some boomeranging back when it suits. I also know that parenting is a process of letting go, and not just of a disposable income. Migration is natural. But the idea that a cuckoo might entice my sons away with a more attractive festive roost makes me defensive, primally so. Plus, it ramps up the pressure to put on the best Christmas ever, and I already do a good one. But piling on the bling is a no-no, the end-of-childhood bell having already been sounded by my sons banning Poundshop junk, plastic and “humorous” gifts, such as wind-up Trump figurines, tabletop golf and novelty socks. This year, stockings must contain sustainable, sophisticated objets. Quality over quantity is the watchword. All very grown-up – and there’s the rub. I appear to have joined what other ENS studies refer to as “midlife parents”, “empty nest older adults”, and “the elderly whose children have left the old adults alone at home”. The elderly. The old adults. No wonder I feel washed up. Time has been called on the chief focus of my existence for the past 20 years.It is predicted that by 2030 there will be more than 200m empty-nesters in China, a country that takes ENS very seriously, partly because the one-child policy implemented in 1980 (and terminated in 2015) means that for a vast swathe of empty-nesters there isn’t even the salve of a nest half-full, a period of transition in which the children leave one by one, supposedly softening the blow. I’ve had this, thanks to a two-year age gap between my sons. It hasn’t made their launch any easier, possibly because I thought I would be glad when my second son “migrated”. I looked forward to more time for myself. But I hadn’t factored in the other bird in my nest: the husband.Forget all that indulgent “me time”, the empty nest, chirp the experts, is a chance to “reconnect” and “rekindle” your relationship. Ours is very satisfactory as it is, thank you very much. But no, we must plan adventures together, say husband-and-wife marital wisdom podcasters Ashley and Marcus Kusi, authors of Our Bucket List Adventures: a Journal for Couples. Hmmm. Bucket lists, with their implications of the Grim Reaper metering your time, are not for me. There is no way I am going to invite my husband to celebrate our mortality à deux.“Repurpose yourself” is another common recommendation, which makes me feel like upcycled furniture. Kim Smith, an American counsellor and author of Embracing Next: an Empty Nest Enjoyment Guide, says it’s time to focus on the future. She’s keen on the “re” prefix, too. “Reframe, refocus and refeather” is her mantra for “maximising your enjoyment of the next chapter of life”.US holistic psychotherapist Dina Molina, author of Empty Nest, Sexy House, talks of the “sexy power” that is ours for the taking. Go out, she says, have fun with friends, renovate your home. Erin Marshall, a US interior designer, actually specialises in EN renovations. Avoid turning your house into a shrine by filling every wall with photographs of your kids curate them on a single wall instead, she advises. After all, she implies, you don’t want to look desperate.But maybe we are. A friend tells of how he recently traipsed across his son’s town one sodden morning carrying bags of groceries for him. “I felt like a bird taking worms to the nest,” he tells me. Doing so sated his need to nurture, feed and provide, a need that he said can feel like a craving. Another parent has arranged an overnight business trip to her child’s university 300 miles away so that she can fill her daughter’s fridge, as she puts it, the night before her exams.I wish she’d fill my fridge. Since our sons have left, it’s empty. It used to be bursting with food – meat for the carnivore, fish for the pescatarian, beers in case mates came over, a freezer full of pizzas for late-night munchies. I find it ghoulishly fascinating that, having nurtured our two sons for two decades, I now seem unable to feed, let alone nurture, myself or my husband. I have to force myself to buy groceries and remind myself it’s not fair to leave the husband to do all the cooking. On the upside, it is very nice to be waited on.At least we don’t cry during meals. An artist friend told me that when the eldest of her three children left home, she and her husband sat at the supper table with tears streaming down their faces, for weeks. So did the younger daughter, aged 16, and their son, 11. “My daughter missed her big sister,” says the mother, “and said she had lost her best friend. We were desolate.” The mother went into therapy for six months.Grief is one of a litany of symptoms that includes sadness, loneliness, anxiety, restlessness, guilt, bodily aches and pains, anger, irritability and frustration. A dip in self-esteem is another which, compounded by a loss of social connections and a change in identity, is likened to the feelings experienced by the unemployed. For my part, I find myself questioning what, if anything, I can still offer my children, beyond love, a roof and a nice line in banana muffins worse, I catch myself wanting my currency as a mother affirmed, which feels weird and needy. As ever, parenting is not about me, alas, or at least is not supposed to be.If only we didn’t live as long as we now do, or involve ourselves in our children’s lives as much as we do. Back in 1900, short life s and children living at home meant the empty nest only lasted two years. In the 1970s, when sociologists first popularised the term empty nest, it was 13 years. Today, with male and female life expectancy now at 79 and 83 respectively and the average age at which adult children fly the nest for good being 26, we’re talking decades – and that, I realise, still gives me plenty of Christmases to gild the nest.Milkshakes and Morphine: a Memoir of Love and Life by Genevieve Fox is published by Vintage at £8.99.

I love the period architecture there and I had visited the Eames House, too. So when I saw this place I fell in love with it.”Built and once occupied by British architect Martin Crowley in 1979, the single-storey compact house with a flat roof is a classic piece of infill architecture. It’s set on a back street where it is virtually invisible, tucked away between a row of garages. The black-painted front facade is largely blank, save for a bright orange door through which you access a cobbled courtyard. Here, Douglas Deeds white fibreglass pots are dotted around underneath a black I-beam frame that extends out from the steel, glass and brick structure of the house. A bamboo garden helps to screen the towering Georgian terraces behind.“It’s so private here, no one really knows the house exists,” says MacLean, who now shares the live-work space with his wife Jenny Rose – with whom he opened the design agency Studio MacLean in 2013 – and their six-year-old son, Stanley.Inside, the layout is built to a modular plan with three bedrooms (one of which has been converted into a studio), an original bathroom that the couple plan to redesign next year, and a fluid open-plan kitchen, living and dining space whose sliding doors give on to the peaceful entrance courtyard.Full-height glass windows bring in light to the exposed concrete walls of the space and everything has been kept structurally as it was originally intended, with a new roof added only for extra insulation. “There were two former owners before us who were also sympathetic to Crowley’s vision,” says MacLean. “So everything is exactly as it was when it was finished.” A minimal update to the tired-looking interior a few years ago included reinstating terracotta Welsh quarry tiles to replace laminate flooring across the house, and this year the couple have embarked on a complete makeover. “Everything inside our home now is bespoke: we made it ourselves or with collaborators,” says MacLean.In keeping with the architectural origins, the design-savvy duo have retained original interior leftovers including wooden doors, radiators and steel light fittings by Charlotte Perriand. Modular shelving by Dieter Rams, now full of design and fashion books, lines almost the entire white-painted concrete wall in the living area.There are bursts of colour everywhere, used as focal points or room iders, such as the vibrant yellow walls of the showstopper kitchen that match the bespoke cabinetry with an optical graphic print called Sun Loving Bollards by designer Eley Kishimoto.“The house lends itself to colour,” says MacLean. “The rest of the white and grey palettes in the place are muted, so we designed this kitchen with Eley to make a statement and show off our collaborative work.” The kitchen space also includes three unobtrusive Joe Colombo Fresnel wall lights above the hob and the innovative Zip HydroTap Celsius All-In-One, which dispenses instant boiling, cold and sparkling water.In the master bedroom, a funky space-age-like shower pod with a bright orange door, is a new addition made in-house by Studio MacLean, along with the double bed and wardrobe. The shower walls are lined with an electric mix of mosaic tiles in orange, black, white and yellow, the design of which is inspired by Berlin’s U-Bahn station, Konstanzer Strasse. “We’ve always loved the colour of the walls in that station and we wanted to recreate it here,” says MacLean.A bespoke teal-green wall cupboard next to a bed fitted into a snug alcove in their son’s room features shelves with unusual yellow storage baskets. “They’re actually old snail crates we picked up in France,” laughs MacLean.Just as the Eames house was full of colour and collected objects, there is an assortment of mementos the couple have acquired over the years in various rooms, from sculptural ceramics, old architectural models and unusual antique metal shoe kit boxes, to a French industrial clock by Brille and three original posters by graphic artist Hans Schleger that MacLean’s father helped design. “My dad was involved in the fishmonger industry in the late 50s to the 80s, and worked with Schleger to design the posters for a company called MacFisheries. They look great here.”There is also a covetable mix of furniture design classics, ranging from German Flötotto Profilsystem storage containers and an Alvar Aalto 41 Paimio chair in the living area, to a George Nelson roll-top desk and midcentury string chair by Allan Gould in the study.“We’ve randomly collected things over the years, but we don’t have a passion for one thing or look at pieces to specifically suit the house,” says MacLean. “We have a home in France, too, so we love going to vide-greniers, and we’ll often swap things between the houses.”Now their interior mission is almost complete, the family are enjoying their home and despite having planning permission for a second storey, the couple have decided against it. “We don’t want to ruin the feel of the house, so we’ve just focused on creating our dream space instead. It’s most definitely a forever home.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/666d31e5c0f2b3c47a25d8c4ae4cb108ed84e9f2/0_498_6248_3748/master/6248.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2210208d5b9624ee1e4fa9122812e334","title":"bbc could restrict journalists twitter","story":"Executive said to be considering move after rows during election campaignThe BBC is considering restricting its journalists’ use of Twitter. If the plan is approved, top correspondents will be told to move away from using online platforms to break stories or offer instant analysis.The proposal follows criticism of online comments made by staff during the election campaign. Political editor Laura Kuenssberg was attacked by some Jeremy Corbyn supporters for repeating, along with other pundits, a false allegation that a Tory minister’s aide had been punched by a Labour activist. North America editor Jon Sopel has meanwhile been accused of tweets that reveal a critical stance on Donald Trump.Now Fran Unsworth, the director of news and current affairs, is believed to be keen to persuade journalists to end the practice of frequently posting on politics and current affairs.“She said that it was likely she would meet some resistance, but that she wants to start a debate and was now contemplating asking correspondents to come off Twitter,” said a BBC journalist. Unsworth is thought to have outlined her plans at a party held in the BBC Council Chamber in old Broadcasting House.Last week, Channel 4 reportedly banned non-political staff from tweeting about current affairs.Phil Harding, the BBC’s former controller of editorial policy, welcomed the possibility of a review of Twitter’s place in BBC news coverage. “They need to take two steps back and make sure what they are saying is impartial and true, because we need that impartial service badly at the moment,” he told the Observer.Harding, who also edited the Radio 4 Today programme during his years at the BBC, added that a review of coverage priorities was standard after any election. “The most important thing is that they hang on to the trust, which has fallen away a little. They have to consider whether they need to be in among the first reactors to an event. It is a difficult conversation, but they have to get the balance right,” Harding said.Kuenssberg signed off from Twitter for Christmas on Thursday with apparent relish, writing “see you on the other side (follow @BBCPolitics and @BBCNews if you want to keep up, or sit on your sofa and eat Quality Street and come back in 2020)”.The journalist, who has 1.13 million Twitter followers, has been subjected to a torrent of online abuse over the past month. Her festive good wishes were met by several suggestions her own break should be haunted by the ghosts of the Labour election victory that might have been.Last Monday, Andy McDonald, a member of the shadow cabinet, claimed the BBC had played a part in Labour’s defeat.Similar attacks on BBC impartiality led Huw Edwards, the election night anchor, to write an unprecedented defence of the standards of licence-fee-funded reporting: “Providing a fair and balanced account of a complex election campaign – with feelings running high on all sides – is difficult enough. Trying to do so while dealing with relentlessly vitriolic attacks is doubly challenging.” Edwards warned that “toxic cynicism” about BBC output could undermine the broadcaster as it faces renewed threats from a strengthened Conservative government. Downing Street has promised to consider decriminalising the non-payment of the TV licence fee, making it equivalent to failure to pay any other utility bill, rather than a criminal offence.Edwards also tweeted: “We are very far from being perfect at @BBCNews – but the bilge about ‘bias’ needs a response.” Channel 4’s decision follows mistakes, including an online subtitling error on tweeted video footage that wrongly suggested that Johnson had questioned whether “people of colour”, rather than “people of talent”, should be allowed into the country under Conservative immigration policy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d209081dc8b8757d4fdf8ddaf617fc3b7955c48a/0_0_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87adadc58f5a5a4f4071195bf034f526","title":"twitter toxic institution bbc calibre doesnt need it","story":"There was an irony to Huw Edwards’s defence of the BBC last week. You could argue the very act of him speaking out, feistily claiming the BBC wasn’t biased, proved quite the opposite. Corporation rules on bias expressly forbid its journalists from expressing opinions on controversial political matters. Yet here was the BBC’s leading news presenter doing just that. And yes, I am being pedantic.As it happens, I agreed with Edwards. It’s often said but true: if both main parties claim the BBC is biased – and they do – well, then, it must be impartial. There may be subconscious tonal bias – Evan Davis’s noticeably more aggressive Newsnight interviews with Leavers during the referendum campaign were arguably an example – but having worked there for more than four decades, I know that Corporation journalists would never knowingly favour one argument or party. Edwards’s belligerent tone, however (critics display “a wholly laughable cluelessness,” he said) wouldn’t have won the BBC friends in high places. And with the danger increasing – witness government threats to decriminalise non-payment of the licence fee – friends in high places is just what it needs.I’ve been thinking a lot about the BBC’s future while rewriting my play The Last Temptation of Boris Johnson for its national tour. In its first incarnation, when Theresa May was still PM, it took a punt, predicting (a) that we would leave the EU in 2020 and (b) that Johnson would succeed May, but also (c) that by 2030 the BBC will have been taken over by Amazon. OK, that last one won’t happen. But what might, in the light of the BBC’s output during the election, is another crisis to rival the Gilligan-WMD affair, triggered by the BBC’s wholehearted embrace of Twitter. Because if there’s one thing the BBC should fear more than accusations of bias, it’s getting it wrong. And Twitter, with its rush-to-judgment culture, is, as we know, not far from Planet Wrong.Every tweet is a hostage to fortune. A false one, like Laura Kuenssberg’s assertion that a Labour activist had punched an adviser to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, is akin to the BBC handing its assassins a bullet. It was Twitter culture, if not a tweet, behind the same (otherwise excellent) journalist’s observation on air before polling day that things were “looking grim” for Labour – a claim which, it is alleged, broke the law and led to complaints to the police. (The BBC is adamant the comments did not breach electoral law.)A 247 news culture means that the odd mistake is inevitable, of course. But constant tweeting magnifies the odds of editorial disaster considerably. If the BBC doesn’t get its journalists off Twitter, or at least radically overhaul its social media policy, errors will be made again. Why risk it? Where’s the kudos in being first with nuggets of unimportant news? BBC credibility depends on being right, not first. It should wait, then come down from on high like Moses with the tablets, rather than mixing it with the journalistic ferrets.BBC senior management is well aware of these dangers. However, they’re worried a social media retreat would look weak and regressive, and be unpopular with the young. But that’s false thinking. Stepping back from it would make BBC journalism stronger in the long term and improve its image.

Wrapped in a black PVC mini-dress and sporting a bobbed wig on the cover of her last album, I’m Not Bossy, I’m The Boss (a long-ago 2014), the Irish singer was still identifiable as the shaven-headed young woman from the all-conquering Nothing Compares 2 U video, and as the pop star who tore up a picture of the pope on live US television in 1992.A few days after her 53rd birthday, taking the stage on the only mainland UK date of her current tour, O’Connor is barefoot, clad in a black abaya with a subtle geometric check, and wearing a hijab – still unmistakable, despite a change in religion, two changes of name, some assertions of non-binary sexuality and a three-and-a-half-year process of regaining good mental health. Just as the Cassandra of Greek myth was doomed to tell the truth and not be believed, O’Connor’s 1992 declarations about abuse in the Catholic church are now a very public scandal.She is undergoing an act of renewal. Last year, she released a demo of new music under the name Magda Arjuna Davitt, expressing a desire to rid herself of her “patriarchal slave name” and “parental curses”. Now she goes by the name Shuhada Sadaqat (Shuhada is an Arabic girl’s name sadaqat refers to a voluntary sign of faith).Even more striking than her shape-shifting constancy, perhaps, is the unwavering quality of her voice, which remains imbued with moral authority and the kind of tell-tale timbre that requires nanoseconds to recognise.When O’Connor – she continues to use this name for work – opens her mouth tonight to sing Queen of Denmark, a John Grant song that she has made her own, her voice still goes from nought-to-righteous ire in one breath. “Why don’t you take it out on somebody else?” she hollers, to wild hoots of approval.Throughout this often mesmerising gig, O’Connor is a picture of restraint – under-singing not because she has to, but because she is a master stylist. She still hits plenty of high notes, but she does it when it suits her. Also wonderfully unchanged is the way O’Connor emphatically yanks her chin to one side on a crescendo, as though the full blare of her voice might overpower the microphone.Most of O’Connor’s compositions are love songs, but her political songs are now, once again, very relevant. Last summer, the US guitarist Sharon Van Etten revived one of O’Connor’s old tunes, Black Boys on Mopeds. O’Connor’s version goes down very well tonight. “These are dangerous days,” it goes (it’s set in the Thatcher era), and there are howls from the crowd, many of whom remember the last stretch of Tory hegemony first-hand.Perhaps most germane to the present moment is O’Connor’s very open, public and ongoing conversation about her physical and mental health. In 2017, she told a US television talk show that a hysterectomy in 2015 plunged her into full menopause, and O’Connor cites the lack of hormone replacement therapy post-op as contributing to a suicide attempt.That same year, the singer posted a distressed – and distressing – video from a New Jersey motel room. In the months that followed, she received in-patient therapy. She told the Irish broadcaster Dave Fanning last June that “if I hadn’t been in hospital for three and a half years… I wouldn’t be alive to sit here talking”. She described therapeutic work undertaken on the trauma she sustained in childhood (her mother was a violent alcoholic who died when O’Connor was 18) and the difficulty doctors had in arriving at her precise diagnosis.Although every song O’Connor serves up tonight emphatically has something to say, there are times when you do question the medium in which they are delivered. It is high time O’Connor made a record that didn’t have the foursquare thump of pop-rock at its heart – her voice and her writing deserve something braver, more beautiful.Backing her on this tour is a perfectly fine band of players – beanpole electric guitarist Phil Edgar and sweet-voiced acoustic guitarist Jackie Rainey combine to sing harmonies with O’Connor on In This Heart – but the plodding metre feels dated, especially given the endless artistic possibilities of O’Connor’s transcendental voice.Harbour, from 2014, shows what she can do with a faintly jazzy blues. When she performs a cappella, however, time stands still. I Am Stretched on Your Grave is a traditional song O’Connor recorded for I Do Not Want What I Haven’t Got (1990). Tonight’s version raises the hairs on your gooseflesh, with O’Connor’s spectral voice soaring, and her intonation suggesting everything from traditional Celtic music to Arabic devotionals.In 2015, O’Connor retired Nothing Compares 2 U from her live repertoire, saying she didn’t emotionally relate to the song any more. It’s back, with new melismas and missing absolutely none of its heartbroken power. Even more shivery, however, is the moment in the encore, when O’Connor starts her newest song, Milestones, without accompaniment and with the microphone switched off. Gradually, her voice rises and the amplification is turned back on. “Evil is not my true nature,” she sings. For a few pregnant seconds, this busy venue is in rapt silence."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45c6bed173206f779ed3e659b1c5f439e658e319/0_248_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ea42335f611e5aa9b29dc0858a805af","title":"inside the mind of scientist james lovelock","story":"James Lovelock, who turned 100 this year, discusses his life’s work, including his latest theory that AI might be the key to saving the planet.

Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner, touted as a possible leadership contender, is more likely to stand instead for the role of deputy leader.Long Bailey has yet to make any contribution to the debate over the party’s future direction since the election, amid signs that the Corbyn wing of the party is at odds over whether to promote her as a “continuity” candidate who will take forward the radical economic ideas championed by Corbyn and John McDonnell, or as a more independent-minded figure who wants to move on from Corbynism.On Saturday night a senior source close to McDonnell, who has long promoted Long Bailey as his protege, said the shadow chancellor had made a “conscious decision” not to play any role in the leadership contest. Supporters of other candidates believe the Long Bailey camp is struggling to unite amid the bitter fallout following the election result.On Sunday, also writing in the Observer, Labour’s former deputy leader Roy Hattersley makes the startling suggestion that if Long Bailey is chosen then moderate Labour MPs should refuse to accept her. “Despite the obvious truth that Jeremy Corbyn must take the blame for the worst result in almost 100 years, Rebecca Long Bailey, his anointed successor, is the favourite to succeed him as party leader,” Hattersley says.If she were to win, he says, “genuine democratic socialists in the parliamentary party” should strike back. “The elevation of Long Bailey would provide an early opportunity to demonstrate that they mean business. The cause would be best served by an outright refusal to accept the imposition of a leader who does not command their confidence. A formal protest with a recorded vote would be almost as effective. Emboldened, they must then insist that the shadow cabinet is, once again, elected – giving its members an independent authority which they would not possess as leader’s nominees.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb42ca7c80c84b1c656c117c59921104f758cf64/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5941612841b421f31694e084b72f82a6","title":"labour after the debacle what comes next","story":"Three Labour stalwarts discuss how the party can regain the confidence of votersThe first election I paid attention to was in 1983. In the wake of the Brixton riots, Michael Foot’s commitment to tackling racial discrimination and disadvantage awakened my political consciousness. The manifesto was Labour’s most radical of the century, offering increased spending for the NHS, comprehensive care for under-fives and an emergency programme for investment in housing and transport. To a boy growing up poor in Tottenham, it seemed the exact tonic our sickly country needed.After learning the result – wipeout for Labour and a majority of 144 for Margaret Thatcher’s Conservatives – I was distraught. I could not believe that, offered a hopeful vision for a fairer UK, the public had opted for more economic conservatism. In the early hours of Friday 13 December, as the Tories secured their biggest win since the Thatcher era, I recognised the same disappointment and disbelief in many of those around me.The Jeremy Corbyn I have known for decades as the MP for my neighbouring constituency is kind, compassionate and thoroughly decent. I regard him as a friend, with a wonderful track record as a constituency MP. To put it politely, these were not the qualities that came up on doorsteps as I campaigned in London, Halifax, Bury, Bolton, Cardiff, Birmingham, Watford and elsewhere.The leadership’s failure to deal with the stain of antisemitism within the party stripped Labour of moral authority. Jeremy’s triangulation on Brexit left Leavers thinking he was a Remainer and convinced Remainers he supported Leave. His well-reported hostility to institutions such as Nato cemented the public’s distrust. It was not Jeremy’s righteous belief in economic justice that lost Labour this election it was his perceived worldview, failure of competence, and mind-boggling decision to abdicate leadership on the biggest issue of the day.For Labour to win back what were once seen as our heartlands, we need to unite the country around a vision for the UK we can all take pride in. This does not mean imitating Boris Johnson’s populist, ethnic nationalism. Many people voted Tory because of a legitimate commitment to leaving the EU, or because they did not like Corbyn or what Labour was offering. But Johnson cynically scapegoated migrants during the campaign, warning that Europeans had treated the UK like “their own” country for too long. This is not the first time Johnson has attacked a minority in an attempt to win popularity. In 2018, he compared Muslim women to bankrobbers and letterboxes, which led to a surge in hate crimes. By lurching to the right, Johnson was able to make a Faustian pact and convince Nigel Farage to stand down. This helped him win, but set a very dangerous precedent.Johnson’s ethnic nationalism relies on the idea of the nation as the natural home of a people whose ancestors are all from one ethnic group. History suggests that once ethnic nationalism is introduced into a nation’s politics it is difficult to remove and even more difficult to control. Once one group is defined as “the people”, the next step is often to classify the excluded as second-class citizens. This is hardly a route back to national unity.A new tribalism has gripped the UK. However, recent surveys show that on the most fundamental issues – climate change, equal pay and the right of women to have careers, faith in science and scientists, the NHS – we are not ided. On these issues our collective views are converging, and even heading towards a consensus. We need a politics that reflects that. The alternative to Johnson’s ethnic nationalism that Labour should offer is a civic nationalism. Rather than basing national pride on biological heritage, skin colour or religion, civic nationalism says we can unite around shared values and institutions. To foster this, we need new spaces and places in which the UK’s erse peoples can engage with each other and belong.Why don’t we start by creating a citizens’ assembly to begin deciding the basis for a new British bill of rights and a codified constitution? Next, who is up for scrapping our unfair voting system and replacing it with something proportional to encourage a new politics of compromise? Then, why not trial a form of universal basic income – call it the citizens’ fund – so that all people have the capacity and capital to come together in social clubs, sports teams and other parts of civic life? More controversially, could compulsory national civic service – compelling young people from all regions, ethnicities and social classes to mix – remind us what we have in common?Labour will win back the country only if we show the public that we love the UK, too, and are positive about what we have achieved together, and optimistic about the inclusive, multicultural, dynamic society we want to build. The difference is that our national pride manifests itself in hope, rather than fear. While Johnson pulls the country back towards a nostalgic version of Little England, Labour must own the future of a reinvigorated UK.As for which Labour figure I believe is best-placed to lead this hopeful vision, I will consider that over Christmas.David Lammy is the MP for Tottenham in London“Can I ask why you’re voting Conservative this time?” I asked the woman – who voted Labour in 2017 – smiling at me from the doorway of her home, beautifully decorated for Christmas.“Not at all,” she beamed. “First, education…” “Cut by £69m, in real terms, in Wakefield since 2015,” I interjected. “Second, the NHS,” she continued. “Suffering the longest funding squeeze in its history,” I countered. “Third, Brexit – I voted Remain but I just want it done.”The causes of our worst defeat in 80 years are complex – and simple. A winter election that Jeremy Corbyn should never have agreed to, against the advice of his shadow cabinet and the parliamentary Labour party. In the middle of a Brexit crisis, his indecision on the biggest issue facing the country meant we lost Leave and Remain voters. His leadership ratings were abysmal. Voters didn’t trust him on defence, security and the economy. They hated the party’s infection by antisemitism and saw good MPs bullied out of their seats. They just didn’t like him.When our “all shall have prizes” manifesto was published, people asked where the money was coming from and scoffed at our nationalised broadband idea. Nostrums of the 1970s were presented as answers to the 21st-century challenges of new technology, climate change, an ageing population and the changing nature of work. The £58bn for the Waspi women knocked the “carefully costed” mantra on the head.People despaired at the invidious choice before them and picked what they saw as the lesser of two evils. Thousands of party members had resigned. More have resigned since the result.Those failures mean a hard Brexit looms in January. Boris Johnson’s promises on workers and environmental rights have gone, exposed as a ruse to win power. His anarchic Vote Leave government is cracking on. A £10 minimum wage will happen only “if economic conditions permit”. They won’t. The economy will shrink and people will be poorer. Brexit threatens the union and will harm our public services. The gap between north and south, rich and poor will grow.So when I saw Jeremy posing for a photo with young people in parliament, I seized the moment. In my accidental exit interview, I asked why he wasn’t apologising to them. Why he was still leader when his personal toxicity, organisational incompetence and political mishandling had led to the catastrophe? How did losing the election mean we won the argument?The answers were indifferent and infuriating. The pre-election trigger ballots to reselect Labour MPs were because he wanted more democracy in the party. The bullying? Mainstream media. Antisemitism? Did I think he wants racism in the Labour party? He was present, but not involved.The Labour party, formed to represent working people, cannot ignore their verdict. We have failed them for four elections in a row. The party does not have a God-given right to exist.Members must decide if we are to be the strong social democratic opposition our country needs, or an ideological vanity project. The next leader must speak not just to members but to voters in Wakefield and Wolverhampton. They must ignore the keyboard warriors and speak to the decent, silent majority who want a leader they can trust.The next leader must reaffirm Labour’s progressive internationalism, kick out the antisemites, rebuild organisational competence and enforce the rules. They’ll need the heart of a lion and a strong stomach for the fight. We need to detoxify and become again a principled opposition that people can trust. We need a courageous, credible, clever and competent person to reshape our movement. Observer readers should join us and help get it right this time.Mary Creagh was MP for Wakefield from 2005 to 2019The Johnson government is clearly resolved to use the power of the state in order to drive through a rightwing shift. Our task is both to oppose Johnson but also to advocate the renewal of the country in a way which unites, rather than ides, and which offers a new economy, social justice and democratic reform.We must use the leadership election to debate our future. A blizzard of discrete tax and spend policies which lack any connective narrative or national story will not work.First, we need an analysis. Labour’s concern about impoverished public services, gross inequality and class stratification was surely correct. Our transformative approach should be sustained.It is also clear that many millions of people share the view that we need a big change. How else can we explain the fact that over 17 million people voted to leave the EU?A sense of dissatisfaction with the status quo has been incubating from as far back as the 2005 election. It is most deeply rooted in those areas which have suffered most from recent economic changes and which are geographically peripheral to the metropolitan growth nodes of the new economy.Too many people in too many communities experience a loss of agency the power to control their own lives, to make a difference, and to have a voice which can make itself heard.Instead they sense they’re in a place where (bad) changes happen. Loss of control, no apparent economic purpose, and the collapse in social mobility means that your kids and grandkids can’t break out. The communities which I represent lost their coal mines 35 years ago. Their raison d’être was stripped away.Of the 533 English constituencies, mine is the 529th worst in terms of social mobility. Children born here can have little expectation of making progress in their lives.Loss of purpose leads to a sense of alienation and to emotional responses such as anger and a deep sense of existential angst.The right has understood this loss of agency. It explains the Brexit slogan of “take back control”. Of course, these working-class communities will not recover any control with a Tory government.Sadly the Remainer contingents failed to understand the emotional sense evoked by the offer of restored national sovereignty. Instead they sought to overturn the referendum in an apparent further twist of the knife by a social group which had never seemed to listen to or understood the “held back” regions.Given that the party was seen as tilting towards rejection of the votes of millions, it can hardly be surprising if those millions were suspicious of everything else we said, even though – taken singly – our policies were so popular that in some cases even Boris Johnson was using similar language.Where next, then? I would suggest three things. Each will require humility and a listening ear. First, there must be no going back to New Labour, where the alienation from so many communities began. Rather we must retain our central drive towards a transformation of our economic structures.But this must be rooted in a clearer understanding of working-class and left-behind areas. Never again should we present ourselves as knowing better than millions of our erstwhile supporters.Second, we need a connecting national story which explains who we are and where we are heading. This will require us to demonstrate how we will empower communities throughout the country and restore agency to those whose lives are subject to impersonal, often global economic forces. None of this new national story needs mean a return to a sense of an imperial Britain. The future is in internationalism on the one hand and localism on the other, bound together by a strong value-laden principle of solidarity.Third, we need to tackle the wholly dysfunctional, remote and incomprehensible political structures manipulated to their narrow interests by a golden elite group. We need a careful process of building power structures outside the metropolitan centre.It feels to me that progressive federalism with regional devolution in England alongside devomax for the nations is the only realistic way forward.Acting carefully, rooting ourselves in all Britain’s communities with resolve and radicalism but also with economic credibility, we can win again even in this dark hour.Jon Trickett is shadow minister for the Cabinet Office and MP for Hemsworth"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b75d979e61e6b55514d4aa25b9fcf460792fce53/0_426_2320_1391/master/2320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e82c72e142c9898ca25ea4985d297a5e","title":"if you speak multiple languages which words get lost in translation","story":"Share your favourite words or terms that just don’t translateA new study has demonstrated that while words for emotions such as “fear”, “love” or “anger” are often directly translated between languages, there can be differences in their true meaning, depending on the family the language belongs to.For example, while the concept of “love” is closely linked to “like” and “want” in Indo-European languages, it is more closely associated with “pity” in Austronesian languages.The team behind the research say the way particular experiences are interpreted as emotions appears to be shaped by culture.Are there words you know which can be directly translated, yet have subtle differences in meaning?

Over the last 24 hours looked very hard at that and we think we’re ready to go,” he said on Saturday.Despite the failure to dock, the mission would still harvest “an enormous amount of data”, Bridenstine said, including information from an anthropomorphic model human packed with sensors called Rosie the Rockeeter.The failure to complete the mission, with investigations so far focusing on Boeing computer code, represents another black eye for the company. Last week, Boeing suspended further production of its profitable 737 Max, the passenger airliner involved in two crashes that killed 346.Friday’s Starliner test was considered a crucial rehearsal for next year’s inaugural launch with astronauts, as well as Boeing’s chance to catch up with SpaceX, Nasa’s other commercial launch provider.But neither firm has yet launched a manned test of its newest capsule. Last April, a SpaceX capsule designed to carry astronauts exploded during a ground test.The Starliner’s debut launch to orbit was a milestone test for Boeing, which is vying with SpaceX, owned by high-tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, to revive Nasa’s human spaceflight capabilities.SpaceX carried out a successful unmanned flight of its Crew Dragon capsule to the space station in March.Still, Boeing said the data coming back from the Starliner suggested it was performing well.“An astronaut on board could have provided a lot of options to mission control that could have put us in a position to get to the international space station,” Bridenstine added during a Saturday briefing.Built to accommodate seven people, the white capsule with black and blue trim will typically carry four or five.The latest flight was designed to test all systems on the $4bn capsule, from the vibrations and stresses of liftoff to touchdown. On Friday, Nasa emphasized that the capsules were designed to be safer than the old space shuttle.“We’re talking about human spaceflight,” Bridenstine cautioned. “It’s not for the faint of heart. It never has been, and it’s never going to be.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/520e1092c1c21a9eb6f606345d8c58ca69babfcd/169_366_4558_2735/master/4558.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81dc59bcb3fd25703ac3c3361ab64422","title":"thistlecrack king george kempton","story":"The popular 11-year-old will warm a lot hearts if he wins midwinter’s championship race of steeplechasingEasily the most popular winner of Boxing Day’s King George VI Chase would be Thistlecrack, now firmly into the loveable veteran stage of his career. He was the upstart when he won it as a novice chaser three years ago with a tearaway performance so impressive that he seemed to have the game at his mercy, a memory made poignant by the knowledge that he has not won since.While the market has him pegged as a 14-1 shot and expects him to be run ragged by the flashy youngsters Cyrname and Lostintranslation, there is a sizeable gang of followers who have never lost faith: the Thistlecrackers, we might call them. They are given every reason for hope of a miracle at Kempton by the words of those close to the horse.“He is working brilliantly at the moment,” says his trainer, Colin Tizzard, from his base on the Dorset-Somerset border. “Honestly, he is brilliant. He would be probably as good as anything on our gallop at the moment, if not the best.”This is not what one expects to hear about an 11-year-old that missed the 2017 Gold Cup because of a tendon injury and the following year’s race with a stress fracture. When he finally got to the Cheltenham race in March, he failed to show anything like his best form and was pulled up for the first time.But Kempton has brought out the best in him, notably in last year’s King George, when Might Bite, Native River, Politologue and Waiting Patiently were all better fancied. He beat them all and halfway up the home straight it looked as though he was going to pull off an improbable second success in the race. “I did think he was going to win it,” recalls Tom Scudamore, who has ridden him in every race since April 2015. “When Clan Des Obeaux came alongside, I was thinking he hadn’t always been the strongest of finishers. Unfortunately for me and Thistlecrack, he decided to turn over a new leaf that day.”Clan Des Obeaux finished stylishly and had a length and a half in hand at the line over Thistlecrack, who was a dozen lengths clear of everyone else. The winner benefited from a hold-up ride and the result may have been different had Thistlecrack been able to save a bit more for the last half-mile.But that has never been his way. When he won the 2016 race, he tore around Kempton in the manner of a child ripping open presents, as if there was no end to his energy and nothing to gain from restraint.His prodigious leap at the second fence will live in the memory long after he is retired. If he had learned professionalism by then, he would have fitted in an extra stride and popped over, instead of exuberantly hurling himself through the air. It ought to have undermined his finishing effort but the laws of the game seemed suspended that afternoon.“He’s been an awesome racehorse,” Scudamore says, “to have won so many Grade Ones and a King George as a novice. Obviously, through injuries and what-have-you, he hasn’t quite reached those heights we all thought he was going to do. It’s hard to know what to expect this time but I sat on him last week and he seemed in good order. He ran a cracking race at Newbury last month, which was a great pipe-opener because he needed it really badly. He’s normally going there as one of the favourites but this year it’ll be slightly different.”Tizzard also trains Lostintranslation, whose chance is more obvious, and for a while it looked as though he would switch the older horse away from the King George back into the staying hurdle ision he once dominated.Only on Monday was the decision taken to have another crack at the midwinter championship race of steeplechasing.Tizzard is always softly spoken but his Dorset tones have been gathering conviction as he reflects on his horse’s chance. “I’m quite looking forward to him running.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c389fb1c79580a4adf1e02a77904ec1dfac37a1/0_227_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a82ebfc913c388d5eb979b3fa6a3a69","title":"uk europe travel discoveries 2019 readers travel tips","story":"From a grand-but-affordable Scottish castle to beauty spots in the Azores, our tipsters share their travel highlightsWhen a friend suggested a weekend trip to Scotland as opposed to Rome or Bruges, I was sceptical.

And at 19th-century Stonefield Castle, with sweeping turrets and elegant well-tended gardens, near the lovely fishing village of Tarbert, my Scottish love affair began. Delicious seafood from the neighbouring Loch Fyne and glasses of malbec consumed over scrabble in the library made the weekend even more magical.

Baker knew the hardest part of the home invasion would be getting past the front door, so he devised a plan to dress up as police officers conducting a routine investigation.Once inside the Mills family home, Baker revealed his true colours. He tied up the mother of the family, ignoring the pleas of the three children present, stole money and objects, then turned a gun on the father, Donald Mills, shooting him dead.When Judge David Williams sentenced Baker in December 2017 to 19 years in prison for reckless homicide, burglary and impersonating a police officer, he said he would have given a longer punishment if he could. “I’ve been practicing law for 30-something years, and I’ve never seen a more compelling or complete case, the evidence was just overwhelming.”Fast-forward just two years and Patrick Baker is a free man, released by Kentucky’s outgoing governor in act that has been dubbed “extreme pardon”. The brutal killing is just one of the extraordinary elements of the eleventh-hour move by Matt Bevin, a Republican in the Donald Trump mould who even by his own controversial record has astonished and angered his state with his pardons.It was the final manoeuvre of a governor who was elected in 2016 on Trump’s coat-tails, making Kentucky the last southern state in America to turn Republican, only to be voted out of office last month. What motivated a politician who has spent the past three years waging bitter wars with teachers, trade unionists, voters, liberals, scientists and reproductive rights advocates suddenly display such profuse mercy towards prisoners has become the talk of Kentucky.Even his own previously loyal Republican peers have expressed bewilderment. The top Republican in the state senate has called for an investigation of Bevin’s “extreme pardons and commutations”.Mitch McConnell, the US senator from Kentucky better known as the Republican trying to stymie Trump’s impeachment trial in Congress, has denounced the release of “heinous criminals” in his home state as “inappropriate”.Speculation of what drove Bevin to his action initially focused on money, after the Louisville-based Courier Journal discovered that the family of Patrick Baker had donated $21,500 to Bevin’s political campaign funds before the commutation. Suspicion of pecuniary incentives then turned to moral outrage of a different sort after Bevin tried to explain on local radio why he had pardoned Micah Shoettle after only 18 months of his 23-year sentence for rape.“There was zero evidence,” Bevin told the radio host, adding that the girl’s hymen had been intact.That provoked a whole new chorus of indignation, including from paediatricians who pointed out that rape cannot be proved or disproved by examination of the hymen.That was just the start of it. As intrepid local journalists began to dig into the mountain of pardoned cases, other apparent horrors emerged.They included further sexual offenders. Dayton Jones, who Bevin set free after three years of a 15-year sentence, had pleaded guilty to raping a boy aged 15 whose bowel he ruptured with a sex toy. Charles Phelps had his name removed from the sex offender registry by Bevin having pleaded guilty in 2013 to child abuse images offences and sexual conduct with minors.The gruesome details of the violent crimes committed by some of those selected for commutation did not stop there. Delmar Partin was convicted of beheading a female co-worker and hiding her mutilated body in a barrel Irvin Edge had hired a hitman to murder his business partner at home in front of his family Blake Walker had killed his own parents.Most of the lucky 428 singled out by Bevin were non-violent. When the Courier Journal came to analyse the beneficiaries of his largesse, the paper found that 336 of them were on non-violent drug sentences.The newspaper calculated there were almost 1,000 black or other minority prisoners who would have qualified for Bevin’s largesse. He chose 16.On one level, there is something fitting about the storm of controversy in which Bevin has finished his governorship given that disputes seemed to follow him around throughout his term in office. At the height of a recent measles epidemic, he let it be known that he had exposed each of his nine children to a neighbor’s chickenpox so that they would contract the disease as an alternative to getting vaccinated.“They were miserable for a few days, and they all turned out fine,” he said, while telling the federal government to get its nose out of people’s private business. That anti-vaxxer sentiment expressed by Kentucky’s then governor earned him a riposte from a leading paediatrician who remarked: “We’re no longer living in the 17th century”.Earlier this year, when Kentucky schools were closed to protect children from the -20F (-29C) wind chills, Bevin publicly complained: “C’mon now. I mean, what happened to America? We’re getting soft.”On policy, he followed the classic Trump textbook, ramming through “right-to-work” laws that prevent trade unions gathering fees as a condition of employment, denouncing teachers on strike for exposing kids in their charge to sexual abuse and physical danger, supporting efforts to suppress the vote among minority communities, limiting access to Medicaid and banning abortion at 20 weeks.The toxic combination earned him Trump’s adoration – the US president unsuccessfully campaigned on Bevin’s behalf in the recent gubernatorial race – but it also gained him the mantle of one of the most unpopular governors in the US.Last week Bevin posted a long screed on Twitter in which he sought to explain his pardons. He began by evoking the spirit of redemption and second chances, and the ambition to help offenders seek rehabilitation.He went on to insist that during his years as governor he had invested hundreds of hours to reviewing petitions for pardon. “Contrary to that which has been falsely stated by many, not a single person was released who had not already been scheduled for a specific release date,” he said.He denied any financial motive, calling any such suggestion “highly offensive and entirely false”.The Twitter thread does not appear to have satisfied his detractors, or calmed the widespread shock at a Republican’s last-minute flurry of pardons. The sister of the murdered home owner, Donald Mills, was blunt after she learnt that Patrick Baker was now out.“Matt Bevin can rot in hell,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3df093759b10d1d0f167dabc1e082aa2c82505e/0_200_2344_1407/master/2344.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=292d0f92de1577fc230e642996187a9b","title":"board games books and brand new clothes a guide to christmas shopping in your local charity shop","story":"They’re the cornerstone of every high street – guaranteed to have an eclectic mix of everything from clothes to homeware.

Zadie Smith, Margaret Atwood, Philip Pullman and John Grisham are all regulars, and you’ll find plenty of new authors such as Sally Rooney and David Chariandy too. While some titles may be a few years old, it’s not unusual to find the latest must-read on the shelves, and keep your eyes peeled for signed editions for an extra-special touch.Chintzy chinaFrom cocktails served in teacups to unusual teapots becoming a major home decor trend, the popularity of chintzy, vintage china is on the rise.

Why not use a floral teacup as a holder for a homemade candle?Classic recordsWith vinyl records increasing in popularity, why not make a beeline for your nearest charity shop as they have plenty on offer. As digital formats took over, people turned to charity shops to free up their once-straining shelves and, because vinyl was donated in such abundance, many charity shops sell records for as little as 25p. You can expect to find everything from classical and krautrock to electronica and soul.Brand-new clothesWe all know someone who’s a little squeamish about the idea of secondhand clothes. But luckily for thrifty gift-givers, charity shops are not only stocked with vintage finds and pre-loved pieces, they’re also home to a huge amount of brand-new, unworn clothes. A quick rifle through the rails of your local charity shop will reveal a whole host of clothes with the original tags still attached. You’ll find everything from bold, printed T-shirts and floaty maxi dresses to jeans and shirts. There’s an abundance of high street labels waiting to be found and, if you’re lucky, you might just stumble across a designer piece.Vintage sewing patternsMore than a million people have taken up sewing over the past few years, with sales of sewing patterns soaring. However, with some patterns costing as much as we’re used to paying for a fully finished garment, the prices involved can be off-putting. To keep the crafty person in your life stitching, have a rifle through the baskets of vintage sewing patterns you often find tucked away underneath shelves. Selling for as little as 50p, you could buy enough to keep them busy until next Christmas.Statement jewelleryYou don’t have to go to an expensive boutique to find the perfect piece of jewellery – there’s plenty to be found in charity shops and they won’t break the bank. Take your pick from delicate vintage brooches, strings of pearls (likely faux, but you never know), oversized earrings, watches and cufflinks. The shelves are full to bursting with an assortment of jewellery that will suit everyone from your best friend to your grandma.Toiletry gift setsOnce a reasonably priced option for a secret Santa, toiletry gift sets seem to get more and more expensive each year. Rather than splashing out, see what’s on offer in your local charity shop. While some people may be worried about buying lotions and potions secondhand, charity shops are very savvy with their stock. Anything opened doesn’t make the shelves and many branches keep high street gift guides from the last couple of years in stock so they can cross-check whether a set is in date or not.Show your high street some loveWhy not seek out the personal touch with your Christmas shopping this year and join Visa in supporting local independent businesses across the country because #WhereYouShopMatters"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b08e67d45c554e1416a0d05e20f37399801fb0de/2810_672_2638_1583/master/2638.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=641c6a1f2409434d9c09472aa8a21693","title":"weve become like a little family of shops we look out for one another","story":"For Karen Harvey, her shop Hoos is fulfilling a lifelong passion for Scandi design while also breathing welcome new life into her local area, writes  Malcolm Jack “I often get people coming in and asking me what the name of the shop means,” smiles Karen Harvey, founder and owner of Hoos. “Everyone thinks it’s Danish or something. It’s actually just how you say ‘house’ in Scotland,” she laughs, “it’s just a bit of fun.”Be that as it may, it’s a name that captures a lot about what makes Glasgow’s haven of gorgeous Nordic homeware such a unique delight to visit. Both in terms of its synergy of fine Scandi and Scottish design (“hus”, pronounced the same way as Hoos, happens to be the word for “house” in the three main Scandinavian languages), and also its welcoming sense of warmth and character. Never more so than in the run-up to Christmas, when Harvey and her staff embrace the rich northern European tradition of bringing cosy light and comfort to long, dark winter nights, with their twinkling decorations and friendly, personalised approach to helping customers pick just the right presents for family and friends.Home has been at the heart of 63-year-old Harvey’s entire working life, in different ways. For 30 years she lived in Suffolk, leading two charities that did revolutionary things in improving the lives, living circumstances and futures of vulnerable young people (she received an MBE for her services). A mixture of professional and personal circumstances led her back to her native Glasgow a few years ago, where she decided to take an entirely new career direction.“I’ve always had an interest in interiors and design, even though that’s not my background at all,” Harvey explains. “Scandinavian design has always been my sort of personal aesthetic, so when I was thinking: ‘OK, what brands do I want to do?’ they were the only ones for me.” She leased small premises on, at that time, a dilapidated stretch of Great Western Road, just off the west end of Glasgow’s central artery Byres Road, and with the support of her architect partner Bill, cleverly transformed the compact space into an immaculately laid out, bright and inviting oasis of select hard and soft furnishings, cool kitchen and tableware, lush green house plants, stylish rainwear, handmade fashion accessories and other assorted pretty things.Starting a new business in a new sector would be a daunting challenge for anyone, but Harvey took it in her stride. “I had to go to Copenhagen and be interviewed by some of the brands, because they’re very particular about what kind of shops they’re going in to,” Harvey reveals. She evidently impressed, because Hoos has become one of the few stockists in the UK for a host of hip makers such as Hay, Normann Copenhagen and Skagerak, to name just a few. “Most of my jewellery is by Glasgow School of Art graduates,” Harvey explains. “We also do textiles by Scottish makers. You’re not going to find these kinds of things in any other store either.”Business is going strong for Hoos, as it helps lead a local high street revival. Harvey is passionate about fostering a thriving community along Great Western Road, which has seen a host of great vintners, victuallers, boutiques, bookshops, bakers and cafes breathe new life into a historic strip of retail premises. She’s involved with Love Great Western Road, a Business Improvement District (BID) proposal encouraging local businesses to work collectively for a brighter, more prosperous commercial future. “It’s helped us to get to know one another,” Harvey says of BID. “We’ve become like a little family of shops – we look out for one another.”As well as local retailers pulling together to support each other, they all rely on their customers doing the same. By reminding people #WhereYouShopMatters, Visa is championing local, independent retailers to help restore richly deserved focus and footfall to our high streets. Not only because our high streets are at the heart of our communities, but also because great independent traders can offer unique and enriching retail experiences, where staff take a hands-on approach to helping you select special things for yourself and for the important people in your life. Shops like Hoos are working hard to not only redefine what it means to be a small, independent trader in the digital age, but also help revitalise our high streets for a new generation, and they deserve to be shouted about for it.“I’m really encouraged by Visa’s #WhereYouShopMatters initiative,” says Hoos’s Karen Harvey, “because it brings businesses like ours to people’s attention. Particularly among younger people, who I think are the ones who increasingly do most of their shopping online. If it brings Hoos to their attention for maybe the first time, obviously that’s fab. And then they’ll come to Great Western Road more often and see all the other fabulous shops too.”Here are some of Harvey’s top tips for great Christmas shopping experiences in her local area:Love and Squalor“A small shop just past Kelvinbridge. Rebecca is the owner and she sells clothes that she handmakes herself. So it’s like going back to how it used to be many years ago. She also buys in things such as wonderful socks and lovely Irish scarves, blankets and candles. It’s just a really nice experience going in there.”427 Great Western Road, Kelvinbridge, G4 9JACottonrake Bakery“A fabulous independent bakery, doing wonderful bread, cakes and bakes. In the run-up to Christmas they do all kinds of special things such as Christmas jams and other nice little presents. We feel extremely lucky to have them nearby.”497 Great Western Road, G12 8HLPaulin Watches“Everyone loves a watch – particularly a handmade one. Paulin’s designs are beautiful. They’re a young, independent company and they sell lots of other handmade things such as risograph prints by local artists.”407 Great Western Road, G4 9JAShow your high street some loveWhy not seek out the personal touch with your Christmas shopping this year and join Visa in supporting local independent businesses across the country because #WhereYouShopMatters"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71f2c9a26f832b9957df0f178b0e25d1a45f8cdd/418_2114_3422_2053/master/3422.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09930e09e9b7d6674f8445610cfea1b4","title":"the more festive the better how the high street becomes a special place at christmas","story":"Shopping takes on a new life at Christmas as the high street is transformed – as shoppers profess to having a little more goodwill than on your average Saturday and independent stores become the top destinationsAt the risk of sounding incredibly basic, I’ll confess: after the Christmas music, the decor is my favourite part of the festive season. While I’m next to useless when it comes to putting up my own decorations, I’m drawn like a moth to the flame to any household, restaurant, market or shop that has put in the extra effort. The more fake snow, twinkling lights and jingling bells, the better.In the car-centric Toronto suburb where I grew up, most of my youthful Christmas shopping was confined to the local mega-malls, which were unfailingly packed with overheated shoppers from Black Friday through to Boxing Day, so moving to the UK has been something of a revelation. No mall Santa, however rosy-cheeked, can really compete with the quaint holiday market in my boyfriend’s Lancashire hometown, or Kew Gardens’ festive trail of lights.That’s why you’re likely to find me gawping at the garlands over Regent Street when they’re illuminated later this month. The first major high street in London to adopt the practice of street-long decoration, Regent Street has been doing its Christmas light display since 1954, after a reporter described London as “drab” during the holiday season. Oxford Street followed suit soon after, in 1959, and by the end of the 1960s, high streets across Britain were invested in the new tradition. In fact, many cities now make an event of the day the lights are switched on, complete with fair rides, pantos and celebrities of varying degrees of fame.These spectacles aren’t just about dazzling onlookers. In Christmas and the British: A Modern History, historian Martin Johnes explains that light displays “gave 20th-century Christmas shopping a sense of occasion that differentiated it from the wider shopping experience that had become so embedded in everyday life”. More than just setting a mood, high street Christmas decorations make shopping less of a chore. If we have to endure the hordes each season, why not do it somewhere we don’t only tolerate, but enjoy?It’s not only the busy high streets following this logic. The coloured lights strung by volunteers in the tiny Cornish fishing village of Mousehole, all funded by donations, attract some 30,000 tourists a year to the benefit of local businesses. And for the last three years, Broadway Road in the Cotswolds has hosted late-night shopping evenings in December, with local stores staying open until 8:30pm so shoppers can stock up on gifts and take in a mix of performances in a cheerful environment. A friend of mine who worked at a Broadway Road hair salon recalls the time her team dolled up Three Wise Women and had them ride down the street on camels.Partial to a late-night browse myself, I usually venture to Mount Street in Mayfair to watch the lights get switched on, and spend the rest of the night wandering through the boutiques, sipping complimentary champagne and stuffing my face with mince pies to a medley of choristers and fashionable DJs. You can get the same buzz on many high streets in December, when independent shops stay open late and a holly wreath (or cup of mulled wine) is always close by.For all my talk about the high street at Christmas, I’m not one of those people who sorts out their list early. I pick up inspiration over the course of the year, and then do most of my shopping in the two weeks before the big day. That period, when the excitement around Christmas is reaching its peak, is when I feel most energised and most excited to take part in any Christmas-related activity, whether it’s ice-skating, eating Serrano ham at a friend’s flat or having one final night out before everyone goes home for the holidays. And in those instances, as with the shops, the more festive the environment, the better.Show your high street some loveWhy not seek out the personal touch with your Christmas shopping this year and join Visa in supporting local independent businesses across the country because #WhereYouShopMatters"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f4223e36b9b9204ba47fb44221ad0000a4710c8/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7068dac0d21b3b582c48264429ffc00f","title":"no christmas mass at notre dame cathedral for first time since 1803","story":"Mass to be held nearby as workers continue to repair Paris landmark eight months after devastating fireNotre Dame cathedral will not hold a Christmas mass for the first time since 1803, French officials confirmed on Saturday, as workers continue to repair and rebuild the Paris landmark eight months after a devastating fire.The cathedral’s press office said the rector, Patrick Chauvet, would still celebrate midnight mass on Christmas Eve, but it would be held at the nearby church of Saint-Germain l’Auxerrois.Notre Dame, part of a Unesco world heritage site on the banks of the river Seine, was ravaged by the 15 April blaze, losing its gothic spire, roof and many precious artefacts.The building had remained open for Christmas through two centuries of often tumultuous history, including the Nazi occupation in the second world war.

For once I am not lambasting politicians for this.Because I can’t blame them for the ide which I believe causes damaging pain, the gulf between generations. The fact is even the oldest and the youngest need each other.Documentaries by Channel 4 celebrating the success of nursery schools located in old people’s care homes underscore the point.The old need the young to keep us fit, strong and happy. The young need the old to tell them our stories and stop them stumbling into the same old landmines. And yet everything about our current society, where we live, how we shop, how we entertain ourselves, sets up barriers that keep us apart.Looking back to my own childhood, I see all of us grandchildren circling around my grandmother’s home. I visited her every weekend. When as an appalling teenager I ran away from home, it was to stay overnight with granny. But then we lived within a couple of miles of her.This Christmas I will be speaking, as I have for the past six years, to Silver Line callers, older people who are living alone, isolated from children, whose memories of happier years deepen their loneliness, but for whom Christmas is now, as one told me last year, “Just another day to get through.”Three years ago I helped to launch a project created in Torpoint by Elisabeth and David Carney-haworth, she a head teacher, he an ex-policeman. It’s called Silver Stories and like most brilliant ideas it’s so simple.Elisabeth asks six and seven year olds, year 2 of her primary school, (the “Silver Readers”), to telephone older people, (“Silver Listeners”), once a week in their lunch-time from their school, and read to them. Two of the Silver Readers, Holly aged 6 and Robert aged 7 rang me this week and read to me a poem about a rain forest.Holly told me she likes to read to older people “Because it’s a time when they can relax and have a cup of tea and a biscuit.” Robert added, “And because we can talk to them and make their day.”They agreed they both like talking to older people, as Robert explained, “Because I like reading, and it’s a nice way to say thank you to them.”When I revealed my age they responded with a satisfying “Wow”. I shocked them by revealing that when I was young there was no television, and I didn’t eat a banana until I was six. I explained it was due to the second world war, and they sang me the song they’ve been practising for their Remembrance service, “We’ll Meet Again.” The whole conversation was a delight.Doris, one of the Silver Listeners the children read to each Thursday, told me she used to teach in the school. Now aged 86 Doris lives in a care home near Manchester.She has osteo-arthritis which means she cannot stand or walk, and as almost everyone else in the home has dementia, she spends all her time sitting in her room, crocheting, doing puzzles and reading a great deal. Her husband died 14 years ago, “I miss him so much”. Her son lives in New Zealand, her daughter lives 150 miles away, she occasionally sees a child when a carer brings a toddler in, “I love it when they plonk them on my lap.” She misses the company of children, “I was with them for 24 years”, so for her Silver Stories are “A joy, I’m very grateful.”And she wrote her Silver Readers a poem to express her appreciation, “Dear children as you happily speak, I look forward to hearing you every week. Keep up the good work and all you do. Best wishes and a huge thank you.”So before Christmas this year, I would like to call upon every primary school to contact care homes in their area and ask for Silver Listeners. To be read to once a week is a pleasure. When you are deprived of children’s company, to be read to by 6 year olds is a special joy.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

And which ones are near you? Enter your postcode below to find out the undersubscribed, outstanding schools in your area.How to find out if schools in your area are oversubscribedEnter your postcode into our searchable tool above, and you will get a list of all the schools in your area.You can not only find out which schools in your area are over or undersubscribed, but also see their Ofsted ratings. You\u0027ll find out the best but also the most realistic school in your area to apply to, based on 2019\u0027s intake.The data, obtained from the Department for Education through freedom of information requests, compares the number of times a school was listed as a first-preference choice to the number of places offered in 2019. This presents the most up-to-date figure for the ratio of applications per place at any inidual school.Kensington and Chelsea has the most \u0027outstanding\u0027, undersubscribed secondary schoolsThe local authorities with the largest proportion of undersubscribed, outstanding secondary schools are Kensington and Chelsea, Merton, and Westminster.Three of Kensington and Chelsea\u0027s six secondaries are not only ranked as outstanding but they also had fewer first-preference applications than offered placed in 2019. These are Saint Thomas More Language College, Chelsea Academy and Kensington Aldridge Academy.This means that half of Kensington and Chelsea\u0027s secondary schools are both under-subscribed and outstanding, with similarly high proportions in Merton (33 per cent), Westminster (30 per cent) and Southwark (26 per cent).On the other hand, there were 91 constituencies that didn\u0027t have a single outstanding, under-subscribed school. These included from Blackpool, Derby, the Isle of Wight, Barking and Dagenham in London, Surrey and Wolverhampton. The most oversubscribed outstanding school in 2019 was The Royal School in Wolverhampton which had 7.94 first-preference applications for every place it offered.The outstanding school with the lowest ratio of applications per place was Notre Dame Roman Catholic Girls\u0027 School, in Southwark. In 2019, they saw 31 first-preference applications and yet handed out 123 places (a ratio of 0.25 applicants per place).One in ten local authorities do not have a single \u0027outstanding\u0027 schoolOne in ten local authorities do not have a single “outstanding” secondary school, an analysis by The  has found.There are 17 – including Brighton and Hove, Milton Keynes and South Gloucestershire – out of 151 local authorities in England, where not a single secondary has been given the top rating by Ofsted.Ministers are accused of putting “rocket boosters” under London’s schools while other parts of the county are left “fighting for resources” and falling behind.Anne Longfield, the Children’s Commissioner for England, said that youngsters in some parts of the country face a “double whammy of poverty and poor schools”.She said: “Every child should have the chance of going to an excellent school, yet too many are leaving fifteen years of education without even the basic qualifications.  “London’s education system has had rocket-boosters under it for nearly two decades, while schools in some poorer parts of the country are fighting for resources and falling further behind.”She said the Government must put a “relentless focus” on areas that are missing out, including help with recruiting good teachers and extra tuition for children who are struggling to keep up.  The other areas with no outstanding schools are Barnsley, Blackpool, Bury, Central Bedfordshire, Hartlepool, the Isle of Wight, Knowsley, Middlesbrough, North Lincolnshire, North Tyneside, Northumberland, St Helens, Swindon and Wigan.    Professor Sophie von Strumm, from York University’s department of education, said that regional variation in schools’ Ofsted rating is likely to be a reflection of differences in parents’ wealth.  “Rich parents move to areas with outstanding schools for their children,” she said.“However, attending an outstanding school doesn\u0027t make much of a difference for your school performance, it\u0027s your family background that matters.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “This government is determined that every child can benefit from a high-quality education, and teachers and school leaders are helping to drive up standards right across the country.

of accidental catch.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Scottish White Fish Producers\u0026nbspAssociation (SWFPA) said the cod quotas would make conditions “extremely challenging” for

fisheries minister George Eustice said: “This year there has been some very challenging science for cod stocks in many parts of the northeast Atlantic and we have responded to conserve stocks.“I know that some of the quota reductions will be very difficult for some sectors of the industry, and there has been considerable debate this year about the importance of by-catch allowances to support the delivery of the discard ban.“However, we also know that\u0026nbspto protect the profitability of fisheries in the future\u0026nbspwe must fish sustainably today.”Scotland Office minister Douglas Ross said: “The UK government worked hard to secure the best possible deal for Scotland – defending the industry’s interests and the need to ensure the long-term health of fish stocks, in the face of challenging quota advice for species of great importance, such as North Sea cod.“The great news for our fishing industry and coastal communities is that, as we get Brexit done and become an independent coastal state, we will no longer be shackled by the hated Common Fisheries Policy.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when our seas face huge threats such as climate change and overfishing, the UK can lead the world by demonstrating sustainable, responsible management of our fisheries.”Chris Thorne, an oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said: “North Sea cod, like our oceans, are in crisis and so we welcome this decision to cut the quota, which we hope will give this\u0026nbspspecies space to recover.”The UK delegation was led by Mr Eustice, Mr Ewing, the Welsh government’s minister for Environment, Energy and Rural Affairs, Lesley Griffiths, and representatives from Northern Ireland.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

That decision appeared to be a specific attempt to draw attention to the account, and to make clear that the Twitter boss knew about it.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMoments later, the Mr Dorsey used his own platform to unfollow\u0026nbspMark Zuckerberg.

It is still not clear whether it was the result of a genuine fallout or a more friendly jibe.Mr Zuckerberg\u0027s Twitter account is hardly used at all, despite having more than 400,000 followers. While he used it throughout 2009 to write about new\u0026nbsp features, the only post since was a 2012 message that linked out to a post on his official Facebook page.Mark Zuckerberg followed one new person on Twitter this yearMr Zuckerberg followed only one user of the site through the whole year – in another unexplained, unusual interaction. But that happened at the beginning of the year and is not thought to be related to any of the new events.\u0026nbspSome have speculated that the goat – and perhaps all of the events – are in reference to a strange exchange between the two billionaires at the beginning of the year.In January, Mr Dorsey claimed that Mr Zuckerberg had served one of the animals as part of a meal, during a year when he was only eating food he had killed.Mr Dorsey said that Zuckerberg is a “very, very smart businessman,” and then he went on to say: “He made goat for me for dinner. He killed the goat.”The Twitter boss then clarified that Mr Zuckerberg did not kill the goat in front of him but “killed it before” their meal.“I guess he kills it,” he said. “He kills it with a laser gun and then the knife. Then they send it to the butcher.”Mr Dorsey\u0026nbspthen corrected himself to make clear it was probably a stun gun, and went on to suggest that he did not eat the goat because it was cold.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

APTaking Harry Belafonte’s 1956 hit “Mary’s Boy Child” and singing it in medley with new song “Oh My Lord”, Boney M’s No 1 hit combined Christmas carol-like harmonies with Euro disco, steel drums and a reggae sensibility. It might sound disastrous – but somehow it works. AP“He’s gone2,000 milesIs very far,” sings Chrissie Hynde, above a twanging guitar riff in “2,000 Miles”, her serpentine melody stretching each syllable into several. You could easily assume it’s about two separated lovers, but it was actually written for the band’s original guitar player, James Honeyman-Scott, who died of a drug overdose a year earlier at the age of 25. The song is desperately bleak – as is the case with all the best Christmas songs – but with a note of festive hopefulness too. “The children were singingHe’ll be back at Christmas time.” AP418 15) Rockin\u0027 Around the Christmas Tree – Brenda LeeBrenda Lee was just 13 years old when she made herself a rockabilly legend thanks to the recording of this party classic. It always reminds me of scenes in The Santa Clause (one of the best ever Christmas films) where the jaunty number was heavily featured, along with seminal holiday movie Home Alone. RO518 14) Let it Snow! Let it Snow! Let it Snow! – Dean MartinFew Christmas songs are as cosy as this one. Dean Martin’s smooth, rich voice is as warming as a good glass of whisky paired with sweeping, romantic strings and a chirpy flute, “Let it Snow!” conjures up images of stockings hanging up over the chimney, a Christmas tree glinting with baubles, and a frost-tinted window with snow falling outside. RO618 13) Walking in the Air – The Snowman  Peter AutyThough Aled Jones tends to get the credit for this haunting masterpiece, it is actually the voice of choirboy Peter Auty that appears in the climactic scene of the wordless 1982 animation The Snowman. He wasn’t credited though, and when his voice broke and Jones’s version reached number five in the UK charts, he was almost written out of history. In truth, though, whichever version you hear, the song’s sweeping grandeur is goosebumps-inducing. AP718 12) Peace on Earth Little Drummer Boy – David Bowie Bing CrosbyRecorded for Bing Crosby’s TV special Merrie Olde Christmas, and framed around a strange scripted exchange of banter between the two, this mash-up only came about because Bowie hated the song, “Little Drummer Boy”, that he had been asked on the show to sing. So songwriters Ian Fraser and Larry Grossman, alongside the show’s scriptwriter, cobbled together “Peace on Earth” to serve as a counterpoint, while Crosby performed the intended song. They recorded the resulting medley after less than an hour of rehearsal, and five weeks later, Crosby died. AP“Eartha Kitt is the sexiest woman in the world. You don’t write Christmas songs that are sexy. How are we going to do that?”This Mel Torme composition was originally written, according to Torme, with Bob Wells as a mind-over-matter attempt to stay cool during a stifling summer day in 1945. It’s one of Cole’s most enduring hits, and one of the most beloved of all Christmas songs. RO1018 9) I Believe in Father Christmas – Greg LakeThis Mel Torme composition was originally written, according to Torme, with Bob Wells as a mind-over-matter attempt to stay cool during a stifling summer day in 1945. It’s one of Cole’s most enduring hits, and one of the most beloved of all Christmas songs. RO1118 8) It\u0027s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year – Andy WilliamsAndy Williams’ classic brings to mind the kind of big, brash Christmas’s you see in American films – lots of presents, blazing fireplaces and a huge feast – but also plays heavily on the importance of spending time with your loved ones. It consistently appears in the top 10s of Christmas song rankings, and more than 50 years in, the 1963 staple shows no signs of wearing out. RO1218 7) \u0027Stop the Cavalry – Jona LewieIt was “just another anti-war song” until Jona Lewie threw a kazoo into the mix. The English singer-songwriter never intended “Stop the Cavalry” to become a Christmas single, but the festive mention in the line “I wish I was at home for Christmas”, along with the addition of a Salvation Army brass band and tubular bell, was enough to convince listeners.1318 6) Driving Home for Christmas – Chris ReaIn 1978, Rea thought it was all over. His record contract was done, and his manager had just told him he was quitting. Rea wanted to get home from London’s Abbey Road studios to Middlesborough, but his record company wouldn’t pay for a ticket.Sinatra’s version of this classic Christmas song opens on his isolated vocals before gradually introducing the swooning choir and tender strings section. And the lyrics: “Have yourself a merry little ChristmasMake the Yuletide gay  From now on your troubles will be miles awayHere we are as in olden daysHappy golden days of yoreFaithful friends who are dear to us  Gather near to us once more.” RO1518 4) All I Want for Christmas is You – Mariah CareyGeorge Michael wrote, performed, produced and played every single instrument on this song, where the narrator looks back with sadness on a past relationship. As with “Fairytale of New York”, you have an upbeat, cheerful rhythm and chirpy instrumentation, against the melancholy of unrequited love in the lyrics, with the suggestion that it was given away too hastily (“This year, to save me from tearsI’ll give it to someone special”). RO1718 2) Fairytale of New York – The PoguesSome of the best songs combine uplifting instrumentation that contrasts with lyrics that can be downright miserable, and such is the case for “Fairytale of New York”. It has none of the sickly sweet sentimentality of Mariah Carey’s “All I Want For Christmas Is You” or Wham!’s “Last Christmas”.Richard (Dick) Smith was suffering from tuberculosis, an illness which had plagued him since a child, from his bed in a sanatorium in Philadelphia. Gazing longingly out of his window at the snow, he wrote a poem describing all the things he would do when he was well again. He was inspired by the views of people playing in the park across the street from his family home on Church Street, where he’d lived with his mother, brother and two sisters. His father had died when he was a child. 118 18) Happy Xmas (War is Over) – John Lennon and Yoko OnoThere’s a caveat to the optimistic message of the song’s title. “War is over,” sing a choir of children over festive tambourines, but only, they add, “If you want it.” Having analysed the success of his previous single, “Imagine,” the former Beatle noted, “Now I understand what you have to do: Put your political message across with a little honey.” On this, an anti-Vietnam war protest song wrapped up in sleigh bells, strings and an anthemic melody, he does just that.

It was agreed that cod quotas will be cut by 50 per cent in the North Sea, while limited quotas were agreed for cod in the Celtic Sea, Irish Sea and west of Scotland – just enough to allow the landing of accidental catch.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Scottish White Fish Producers\u0026nbspAssociation (SWFPA) said the cod quotas would make conditions “extremely challenging” for people in the industry.However, there were increases for other species, with quotas for haddock in the North Sea rising by 23 per cent and sole in the western Channel rising by 19 per cent.Created

fisheries minister George Eustice said: “This year there has been some very challenging science for cod stocks in many parts of the northeast Atlantic and we have responded to conserve stocks.“I know that some of the quota reductions will be very difficult for some sectors of the industry, and there has been considerable debate this year about the importance of by-catch allowances to support the delivery of the discard ban.“However, we also know that\u0026nbspto protect the profitability of fisheries in the future\u0026nbspwe must fish sustainably today.”Scotland Office minister Douglas Ross said: “The UK government worked hard to secure the best possible deal for Scotland – defending the industry’s interests and the need to ensure the long-term health of fish stocks, in the face of challenging quota advice for species of great importance, such as North Sea cod.“The great news for our fishing industry and coastal communities is that, as we get Brexit done and become an

At a time when our seas face huge threats such as climate change and overfishing, the UK can lead the world by demonstrating sustainable, responsible management of our fisheries.”Chris Thorne, an oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said: “North Sea cod, like our oceans, are in crisis and so we welcome this decision to cut the quota, which we hope will give this\u0026nbspspecies space to recover.”The UK delegation was led by Mr Eustice, Mr Ewing, the Welsh government’s minister for Environment, Energy and Rural Affairs, Lesley Griffiths, and representatives from Northern Ireland.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They have these massive eyes, bunched up noses… The condition is called brachycephalism.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He then tweeted a screenshot of the pug looking “nonplussed” after going viral online.Pugs in particular have exploded in popularity in recent years. Data from the\u0026nbspKennel Club\u0026nbspshows the number of pedigree puppies born each year has increased from about 1,000 twenty years ago to more than 9,000 last year.Man fights to be reunited with emotional support coyoteHowever, there are indications the warnings from vets is now starting to sink in with the public the numbers of pug registrations with the Kennel Club fell last year for the first time in over a decade, while Pets4Home reported a fall in the number of adverts selling pugs of 17 per cent. \u0026nbspDr Cowlam said he would “actively encourage” anyone considering buying a pug or similar brachycephalic dog to think again.If they are intent on it, “do real research into the breeding” because there are now some specialist breeders intentionally trying to undo some of the dogs’ health problems by lengthening the snout.“But also there are lots of irresponsible breeders out there just looking for a quick buck,” he warned.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Despite his party losing 59 seats, he insisted that Labour had “won the argument”.However, the BMG poll suggests that his economic agenda and his stance on national security issues were both particularly unpopular.It found that 46 per cent of voters think Labour should ditch its current agenda on tax and change course, while just 27 per cent are in favour of\u0026nbsppolicy similar to Mr Corbyn’s.\u0026nbspJohn McDonnell vows to stay out of Labour leadership contestForty-five per cent of voters also want Labour’s current positions on public spending and nationalisation to be dumped, while in both cases 28 per cent do not.The gap is even wider on security issues, with 48 per cent saying that the new leader should break with Mr Corbyn’s approach to defence. Just 21 per cent support the current policy.Even among Labour voters, only around half say the next leader should definitely continue Mr Corbyn’s approach to tax and nationalisation.By contrast, Labour’s current health policies are much more popular, with a majority (42 per cent versus 33 per cent) wanting them to be maintained. The party’s position on climate change is also slightly more popular than unpopular.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Robert Struthers, research manager at BMG, said: “As the Labour Party enters a period of soul searching, this polling suggests that there is much that the public would like the next Labour leader to change with respect to the party’s\u0026nbsppolicy platform.“From the areas listed, the NHS and climate change are areas where more voters feel Jeremy Corbyn’s positions are in the right place. For instance, in the case of the NHS, close to half of the public think the next Labour leader should pursue a similar agenda, including three-quarters of those who backed Labour at the ballot box earlier this month.“More concerning are areas such as defence, taxation\u0026nbspand nationalisation, where many more think the next Labour leader should change direction. Indeed, in terms of defence and security – an area where Mr Corbyn often clashed with his critics on the right of the Labour party – it is particularly telling that more of even those who still backed Labour just two weeks ago think the next Labour leader should change course than believe they should stick with Corbyn’s platform.”The BMG poll revealed that voters are not yet impressed by any of the potential candidates.When the\u0026nbsppublic\u0026nbspis asked who should succeed Mr Corbyn, Sir\u0026nbspKeir\u0026nbspis the most popular option, but he is backed by just 9 per cent of voters – narrowly ahead of Ms Phillips (8 per cent) and Ms Cooper (6\u0026nbspper cent).\u0026nbspIn a blow to Ms Long Bailey, who is seen as Sir\u0026nbspKeir’s main rival as frontrunner, only 2\u0026nbspper cent of people polled said they wanted her to replace Mr Corbyn, while 61 per cent said they had never heard of her. The Corbyn ally comes behind Mr\u0026nbspLammy, the Tottenham MP, and Ms\u0026nbspNandy, the Wigan MP, when voters are asked who should be the next Labour leader.Sir\u0026nbspKeir\u0026nbspis also the most popular choice among Labour voters, with 16 per cent preferring. He is ahead of\u0026nbspMs Phillips (11 per cent) and Ms Cooper (7 per cent).Among Tory voters, many of whom Labour will need to win over if is to win the next election, Sir\u0026nbspKeir\u0026nbspis marginally less popular than Ms Cooper.The poll found that many members of Labour’s top team have barely registered with voters. Ms Cooper was the best known, with 60 per cent of people saying they had heard of her, followed by 55 for Ms\u0026nbspThornberry, 50 per cent for Sir\u0026nbspKeir\u0026nbspand 48 per cent for Mr\u0026nbspLammy.The figure drops to 28 per cent for Ms\u0026nbspNandy\u0026nbspand 23 per cent for Mr Lewis.BMG Research interviewed a representative sample of 1,506 GB adults online between 17 and 20 December.

By the same measure, negative coverage of the Conservatives halved.”The research also reveals a high presidentialised campaign, with Mr\u0026nbspJohnson and Jeremy Corbyn by far the most prominent figures in the media coverage. The researchers found that most contenders for the next Labour leadership contest featured little in coverage.\u0026nbspThe study found that Brexit was “by far the most dominant issue” at critical points in the campaign – its start and end – but in intervening periods its prominence was lower.“Research has shown that many voters only start paying attention in the last days of an election, so the final rush of Brexit coverage could have been consequential,” the researchers said.\u0026nbspWhile the Conservatives had the edge in press coverage in 2017, the researchers found that the media landscape was much closer at the previous election: the Conservatives had a balance of minus 0.09 to Labour’s minus 0.13 in the balance of positive and negative stories – meaning Labour was only somewhat more negatively portrayed.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The most recent poll showed 62 per cent of people support the strikes – up three points from a similar poll last week.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“The majority of French people support the action because they are not fooled,” Danielle Simonnet, an elected member of the Paris city council, told The Independent. “They know that with these reforms we will all lose.”Simonnet joined mass protests this week, which saw more than half a million people join street demonstrations throughout France calling on President Emmanuel Macron to drop plans to introduce a universal pension scheme. The reforms were one of Macron’s flagship election promises, which he claims are necessary to revitalise France’s economy.Protestors say the reforms are a betrayal of workers’ rights within one of the world’s most socially progressive systems. For most, they will mean working longer for less money, with a new “pivot age” of 64 forcing people to work an extra two years to receive a full pension.Attempts to frame the narrative against the industrial action backfired over the weekend, after one reporter’s attempts to sow discontent among commuters caused\u0026nbspthe hashtag “Proud of the strike” to trend across social media.\u0026nbspOne thousand tractors roll into Paris for farmer protestIt happened after a TV journalist from\u0026nbspBFM TV suggested that travellers were fed up with the strikes after national rail firm\u0026nbspSNCF\u0026nbspannounced train cancellations for 23 and 24 December. A passerby at the Gare de Lyon station in Paris interrupted the report to say they were “embarrassed by the tone”.The commuter continued: “This is a very difficult period… but the real problem is not the people on strike. We have to look elsewhere.”It is a sentiment shared by critics of Macron, who say his neoliberal agenda favours businesses, and those already well-off, over ordinary workers. Macron, a former investment banker, has faced similar accusations since long before these strikes began through the Yellow Vest protests, which have now entered their 58th consecutive weekend of unrest.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Protestors clashed with police on Tuesday,\u0026nbsptrading tear\u0026nbspgas for petrol bombs. Half of the 16 metro lines in the capital were not running at all for most of the week, with a further six experiencing severe disruption. The only two lines running normally were the line 1 and line 14 – both of which operate without human drivers.\u0026nbspAt over-crowded bus stops this weekend, people spilled off pavements and onto the street, with any buses that were running often too full to pick up more passengers.One way to get across the city was on the free-floating bicycles and e-scooters, but even these have proved problematic. Unions were angered by public transport operator RATP’s decision ahead of the strikes to team up with the e-scooter companies to offer discounts for commuters.\u0026nbspUnion leaders described the move as a “provocation” designed to undermine the action. Since the strikes began, thousands of electric scooters in Paris, Lyon and Bordeaux have been vandalised by protestors.Lime, the largest e-scooter operator in Paris, did not give exact figures for how many of its machines have been damaged in recent weeks. A spokesperson for the firm also did not comment on the strikes, simply telling The Independent: “Vandalising our electric scooters disrupts the thousands of Parisians who use them to travel around the city at this busy time of year.”Another day of mass protests are planned for 9 January – more than a month after the strikes began. Negotiations between the government and unions will also resume in January, with Prime Minister Edouard Philippe hoping to pass legislation by the summer.But his most recent plea for public transport companies to resume services over the holidays was ignored. Unions said there would be no “Christmas truce”, with CFDT union leader Laurent Berger responding: “The prime minister hasn’t heard what the street is saying.”The last time such drastic public sector reforms were proposed was in 1995, when three weeks of nationwide strikes resulted in the government eventually capitulating.\u0026nbspWhile they continue to have the public’s backing, it seems unlikely the latest strikes will end until workers’ demands are met.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He arrived with his mother and father and his eight brothers and sisters after two days of walking. He recalls seeing many dead bodies lining the sides of the tracks that led to Uganda’s northern border. The family were fearful of abduction by rebel groups or becoming caught in crossfire between the government and militia groups. David enjoyed school immensely in South Sudan but said his school had closed due to conflict. He attends Alaba School at Bidi Bidi Refugee Settlement. David dreams of a better life for his family.Sarah, 14, arrived to Kigeme refugee camp from DRC in 2012. Her parents, now unemployed in Rwanda, worked as rag traders. They made the decision to flee the fighting for the safety and relative calm of Rwanda. They were made to feel very welcome by the host community. Sarah is enrolled in class, three years behind where she should be, due to conflict, and she really enjoys her schooling. GS Gasaka school, run by Education Above All Foundation and UNHCR, is providing her the environment to allow her to dream one day of becoming an accountant so she can help her family live a better life.Nakato 19, was born and raised in Yumbe, Uganda. A graduate from Aruma High School, she has aspirations of becoming a journalist. She is actively involved in a movement called “Raise up and Talk” to help empower the younger generation to share their experiences and stories as a form of therapy, to help process the trauma from a life in conflict. Forestal, nine, is in second grade at Marescot School, Haiti. The school is funded through the partnership between non-profit buildOn Haiti, and Educate A Child (EAC), who have constructed 58 schools, as well as training 959 teachers. Forestal explains how she was given up by her father after the death of her mother. She now lives with her auntie as a “restavek” (child in domestic servitude) where she performs chores around the house for at least two hours a day including laundry, sweeping and mopping floors. She can only recall seeing her father once in her entire life. “It was only for one day, but it was really great, we had so much fun,” she says. Forestal hopes that she can see him again – but he lives and works in Port Au Prince, more than three hours away by car.Furaha, six, attends Buremba Primary School. She is a member of the Batwa “Pygmy” tribe, forced out of their native home in the Bwindi Forest to make way for a national park protected as a Unesco World Heritage Site. She lives in Kitahurira settlement camp, about 2.5km and a three-hour walk from her school. The construction of schools and training of teachers in remote areas of challenging geography ensures those hardest to reach have a right to education. Building Tomorrow Uganda through its partnership with Education Above All Foundation has enrolled 53,373 out-of-school children back into quality primary education in Uganda.Niyosenga,12, arrived from Kiyiri, DRC, in 2016. Her mother was killed in the fierce fighting which swept through towns and villages. She made the journey with her father and grandmother to the relative safe haven of Uganda to join the 1.2 million refugees. Niyosenga remained out of education in DRC until the age of nine as the long walk to school was too dangerous with roads closed by police or rebel militia.To help pay for Niyosenga’s school fees her father grows maize while her grandmother, 72, weaves baskets.Jasme, 10, is enrolled at a buildOn school in Perigny. Her two brothers and three sisters all attend the same school. Unlike the reported 300,000 restavek children that live away from their biological parents, Jasme lives with her family.Esperence, 10, goes to Perigny school. Seated on a bench at the end of a long dark corridor, overcome with emotion, he explains how he was given up by his biological parents at the age of eight. He now lives with his auntie and is a restavek child. The term restavek comes from the French rester avec, to stay with. Discussing the work around the house he has to complete as part of his daily chores, he explains: “I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs.”Yean, six, lives in Phnom Penh. Yean’s mother, a widow, feels helpless as she simply cannot earn enough to support her family. Today, Yean lives with her 80-year-old grandmother Khzm Men in Sensok 5, a settlement in the village of Kohmouta on the outskirts of Phnom Penh. The settlement was relocated from one of the capital’s inner city slums areas. Yean attends public school on the periphery of the settlement but due to the informal school fees system in Cambodia, she is forced to consider dropping out due to lack of funds. Yean is desperate to continue her education to fulfil her dreams of becoming a nurse, but without assistance her dreams seem out of reach.Charles, 16, lived with his mother and father in DRC. The Marekera family were forced to leave because their son was persecuted for being an albino. His father was repeatedly beaten after refusing to sell Charles to witchdoctors, who believe teeth, fingers and eyes brought good luck to those who bought their body parts. The transition for Charles arriving in Uganda from DRC has left him with large gaps in his education. Leaving as a senior in secondary school, he now finds himself back in primary school – and facing a similar stigma as an albino in Uganda. His long walks to school are interrupted by strangers attempting to lure him away to profit from the sale of his body parts. Charles explained: “I will never feel safe, however my safety now is less important to me than getting an education. I am determined to get my diploma and have a job where I can help protect the rights of other albinos.”Athar, 21, a beneficiary of Al Fakhoora, a programme of the Education Above All Foundation, was the youngest member to join the writers’ association, aged 14. She stressed the importance of explaining what is happening to the Palestinian people. Five years ago the conflict changed her life forever. She said: “The house was full of our relatives, suddenly everything went dark. I tried to get out of the house, I felt a pain in my leg and there was so much blood. I lost consciousness and woke in the ambulance. Hospitals ran out of anaesthetic so doctors stitched injuries I sustained without it, it was incredibly painful. I heard the news that my father was killed. Losing him was incredibly difficult for me as we were so close.” As a child, Athar had dreamt of becoming a writer or a poet. She said: “My father was my inspiration, encouraging me to write, since his death I have struggled to write anything. For me education is like food or fuel, an energy that gives me power to keep going.”Moza was born and raised east of the Tigris river that ides the city of Mosul. Her parents and five siblings have lived in a two-room concrete dwelling for 10 years. Farhan, Moza’s father, works as a labourer carrying blocks on construction sites across the city. He is in need of a hernia operation, which will cost £200, and finds work extremely difficult. He can’t afford six months off work to recover. The family income is only £62 per month, which barely covers bills. They are forced to take credit from shops to be able to eat. Moza is due to enrol back into schooling. However, at present, she cares for her mother who suffers respiratory problems due to a lodged bullet in her lung after being caught in crossfire during the conflict. She doesn’t know what to expect as she has never set foot in a classroom. Two years beyond the normal enrolment age of six, she still has great dreams of working with NGOs to help residents displaced from the city.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Ali, nine, a Syrian refugee family from Deir ez-Zur district in eastern Syria arrived in Lebanon in 2011. They fled their home with several neighbours by bus toward a safer haven in Lebanon at the outbreak of civil war, which tore through their country. Heavy shelling bombarded their bus and the remainder of their journey had to be made on foot. Nine-year old Ali Ahmed’s father, an agricultural labourer explained that life in Lebanon was hard as they struggle to pay basic bills such as food and rent. As with most Syrian refugees, they are in debt to their landlords and to local shops owners. The collective family income is barely enough to cover any of their bills. Ali, one of the family’s 10 children, attends school 10km from home and dreams, one day, to be able to return home with his family to Syria.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Owen, 16, has been enrolled in Buremba Primary School since 2007 and is one of eight siblings. Now in older years at school, he must pay more money. His parents are peasant farmers and work the land digging and picking tea, this means they must work most days to be able to keep up the payments. Buremba School is one of 60 new schools constructed under the Building Tomorrow and Educate A Child programme in Uganda.Afat, 12, left his home in Deir ez-Zor, Syria six years ago, forced out by the civil war which displaced millions of people, in his case to the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon. He is one of the thousands of Syrian refugee children sat in doorways of Lebanon’s many tents, shelters and makeshift homes dreaming of an education. Instead, he works 11 hours a day collecting scrap metal which he sells for around £2.50. He knows he has a right to education, but he is concerned to help provide for his family. He dreams of one day being able to return home to Syria with his family, to a better life.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added: “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Ikiriza, 5, Kamwenge District, Uganda. Ikiriza who is five years old lives in a small house with his nine brothers and sisters. His parents can’t afford school tuition fees for all the children, leaving Ikiriza with little choice but to fund his own education by working weekends carrying plastic jerry cans of water from the lake for various households of the neighbourhood in Kamwenge district. For this, he earns the equivalent of 5 US cents a day, which helps contribute towards his school fees at Bisozi Primary. He dreams of one day becoming a doctor so that he can help his father who suffers from ill health.Rami, six, lives at Beach Camp, on the sea front amongst the heart of the fishing community al-Shati in the northern Gaza Strip. Rami walks amongst the rubble of shelled buildings, a reminder of past and present conflicts. Restriction to employment and travel have meant many Palestinians are confined in Gaza. Some bright lights still shine as Rami attends grade P1 in school and dreams of becoming a footballer one day.Abdul 10, with his gaze to the floor, wrapped in blankets, huddles by the family stove. His father, Muhammad, emerges from the black of the adjoining room clutching an armful of medical documents written in French, a language he cannot read. His son is two years overdue a heart operation that would save his life. Srey, three, lives in a small dark room with her parents, siblings and relatives. A total of eight people live in a cramped, damp space in a makeshift barn of corrugated metal on the edge of the railroad tracks in the urban slums. The CYMCA Facility drop-in centre, funded in partnership between EAA and Aide et Action, provides emergency education to around 80 children in the area.Joender, six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela arrived in Ipiales, Colombia, after a 33-day journey mainly on foot. He is one of 3.5 million Venezuelan refugees that have left their homes following a catastrophic economic meltdown of his country leaving its citizens starving with no access to food, employment, medical services or education. He holds a packet of crackers, a kind donation from one of the many generous Colombians offering support to the Venezuelan people.Kennedy, 13, displaced to Uganda. He is another statistic of the 2.3 million South Sudanese refugees that fled the outbreak of civil war. Uganda alone shouldering 800,000 refugees. Kennedy was denied a normal childhood and instead became a witness to violence, torture and death in war. Not surprisingly, Kennedy’s family were unwilling to send him to school with threat of armed attack, abduction or recruitment by militias. On arrival in Uganda, Kennedy was still held back from attending school and fulfilling his dream of becoming a doctor. His parents were simply unable to afford the cost of a pair of shoes required for enrolment.“The canvas Billingham bags which carry the tools of my trade. They have sat beside me in the dust of countries around the world listening with me to every word of every story. I feel torn staring at them, joy at returning to my loved ones and the heartache of those I had to leave behind. Now they sit on the polished floor of my room, zipped up and lined up. I need them closer, to feel their weight on my shoulders again, I need to be away.….”David, 13, arrived in Uganda in July 2016 fleeing the civil war that broke out in South Sudan. He arrived with his mother and father and his eight brothers and sisters after two days of walking. He recalls seeing many dead bodies lining the sides of the tracks that led to Uganda’s northern border. The family were fearful of abduction by rebel groups or becoming caught in crossfire between the government and militia groups. David enjoyed school immensely in South Sudan but said his school had closed due to conflict. He attends Alaba School at Bidi Bidi Refugee Settlement. David dreams of a better life for his family.Sarah, 14, arrived to Kigeme refugee camp from DRC in 2012. Her parents, now unemployed in Rwanda, worked as rag traders. They made the decision to flee the fighting for the safety and relative calm of Rwanda. They were made to feel very welcome by the host community. Sarah is enrolled in class, three years behind where she should be, due to conflict, and she really enjoys her schooling. GS Gasaka school, run by Education Above All Foundation and UNHCR, is providing her the environment to allow her to dream one day of becoming an accountant so she can help her family live a better life.Nakato 19, was born and raised in Yumbe, Uganda. A graduate from Aruma High School, she has aspirations of becoming a journalist. She is actively involved in a movement called “Raise up and Talk” to help empower the younger generation to share their experiences and stories as a form of therapy, to help process the trauma from a life in conflict. Forestal, nine, is in second grade at Marescot School, Haiti. The school is funded through the partnership between non-profit buildOn Haiti, and Educate A Child (EAC), who have constructed 58 schools, as well as training 959 teachers. Forestal explains how she was given up by her father after the death of her mother. She now lives with her auntie as a “restavek” (child in domestic servitude) where she performs chores around the house for at least two hours a day including laundry, sweeping and mopping floors. She can only recall seeing her father once in her entire life. “It was only for one day, but it was really great, we had so much fun,” she says. Forestal hopes that she can see him again – but he lives and works in Port Au Prince, more than three hours away by car.Furaha, six, attends Buremba Primary School. She is a member of the Batwa “Pygmy” tribe, forced out of their native home in the Bwindi Forest to make way for a national park protected as a Unesco World Heritage Site. She lives in Kitahurira settlement camp, about 2.5km and a three-hour walk from her school. The construction of schools and training of teachers in remote areas of challenging geography ensures those hardest to reach have a right to education. Building Tomorrow Uganda through its partnership with Education Above All Foundation has enrolled 53,373 out-of-school children back into quality primary education in Uganda.Niyosenga,12, arrived from Kiyiri, DRC, in 2016. Her mother was killed in the fierce fighting which swept through towns and villages. She made the journey with her father and grandmother to the relative safe haven of Uganda to join the 1.2 million refugees. Niyosenga remained out of education in DRC until the age of nine as the long walk to school was too dangerous with roads closed by police or rebel militia.To help pay for Niyosenga’s school fees her father grows maize while her grandmother, 72, weaves baskets.Jasme, 10, is enrolled at a buildOn school in Perigny. Her two brothers and three sisters all attend the same school. Unlike the reported 300,000 restavek children that live away from their biological parents, Jasme lives with her family.Esperence, 10, goes to Perigny school. Seated on a bench at the end of a long dark corridor, overcome with emotion, he explains how he was given up by his biological parents at the age of eight. He now lives with his auntie and is a restavek child. The term restavek comes from the French rester avec, to stay with. Discussing the work around the house he has to complete as part of his daily chores, he explains: “I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs.”Yean, six, lives in Phnom Penh. Yean’s mother, a widow, feels helpless as she simply cannot earn enough to support her family. Today, Yean lives with her 80-year-old grandmother Khzm Men in Sensok 5, a settlement in the village of Kohmouta on the outskirts of Phnom Penh. The settlement was relocated from one of the capital’s inner city slums areas. Yean attends public school on the periphery of the settlement but due to the informal school fees system in Cambodia, she is forced to consider dropping out due to lack of funds. Yean is desperate to continue her education to fulfil her dreams of becoming a nurse, but without assistance her dreams seem out of reach.Charles, 16, lived with his mother and father in DRC. The Marekera family were forced to leave because their son was persecuted for being an albino. His father was repeatedly beaten after refusing to sell Charles to witchdoctors, who believe teeth, fingers and eyes brought good luck to those who bought their body parts. The transition for Charles arriving in Uganda from DRC has left him with large gaps in his education. Leaving as a senior in secondary school, he now finds himself back in primary school – and facing a similar stigma as an albino in Uganda. His long walks to school are interrupted by strangers attempting to lure him away to profit from the sale of his body parts. Charles explained: “I will never feel safe, however my safety now is less important to me than getting an education. I am determined to get my diploma and have a job where I can help protect the rights of other albinos.”Athar, 21, a beneficiary of Al Fakhoora, a programme of the Education Above All Foundation, was the youngest member to join the writers’ association, aged 14. She stressed the importance of explaining what is happening to the Palestinian people. Five years ago the conflict changed her life forever. She said: “The house was full of our relatives, suddenly everything went dark. I tried to get out of the house, I felt a pain in my leg and there was so much blood. I lost consciousness and woke in the ambulance. Hospitals ran out of anaesthetic so doctors stitched injuries I sustained without it, it was incredibly painful. I heard the news that my father was killed. Losing him was incredibly difficult for me as we were so close.” As a child, Athar had dreamt of becoming a writer or a poet. She said: “My father was my inspiration, encouraging me to write, since his death I have struggled to write anything. For me education is like food or fuel, an energy that gives me power to keep going.”Moza was born and raised east of the Tigris river that ides the city of Mosul. Her parents and five siblings have lived in a two-room concrete dwelling for 10 years. Farhan, Moza’s father, works as a labourer carrying blocks on construction sites across the city. He is in need of a hernia operation, which will cost £200, and finds work extremely difficult. He can’t afford six months off work to recover. The family income is only £62 per month, which barely covers bills. They are forced to take credit from shops to be able to eat. Moza is due to enrol back into schooling. However, at present, she cares for her mother who suffers respiratory problems due to a lodged bullet in her lung after being caught in crossfire during the conflict. She doesn’t know what to expect as she has never set foot in a classroom. Two years beyond the normal enrolment age of six, she still has great dreams of working with NGOs to help residents displaced from the city.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Ali, nine, a Syrian refugee family from Deir ez-Zur district in eastern Syria arrived in Lebanon in 2011. They fled their home with several neighbours by bus toward a safer haven in Lebanon at the outbreak of civil war, which tore through their country. Heavy shelling bombarded their bus and the remainder of their journey had to be made on foot. Nine-year old Ali Ahmed’s father, an agricultural labourer explained that life in Lebanon was hard as they struggle to pay basic bills such as food and rent. As with most Syrian refugees, they are in debt to their landlords and to local shops owners. The collective family income is barely enough to cover any of their bills. Ali, one of the family’s 10 children, attends school 10km from home and dreams, one day, to be able to return home with his family to Syria.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Owen, 16, has been enrolled in Buremba Primary School since 2007 and is one of eight siblings. Now in older years at school, he must pay more money. His parents are peasant farmers and work the land digging and picking tea, this means they must work most days to be able to keep up the payments. Buremba School is one of 60 new schools constructed under the Building Tomorrow and Educate A Child programme in Uganda.Afat, 12, left his home in Deir ez-Zor, Syria six years ago, forced out by the civil war which displaced millions of people, in his case to the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon. He is one of the thousands of Syrian refugee children sat in doorways of Lebanon’s many tents, shelters and makeshift homes dreaming of an education. Instead, he works 11 hours a day collecting scrap metal which he sells for around £2.50. He knows he has a right to education, but he is concerned to help provide for his family. He dreams of one day being able to return home to Syria with his family, to a better life.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah.

I am staring at my canvas camera bags, which sat beside me in the dust of countries around the world.\u0026nbspNow they sit on the polished floor of my room, zipped up. I need them closer, to feel their weight on my shoulders again, I need to be away…Here I have compiled a collection of photographs and memories, comprising the stories of some of the most marginalised children in the world.Winter: Abdul, a Syrian refugee aged 10, is seated in a makeshift shelter, perched high among\u0026nbspthe rugged snowy mountain caps of Arsal, Lebanon. He holds his father’s hand as they both huddle\u0026nbspby the stove for warmth. He has the haunting stare of a boy who knows he is\u0026nbspgoing to die, an expression that cuts through the paraffin haze of the dark room as temperatures fall below zero. Mohammed, his father, gaunt from grief, explains\u0026nbsphis son is two years overdue for an operation that could save his life.\u0026nbspWith no means to finance it, he raises\u0026nbsphis hands to the sky in hope that his prayers would be answered.\u0026nbspI remember waiting to see my doctor as a child. I knew my turn would come Abdul knew his would not.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSpring:\u0026nbspVenezuelan refugees who once ate together as families around their own tables\u0026nbspnow eat from rubbish bins on their hands and knees to survive the crisis in their country. All the while, their president publicly feasts\u0026nbspin lavish establishments. Roughly 3.5 million Venezuelans, among them doctors, lawyers and teachers, have left their country, out of starvation and fear.Joender, aged six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela, arrived in\u0026nbspIpiales, Colombia, exhausted and hungry. He was offloaded with his family from a galvanised lorry like cattle, after a 33-day journey, mostly on foot, where they were forced to beg for food to survive. His cupped hands are\u0026nbsprewarded with a packet of biscuits donated by a local in the town. He clutches\u0026nbspthe packet like a prize. Having never begged for food myself as a child, I could not begin to understand the internal dialogue in doing so. I knew I could simply open a fridge door\u0026nbspJoender\u0026nbspcan’t.Summer:\u0026nbspEsperence, aged 10, is a Haitian “restavek” or child slave. He was\u0026nbspgiven away by his biological parents to a more affluent household and\u0026nbspforced into a life of domestic servitude. The feeling of being abandoned proves\u0026nbspto be too much for him. Standing in the kitchen and washing dishes, he simply shrugs his small shoulders, and one by one the tears roll\u0026nbspdown his face. Hours each day are spent cleaning, sweeping and washing.\u0026nbsp“I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs,”\u0026nbsphe says.\u0026nbspNearly 260 million children aren’t in school – do we care?

In a dark room in remote north western Tanzania, she explains\u0026nbsphow not going to school saddens\u0026nbspher. But she nonetheless still dreams that somehow she could become a teacher to help others like her with no access to education. I didn\u0027t have a choice.\u0026nbspI had to go to school. Mamoke didn’t have a choice, but that was because the right of education was unavailable to her. I realise I have taken so much\u0026nbspfor granted in my life. Children around the world live with no access to healthcare, displaced from their home, going to sleep hungry, growing up in conflict and with no\u0026nbspeducation.I did not choose my career any more than I chose my life. It chose me, and it is the greatest privilege, a blessing and a burden in the same breath.

It’s what we lacked in the election”.The explosive remarks came in an exchange with a Labour colleague on Facebook messenger, which has been leaked to The Sun.Asked by the colleague why he wasn’t joining calls for Mr Corbyn to resign, Mr Russell-Moyle declared: “Because I’m not a c*** like those calling for his immediate resignation”.The firebrand MP added: “All the people saying stand down immediately are not saying it in good faith and that’s reason enough to ignore.“Anyonesays that they knew exactly what was wrong I’m afraid is a liar and a charlatan, and I will take no lessons from people who have spent the time undermining the party in all sorts of manners ofthe last few years”.In the conversation, Mr Russell-Moyle also stuck the kne into moderate Labour MP and potential leadership contender Jess Phillips, a long-standing Corbyn critic.Referring also to veteran Labour MP John Spellar, he added: “Jess Phillips would be a disaster. I think she would be truly terrible. I would have anyone but Jess. Well, maybe not anyone – Spellerwould be worse”.When contacted by The Sun last night about his attack on other Labour MPs and the use of his language, Mr Russell-Moyle said: “I said that because calling for Jeremy to go now is a silly and I would go so far to say c***ish thing to say.The best thing is for Jeremy Corbyn is to move aside in an orderly and organised fashion.“In private communications, it is an acceptable word to use, in public though it wouldn’t be.”He also accused the person who leaked the messages to be a suspended member of the party.Mr Russell-Moyle added: “People were speaking with knee jerk reactions the day after the election. We were hurting”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s moreyou’re working. But just tell them you’re unemployed or a student. They won’t check. Most of their current members are one or the other.And look who you have to choose from! Such a rich tapestry of political brilliance.David Lammy! Yay! The man who hates the police stop and search policy. A man who will brand you a racist before you’ve even opened your mouth.Richard Burgon! A plank of wood into which a village idiot has drilled two eyes and a mouth. Rebecca Long-Bailey — so inept even her own party members refer to her as Rebecca Wrong Daily.We could even co-ordinate and demand that they keep Magic Grandpa as boss. I mean, the party still seems to be in a state of denial. It was nothing to do with Corbyn! The voters loved him and loved our policies! We only didn’t win because of, er, Tory lies. The voters are thick, you see. Oh — and Brexit.For a very long time I was a member of the Labour Party. The main reason I left is the main reason nobody voted for it this time around. It is no longer the party of the poor and the working class.It has become a fringe group for metropolitan, middle-class liberals.Look at the only places it did well. Cambridge, Putney, Canterbury. Ha, bring on the revolution, then.“Are we manning the barricades, Cressida  Can I finish my Yakult first ”In a sense it doesn’t really matter who wins their leadership race. Labour lost not just because of the idiotic Corbyn or because of Brexit. It goes far deeper than that.It is the culture of the party. It despises everything its old voter base stands for. Even the moderates.It cannot abide patriotism, for a start. Its old voters are rather proud of Britain, and what Britain stands for. Corbyn and his allies hate our country.The traditional Labour voters believe in the traditional family, too. They have no time for identity politics and political correctness. They want a better deal, but don’t buy into all of the infantile agit-prop that goes along with today’s Labour Party.How the hell do you change that when the far-Left munchkins of Momentum still hold all the power There are still good people in the Labour Party. Some of them — like the brilliant Caroline Flint — lost their seats last week because of what Labour has become.Look at it now. Corbyn is STILL the leader. There is nothing they can do to get rid of him. He’s called for a period of reflection. It didn’t take the voters very long to reflect, did it We need a new party which represents working class people, especially away from London. That’s why I joined the Social Democratic Party.And we can happily leave the Labour Party to its “reflections”. Its support for terrorists, its loathing of the West. It STILL thinks it got its policies right.Even with a new leader it will still be terminally deluded.SO, is the BBC biased Welsh gob on a stick Huw Edwards thinks it is impeccably neutral. But then he would, wouldn’t he  But don’t take my word for it.Here’s the brilliant ex BBC journo and newsreader Michael Buerk, writing in the magazine The Critic. “ . . . all the presenters on the Today programme have been privately educated, like an astonishingly high proportion of the BBC’s editorial and production staff.”He added: “These are unormly bright, urban, young, well-educated arts graduates who have moved smoothly from one liberal institution to another. With little understanding of, or sympathy for, industry, business, the countryside or of course Brexiteers.”As Buerk pointed out, the BBC’s worldview is formed by the people who work for it.An estimated  per cent of them were against Brexit and there are plenty of objective studies which bear out a huge bias against Brexit.Go get ’em, BoJo.The advice is to always park where there are lots of people nearby .And in a well lit area. With the back of the car as close to a fence or kerb as possible.Anyway,someone sidles up to you in the pub and offers you a catalytic converter for a ton, here’s what to do.Kick him in the penkies and shove the converter as far up his rectum as is humanly possible.He’ll be passing incredibly clean wind, regardless of how many sprouts he eats.IS it possible to be more thick than Lauren Goodger  If so, how The Towie “star” got caught in a sting by the BBC. She was filmed endorsing a supposed health drink called Cyanora.She was told the product contained hydrogen cyanide, one of the most lethal substances known to mankind. But not known to Lauren, apparently.She was perfectly happy to give it her blessing. She admitted she’d never tried it . But then she also admitted she had never tried another product she had endorsed.Listen. Never believe TV personalities, actors, singers, etc.Don’t believe them when they tell you what way to vote. Don’t believe them when they’re trying to flog you something. For the most part they’re just greedy and thick as a plate of mince.OH what a pleasure it was to walk around a nice liberal, middle-class area of London last weekend singing: “Ohhhhhh Jeremy Corbyn!”The looks of hatred! I suppose it’s wrong to take pleasure in other people’s misery. But sometimes I can’t help it. Years of being told we’re all bigoted, racist and uneducated, I suppose.My we said she was more thrilled by the election result than she was by the birth of our daughter, which I think is pushing it a bit.Anyway, Boris Johnson has proven that he is a very canny politician indeed.He won the Mayor of London elections twice – by wooing the most right-on liberal electorate in Europe. And then he appealed to exactly the opposite tranche of voters to win the election last week.Huge credit, mind, to his adviser Dominic Cummings. A very sharp bloke – and from the North East.

RUIs are what the Law Society’s head of justice has described as a “major scandal” waiting to erupt.I know Home Secretary Priti Patel will have a lot on her plate as Parliament begins, but this ought to be one of her top priorities.The shocking overuse of RUI came to light on Wednesday, after -year-old thug Ewan Ireland was jailed for le for the murder of solicitor Peter Duncan in a Newcastle shopping centre in August.Peter’s misfortune was to have brushed past Ireland in the doorway of a shop, an act which Ireland took as a slight.He took hold of the screwdriver he had stolen minutes earlier and drove it into Mr Duncan’s heart.It is a tale of mindless, casual violence which has become all too common in modern Britain as the jumped-up egos of young men rage against anyone who gets in their way.But what makes it all the more disturbing is that Ireland’s tendency for extreme violence was well known to police and the courts, yet still he was allowed to walk the streets.While other boys of his age are busy studying for A-levels, Ireland had already amassed a formidable range of criminal qualications.He had  convictions for  dferent offences. He was on conditional discharge for an offence of battery and on bail for a charge of affray for threatening to slash another boy’s Achilles’ tendon.Yet in spite of all this, he had been released under investigation for a robbery.He is not the only violent criminal to have been sent on his way by police. In September last year Alan Martin, of Sunderland, was released by police after his estranged we accused him of raping her.Not only did officers release him, they also ed to him the keys to his we’s house. He promptly ed to the address, attacked her with a hammer and strangled her before taking his own le, too.Astonishingly, Northumbria Police were later cleared by the Independent Office for Police Conduct. No one seems to want to take responsibility. No doubt it will be the same next time, too.Since April , , violent criminals have been released under investigation, Home Office figures reveal.Unlike police bail, no restrictions have been placed on these people. They are not banned from visiting particular places, they have not had to raise a deposit, hand over their passport or report to police at regular intervals. Nor, unlike police bail, is there any time limit on RUI, so police are under no pressure to bring charges quickly.The misuse of RUI is a hangover from Amber Rudd’s time as Home Secretary. It was her Policing and Crime Act  which stopped police putting people on bail for periods of more than  days. True, something needed to be done. The case of former Radio  DJ Paul Gambaccini had inspired the rule change.He had been held on bail for a whole year as police investigated accusations of historic sex offences which turned out to be without foundation.Unable to put criminals on bail for more than  days, police forces took to releasing them under investigation instead.That might be perfectly reasonable in the case of relatively minor crimes which take a long time to investigate, but it is hardly an appropriate way to treat suspected murderers and rapists, especially those with a long history of violent offences.At the very least, people suspected of violent offences — and for which good evidence exists that those offences really did take place — need to be monitored.As for people who have been released on licence while serving sentences for previous convictions, there should be no argument at all — they should be taken back to prison without hesitation.Ministers like to talk tough on crime, especially around election time, but behind the scenes they get caught in the stranglehold of the liberal establishment.Punishments get weakened, prisoners get released early.Disgracefully, former Home Secretary Jack Straw described the sentencing system as the “benign deception of the public”, who, unaware of the soft reality, assume that criminals are being properly punished.But there is nothing benign about serial offenders being freed to rape and murder when police and the courts know full well their records.During the election campaign, Boris Johnson finally called an end to the deception.Braving an onslaught from the nation’s liberal consciences, he announced that prisoners will no longer be eligible for automatic early release — something which allowed the London Bridge killer Usman Khan to embark on his murderous spree.But the Johnson Government should not end there.It needs to stop the police releasing violent offenders back into the community without any restrictions on their movements nor any requirement ever to report to a police station.Liberals like to say that we can’t solve crime just by jailing people. On the contrary, had Ewan Ireland been kept out of circulation after his first offence it would alone have meant  fewer crimes in Newcastle over the past four years.It is hard enough to catch criminals.But to release those we do catch, giving them the freedom to embark on long crime sprees, is plain madness.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And then he also didn’t notice when the car span round and hit the front of his lorry again.And finally he didn’t notice when he was ­actually pushing the car SIDEWAYS along the busy dual carriageway.The man in the Golf was presumably leaning on his horn as hard as he was leaning on his brakes. Everyone in every other car on the road was also leaning on their horn and gesticulating.But still, chummy in the cab kept rolling along. I have spoken to lorry drivers about how this could be possible and they say that in the Daf truck that our friend was driving, it isn’t.They say that in a Volvo you sit so high up, your view of the road ahead is obscured by clouds and solar flares. But the seating ­position in a Daf is ­famously low down.So he MUST have noticed that instead of a teddy tied to his radiator grille, he had a full-sized Golf. Me though  I have another suggestion.Yes, the Golf’s tyres would have been making a right old din buthe’d had the radio on, maybe he didn’t hear them.And sure, it takes quite of lot of effort to push a Golf sideways along the road. But the engine in that Daf is designed to haul tonnes, and at the time of the incident no trailer was attached.Now that I’m a farmer, I understand the problem here. All my neighbouring farmers say that my new tractor is far too large.To which I say that tractors are like penises. And therefore cannot be too large. They also say the  horsepower it develops is too much.And on that, I sort of know what they mean. In a less powerful tractor you can sense when the ground is soft or the load is too heavy.But in mine, I just sit there listening to the radio, not noticing that my cultivator on the back has become entangled in a hedge and is ripping the whole thing out of the ground.Once, I turned round after I’d done a nice straight line across a field, to find I’d been pulling a whole postcode behind me.There were houses, schools and even a ­couple of churches in the mountain of mud I’d been dragging along.If I somehow hit a Volkswagen in my tractor, and I couldn’t see it out of the window, I definitely wouldn’t notice.Any more than I’d noticea baby wren landed on the roof. I’m sure that for the Golf driver on the A, it must have been a pretty scary moment. I sympathise with him.But I also sympathise with the lorry driver who set off to work as a man and arrived as an internet sensation with no one to sympathise with him except me and an eye-witness called Ellie Goulding.WE were told on Wednesday that Australia had endured its hottest day EVER.But that’s not strictly accurate.

Because who wants to sit there being sold to Those were simpler days.So much has changed, including a new profession coming into existence: The influencer.The problem with influencers is that it’s impossible to tell whether they are enthusiastically mentioning products because they love them or because they are being paid to.Eventhey really love a certain cream or tea, when money changes hands, the water is muddied.We like to believe people would only promote products that make their lives better.But the clue is in the name. Anyone whose job title is “influencer” is being paid to sway their followers into buying things they otherwise would not.As a result, we don’t know who to trust.This was illustrated this week by Lauren Goodger being caught on camera for a BBC show agreeing to promote a drink containing hydrogen cyanide.The reality TV star was secretly filmed during a meeting where she was asked to promote a fake diet drink named Cyanora — said to contain the deadly chemical hydrogen cyanide — on Instagram.It was part of an investigation by the documentary into whether celebrities consume the products which they are paid to promote.The alacrity with which Goodger agreed to promote this fake product was alarming.Similarly worrying, to demonstrate her willingness to promote a product she had never tried, she talked about how she promoted another product, Skinny Coffee, which in January she claimed helped her lose lb in three weeks.“I never tried Skinny Coffee,” she admitted.To drive the point home, she added: “I’ve even had my own friends message me, ‘Laur, can you get me some of that Skinny Coffee, does it work ’ . . . I’m like, ‘Do you not know this by now ’ And they’re actually going and buying it and I’m like, ‘You know how this works’.”At least she is honest. When she doesn’t realise she is being recorded.By way of explanation, a representative for Goodger said: “Lauren was asked to . . . appear in an advert for a new water.“There was no mention of what the water contained before the meeting. The money on the table was quite a large sum.”Goodger herself said: “As with any audition, you people-please and say what they want to hear.“They asked me, ‘Would I promote the drink without using it ’ In the heat of the moment, I said yes and also said I hadn’t tried Skinny Coffee — in the hope of getting the job.“I would never promote anything on my Instagram that I don’t feel is right for my followers and that I haven’t used. The sit-down meeting after the audition was filmed undercover without my knowledge.”So I guess we take this to mean that had she known she was being filmed, she wouldn’t have been so up-front about the real role of an influencer.It is easy to forget that influencers are paid to promote products.Even those who start off promising to recommend only things they like are probably susceptible,the price is right. Andthat is the case, how can we believe anything is a genuine endorsement So, who can we trust  Let’s start with ourselves. Instead of handing our likes and values over to be decided by so-called influencers, we should remember our own sense of self and what we like and dislike.And let’s go back to another thing from the good old days: Trusting real friends instead of Instagram ones.FALLON SHERROCK made history this week as the first woman to beat a man at the PDC World Darts Championships.She was so surprised to beat Ted Evetts - at Alexandra Palace on Tuesday she wept tears of joy, saying: “I have proved we can play the men and we can beat them!”Fallon, , who until four years ago was a professional hairdresser, first picked up darts at the age of .She later added: “I can’t believe what I achieved. I’m so happy.I always had the game but us women have never had the opportunity to prove it.”Very true. But isn’t it mad  There is no reason why a woman can’t play darts as well as a man.But it also needs people to stop treating it like a service for plasters, reassurance and insignicant ailments.Take the man on C’s  Hours In AE who turned up at hospital with a stf neck.Issuing fines to time-wasters is the only way people will start to realise how valuable our NHS is – and how we need to treat it with the respect it deserves or risk losing it.I AM pleased the judge’s decision to impose two le sentences on “Black Cab Rapist” John Worboys could see him die behind bars.Mrs Justice Gowan handed Worboys, , a minimum term of six years for attacking four women and he will have no chance of parole before .Worboys, one of Britain’s worst sexual predators, now goes by the name John Derek Radford and has been in jail since  for abusing  other victims.It is believed he plied more than  women with drink laced with sedatives from a “rape kit” kept in his cab.The judge told him he may never be released, branding him “still dangerous”.For once, in this case le really does mean le. It is likely he will die in prison.And just think: Last year, the idiots on the Parole Board were actually going to let him out.PHOTOS of Beyonce at rapper Diddy’s th birthday party are jaw-dropping.She looked a million dollars in that dress .But also, who knew Alexis Carrington’s  Dynasty fashion was back  I guess we do now.JUSTIN Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, has been on the receiving end of some unfair bashing of late.Firstly he was accused by some of being a “leftie Remainer”. Then others called him a Tory. Obviously he can’t be both.To be called a racist by voices on the Left for defending the Chief Rabbi was outrageous.The Archbishop was criticised when he effectively backed the Chief Rabbi’s comments about the Labour leadership’s record on anti-Semitism with a tweet highlighting the “deep sense of insecurity and fear felt by many British Jews”.Welby has done some great stuff lately, including going to ebola zones against all advice.Not only that, his voice is vital at this time of year as the country needs to come together post-election and at the start of a new decade.He was right to defend the Chief Rabbi and we should come together to support him as the leader of the Church of England.It is a tad violent, but it is great.Ben Hardy plays a guy who is an expert in extreme sport parkour .I met Ben when I was on ITV’s Lorraine this week.He is a lovely man and a great actor.I ADMIRE Sharon Osborne’s honesty about what she has done to look the way she does.Namely, she has spent £, on a facelt, tummy tuck, eye lt, abdominoplasty, liposuction and Botox, breast surgery, vaginal cosmetic surgery, and lost more than lb after gastric surgery.In the past, she has said: “There’s not much I haven’t had tweaked, stretched, peeled, lasered, veneered, enhanced or removed altogether.”Live and let live, I always say.

Decades of seeing the innocent robbed of their lives while the guilty were free to grow old.Years of knowing that those who planned the slaughter were lucky recipients of one of Tony Blair’s “letters of comfort” — meaning that under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, known ­terrorists would never be prosecuted.And so got away with murder. Until this week.Mrs Justice Yip ruled in the High Court that the IRA’s John Downey was an “active participant” and “knowingly involved” in the Hyde Park slaughter.“We’ve got justice,” says Sarahjane Young, who was four years old when she watched from the window of her nursery as her -year-old father, Corporal Jeffrey Young, was blown up. “We can call John Downey what he really is at last — a terrorist ­murderer.”The images of that terrible carnage are seared into the memory of anyone old enough to remember.The broken bodies of seven dead horses strewn across the park. The crumpled row of cars destroyed by a lb nail bomb that was built to tear apart flesh and blood and ­families, designed to break hearts and lives and inflict unimaginable human misery.And the heartbreakingly smiling faces of the dead seen earlier as they posed proudly in their Household Caly unorms.Lieutenant Anthony Daly, . ­Corporal Roy Bright, . And two teenagers who were already men.Trooper Simon Tipper, , just back from his honeymoon. And ­Lance Corporal Jeffrey Young, also , whose tiny daughter Sarahjane watched her daddy ride by, and then watched him die.John Downey’s fingerprints were found on car park tickets for the vehicle containing the nail bomb. So why has it taken so long to bring the guilty man to justice Because the families of the victims were forced to take out a civil action after the courts failed them.Criminal proceedings against Downey collapsed at the Old Bailey in  because he was one of  IRA members who secretly received one of Tony Blair’s “letters of comfort”.Blair bought peace with the IRA by assuring the men of violence they were no longer wanted for crimes committed during the Troubles.It is a bitter truth that you make peace with your enemies and not your friends. But for far too long the peace brokered by Blair has seemed wickedly, unforgivably one-sided.Hundreds of IRA men were free to live their lives while it took until THIS THURSDAY for Boris Johnson to promise in the Queen’s Speech that former veterans of the British Army who served in the Troubles would finally be free from witch hunts.That Downey has been brought to book at long last is thanks to the fierce determination of the bereaved families and to the generosity of the public, including Sun readers who raised £, to help fund their cause.“I want to thank all of you,” says Mark Tipper, brother of -year-old Trooper Simon Tipper. “You have no idea what this day means to all of us. My brother can sleep easy at last.”The verdict paves the way for the families to pursue Downey— currently on remand in Northern ­Ireland for the murder of two ­soldiers at Enniskillen — for damages of up to half a million pounds. But their success is inevitably tinged with bitter regret.Because it is a shameful stain on our justice system that the families of murdered soldiers were forced to wait  long years for justice.And it is a disgrace that these families were refused legal aid four times while Downey was awarded £, of taxpayers’ money to defend himself against criminal proceedings.And it is mind-boggling — is it not  — that the Labour Party just went into a General Election led by Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell, two failed politicians who have never made any secret of their ­puerile hero worship of the IRA.McDonnell had a plaque commemorating the “martyrs” of the IRA and INLA on the wall of his constituency office.In , Corbyn caused outrage when he invited Gerry Adams and other members of Sinn Fein to Westminster when there was still blood on the streets of Brighton after the IRA bombed the Grand Hotel.If Labour is ever again going to be a serious opposition party — let alone worthy of government — then the party must never again chose leaders who have spent their careers licking the boots of terrorists.And isn’t it a national disgrace that Tony Blair never sent his “letters of comfort” to OUR boys We all love Sir Paul. But when it comes to Christmas records, give me Bing Crosby, Noddy Holder or The Pogues.In fact, give me anybody but the man who thought “simply having a wonderful Christmastime!” sums up the magic of the season.SUDDENLY the national paralysis is over.You can feel it in the air. You can see it in Boris Johnson’s grin – especially when Jeremy Corbyn is by his side.How quickly the world moves on. How suddenly the new day breaks. How abruptly a catchphrase passes its best-by date.John Bercow’s “ORDER! ORDER!” seems as quaintly ancient as Larry Grayson’s “Oooh, shut that door!” or Dick Emery’s “Oooh, you are awful – but I like you!”Bercow is reduced to bellowing “ORDER! ORDER!” to the baffled viewers of Italian TV.He has even been spied shouting his hackneyed catchphrase at his fellow travellers on a south London bus.It seems like only last week that Bercow took enormous preening delight in bellowing, “ORDER! ORDER!” at the mother of all Parliaments.Now yesterday’s Speaker is shouting it on the number  to Catford.He should have borrowed one of Ken Livingstone’s newts.IT has been a bad year for boxing when your favourite fistic moment is Kate Beckinsale demonstrating her stf right cross for Women’s Health magazine.At the start of , it seemed inevitable that Anthony Joshua, Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder would have a series of fights to match the glory days of Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier and George Foreman.They somehow all avoided each other.With the Fury-Wilder rematch allegedly about to be announced for February, perhaps  will be better for boxing.Andit’s not – well, fight fans have always got Kate Beckinsale’s right hander.AFTER Mathew Horne’s late-night trolling of the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg, I am giving the Gavin  Stacey Christmas special a miss.You can watch performers you don’t care for.For example, I can’t stand Benedict Cumberbatch – the eco-activist who advertises cars in China – but I will watch Cumberbatch in Sam Mendes’ World War One film  next year because it sounds unmissable.But Gavin, Stacey and Mathew  I can live without it.Horne tweeted: “I really wish I loved myself as much as you, Laura . . . your ‘journalism’ knows no bounds . . . Resign, you disingenuous plopcarpet.”And plenty more of the same spiteful, semi-literate garbage.It is mind-blowing how totally lost these right-on Rada revolutionaries are when someone doesn’t write them a script.And voters really, REALLY don’t like it.EVERY one of the candidates who Hugh Grant campaigned for at the General Election lost. Lib Dem, Labour, male, female, anti-Brexit or . . .  actually, they were all anti-Brexit.It didn’t work – just as Steve Coogan telling Brexit supporters that we are ignorant did not make us rush out to vote to stop Brexit.I have come to believe that luvvie endorsements are totally counter-productive.They quite literally have the opposite effect that the smug, self-important thespians hope.The public take one look at Grant and Coogan – then vote exactly the opposite way. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It will have done the main thing that it was put in power to do within two months of taking office.The danger for the Tories is that their new electoral ­coalition was held together by a desire to Get Brexit Done and fear of Jeremy Corbyn, and both of those issues will soon be resolved.As the party’s campaign director, Isaac Levido, pointed out to Tory MPs on Wednesday afternoon, Brexit and Corbyn won this election for the Tories and both of them will be gone by the time of the next ­election, so the Tories have to deliver for their new voters or risk defeat.No  is acutely ­conscious of this risk. They know they need a new glue for their coalition — and fast.At Political Cabinet on Tuesday morning, this point was rammed home to ministers by both the PM and Levido.Levido, a clear-sighted Australian, warned the assembled secretaries of state that the Tories have “not won the domestic policy fight” yet.He stressed that this election had been about Getting Brexit Done more than any other issue.Tory support among Leave voters went from  per cent in  to  per cent, and that was key to the victory.Ministers were told that the party’s polling showed the positive things voters associated with the Tories were about sorting Brexit, while the negative things about Labour were to do with Corbyn or Brexit.Levido was clear that voters were backing the Tories to finish Brexit — not because they had suddenly become Conservatives. Another danger for the Tories is that Labour’s fundamental brand is nowhere near as damaged as many at Westminster think.With Corbyn gone and Brexit removed as an issue, the party may well be able to bounce back much faster than expected.Levido pointed out that the Tories’ own polling of  marginal seats had seen the gap between the two parties narrow to just four points in the aftermath of the manestos, as Labour briefly succeeded in turning the conversation away from Brexit.Boris Johnson and the Tory campaign pushed Brexit back to the top of the agenda.Levido was clear that for this reason the election could not be seen as a categorical rejection of Labour’s policies. The challenge for the Tories is to move fast to deliver change, so that people do not feel tempted to go back to Labour again.Do this right and, over the next decade, Darlington, West Bromwich and Wrexham will become Tory heartlands. Get it wrong and these places will turn red once again.Boris told cabinet ministers that voters needed to see and feel change in their local AE and on their roads and high streets.He said there needed to be a clear reduction in homelessness and voters must know that they and their family have a better chance of owning a home. This election made the Tories a national party again.Now they must show these new voters that their cares are Conservative concerns — and that the party knows how to fix the problems. They must deliver for the whole nation.WHERE is the geographical centre of the new Tory party  Well, before the election it was Buckinghamshire.Now it is South Yorkshire, where the Tories hold three seats – Rother Valley, Don Valley and Penistone And Stocksbridge.James Cleverly, the ebullient Tory chairman, has relished telling colleagues this fact. I understand that to reflect this new reality, the Tories are planning to move a large chunk of their party headquarters up north.The thinking is that by getting a chunk of the party operation out of London and into the North, it will make the party less London-centric and more attuned to the concerns of the rest of the country.BORIS JOHNSON is determined that next year must not be as dominated by Brexit as this year has been. He told Cabinet this week that once the UK leaves the EU on January , they should stop talking about Brexit.The PM argued that while the EU would try to create new clf edges and fresh moments of drama, the Government should resist being drawn into this dynamic.He argued that ministers should instead approach it as a normal trade negotiation rather than as some epoch-defining event.I am told that as part of the Government’s effort to de-dramatise things, they intend to resist going to Brussels for every negotiation – something which only adds to the tension and drama.I understand they want negotiations on both sides of the Channel rather than the UK always looking like a supplicant in heading to Europe to be told what it can and cannot have.As part of the effort to lower the profile of these trade talks, I am informed that David Frost – Boris’s understated but effective EU sherpa – will carry on conducting the negotiations.Frost, who is trusted totally by the PM and his inner circle, secured the changes to the withdrawal agreement that made it acceptable to Tory MPs. Having Frost conduct the negotiations rather than a cabinet minister will make them less likely to dominate the news.But there is no getting away from the importance of these talks to the UK. The deal will be the first trade deal the nation has done in -odd years and will be hugely important in determining the future economic direction of this country.The Tories calculate that, for his part, Sir Keir Starmer, the strongest Shadow Cabinet advocate of a second referendum, would deepen Labour’s problem in Leave-voting seats.The only candidate currently causing some concern is Jess Phillips – regarded as the high-risk, high-reward option for Labour.But given her low standing with the Corbyn-backing membership, she is not currently looking like a top- tier candidate.WHEN two or three ministers are gathered together, they start to nervously whisper about the February reshuffle.It is expected that this reshuffle will be big and coincide with the changes to Whitehall that Boris Johnson is keen to introduce. He wants to create some new departments, merge others and even shutter some.Boris’s old allies, though, are warning against a shake-up that sees too many of them replaced.One confidant of this group tells me Boris’s new support base in the party is “a mile wide and an inch deep” and that he needs to keep close those who have been loyal to him through thick and thin.One person who is certain to be rewarded in the reshuffle is Brandon Lewis, the Security Minister.Johnson’s team were impressed by his work during the campaign and want to use him more in the media.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But it said it all. This is the Prime Minister who suddenly cares for all those working and disadvantaged ­people who never got a look in during ten years of Tory austerity. A regime in which he played a key part. One day he is making a victor’s ­triumphal tour of the conquered former Labour heartlands in the North. The next he is unpacking Christmas goodies and furniture from the billionaires’ department store – which only lets kids visit Santatheir parents spend £,. Welcome to Britain United. Not. The image sums up Johnson’s ­problem as he promises voters in ­northern towns that he will “repay your trust”. Does he understand, and will he actually, do what is necessary  Those lelong voters have heard this sort of promise before. What ever happened to the “northern powerhouse” so recently rolled out as the solution for all the left-behind communities  They got left behind and the decline there continued. Boris the convert would like us to believe that under his leadership the Conservative party has been remade, earmarking £billion for northern constituencies over five years.  It may not be enough for the size of the task ahead, particularly where transport is concerned. Buses, rail and road ­networks need creating before anything can start to regenerate the economy outside big cities. All roads literally lead to London, where public spending is already disproportionately higher. “Rebalancing” is Boris’s new mantra inside Downing Street. Failure will see voters’ precious trust falter, just as it punishingly did for Labour. As it begins the search for its own new brand and a new leader, the focus is again on the North. Already it’s clear that anybody with a chance of winning has to be a woman from the North.

The monarch once famously dubbed  her aposAnnus horribilisapos and  has been something of a re-run for the -year-old. Over the past  months, her husband Prince Philip had a police warning for his involvement in a car crash, her grandsons Princes William and Harry publicly fell out and her second son Prince Andrew got ever more entangled in his links to paedophile US financier Jeffrey Epstein. And now Philipaposs health has again come into question, after he was admitted to hospital on Friday aposfor a few daysapos.Of the year as a whole, royal biographer Penny Junor said: This is as bad as it gets for her. Twenty seven years ago the Queen used a speech at the Guildhall to describe her year as an annus horribilis. The year was wrecked by the collapse of three of her childrenaposs marriages - including Prince Charlesapos to Princess Diana - and the fire that severely damaged her Windsor Castle home. Ms Junor said: She obviously wonapost use that phrase again, but I would suspect in some ways thishas been even worse. Prince Philip car crash near Sandringham In January, Elizabethaposs -year-old husband Prince Philip was involved in a car accident near the familyaposs Sandringham estate. The Duke, , was miraculously unharmed other than a few bumps and scrapes. However he had to give up his driving licence after police gave him a warning for driving without wearing a seat belt.  Prince Andrewaposs links with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein The decision by Prince Andrew to take part in an interview with BBC Newsnight about his friendship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein backfired spectacularly. Days after the grilling in Buckingham Palace the Duke of York was sidelined from his royal role with speculation he may never do public engagements again. The father-of-two was judged to have badly handled the questions by Emily Maitlis and even refused to say his friendship with Epstein, who died this year awaiting trial for further child sex trafficking charges, was a mistake.  The Duke has vehemently denied allegations he had sex with teenager Virginia Roberts but the backlash from the interview was swt and Prince Charles, who was in New Zealand at the time, is tipped to have had a hand in his ousting from a public role. Criticism of Meghan and Harry The Queenaposs grandson Prince Harry, rumoured to be her favourite, and his we Meghan have taken strong action against the press. The couple were criticised for renovating their Frogmore Cottage home using taxpayer money and also using a private jet while speaking out on climate change.  A documentary that was supposed to highlight their work on their South Africa tour instead focused on perceived negative media coverage of the couple and particularly of Meghan, who gave birth to her first son Archie in May. Meghan spoke on the documentary about the intense toll the unfair media coverage has taken on her well-being. Harry also spoke about his mental health struggles. I thought I was out of the woods and then suddenly it all came back, and then suddenly I realized no, this is something that I have to manage, Harry said.  Part of this job, and part of any job like everybody, means putting on a brave face and turning a cheek to a lot of the stuff. But again, for me and for my we, of course there’s a lot of stuff that hurts, especially when the majority of it is untrue. Rumours of a rt between brothers Harry and William Gossip from royal insiders continued to suggest throughout  that a rt had developed between Prince William and his brother Prince Harry. In that same documentary on the Sussexaposs tour of South Africa Harry was asked directly about them and didnapost deny it out of hand.  Part of this role and part of this job and this family, being under the pressure that it’s under — inevitably, you know, stuff happens. But look, we’re brothers, we’ll always be brothers, he said. We’re certainly on dferent paths at the moment, but I’ll always be there for him and as I know he’ll always be there for me. We donapost see each other as much as we used to because we’re so busy, but, you know, I love him dearly and the majority of the stuff is probably — well the majority of the stuff is created out of nothing. As brothers, you know, you have good days, you have bad days. Queen dragged into political row The Queen herself was embroiled in political wrangling over Britainaposs exit from the European Union, with her suspension of parliament in September at the behest of Prime Minister Boris Johnson ruled unlawful by the countryaposs top court. The royal family always go to great s to keep themselves away from the political arena but the Queen, unwittingly, played a part in the autumn Brexit fiasco with the Supreme Court judging that she was lied to about the reasons for prorogation.  Royal historian Robert Lacey said Septemberaposs Supreme Court ruling was more signicant than Prince Andrewaposs interview with it possibly heralding the end of the monarchyaposs few remaining prerogative powers and posing questions about its future constitutional role. It could reduce the monarch to an essentially ceremonial and charitable role, he said. The new involvement of the Supreme Court doesnapost question the existence of the monarchy - yet. Butcertain decisions and prerogatives are going to be controlled or taken away, then what has the prime minister got to go to speak to the queen about each week  Queen rises above scandals Most people will look upon  as not a particularly good year for the institution but the Queen came out pretty well, said Dickie Arbiter, Elizabethaposs press secretary from  to . The monarchy has evolved over , years. It has had all sorts of circumstances running against it, but it has survived. It survived , it survived the abdication of, it survived .  Some have gone as far as saying the family could eventually emerge even stronger - and that this yearaposs traumas could lay the foundations of a new slimmed-down monarchy, a long-term aim of future king Prince Charles. Royal historian Robert Lacey said: Itaposs a tragedy in a way, but it is a plus to see Charles playing a positive role in events. After  years, Charles is finally getting his way. One of those whose support they can count on is the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, spiritual leader of the worldaposs  million Anglicans.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBeaming Bonnie Windels, born weighing less than a tub of Quality Street, is in the pink and set for the sweetest of Christmases. The little cutie is one today – a miracle in itself after she arrived in the world tipping the scales at just g – lb oz. Parents Leah and Siegfried were braced for the worst when Bonnie was born at  weeks. Leah , says: “I honestly didn’t knowwe’d see this day. When I went into labour the doctors talked to me about my next pregnancy. It was clear they had no hope. “But here she is now, sitting up, babbling and laughing, with no idea how close we came to losing her.” Former social media manager Leah was determined to keep her baby inside for as long as possible after feeling her membranes bulging at home. Admitted to hospital, she dropped the head of her hospital bed down the moment medics were out of the room to use gravity to keep Bonnie in. She lay reclined in what is known as the Trendelenburg position. Leah, from Portslade, Brighton, says: “I wasn’t having contractions or pain, but I could feel pressure down there and sensed whatever had gone wrong with my pregnancy, it was purely mechanical.” Against doctor’s advice, and at the risk of developing blood clots, Leah spent a week on bed rest to give her little girl a fighting chance of survival at birth. In the UK, the age of viability is  weeks – the same as the abortion limit. Before then, doctors are not legally obliged to help premature babies as the damage to their little bodies is said to be too great, with chances of survival slim. The chance of a -week-old baby surviving outside the womb without brain damage, physical or developmental problems is just  per cent. But Leah was determined to protect her baby, who had been perfectly healthy at a scan two weeks earlier. And at pm each day, she and Siegfried high-fived to celebrate another  hours that she had staved off labour. Leah was given steroids to help the baby’s lungs and magnesium sulphate to protect her brain. Bonnie was delivered a week after Leah was admitted to hospital – just two days before viability.  Her eyes were still fused shut and her delicate, paper-thin skin was translucent. Leah recalls: “She breathed on her own for two minutes before stopping, so the team took her across the room to resuscitate her. But first they had to wait to seeshe’d survive a further minute on her own. “It was the longest, most agonising  seconds of my le. We’d agreed with doctors we wanted them to help herthey could, but acceptedshe was suffering we’d give comfort care and simply hold her until nature took its course.” Swaddled in a plastic bag and bubble wrap to keep her warm, tiny Bonnie fought through the next few days.  On Christmas Day, the NICU staff made ink footprints of her feet and presented Leah and Siegfried, , with a Reindeer Christmas card. It struck a chord with Leah, who adds: “We’d seen how tiny Bonnie was, like a tiny little bird in her incubator, but seeing that card really drove home what a miracle it was that she was still alive.” The couple spent Christmas watching over Bonnie in the NICU at the Royal Sussex Hospital, Brighton, while relatives looked after their son Teddy, then  months old. Bonnie was too fragile to hold but Leah found joy in giving her drops of water on the end of a cotton bud and applying gentle pressure on her head and tummy to simulate the feeling of being in the womb. It is known as “containment holding.”  But there were still concerns. Bonnie developed retinopathy and had surgery at eight weeks to save her sight. She also had chronic lung disease due to prolonged oxygen support and needed blood transfusions after developing an infection. Her oxygen also dipped to just six percent at times, leaving her floppy, blue and moments from death. Leah and Siegfried were told several times to prepare for the worst. But Leah says: “Every time things got hairy, Bonnie pulled through. From the start, she fought the nurses whenever they adjusted her oxygen mask, batting them away with her little arms, and many of them remarked what a little fighter she was.” It was a month before mum and baby had their first cuddle. Bonnie was finally discharged a week before her original due date of April . Fast forward eight months and she is now a happy and entirely healthy lb.  Leah says: “Last Christmas we were scouring the news for articles about ‘preemies’ who had made it against the odds and hoping against hope that we would be one of the lucky ones. “I hope mums and dads will find Bonnie inspiring and keep faith in the medical staff and their preemies’ will to fight, even on the toughest days.” Siegfried echoes Leah’s sentiments – while recalling the nightmare first days of Bonnie’s le. He says: “It was a dark time. We could only sit, watch and hope she would pull through. “I felt powerless but, above all, I wanted to be there for her so she could feel her daddy’s presence and know she was loved. “The worst part was the unknown. Would she live or die, what kind of quality of le would she have  Trying to maintain a normal le for our son and work was close to impossible, but you can’t just crack when you’re a dad. “When I first saw Bonnie, I could barely comprehend how small she was and wanted to give her everything in le. We’ll spend Christmas Day with aunties and grandparents who plan a day of spoiling her with gts, kisses and pinching those cheeks!” "},{"url":null,"title":"boozed up brits take streets","story":"NewsBoozed-up Brits take to streets as -million pints are sunk in giant knees-upBrits are expected to sink around million pints over the weekend - and the traditional Mad Friday was no silent night for paramedics across the UKShareByScarlet Howes:,  DEC NewsA group of women enjoy a night out in Cardf \" to FREE daily email alerts from mirror - daily newsSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

She was one of thousands across Britain who got pie-eyed on the annual knees up. In Blackpool, a sozzled Santa is slumped in a doorway, while a Christmas turkey struggles to walk in Manchester. Some people were crackers enough to go out in the cold wrapped in very little at all as two women don red dresses and Santa hats in Cardf. Elsewhere, one group of lads in Leeds are the picture of knit-mas as they wear matching suits covered in snowflakes and Christmas trees. We are expected to sink around  million pints over the weekend. And the traditionally messy start of Yuletide fun - also known as Mad Friday - was no silent night for paramedics as some overdid the festive cheer. And as government cuts leave emergency services overstretched it falls to Street Angels to patrol the streets and help stricken revellers - including a woman who had cut herself falling down the stairs of a club and a man who had been hit by a car. He said: “People are f***ing mad tonight.”He added: “Plus it costs the NHS £ to call an ambulance. “If we can stop ambulances being called we are helping save cash.” Street Angels volunteers ease the strain on the NHS on one of the busiest nights of the year for drink-related injuries. There are over  Street Angels projects in the UK, part of the Christian Nightle Initiative founded by Paul and Jean Blakey. Volunteers are first-aiders and partner with door staff, local authorities and NHS to create a “safety network”, staying in touch via radio.  Volunteer Stuart Robertshaw, , one of the eight on patrol in Leeds, West Yorks, told our reporter: “For me I have a -year-old daughter so I would hope someone would be looking out for her.” As the Sunday Mirror join them for their sht at .pm, Paul, , tells us: “It gets crazy as you have all sorts of people coming out tonight. “We deal more with vulnerability and incidents that police wouldn’t want to spend time involved in. “In any town or city centre when it’s busy we’re part of a family helping the emergency services cope with the cuts.”  “They save lives,” says bouncer Francisco Gomez, , at Brooklyn Bar. Groups of partygoers huddle together outside one club, downing shop bought booze while pals scream: “Chug, chug, chug.” People are slumped over, unable to make their way home, some vomiting. A woman using a phone box to hold her up shouts at one hapless team to “f*** off” when they try to assist her into a taxi.  But after encouraging her to drink water and calm down they safely get her home. Chief Inspector Lorna McEwan, of Leeds British Transport Police, said: “The Angels really help us. “They will deal with the people that don’t need urgent attention so it saves us dealing with them and doesnapost waste our resources.  But it wasn’t all festive fun. A male police officer was knocked unconscious and his female colleague dragged to the floor and stamped on as they tried to break up a boozy brawl in Manchester. The revellers fled from the scene and no arrests have been made. And back in Leeds a woman spits in the face of a doorman after being refused entry and one lad picks up a metal barrier and throws it at police.

In England last year  kids under two had at least one rotten tooth pulled, according to NHS Digital figures. And nearly , children aged from two to  had one removed – while  kids aged nine or under had all their teeth out last year. In total across England , patients had the procedure. The British Dental Association is worried some children are not getting their free checks as their parents do not go to the dentist – and do not take their kids either. An estimated one in five adults put off seeing a dentist because of the £. charge for a visit. The BDA said childrens’ lack of attendance puts more pressure on the NHS. There are also fears some parents are putting fizzy drinks and sugary milkshakes into babies’ bottles causing their teeth to rot. Dentist Lauren Harrhy, from Pontypool, Torfaen, revealed: “I’ve seen a ­two-year-old having to have nearly all of his teeth taken out – it’s quite distressing.” She urged parents not to put sugary drinks into babies’ bottles and pile sugar on fruit as it can be such a challenge to persuade children to clean their teeth. She said: “It still happens, not as much coke, but we do see it.  “But lots of people say: ‘I thought I’d put a bit of milkshake in because they like it’, but milkshake is as sugary as coke.” NHS chiefs in Wales rolled out the Designed to Smile scheme in  in nurseries and schools in some of the most deprived communities.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe days leading up to Christmas involve a flurry of activity, excitement and,we’re lucky, snow. But the festive season often attracts an unwanted guest – stress. One in ten Brits struggles to cope, according to mental health charity Mind. With gts to buy, family to entertain and money worries, stress can soar, bringing physical and emotional symptoms as well as changes in your behaviour. You might suffer headaches , dizziness, high blood pressure , tummy trouble, sexual problems, muscle tension or pain. You may also find it hard to concentrate or feel overwhelmed. Here are five ways to stop festive stress getting to you.  Ditch perfection There can be an overwhelming expectation that every minute should be a special time, with unrealistic ideals making you feel everything has to be just so. Let go of perfectionism and accept you can’t do it all. Try to be ­flexible with your expectations of yourself, others and Christmas itself. Budget Overspending and dreading January’s credit card bills increases pressure. Help take the strain off your pocket and mental health by setting realistic budgets for everything from presents to food and decor. Talk to your loved ones about your financial worries and you’ll probably find many are in the same boat. Consider Secret Santa gt swapping and, in larger families, buying only for the children.  Shop, don’t drop Christmas shopping can ­consume too much of our time and head space. Ann Heathcote, of the Worsley Centre for Psychotherapy and Counselling, says ­endless scrolling to find the perfect gt can ­trigger stress, resulting in physical symptoms such as high blood pressure. Don’t spend too much time internet shopping as this often leads to hours of browsing with minimal . Instead write a list of names you need to buy for and brainstorm things they like, to help you visualise their interests and inspire well-matched gts. Then you will be ready to look in store or online.  Accept help You may experience an ­exaggerated feeling of ­responsibility in the festive ­season, with women often doing the lion’s share of tasks. Don’t cater to the whole ­family’s needs on your own. Share out jobs. Lighten your load wherever you can so you don’t end up burning out. There’s also no shame in buying the same gt for multiple people.Perspective Remember, nothing is an emergency when it comes to celeb­rating Christmas. Nothing will spoil your day unless you allow it to because it is, ­after all, only  hours of your le. Stop and breathe ­whenever stress threatens to overwhelm you and remember what Christmas is truly about.

The couple have always been very tactile but their touch and eye contact rituals show no sign of diminishing, meaning their body language rituals seem to place them in an on-going ‘Honeymoon phase’ of their relationship. This means they appear to want to illustrate and act out their love in public. This is the kind of exclusivity and intimacy rituals that can make other people feel excluded around them. It’s hard to see how a couple so openly in love could cause any offence but presumably the dinner party set expect open and active sociability rather than a couple appearing to send affectionate tie-signs to one another that suggest they are carrying on some secret and often flirty silent conversations in public. aposFlirty and playful Meghan’s few appearances since Archie was born seem to register an increase of these intimacy ‘in love’ signals that involve even more mutual eye-gazing and celebratory smiles to suggest their relationship has intensied with their new role as parents. In this photothese very flirty and playful signals show a mutually tactile couple keen to share jokes and silent communication. Harry looks very protective here and Meghan flatters him by looking down and laughing as they wind their arms round one another’s waists and lean in together. aposBonding and touch are important, especially to Meghanapos  This pose suggests a more open sociability, with both smiling outward and looking relaxed. These smiles look prompted by the cameras and audience rather than just one another, which would normally be a stage a couple deeply in love would go through as they move out of the obsessional, passionate stage and into something more relaxed, happy and confident. The entwined hands show how important bonding and touch are to the couple, especially to Meghan, who placed her right hand onto their clasped hands to make the loving connection gesture even more emphatic. aposThey are lost to the worldapos  In this image Harry and Meghan turned this simple, congratulatory kiss at polo into a romantic and intimate moment. Meghan threw her head back, baring her neck and the couple used mutual eye gaze to suggest they were lost to the world at that moment. This could have just been a smiling kiss on the cheek but the couple appeared to want to use the moment to reinforce their love for one another. aposTheir bonds are stronger than everaposIn both these photos there’s no change in their tie-signs now Archie has been born, with the linked hands and the excited-looking smiles suggesting their bonds might be stronger than ever. The romance comes from the way Harry gazes adoringly at Meghan and their pinging smiles seem to bounce off one another. aposMeghan gazing up adoringly at Harryapos "},{"url":null,"title":"health games casino offer promotion","story":"Advertorial£ bonus offer from Health Games casino - with £million jackpots to be wonHave fun and give back to charities across the UK playing more than  exciting gamesShareByDave Masters:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Advertorial\" to FREE daily email alerts from mirror - daily newsSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Every detail of the Duke of Edinburghaposs le had been scheduled, monitored and directed. Under constant scrutiny as the husband of Queen Elizabeth II, his le has been dedicated to public service. But since the Duke of Edinburgh withdrew from public le two and a half years ago, he has become somewhat of a recluse, shutting himself away in a farmhouse. He lives alone in Wood Farm on Sandringham estate after transforming it into a private retreat. There he enjoys his time tucked away from the other royals, reading, painting watercolours and having friends to stay. A friend of the royal said the Queen feels the Duke has earned himself a ‘proper retirement’ after being aposon dutyapos since the pair married in .They told the Daily Mail : “She knows him too well —he was still at the centre of royal le he’d feel he had to be involved. “Being at Wood Farm means he’s not too far away, but far enough to be able to relax.” However, the Prince has suffered a few setbacks after he narrowly escaped a car crash in January.  Despite escaping the collision unscathed - when his Land Rover Freelander flipped after hitting a vehicle carrying two women and a baby - it has impacted him in other ways. Days after the incident, he jumped straight back behind the wheel but was forced to give up his driving freedoms after a public outcry. Now he can only drive alone around the royal estates but must be accompanied by a driver everywhere . A courtier said: It meanshe wants to go anywhere he is dependent on somebody , and things canapost be as spontaneous as he likes. Unsurprisingly, the -year-old has outlived may of his peers and spends a lot of time alone.Of late, his most consistent visitor outside of the royal family is Penny Countess Mountbatten, the estranged we of Earl Mountbatten."},{"url":null,"title":"huge royal rule george charlotte","story":"NewsHuge royal rule George, Charlotte and Louis will probably break on Christmas DayKate Middleton shed some light on the Royal Family tradition that her kidsShareCommentsByZoe ForseyLestyle Editor:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video british-royals-arrive-buckingham-palace-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news huge-royal-rule-george-charlotte-\"\" to FREE daily email alerts from mirror - Royal FamilySubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Christmas dinner cost the average person between £. and £. last year, according to Good Housekeeping. But Karen Eaton, who puts together  Christmas hampers for those in need in Birmingham, West Midlands, has found that the festive meal doesnapost need to be that expensive. According to Karen, who makes the hampers as part of her voluntary work for The Christmas Lunch Project, you shop around for bargains you can whittle down the cost of the meal, Birmingham Live reports. She said: It depends on your circumstances but Iaposd sayyou can, club together with friends as itaposs cheaper to share the cost and nicer than spending Christmas on your own.  Lots of supermarkets discount their products in the months leading up to Christmas. So Iaposll buy cranberry sauce and a box of chocolates when theyaposre on offer and put them away for Christmas Day. That helps to spread the cost too. The mum-of-one said: You could cook chicken drumsticks to make it cheaper or,you really want turkey, you can buy turkey drumsticks from Tesco for around £ each. I had one with my son and there was enough meat on one for both of us.  If youaposre cooking for a small number of people, buy your fresh vegetables from an outdoor market. The market traders will happily weigh just a couple of carrots and potatoes for you to save you having to buy a whole bag at the supermarket. Iaposd pick up a stuffing mix and gravy granules from somewhere like Aldi or Lidl because they only cost around p. Or,you donapost want to buy gravy, you can just mix a little cornflour into your meat juices to make your own gravy.  She added: Youaposre never going to find a cheap Christmas pudding so Iaposd buy some mince pies and serve them warm with some cream or custard. Or, better still, buy a jar of mincemeat and some ready made pastry and make your own. For a starter, Iaposd look out for when one of the tasty soup cartons, like New Covent Garden, is on offer and buy a couple of cartons and put them in the freezer. One carton tends to serve two to three people. Utilising your freezer really helps. I donapost believe you have to eat cheapyou always look out for the bargains and offers.

Reboots of classic kids’ favourites are shouting out to ­sentimental parents from shop shelves – and the Furby has come back to claim the No spot. The computerised critter, who has had a refurb to bring him bang up to date for the s, is priced at £. But a mint and boxed original from the s could set you back £. Other re-releases include Polly Pockets. The dolls may be tiny but they’re making BIG money, with sales up  per cent. Toy expert Peter Jenkinson said: “There’s a real revival of all things retro right now and we’re seeing classic toys are gaining popularity alongside more ­modern offerings.” Here are the top  toys enjoying a Christmas comeback.... Furby, RRP £ More than  million of the cute fur balls were sold after they were first launched in . The updated version has LED eyes and can connect to an app, where you can hatch virtual babies.. My Little Pony, £These little plastic equines first galloped onto the market in  - and they’re still hot to trot. There’s a MLP telly show and a movie to get kids giddy. And there’s even a group of adult fans, who love to party dressed as ponies.. Polly Pocket, £ Known as Barbie’s little cousin, the weeny dolls were originally made by Bluebird Toy. But Mattel has brought them back and they’re enjoying huge success.. Rubik’s Cube, £ This boxy brainteaser is a toy shop staple, with more than million sold since it was launched  years ago. But sales are on the up now that cubing has become cool again.. Spirograph, £ This was originally invented in  as a pattern-making machine to help stop bank note forgery. It was launched as a toy in  and sales prove there are still hours of fun to be had with this creative kit.  . Sticklebricks, £ These colourful, bristly bricks were first launched in . Judging by their popularity, it’s fair to say they’ll be stickling around for a whole lot longer.. Crayola, £ Just a simple set of crayons, but Crayola’s rainbow of colours always brighten up grey winter days and they are still a massive draw.. Retro Mini Arcades, £. Who needs a PS  You can get everything from Pac-Man and Street Fighter to Asteroids and Space Invaders on these mini arcades. They are the cool thing to have in your home – evenyou don’t have kids.. Stretch Armstrong, £ This gel-filled, latex body-builder was originally designed to have springs inside to make him stretch – but a corn-syrup mix became his muscle mass of choice in the s. Stretch him up to four times his size and he boings back.. Tree Tots, now called Timber Tots, £.

They are bracing themselves for a dramatic rise in raisin poisoning this Christmas after the number treated last year soared. Vets Now, which runs a network of pet emergency hospitals and clinics, is ­reminding owners that ­raisins are toxic to dogs. They can cause sickness, diarrhoea and potentially fatal kidney failure. Laura Playforth, a director at Vets Now, said: “Our vets and vet nurses treated ­dozens of dogs last year who had eaten mince pies left out for Santa and we are expecting similar this year. “That’s why it’s important to raise awareness that the raisins in mince pies are toxic to dogs.” Their Telford branch treated several pie-munching pooches in three hectic hours last Christmas Day. One was three-year-old cockapoo Ernie, who swiped a mince pie left under the Christmas tree for Santa – as well as the carrot left out for the reindeer. While the carrot did him no harm at all, the pie made him badly sick overnight. Owner and mother-of-two Jodie Holt, , a nurse, said: “As soon as I saw the mince pie had gone, I started googling it and saw how dangerous raisins are. Ernie’s not normally a scavenger so when he was poorly it never occurred to me it was because he’d been downstairs in the night and eaten Santa’s mince pie. “Vets made Ernie sick to get rid of any raisins in his stomach before giving him activated charcoal to ­absorb the toxins. “I’ll be making sure Santa gets the pie this year and Ernie goes nowhere near it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"struggling family universal credit left","story":"NewsStruggling family on Universal Credit left with sandwiches for Christmas dinnerNeil Campbell and Jo Holbrook-Morris run a community farm in Grimsby, Lincolnshire, but after feeding the animals with little support and being crippled by Universal Credit, theyre left strugglingShareCommentsByBradley JollyOnline journalistConnor Lynch:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video what-is-universal-credit-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news struggling-family-universal-credit-left-\"\" to FREE daily email alerts from mirror - daily newsSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Neil Campbell and Jo Holbrook-Morris, and their two young kids have been left with just £ a week to live on with Universal Credit .And after mortgage payments, bills, food, clothes and other expenses, they are left with barely any money. Grimsby Live reports they also run a community farm with little support and also have to pay for feed for their animals, including donkeys, pigs and chickens.At the moment we are really struggling, we have put everything that we had into setting up the farm, but due to the delays that we have had with planning, we have been forced onto Universal Credit, Neil said today.Are you a struggling family facing severe poverty  Contact webnews@trinitymirrorThe thing is, the community have really rallied around the farm and embraced it as their own, so we feel that we have to keep things going for them, in the hope that some day we can turn things around. Because we were initially told that our planning application would take just eight weeks, we were given assurances that we could invest in the farm, and then once we did, the application was delayed indefinitely, putting us where we are at the moment. We have had senior officers from the council come to the farm, including the chief executive Rob Walsh, showing it to people as an example of positive work going on the community, because we are helping children from Phoenix House and guiding them in a positive direction to turn their lives around. We have one kid who volunteers there who has given up on earning £ a day drug dealing, because they would rather spend their time looking after and caring for our animals.  The Tory-controlled council insists it is trying to help the struggling family. A hold up in a planning application to expand Nunnyaposs Farm - which would allow it to run as a business and open to the public - means the couple have been unable to unlock grants which have already been approved. A year ago Neil and Jo say they were told the planning application would take just eight weeks by the previous council administration, only for it to now be delayed indefinitely. As a result the couple have had to use their own money to keep the farm running. The couple previously worked in the prison system together for  years, where they saved up money with the goal of setting up a community farm in Grimsby. They now have  animals including donkeys, sheep, pigs, goats and chickens. The Universal Credit is a monthly payment to help with your living costs. You may be able to get ityou’re on a low income or out of work. Universal Credit will encompass all of the following benefits:Child Tax Credit Housing Benefit Income Support income-based Jobseeker’s Allowanceincome-related Employment and Support AllowanceWorking Tax Credit  Jo said that while they have made sure that their kids have presents this Christmas, she and Neil will be going without anything, as they just do not have the money. They have been on Universal Credit since June. She said: Now we know what it is like to live on nothing, we have got used to going without. We have sold everything that we can possibly sell to keep ourselves going, but we just donapost know how long we can last like this. At the minute, it looks like we will just be having sandwiches this Christmas, because we canapost afford anything  after making sure that our kids have presents and are well cared for.  Neil said that Centre, who manage the site where the Nunnyaposs Farm is based, have been working hard to address the planning problem. He said: We canapost walk away from the farm now after everything that we have put into it, it just wouldnapost be fair on the community who have embraced us with open arms and ourselves. I just hope that we can get this sorted soon, so that we can get the Nunnyaposs Farm properly up and running. The problem with the application developed after Sport England objected to the expansion as the land where the farm is based was included in the councilaposs playing field strategy. A similar piece of land would have to be found to replace this in the future playing pitch strategy before the objection is lted. Because of this, Neil and Jo have not been able to use grant funding that they have ring fenced for projects, and cannot fully open up the farm to the public.

Stewart, , said there is a problem with the visa application process. Itaposs taken an entire decade, despite the fact that sheaposs settled here and is completing her schooling here, he added. Bota, who has been given an unconditional offer to study at Edinburgh Napier University and a conditional offer from the University of Edinburgh, has a biometric residence permit and is halfway through a long residence, which takes  years before she can apply for settled status. The family claims fees at Edinburgh Napier University are about £, per year, with fees at University of Edinburgh costing more than £,. Bota said: It’s really disappointing that I can’t be as excited as other pupils getting their offers back. It’s a shame. “I’ve worked just as hard and can’t follow the career I want to do. My mum’s really upset as well. She wants the best education and career for me but it’s just backfired – everybody’s stressed out. “All my predicted grades are As and Bs, so the exams shouldn’t be a problem. I try my best.”  Stewart said he has spoken to the universities in terms of overturning the decision to class Bota as an international student but it seems to be quite black and white. The family are now hopeful Bota will get accepted for a scholarship and are looking for political support.

One neighbour said the windy blast was like a plane taking off as it tore through Chertsey and Shepperton. Images posted on social media at around .am show trees strewn across the road. Runnymede Police said officers received numerous reports of trees down in Chertsey and the rest of the borough, Surrey Live reports . Tracy Bramley, who was sitting in her car when the tornado struck, said: We’ve got a hole in our roof. It lasted less than a minute, it just started to gradually build. I was sat in my car at the time, it all changed really quickly, it started to whip up, I could feel my car beginning to rock a bit, it just came a bit out of nowhere really. At the end of the day nobody is hurt, it can all be repaired. Paula Webb, who lives in the affected area, said: All I can remember is it was really heavy rain, I looked outside and it was so dark, it sounded almost like it was a plane taking off, you could see the trees were literally bent over. It was over in seconds, I could just see tiles off roofs and all the fencing down. Neighbour Jo Mason said: It’s dented the bonnet of my new car, so not happy! I have got loads of dents on the bonnet. We were walking the dogs, when we came back the neighbours said ‘we’ve had a tornado’.  It’s gone down Bittams Lane by the looks of it, it’s a bit of excitement. Tim Readings, assistant group commander and incident commander at Surrey Fire and Rescue, said: We got called here at about .am to a report of a tornado. There are in excess of  houses with damaged roofs and  private cars that have been damaged by falling tiles. There are fences and trees down. We are using two aerial appliances, one from Leatherhead and one from Guildford, and firefighters from ious stations to make it safe and remove any dangerous tiles and support residents, because obviously this has happened right before Christmas so we are doing everything we can.  The residents have been great, very supportive. A police statement says: Please respect road closures to allow our partners to clear them stay aware of possible further trees falling drive carefully.  Chris Thornton, who lives in a cul de sac next to Bittams Lane, said: Initially it was just like this, a normal, calm day, but then out of nowhere there was this rushing noise that developed into a roaring noise. I looked out the window and there was rain going past horizontally and it only lasted for about a minute or so.

He is one who will be here for a while. We will get it sorted soon.“Fin is in the team because he deserves to play. That’s why he has played the majority of our games this season, it’s because he has been excellent.“He has made  appearances and most of them have been starts. For someone so young, I think he holds his own on the pitch and controls the game at times.“There is a lot to him that’s to like. He gives us a balance. Fin will sit there and break things up.“He has been great for us from day one and is very consistent.“He is going to have a really good career.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/12/Arsalan-Haider-423x564.jpg ","title":"cctv images show the moment customer tackled crook in dundee newsagents","story":"Shocking CCTV images show the moment a crook robbed a city newsagents – and police have revealed they are following a positive line of inquiry into the attempted heist.A Dundee shopkeeper has praised a have-a-go-hero customer who tackled a man brandishing a weapon inside the store.Arsalan Haider, Court Street News manager, released images this week of the incident which police are still investigating.Pictures show the customer #hugging# the man after he had reportedly swung wildly at the -year-old shopkeeper in a fit of rage after demanding cash.Police confirmed they are following a #positive line of inquiry# into the incident which took place on Wednesday December .Arsalan said the woman was a regular customer before thanking her today for her actions during the disturbance which took place shortly after pm that day.Describing the incident he said the man had used a metal frame from a chewing gum stand at the front counter before the customer intervened.He added: #If that customer hadn#t have been here it could have got worse # she massively defused the situation by taking the man outside.#I#d pushed the panic alarm during the incident before he fled the scene.

defeat at Pittodrie earlier this season.Moments later Cosgrove shot wide from eight yards at the far post after Niall McGinn picked the prolic striker out with a free kick.In the th minute Lewis was called into action when ing low to block a  yard drive from Olivier Ntcham.Celtic were completely dominating against a Dons side who on the rare occasion they got possession struggled to retain it as there were limited out balls.Against the run of play Aberdeen equalised when Niall McGinn crossed into the box from the right and COSGROVE rose high above the Celtic defence to nod home into the top corner from eight yards for his th goal of the season.It was a quality goal from Aberdeen both in the set up and execution.Celtic claimed for a penalty soon after when Edouard went down in the box but James Wilson looked to have won the ball when tackling.In the th minute Callum McGregor fired in a -yard drive but keeper Lewis easily saved.Aberdeen were still primarily defending and hitting on the break but looked far more comfortable in the aftermath of the opener.However, the league leaders regained the lead when Christie fed in EDOUARD who raced in front of Taylor and fired a low shot beyond Lewis in the th minute.Aberdeen#s hopes of salvaging something from Parkhead suffered another heavy blow when Cosgrove was given a straight red card for a challenge on Ajer who had seconds earlier produced a perfectly-timed tackle on Jon Gallagher to win the ball.Cosgrove slid into the tackle and appeared to win the ball.As Cosgrove went to leave the pitch after being dismissed, Celtic skipper Scott Brown got involved and wound up the striker, who pushed him away.Aberdeen: Lewis, Logan, Considine, McKenna, McGInn, Taylor, Cosgrove, FergusonSubs: McLennan , Gallagher , Main .Subs not used: Cerny, Devlin,  Hedges, Campbell.CELTIC: Forster, Jullien, Brown, Christie, Ntcham, Edouard, Bolingoli, Frimpong, Ajer, McGregor, Forrest.Subs: Johnston , Grfiths , Rogic Subs not used:  Gordon, Taylor, Bitton, Issouf Bayo,Referee: Euan Anderson"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor november 1 2019","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,It is time for Remembrance again and many people will be wearing a red poppy in support of the allied servicemen and women who suffered during the last century.White poppies have been on sale since  to support and remember all victims of all wars, be they civilian or military and regardless of race or gender. Funds raised go towards the peace building work of the Peace Pledge Union, who are unashamedly against wars and the causes of wars.On Tuesday November  and Thursday November  we will be selling white poppies from the foyer of the Lochgilphead Co-op.Bob Dixon, MinardSir,I agree with the points made by Robert MacIntyre in last week#s edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser, when he says that the proposed education cuts are #madness#.This madness is being forced on councils by the SNP government and its Green Party allies at Holyrood, who for years have been voting for Scottish Government budgets which force councils to make cuts.Unless the SNP and the Greens change course and stop cutting the money they give to councils, this madness will continue.I hope that Mr MacIntyre, a former SNP councillor, will write to the leaders of the SNP and the Greens and demand they give councils enough money to stop these mad cuts.Councillor Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll and ButeDear AileenWe are responding to your recent consultation about the council budget.Whilst we are very sympathetic to the dficulties that all public bodies, including the Scottish Government, have faced as a result of a decade of austerity it is only fair to point out that this was imposed not by the Scottish Parliament, but by Westminster.The truth is that overall the Scottish Government has maintained the overall funding for local government, as a share of the overall budget, at around  per cent.Councils have, once again, the option of raising additional funds by increasing the council tax, something they have sought for a long while.The inidual share of the total funding allocated to councils is decided by COSLA, using a needs-based formula. Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhy is it so hard to negotiate the modern world That is the question asked by Dame Helen Mirren in the Radio Times.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each. Also the bands sold tickets along with their merchandise to give an extra £ approx to the cause.

Well done to all who were there and supported the whole event.Dan and crew, Mojo organisersSir,Among the many concerns caused by you-know-what is the very real fear that hospitals and high street pharmacies will run out of vital medical supplies which would normally arrive from factories in Malta, Hungary and Poland.So why are generic medicines not made in Lochgilphead, in Campbeltown and in Rothesay  After all, calcium supplement tablets are made in Galashiels by a Japanese brewery company.Glasgow Health Board built a brand new wee factory on the Western Infirmary Glasgow University campus  years to manufacture some but not all of their requirements. Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters human impact on climate change then and now","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHuman activity from the industrial revolution onwards is causing global warming which,not halted, will have catastrophic consequences.Now scientists suggest that human activity several centuries earlier also caused climate change*.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban.

The games were well contested, and the Argyll boys could have won both games. Two lapses of concentration against Lomond let them in for easy tries and only two points separated the teams in the Shawlands game at the end, when SAS had been in the lead for large parts of the match.The whole team thought it was important to finish the group with a good home win.The boys set out their stall early at MacRae Park when a contested ruck ended with a good turnover from SAS number seven McLean and a great pass out to winger Gritten from number eight McColl-Smith, who then released MacKay. The full back ran  yards to score under the posts and then convert his own try.SAS were next on the score sheet when Captain Donald Self went over the whitewash. MacKay converted and SAS were  –  up.Some good play from both teams was making for a great game, enjoyed by a large home crowd. Pupils were given the chance to watch the game and they made their voices heard and, spurred on by the crowd, Euan MacArthur was next on the score sheet and once again MacKay converted the try.The first half finished - to the home team.The second half started with Boclair coming back at SAS and, after some good running, they pulled a try back.SAS found themselves under sustained pressure and soon Boclair had a second try. Only one try was converted, and the score was -. Another try, this one converted, for Boclair and the pressure was really on.South Argyll thought they had secured the game when Ellis went over and grounded the ball only to realise he had gone over the dead ball line. No try and the pressure was on again. Minutes later, after some great forward work to turn the ball over, McArthur again went over for South Argyll#s fourth try. Another two points from MacKay made the score -.After the restart Boclair went all out to get another score. Great defensive work from the SA backs kept Boclair out for a sustained period of attack until, with only seconds to go, the scored their fourth try.As the conversion attempt fell short the final whistle blew and South Argyll celebrated a hard-fought win.While South Argyll didn not get out of the group stages they can be very pleased with third place,only one point behind second spot."},{"url":null,"title":"a garden of festive delight","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNot your common or garden evening of entertainment, a special festive concert will be held next week near Minard.Friends of Crarae will present their annual carol concert at Crarae Garden on Thursday December .The evening will feature Cumlodden choir and guests and the audience is welcome to sing along.Festive refreshments and a raffle will be available at the concert, which opens at .pm for a .pm start.Tickets will cost £ on the door, and the National Trust for Scotland shop will be open for those last-minute gts."},{"url":null,"title":"an ardrishaig piano recital to remember","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSaturday November  was a cold and frosty day and, whilst the audience had the luxury of warm hats and coats to fend off the chill of a  degrees centigrade hall, this was not afforded to soloist of the day, the -year-old Ukrainian Russian pianist Vitaly Pisarenko.When many would, however, have struggled with the cold, from his first entry he appeared unphased by it and indeed gave us a memorable exhibition of astonishing virtuosity and musicianship.Each half of his well-balanced programme started with early Beethoven sonatas, beginning with his first, Op. No. . Dedicated to his hero, Haydn, this was delivered with the reverence it deserved and the clarity and drive of the final Prestissimo would have pleased the dedicatee no end.The first half ended with two Chopin Polonaises # Op.  Nos.  and  # and his third Ballade. The second Polonaise was particularly impressive with its menacing opening figure and Vitaly#s judicious use of the sustaining pedal lent great clarity to all three pieces and indeed to all his recital.After the intermission came Beethoven#s Sonata Op.  No. . By this time Beethoven had developed his own inidual persona and the three contrasting movements of this work were beautully executed, particularly the Adagio with its slow melody and stuttering accompaniment and the contrasting fluidity of the final Allegretto.Next we heard Bela Bartok#s Suite Op. . This was typical Bartok from beginning to end, spikey, angular and generally very speedy and played with incredible precision. When I said to Vitaly that it sounded fiendishly dficult he retorted: # It#s actually quite easy I learned it in three days.#While not normal fare for our audience this, hopefully, was an interestingFirebird is probably Stravinsky#s best known work apart from, maybe, his #Rite of Spring#, and both were originally written as ballet scores. However, due to their popularity, over time these and other works of his have been transcribed by ious people for all sorts of instrumental combinations, and the Agosti transcription of Firebird for piano solo that Vitaly played as his finale is probably the most well known. It makes huge demands on the soloist as Agosti endeavoured to encapsulate Stravinsky#s rich orchestration into a work for only two hands it only works in the correct hands and Vitaly#s were just such hands.This was an electrying rendition and not just for the sheer virtuosity as there were gorgeous quiet sections as well. The thunderous applause at the end said it all.Virtuosity is a given nowadays and over the years we have heard some fine pianists at Ardrishaig, but it was Vitaly#s musical integrity and attention to detail which was a cut above and truly inspirational. This was indeed a recital to remember.The concert, in Ardrishaig Public Hall, was staged by Mid Argyll Arts Association in association with Argyll and Bute Concert tours."},{"url":null,"title":"no need for stress shop local in festive lochgilphead","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNow there is need to rush out on your lunch break, or even break your neck heading into town before the Big Day # Lochgilphead retailers are opening late, so you can relax while getting your Christmas shopping finished.A #shop local# initiative is being promoted around town, encouraging shoppers to support local businesses by purchasing their Christmas gts and festive feasts locally.On Thursday December  many of Lochgilphead#s shops will be open late, including The Square Peg Marmalade Deli Danny#s Ironmongers Fyne Tackle Argyll Book Centre Breagha R  S Stovecraft Love Dove Studio The Sweetie Jar West Coast Home Fyne Living Bluestone Argyll Pharmacy Mary#s Meals Argyll Gt Company The Archway D  D Wool and Crafts and The Mail Box, including the post office, will also be offering the usual postal servicesyou have any gts still to send off.Rumour has it that some shops will also be offering festive nibbles and drinks, plus promotional offers and discounts."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 5 the nineteenth hole","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWelcome to Episode Season  Finale # Join presenters Stephen Day, George Graham and Keith McIntyre for more golfing chat about Bob and other golfing fun # with additional material from David McPhee, Bruce McNab, Neil Armour, and Charles Spreadburry.This week they discuss more golfing terminology, look at some stats and even answer a listener#s question.You can listen and or download all Episodes of The BOBcast below"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 13 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsNever mind the general election, with its deep isions and rancour, let alone the circumstances which brought it about.

This year’s winner, picked by the skipper, was Robert ‘Grinch’ MacBrayne.The day started off as expected, pretty cold with a few light showers. Fishing was slow at first with roughly an hour passing before the first catch came aboard, but after that it was non-stop until lunchtime.The quality of spurs and whiting was better than expected with very few undersized caught.

Social care, mental health and primary care services are all crying out for more support, and better resourcing them would take the pressure off the accident and emergency service.The SNP government have failed to meet the AE target time every month for over two years. They need to take swt action to properly prepare AE departments before winter sets in. A good place to start would be publishing the integrated workforce plan that staff were told would be out last year. Another broken SNP promise.Yours,Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll  Bute.Connected nationSir,Before I address Alan Reid’s comments on superfast broadband , it ought to be remembered that this is the same ex Liberal Democrat MP who propped up the Tories and imposed years of toxic austerity measures on Scotland, shrinking the UK economy by £ billion, imposing Dickensian social policies # like the Bedroom Tax # on the poorest in society, and voluntarily choosing to make Tory cuts possible.The Liberal Democrats are deeply stained by austerity and they will remain, rightly, untrusted as the Tories little helpers.Mr Reid berates the SNP government for alleged failure to deliver superfast broadband. Yet, inspite of the unique dficulties in delivering superfast broadband in rural Scotland, which BT described as the ‘most signicant geographic challenge in the UK, and arguably Europe’, the latest Ofcom ‘Connected Nations’  report shows that Scotland outperforms the UK as a whole when it comes to new broadband deployment.There remains work to be done and the Scottish government is committed to delivering the best possible value and completing the roll out by  .Mr Reid is right to say that contracts have not been finalised yet, but with telecommunications and broadband reserved to Westminster, the changes in contracts imposed by UK ministers mean that bidders require additional time to recalibrate their bids.It is up to Mr Reid to carp from the sidelines, but readers can be confident that this SNP Scottish government will deliver a future proof network that will make Scotland one of the best connected places in Europe.Yours,Ron Wilson,Secretary Kintyre SNP.Coffee thanksSir,This year our World’s Biggest Coffee Morning fundraiser entered its th year.In community centres, schools and workplaces, thousands of coffee mornings were held across Scotland to raise money and help us support people affected by cancer.I would like to offer a huge and heartfelt thanks to every single one of your readers who held or attended a coffee morning – your energy and generosity never ceases to amaze us.Whether it’s specialist cancer nurses, support workers or benefit advisors, we can only offer the support that people with cancer need thanks to the tireless fundraising efforts of our supporters.The number of people who need our help is growing, and we want to offer support to everyone who needs it.

It came after representatives of the local industries which discharge their waste effluents into the main sewage system indicated that they would be willing to co-operate in the neutralising of the acids in their effluents.Without neutralising the acid would prove damaging to the pumps envisaged for the new scheme.The motion calling on the council to give the go-ahead on the project was made by Dean of Guild William Stevenson, and seconded by Councillor N. S. McCallum, who said: #I think health comes before money in this respect.#Fears were expressed about the effect the scheme would have on the rates. Councillor Alastair McKinlay said: #It might be that in years to come we, as a council, will be blamed for putting the rates up.#Provost Daniel McKinven said that the efforts made in the past to secure the new sewage system for Campbeltown were #joint efforts#. The Provost said that the council had #done this for the good of Campbeltown# and that they would #see to it# that local labour is employed on the actual scheme.Mr W. P. Scott, the representative at the meeting of Messrs. Crouch and Hogg, the firm of consulting engineers who will be employed on the project, said that the pumping main would probably be laid along under the Low Askomel road.Mr Scott commented that the most expensive part of the scheme will be the actual laying of the pipelines.Hon. Treasurer George Halbert and Town Chamberlain, Mr William B. Allen, calculated that the rates may have to be increased by s d to cover the cost of the scheme. But Mr Halbert pointed out that the increase may be considerably more.The final calculation will not be made until Messrs. Crouch and Hogg supply a final figure for the cost of the scheme.The town will be eligible for a rates support grant.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGOHighland Parish Church ChoirOn Wednesday night the choir of the Highland Parish Church gave a concert in the Kirk Street Hall in aid of the funds of the Women#s Guild.The audience quite filled the hall, and a most enjoyable programme was received with every indication of appreciation.The choir contributed two-part songs which were rendered tunefully and with fine feeling, and the audience responded with particular warmth.The vocal solos by members of the choir were all most successfully rendered.The songs were nicely selected and several singers, heard for the first time, performed with great taste and sweetness.The soloists were Misses Macalpine, L.

But she asked why the young woman was so determined to climb the stairs, even though she was clearly very ill and finding it dficult.This led to me mentioning who Anne Frank was and that people visit the attic because itrsquos the place where she hid.ldquoWhy was she hiding  was the inevitable question, just as bedtime arrived.I was suddenly presented with a dilemma, not so much that bedtime was now delayed, but how to explain to a six-year-old the depth of evil and hatred that was the reason for Anne Frank having to hide in an attic with her family. And then whether to explain what happened to her after she was discovered.I knew that I couldnrsquot just ignore her question. So we searched for images of Anne Frank, which meant she became a real person for my daughter.Skye studied her and said she looked nice and kind, and asked again why she was hiding.I explained that people who didnrsquot even know her hated her just because she was a bit dferent to them. I couldnrsquot explain the horrors of genocide and concentration camps, but she understood that Anne Frank and her family must have been really scared to hide in an attic.ldquoWhat happened to her  asked Skye as she dressed for bed.This was not a bedtime story I wanted to tell. Indeed, for a child so young, it was not a story I wanted to tell at all. She knows there are bad people and staying safe is important, but we feel the need to protect our children from the evil and hatred that is sadly so deep-seated.But it is at this young age that the seeds of intolerance and hatred can be plantedthey are not encouraged and helped to feel empathy to others, including those who are dferent in fact, especially those who are dferent.So I told her a lsquochild-friendlyrsquo version of Anne Frankrsquos story,there can be such a thing. I gave no details of the horror of the Holocaust but we imagined how she must have missed her family when they were split up, and how sad it was that she died not long before the war ended.She wanted to look at Anne Frankrsquos photo again and say goodnight to her.ldquoThank goodness that could never happen to us here, could it dad ldquoNo, that is not going to happen, and we have to make sure it doesnrsquot happen to anyone  either, I reassured her.I felt quite emotional as I went downstairs with my kids sleeping safely in their cosy beds. I thought of the families in Syria who cannot keep their children safe from hatred and violence. I knew that such horrors could happen anywhere, at any time yes, even here yes, maybe even to us or our neighbours or friends. In fact, hatred of dference is indeed amongst us.A friend of mine was on a bus heading from East Lothian into Edinburgh last week and witnessed a horrible racist verbal assault on a Polish family. The horric murders in London are also part of the same hatred of dference ndash a man so full of hatred for people who think dferently that he randomly killed two amazing young people.Hatred is a virus that can infect any society and any inidual in it. History has taught us that fanning its flames can be an easy way for politicians to win power. But like real fire, once itrsquos released it can spread and destroy uncontrollably.People say fight fire with fire, but here the comparison ends, for we cannot fight hatred with hatred. Hatred only spawns more of it.And so I searched for words of that remarkable young woman Anne Frank, who left her diary behind, unknowing that it would be her gt to the world. Words I could share with my daughter, from one young thinking child to another. Despite writing at a time of unimaginable fear and horror, in her diary she has left us a timeless message of hope that comes from her rejection of hate:ldquoItrsquos dficult in times like these ideals, dreams and cherished hopes rise within us, only to be crushed by grim reality. Itrsquos a wonder I havenrsquot abandoned all my ideals, they seem so absurd and impractical. Yet I cling to them because I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart.It is our responsibility to live up to that inspiring message from a young woman who was a victim of the hate she rejected utterly to show our children, our family and friends, our colleagues and those we meet on a bus, that love, tolerance, empathy and respect of dference is the counter to hate.And we should expect no less from all our politicians."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-replace-old-boxing-gym-housing","story":"REM Associates have lodged planning applications seeking to replace the th century former Tranent Methodist Church building on Bridge Street with four two-bedroom flats.They submitted the applications on behalf of businessman and premises owner Alex Brown, who founded Bronx Boxing Gym, which was based at the old church, a decade ago.In recent years, Mr Brown had no involvement in the running of the boxing club but still let its boxers use the building.However, costly repairs were needed to make the former church safe, which led to the boxing club vacating the premises.Earlier this year, the club moved to the newly established Fit-in Fitness Gym on High Street, Musselburgh.A planning application has been submitted for the former church building and the east wall which faces the car park on Coal Neuk to be demolished.Drawings included within a second planning application show designs for erecting four two-bedroom flats with a basement car park with space for four cars."},{"url":null,"title":"familys-spectacular-christmas-lights-display","story":"The Woods family open their very own Santarsquos grotto and decorate their home each year to raise money for Mission Christmas and Cash for Kids.This year, there are more than , lights at their family home and in their garden.Dad Stevie Woods said the family ldquojust love Christmas and hope the stream of visitors theyrsquore expecting will leave donations for charity, either cash or a toy.They raised pound on their opening night.The lights were switched on for visitors on Sunday at pm and will be on from .pm to pm daily until Christmas.The grotto is open for visitors, who can enjoy the Disney characters painted on the inside and the Christmas films playing.There is also a Santa Sleigh where children can get their photograph taken, and this year there will be the addition of a Santa train, which Stevie made himself out of whisky barrels.He said: ldquoLast year we raised about pound so wersquore hoping to beat that.

It is a scary premonition.ldquoYoursquore just getting old, was a recent diagnosis from a family member! It was said with affection, of course, yet the ring of truth gave it an unhelpful sting. Age, of course, is just a number and state of mind and I have much to keep me youthful.What did help was meeting up with an old friend last week. As we sat together sharing memories of our youth and the shenanigans we got up to  years ago, I had a disorientating sense of time. It seemed impossible that so many years had passed since the moments we remembered had taken place. Those moments were so present for us. As another clicheacute says, it was asit was yesterday.We both complimented each other on how young we looked but I think this was because we both saw the younger person underneath the wrapping made by time. Society judges so much by appearance, we all do. But when we meet an old friend, even when we have not been in touch for many years, we see the person we knew, eventhe exterior has changed. As the philosopher Henry David Thoreau once said: ldquoItrsquos not what you look at that matters, itrsquos what you see.Who can say honestly they have not judged someone because of what they look like  I am as guilty as anyone . As I said, we all do it on the bus, in the queue at the supermarket while we wait our turn, everywhere. We glimpse at people, avoiding eye contact, but making immediate judgement on the way they look. Sometimes itrsquos negative, sometimes envious, sometimes positive and admiring but always superficial. And I know, like everyone , I too am likewise judged.Itrsquos a human habit, perhaps a primeval instinct in which we must quickly judge people for our safety. But of course outward appearance gives no clue to someonersquos character and real qualities. We must know something of that person first before we can judge on that.And this means seeing beyond what we look at. And to do this we need eye contact, a smile, a friendly gesture and the exchange of some words. We need to connect to the person inside. And the irony is, while there are more of us than ever sharing ever-bigger spaces, we are ever more disconnected from each other.The truth Irsquove come to realise is that you donrsquot have to be an old friend with someone to see their inner self, you just need to see beyond what appears to you. We have another primeval instinct and that is to detect the warmth of a character. But we cannot do thatwe only see what we look at and make no attempt to connect.My resolution, even before New Year, is to do this more often. To smile, say some friendly words and not judge or assume things. I think we actually all need more of this, with people we donrsquot know as much as those we do.As someone once said, a stranger is a friend you havenrsquot met yet. Well maybe you have, but you just havenrsquot spoken to them or really seen them for who they are."},{"url":null,"title":"hometown-clubs-special-honour-golf-star-catriona-matthew","story":"They gave Catriona, who is from the town, the membership in celebration of her victorious Solheim Cup captaincy at this yearrsquos competition, which was held at Gleneagles in September.Stuart Martin, golf operations manager at North Berwick Golf Club, said: ldquoThe club was absolutely delighted when she was given the [Solheim Cup] captaincy.ldquoEveryone was delighted for her when she won the Solheim Cup, especially since she has been related to North Berwick Golf Club for so many years.ldquoGiving her the honorary le membership was a no-brainer ndash everyone was delighted for it to go through.Catriona has been a member of North Berwick Golf Club since , when she was just  years old.On Catrionarsquos reaction to being given the honorary le membership, Stuart added: ldquoShe was just delighted and thanked everyone for being there.ldquoShe talked a little bit about her history growing up playing on the West Links, which led to her going on to do bigger and better things on the European Tour and her experience at the Solheim Cup.The club also announced it was renaming its East Lounge, located on the top floor of the clubhouse, the Catriona Matthew Lounge.Mr Martin added: ldquoShe was a little bit shocked to hear we were renaming the lounge after her.ldquoShersquos quite a private person and keeps herself to herself but she was delighted to receive both of these recognitions."},{"url":null,"title":"consultation-proposed-transport-hub-haddington-branded-shambolic","story":"Protests are expected to take place outside Haddington Town House on Monday evening when the proposals are put to the public.And angry business owners are also planning to place banners outside the townrsquos General Election polling station at the Aubigny Centre today .In recent weeks, East Lothian Council has repeatedly changed plans for a public consultation on a controversial proposal for a new car park east of the town centre. One business owner accused the local authority of trying to ide and confuse people so they did not attend.It comes after the council:Haddington Business Community Partnership had asked the council to postpone the public consultation until the start of the new year because it believes the local authority has breached Scottish Government guidelines stating that consultation exercises should not be launched during local or national election periods.A spokesperson for the council has denied this is the case and insisted it is a normal part of pre-consultation process.Community councillor Pat Lemmon said the decisions of the council were disappointing.She said: ldquoIt does not encourage feelings of trust for everyone working together. The ground rules change by the day.And she said the councilrsquos handling of the proposals had caused major distrust among residents, particularly when it came to the independently produced Haddington Vision document officials use to support their case.She said: ldquoThe Haddington Vision strongly said any changes had to be looked at by all the stakeholders, by everyone concerned, to avoid any ill feeling, to make everyone feel they had been consulted as part of proposed plans.ldquoThe statement made that East Lothian Council hopes to be in a position to implement a decision by March  indicates to me that there appears to be a race on to secure funding for the transportation hub.ldquoIf this is the case, is this the right decision given the strong views for and against any proposed hub in the town and the proposed town centre plans currently being discussed by the steering group ldquoTo have such a meeting so close to Christmas, and the stakeholder consultation at a time when many people are working, seems to me to be a bad decision.ldquoI am very disappointed that such a decision has been made.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council previously confirmed that the drop-in event would run -pm, with a public notice in the Courier of November  confirming that was the case.The event was to give local residents and businesses ldquothe opportunity to discover more about the proposals for a transport hub in Haddington.She said: ldquoThey will also be able to see the progress and history of the project to date, including the consideration of  dferent sites across the town.ldquoComments can be recorded as part of this consultation which will help inform the future development of the proposal and will be followed by another consultation in the New Year.However, the public section of the event has been reduced to just  minutes.When asked why the format of the event had been changed, the spokeswoman said: ldquoDue to a combination of level of interest and availability of staff, a stakeholders meeting will be held at pm and invitees include local business owners, schools, community council, sports clubs, transport companies and accessibility and active travel interests. [The] public event will start at pm.Other sites considered for the car park and dropped for ldquoious reasons include the field between West Road, Park Lane, Pencaitland Road and Letham Drive, and the site of the former Haddington Nursery School Annexe, off Meadowpark, which has also been earmarked for a housing development.The plans for Whittingehame Drive, which were drawn up following a series of closed door meetings, came under fire from a number of Haddington residents.Concerns ranged from the loss of green space on the site, which is beside the townrsquos skate park and G sports pitches, to the potential for accidents with youngsters playing next to the car park.The transport hub, which would include a car park with somewhere between  and  spaces, could also include ldquobus connections, bike hire opportunities and new pathways.According to East Lothian Council, the facility,approved, has ldquothe potential to free up parking spaces in the town for short-stay use, making it easier for people to access local businesses, essential services and tourist attractions.However, business owners were among those raising concerns about the proposals.George James, who runs the East Lothian TV and Video Repair Centre on High Street, felt that the last-minute changes were an attempt by the council to ide people.He said: ldquoIt is clearly isive and an effort to stop people attending the public consultations.ldquoWe are a local business and have been told we cannot attend the stakeholdersrsquo meeting as we are not considered stakeholders.ldquoWe are encouraging as many people as possible to join a protest at the Town House on Monday evening we are determined to ensure they do not get away with this approach, which appears shambolic.Karla Green from the shop is handing out leaflets advising people about the public meeting but the times have changed so much even her leaflets are now out of date.She said: ldquoThey still have pm on them so we have to tell everyone that the time has changed ndash again.Project consultants WYG will be in attendance on Monday and will have a number of display boards showing the extent of proposals.Council transport officers will also be in the Town House and people will have the opportunity to ask questions.A council spokesperson said: ldquoThe public lsquodrop-inrsquo part is now -.pm and it has been extended

It has also previously been identied that the Coastguard site could potentially provide parking for any new flats in the Assembly Rooms.A metal staircase linking the car park to the adjacent Church Street and the town centre is also included as part of the proposals.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, had mixed thoughts on the scheme.She said: ldquoLargely, there is a demand for parking.ldquoHowever, these car parking spaces would require traffic to move past a very small group of cottages that have enjoyed a degree of privacy in effectively a cul-de-sac all the time they have been there.ldquoInitial messages I have had from residents are of horror.ldquoThe prospect is that green space will be tarmacked over and become a pretty signicant car parking lot.The spokeswoman for the local authority highlighted the proposed car park was part of a wider project surrounding parking in the town.She said: ldquoThe project that transportation is considering has nothing to do with the Assembly Rooms but rather a straight forward look at available space to act as long stay and to change Abbeylands parking to short stay.ldquoThe council is currently negotiating with Transport Scotland and Network Rail to increase the capacity of the rail station car park to stop indiscriminate parking on local streets.

A fundamental sht has taken place, not only in Englandrsquos mindset, but the manner in which its voters were induced to back Mr Johnson.What  have we learned from this extraordinary election  Well, herersquos my initial take. I look forward to hearing yours.. The ruthless, despicable tactics used by Dominic Cummings and Vote Leave to win the EU referendum campaign were not an aberration. As Mr Johnsonrsquos victory highlights, they are the new norm. Wersquore going to have to get used to digital s and elements of the media spreading misinformation like wildfire, possible foreign interventions, bamboozling distraction techniques, blatant dishonesty during broadcast interviews. How the Conservativesrsquo opponents respond will be crucial. Play it clean and be crushed, or get dirty, too, and join in them in the moral sell-out  You decide.. Simple slogans ndash especially those created by the aforementioned Cummings ndash really do work. By the end of the campaign just about every voter vox-popped in England seemed to be parroting the ldquowe just need to get Brexit done line. This undoubtedly helped consolidate the pro-Brexit vote around the Tories.. Labourrsquos claim to be the party of working people no longer stands up. Jeremy Corbyn and his disciples can blame media bias for his partyrsquos disastrous result till the cows come home but it wonrsquot change the fact that their man and his policies were a monumental turn-off across the partyrsquos traditional heartlands. Labourrsquos disastrous stance on Brexit didnrsquot help, but the rejection goes deeper. The fact that people living in poverty believed Boris Johnson would look after their interests better than a lelong socialist is both grim and fascinating. Sadly for the poor, we canrsquot bet on Labour facing up to these harsh truths any time soon.. Speaking of Labour claims that donrsquot stand up, we can surely all now agree that a Labour government is not going to ldquosave Scotland, either from the Tories or independence. This ridiculous and out-dated argument was still being peddled on doorsteps, not only by London-based Labour but many in the Scottish party, too. It really would be in the partyrsquos interests to accept that comparing independence ndash which for the vast majority of supporters is based on a simple desire for self-determination ndash to Farage-style nationalism is not only highly insulting, but as wersquove seen for years, electoral suicide. There have been signs over the weekend that at least some in Scottish Labour are waking up. Too little, too late  Quite possibly.. The evisceration of the Lib Dems tells us that Jo Swinson ran a flawed campaign based on a fatal overestimation of her own popularity. It also suggests England doesnrsquot like three-party politics.Or hung parliaments. You can kiss goodbye to any thoughts of electoral reform.. The SNP-Tory stand-off over Indyref cannot go on forever. Both sides are already upping the ante, with Mr Johnson and Michael Gove categorically ruling out another referendum, and Nicola Sturgeon intensying the narrative with talk of Scotland being ldquoheld prisoner. Such shadow boxing plays well to both partiesrsquo core support, of course, but eventually one side will have to go for the knockout blow. Itrsquos hard to see what more Ms Sturgeon can do in the face of such denials and hypocrisyfrom a tin-eared PM buoyed by a right-wing majority, at least until the Holyrood elections of . However Mr Johnson, who purports to be a classical scholar, would do well to learn lessons from more recent events, not least the unstoppable push for devolution that resulted from Mrs Thatcherrsquos condescending and contemptuous attitude towards Scotland during her - year stint as PM. The unpredictable nature of the Johnson-Cummings premiership means you never know what will happen, of course. Will they fancy calling the SNPrsquos bluff  Time will tell.. Meantime, the SNP needs to fashion fresh and persuasive arguments for independence in the post-Brexit world, with palatable solutions to the dficult questions and scenarios created by the UK leaving the EU."},{"url":null,"title":"diary-large-hare-krishna-centre-glasgow-possibly-go-wrong","story":"IrsquoM guessing it happens sort of like thishelliptwo guys are drinking in a local boozer, gulping down pint after pint. Perhaps a few whisky chasers come into play in a cunning attempt to dilute all that Tennentrsquos Lager swishing about in their stomachs.But all good things must come to an end, even Saturday night benders. Accepting this grudgingly, the tanked-up twosome sashay and sway from the comfort of the bar, out into the night, where the winter wind slaps them hard across their faces, like a temperance campaigner confronting a pair of naughty bootleggers in prohibition Chicago.Our booze hounds are feeling the pain, alright. But, lo, whatrsquos this they spy  An open door. And a shimmering light emanates from that door. Crossing the threshold theyrsquore confronted by celestial music wafting down a steep staircase. The music draws the men forward. Upward. Climbing the staircase, they enter a room of chanting, dancing, frolicking and blissed-out fervour.Have they perhaps died of alcoholic poisoning on this dreich and rain-dappled Glasgow evening  Slipped the mortal coil and entered the heavenly realm Nope. The drunken duo have accidentally stumbled into OM Sweet OM, a Hare Krishna Centre in Glasgows Oswald Street, where a gathering of the faithful are in full chant mode. Irsquom one of the gang, as it happens, chanting along with about  other people. This being my first time, Irsquove not quite reached the state of transcendental ecstasy everyone  seems to have tuned into with ease.Which is probably why I immediately spot the drunks staggering into the room. And I must admit theyrsquore making me feel more than a wee bit uncomfortable. Whatthe booze bruvs start getting brash, boisterous, bolshiehellip or worse OK, wersquove got them outnumbered,  to two. Butit comes down to a fight, theyrsquove got inebriation on their side. All wersquove got is spiritual enlightenment. And, quite frankly, in a scrap booze beats beatic bliss. Every time.No Morris Dancers hereLuckily the night doesnrsquot turn violent. The drunks wobble amongst us for a while, their eyes wide like small children watching a particularly trippy episode of In The Night Garden. At one point they stagger over to one of the mantra chanters, who happens to be blind, and start to pet her guide dog.But thatrsquos as tactile as they get. Mostly they just stare. And therersquos plenty to stare at. Before arriving at OM Sweet OM, Irsquod assumed Hare Krishna chanting would be laidback and passive. Itrsquos not. For a start, therersquos musical accompaniment. And I donrsquot mean the wispy twang of a solitary sitar. Blokes are playing lead and bass electric guitars while drums provide a hypnotic dance beat.And, yes, plenty of people are getting into the groove. They arenrsquot performing some sort of heavily stylised dance ritual. No Morris dancers here. What Irsquom witnessing is essentially a bunch of rave-heads letting rip. The dancers gain energy and exuberance by grinning manically at each other. Coke-heads behave in a similar manner, though no illicit substances have passed anyonersquos lips this night.At times the dancing morphs into an Eastern version of a ceilidh. The movers and groovers weave in and out of each otherrsquos giddy embrace. All the while the chant continues: ldquoHare Krishnahellip Hare KrishnahellipAt the beginning of the evening I was told the chanting helps focus the mind on the immediacy of the moment. The person meditating is freed from the anguish of the past and concerns over the future. Although Irsquom enjoying the party atmosphere, Irsquom struggling to attain that desired state of being. I remain doggedly attached to my multitude of petty concerns. Even when the drunks leave, as eventually they do, I still find my mind chained to me. Therersquos just no escaping myself.Though to be honest, even without the distraction and enticement of a greasy lump of meat speared on a prong, Irsquod still be hard-pressed to keep my mind focused on spiritual matters. Therersquos no getting away from it, Irsquom a gutter-grubbing sorta guy.Otherwise there would be chaosUnlike Ramunas Bucimskas who is a bona fide Hare Krishna monk who also answers to the spiritual name Raghumath. Once the chant and stomprsquos over for the evening, I grab the opportunity to chat to Ramunas, whorsquos originally from Lithuania, though he left to study IT in Scotland. Irsquom curious to knowthere have been any prior drunken invasions into the Hare Krishnarsquos devotional space. Theyrsquore located in a rowdy part of town, after all, surrounded by pubs, clubs and fast food joints. ldquoOccasionally it happens, says Ramunas with a shrug and a relaxed smile. ldquoWe want to keep a safe environment, so we make sure thatpeople accidentally wander in here, they never cross a certain line. If theyrsquore in a friendly mood, wersquore friendly too. If theyrsquore a little more aggressive, then we have to be a little bit firm and ask them to leave.He adds: ldquoOf course wersquore a peaceable group, but we recognise that a certain level of violence is necessary in society. Thatrsquos why we have a police department, which we support. Otherwise there would be chaos.In other words,things had got really out of hand Ramunas would have called the cops rather than attempting to fend off the intruders by thrusting a locally-sourced radish in their faces. Irsquom glad to hear it.Beatic, Beatlish blissRamunas proceeds to tell me about the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, the organisation behind the OM Sweet OM centre. Itrsquos the same group that George Harrison, that most contemplative of Beatles, supported and promoted throughout much of his le. They teach a brand of Hinduism focusing on yoga, meditation, mindfulness, mantra, music and a plant-based diet.In the early s, counterculture figures such as the beat poet Allen Ginsberg were attracted to their belief system. By that decadersquos end it wouldnrsquot have been entirely far-fetched to label Krishna Consciousness the official religion of the hippies. The musical Hair even had the cast belting out the Hare Krishna mantra.But Irsquom no hippy, and as I admit to Ramunas, I struggled to tap into the spiritual angle of the evening. Does this mean I wasted my time meditating ldquoNot at all, he says. ldquoOf course we offer spiritual guidance. But there are many people who donrsquot have any spiritual beliefs whatsoever. But they practice mediation with us anyway. It helps them on a physical level and makes them feel much healthier.So did I leave feeling healthier  Indeed I did. For all of two minutes. The precise amount of time it took me to stride down the stairs of OM Sweet OM, turn left on Oswald Street, and bound into the kebab shop that had been enticing me all evening. Ten minutes after that, I wasnrsquot feeling healthy at all.I guess itrsquos safe to say that I havenrsquot reached the George Harrison plane of beatic, Beatlish bliss quite yet."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-put-women-charge","story":"Wall to wall white, middle aged men in suits, the only nod towards ersity being the one fellow whos gone rogue and not put a tie on.This open-necked rascal is one of  chaps in a photograph tweeted by Jake Berry, Cabinet Minister for the Northern Powerhouse to welcome the new #BlueWall of northern Conservative MPs to parliament.\"Working together,\" he captioned this sea of raw masculinity without any consideration of the subtext, \"Wersquoll hunt like a pack to get a brilliant deal for people across the #NorthernPowerhouse.\"If these lads are the hunters, who are their prey  The unemployed  The disabled  Single mums with more than two children  Interns  Cant wait to find out.And yet a record  female MPs have taken their seats in Westminster this week.

Only a third of SNP MPs are women.Back to Labour and the leadership race is underway, awash with female candidates. Eight MPs, six of them women and two of them Keir Starmer and David Lammy, have been touted as candidates for the race.Now, though, there are suggestions that one of those expected to throw her hat in the ring will now run for deputy leader in order to smooth the path for a friend. In a move described as \"sisterly\", Angela Raynor is expected to step back to give Rebecca Long-Bailey a leg up.Should a woman be given the task of steering the Good Ship Labour it will be the first time in the partys  year history, bar one brief interim.As a rival pack to Team BlueWall, the women whose names are being suggested are formidable candidates.Jess Phillips is charismatic and persuasive Lisa Nandy seems to have a grip on the distinction between London and the north of England, otherwise lacking in Labour Long-Bailey is a union favourite Stella Creasy is dynamic Emily Thornberry impressed when standing in for Jeremy Corbyn at Prime Ministers Questions.Should a male party leader be chosen in the face of all this female talent, robust explanations will be required. Its about time the partys glass ceiling was smashed. Its  years since the Labour Party brought a landslide  female MPs to the House of Commons, doubling the number of women MPs overnight. Let us gloss over the sexist Blairs Babes moniker and move on to the fact the women have been allowed to only go so far.In the words of Barack Obama, speaking this week at a private event on leadership, women arent perfect but,Labour really plans to have a serious spell of introspection, it could start by doing something fresh and new.After saying that women arent perfect, Obama added: \"What I can say pretty indisputably is that youre better than us [men].\"\"Im absolutely confident,\" he said, \"That for two yearsevery nation on earth was run by women, you would see a signicant improvement across the board on just about everything... living standards and outcomes.\"The argument begins to pale a little when you take a glance at two recent examples. Theresa May and Jo Swinson were savaged, neither doing an successful job of leading their respective parties.Theres an unfortunate cliche of women being expected to pick up after men and this extends to politics. It was expected that Theresa May would come in and repair the damage done by David Cameron after he ided the country and scarpered to his pound, designer shed to write about the experience.While Vince Cable did a stand up job of heading the Liberal Democrats, there was still a strong narrative that Jo Swinson, a woman who cant define what a woman is, would be a breath of change, leading the party in a new and fresh direction, a direction towards electoral victory.The problem women leaders face is that, when they are impressive - German Chancellor Angela Merkel, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern - their femaleness is praised as a reason why.Yet when, say, Argentinarsquos Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner defaults on international loan payments, or Australiarsquos Julia Gillard is strong armed out by her own party, the fact they are a woman is held against them.Women are expected to resolve years of inequality almost overnight or be cast as failures.Fact of the matter is, we dont have enough and consistent examples to say that female rulers would outperform men, or even do things dferently from their male counterparts.But studies show that women approach negotiation and politics in a dferent way to men. Earlier this year I was in Sierra Leone visiting a project where, to address poverty, financial structures were placed solely in the hands of women because they were shown to use the money for healthcare, housing, education and entrepreneurship.They focused on the means of lting the whole village, prioritising the treatment of everyone.You would hope that putting a woman in charge of the Labour party would lead to the same priority. The one thing we do know, is that the Prime Minister is not good with women.A female leader of the opposition might be just the thing to unnerve - and eventually unseat - him."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-airport-owners-rumoured-behind-prestwick-takeover-bid","story":"Transport secretary Michael Matheson announced a buyer had been found for the troubled transport hub, which passed into public ownership for pound in .:Preferred bidder chosen to take over Prestwick AirportMr Matheson said the bidder for the airport, operated on a commercial basis and at armsfrom the Scottish Government, could not be disclosed.However, reports in The Scotsman suggest AGS Airports, which also owns hubs in Aberdeen and Southampton, are the group behind the purchase.It is currently unknown whether pound million worth of loans owed to the Scottish Government will be repaid as part of the deal.Earlier this month, the airportreported a total loss of pound. million, including loan interest, for the  months ended March .:State-backed Prestwick Airport posts a fresh lossA spokesperson for the group said: ldquoWe have always stated we would welcome an outcome which s Prestwick Airport to a commercial footing in the private sector.He added: \"We have been monitoring the situation closely following the Governmentrsquos decision to place the airport on the market and will continue to watch with interest."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-born-lose","story":"WATCHING Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson march side-by-side into Parliament this week ndash one grim, one grinning ndash was a stark reminder that the lottery of le is all about winners and losers.

But even during the day when they have time off they go to dance classes and fitness classes because they need to keep their body in shape. But they adore it.The hour-long programme goes behind the scenes to meet the formidable characters who run the Moulin Rogue, which was famously the inspiration for the hit  musical film starring Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman.It also captures the incredible spectacle of the dancers performing the can-can outside the legendary venue in October this year -  years to the day since it opened in  on the citys Montmatre in the th arrondissement.Michaela Rondelli, , from Almondbank in Perthshire, was auditioned privately for her role in the revue show and feels the nudity is on the womenrsquos terms.The champion Highland dancer said: ldquoItrsquos not vulgar in any way. Itrsquos actually really empowering to be on stage as a woman and to have the choice to do that. Itrsquos great to have the confidence to do that. I know some people wouldnrsquot, but wersquore all strong confident women at work and we all really enjoy it.ldquoBut any time someone goes home they ask what we want brought back from Scotland.

We might live and work in Paris, but wersquoll always be Scots girls at heart.Sarah Tandy, , from Whitburn has been dancing at the Moulin for  years and is married to fellow Moulin Rouge dancer, Australian David Tandy, with whom she has an infant son Elliott.The principal dancer said: ldquoJoining the Moulin has given me everything ndash a well-paid job, a husband and a family. I started my career at Moulin and thatrsquos where I hope to retire.Returning to the stage after having a child was a challenge for a new mother.ldquoIt was a shock to the system, she added. ldquoIrsquod been off for a full year and went back to work when he was six months old.

Indeed, Ministers have stopped even referring to the deadline,” Mr McArthur said.“It is all the more important, therefore, that priority is given to connecting those communities who have been waiting longest for any sort of service. Good quality, affordable broadband is increasingly critical in accessing services, allowing businesses to compete and enable people to go about their daily lives.#The Orkney MSP added: #Mr Matheson seems happy that Orkney continues to languish signicantly behind the level of coverage achieved nationally. As an MSP representing a central belt constituency, perhaps Mr Matheson believes this is just the ‘price you pay’ for living in an island or rural area.“Whatever the reason, it is unacceptable, the Scottish Government needs to re-commit to prioritising future broadband investment in Orkney and other communities who continue to lag behind when it comes to coverage.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Unfortunately the indications from the EU-Norway talks are that this did not happen and our fishing communities are going to feel the consequences.“Sustainability is important but we must remember that no one has more incentive to ensure sustainable fisheries than family-owned businesses and fishing communities. These groups depend on having reliable stocks now and for future generations.”He continued: “Amongst all the technical discussions and ideological debates, the direct impact on local communities who are reliant on fishing and the surrounding industries is being forgotten. Sustainable fisheries should protect the long-term success of our distinct fishing communities. I hope that the key players in these talks, and our Government, can set aside ideology and reflect on the social impact of quota changes.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

She followed Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn#s position, stating she would like to see a new Brexit deal negotiated with the EU and put to the British people in a referendum, with no Brexit the other option.Jenner Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, said her priority was to #uphold democracy# and to see Brexit through #as soon as possible#.The SNP#s Robert Leslie said that Orkney and Shetland had not voted for Brexit yet #we could suffer most# from the country leaving the EU. He added he would like to remain in the EU and help reform it from within as part of an independent Scotland.The Brexit Party#s Robert Smith did not attend, but his stance of a #clean-break Brexit# with a free trade deal with the EU was announced to the room.Unsurprisingly, Brexit proved the hottest topic of the evening with several questions based around that subject.Ms Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, surprised most in attendance by repeatedly going against party policy # firstly by saying she supported the actions of Gina Miller, who took the Conservative government to court over Brexit, because she was #upholding democracy# and secondly by saying that the government#s #settled status# scheme for EU citizens needed a #total overhaul#.So it would seem the only candidate willing to represent the more than nine and a half thousand brexit voters in Orkney and Shetland is working fisherman Robert Smith of the Brexit party. It would seem Boris promise that all tories elected in this election would back his brexit plan was a bit of the mark. Or maybe it shows that his brexit plan is not brexit at alltheir candidate For the isles is willing to back it.Good to see that the Brexit Party is not drawn into this level of debate. I am sure Robert Smith was absent because he was busy getting Brexit Done. Too right that a clean-break Brexit is what we need. Like was said before, a free trade deal will be the #easiest in human history#. Wise words from Liam Fox, and still yet to be disproved by the #facts#.Robert Leslie, SNP, is obviously unaware ofthe impact of independence. The EU has stated repeatedly that , wewill be automatically out of the EU on Independence Day # with #No Deal#.#When part of the territory of a Member State ceases to be a part of that State, e.g. because that territory becomes an independent state, the treaties will no longer apply #Westminster will no longer fund our #notional budget deficit#. It will become real. Nicola Sturgeon#s Scottish Growth Commission proposed a multi-year plan to reduce it to EU-acceptable levels. We must also have our own, independent central bank and therefore, our own currency. That will take nine yearsand will require tens of billions in foreign reserves.If Britain #remains# there would be a #hard UK border# with EU tarfs . Negotiations will be with Brussels, not Westminster.It will take at least  years, with austerity,to rejoin.And  when we do we shall join the euro and pass control of our economy trade and fishing agriculture to the EU.SNP EU Brexit policy is nonsense. Scots are shrewd people and will not buy it.No, I was absent because I was at sea.#with Rees-Mogg hiding below decks I think she was campaigning in the SW of England.Not surprising. The Brexit party are all at sea.At least you were at sea doing an honest days work Robert, unlike the other candidates. Nobody will know more about the negative effects of European Union membership than you!I#m a bit baffled. I read tonight that Jo Swinson has apologised that she and her Lib Dems backed the Tories# austerity policies. But last night I saw Willie Rennie backing those policies to the hilt. What a party.Jo was talking about the past.Willie was thinking about the future.Now  have quit, including Rees Mogg. Like what Robert did there though, referring to Jacob#s sister, formerly of the Brexit Party, and no longer campaigning for them in the South East of England. You#ve got to ask how a spare bedroom tax would impact on that family# including in their second and third homes and any additional properties in their portfolios.WHY SOCIALIST SNP MEMBERS SHOULD VOTE LABOUR TOMORROW:For the first time in forty years and possibly for the last time during my le, we have the chance to support a manesto that includes widespread nationalisation and the restoration of worker’s rights.These are policies that any self-respecting socialist would have regarded as red lines before Thatcher came along and “modernised” British politics.After Brexit and Scottish independence, we willto the natural battle between left and right. It will even take place within the SNP itself, once the phoney pre-independence “party of national unity” approach falls apart.During these debates, the left will highlight support for Corbyn’s radical policies as evidence that these are still relevant and can still win votes.Meanwhile, the right will highlight the lack of support for Labour as evidence that strong unions and public ownership are no longer winning policies and should be abandoned forever.If you can’t use your vote to get your candidate elected tomorrow, at lease use it to make a statement.The ideas behind Labour’s bold policies need to be kept alive.They will be as relevant in an independent Scotland as they will anywhere .Absolutely.Absolutely not, Johan. I am old enough to remember the Winter of Discontent. Comrade Corbyn, Comrade Scargill. First Secretary Sturgeon! Reach for the rusty tin, self-castration before I would vote Socialist or Nationalist.I am almost old enough to remember the s also. I went missing from hom when I wis about , because I was busy helping a couple of older folk collect fire wood in the absence of coal during the Tories  day week I think.We are not going back to the s, with what we know now we can run things much better under Corbyn.The absence of coal was due to Socialist and le long Soviet supporterMick McGahey#s miners strike. Hardly down to the Tories. Just the Unions holding the country to ransom. Thank God the Maggie neutered that bunch.It#s almost like you are saying Shetland needs a vocal and united local Labour Party willing to take a stand on environmental and equality issues and prepared to ensure people#s concerns are properly considered.Will the local branch make a start to rebuilding by considering whether it isn#t time to call an end to Sullom Voe Yes, it would be goodmembers stopped voting for other partiesIt#s almost like you are trying to change the subject. Which of the parties that plan to close Sullom Voe did you vote for It’s important that unions be strong but not omnipotent, as in the s when many major industries were still nationalised. We meed balance.Combining the two is all very fine for those who, like me, benefited from working in the public sector however it leads to a two-tier workforce, with those in the private sector footing the bill, in taxes or high product prices, for the privileged ones in the public sector. That also hits private sector pay as employers must maintain viability with their increased costs.Having said that, re-nationalisation of electricity would be hilariously apt because government would become directly accountable totaxpayers and or bill-payers for the soaring costs of energy arising from “decarbonisation”, associated with the lunacy of unilateral “declarations of climate emergency” and policies like Labour’s “net zero ”.The IPCC does not call for that and condemns unilateral action as being unhelpful in achieving international agreement.I voted for Blair when sanity prevailed,now Corbyn takes us all back, well he is trying to, but the result empowers Boris!!! So now we have a Boris   Sturgeon catfight. Interesting times ahead, perhaps an Independent Shetland is the way forward, history repeating.When Boris replies to the letter requesting an independence referendum for Shetland, I hope the recipient will share it on this forum.We could all do with a laugh.Don#t make us laugh IanI wouldn#t trust this council to run a bath never mind having full autonomy of all the finances!Are you going to be King Ian Just a jest, George, but many a true word!If Sturgeon goes Indy I would rather stay with the UK or go for autonomy. . Think about it.Agreed Johan, and Labour has had my vote this time, but when there is a chance of turffing out an austerity backing LibDem# The main thing is people are being offered a chance to take back control of the vital services they depend on that should never have been privatised in the first place.New management systems will mean these can in future serve the people rather than serving corporate greed.Whether we get there this election or not, Corbin#s bold ideas have reignited the debate and energised thousands more activists than the Tories have active members. Hope remains for a fairer society in which the economy works for the good of the people as well as the environment they depend on.The LibDems on the other hand remain forever compromised between the freedom of business to exploit people and the freedom of people not to be exploited. Some wonderful handwringing from Carmichael on Viking Energy this election.Well done for your stand there and on UHA.Particularly pleasing to see Friends of the Earth saying Labour#s manesto was better for the environment than that of the Greens.O dear, poor Peter.On the wrong side again.#Labour#s worst performance since #. #Corbin’s bold ideas have reignited the debate and energised thousands more activists than the Tories have active members.# What the Socialist left did for Labour, just imagine what the would do to the UK and shudder!!! Momentumare the new Militant Tendency, no wonder they are heading to the dust bin of history.No, I am agreeing with you Malcolm, and also saying there is a conversation to be had locally about how long Shetland should continue to host the oil industry.The biggest benefit would have been in stable local employment, but that is not what we have seen.If the oil industry honours its original promises there will be years of work in ing the terminal site to nature.Some will say the sooner that begins the better.If that thinking can#t happen on the left where  will it happen Apparently % voted for political parties that wanted a second Brexit referendum, but now we#ve got the blues.What hope now for the  in  bairns born into poverty Thank goodness we avoided Corbyn#s, Socialism Peter. Look to Socialism in Venasuallia what that would do for us. That whole country is in poverty.Over  million scots voted to remain in the uk nowhere near that amount of scots voted to remain in the eu or for the snp. What is it about democracy you don#t understand  You seem to think you just change the question to suit the answer you claim to have got to a question that was never asked. And then have the gall to say that brexiteers didn#t know what they were voting for.Think about this George. If two years ago I had said Boris would be PM with a landslide every one would have laughed. The phrase is #He who has the last laugh#, Ho, Ho, Ho. Now everyone calm down.

In response to Ofgem’s decision, SSEN is also promising to progress preparation of the Shetland #standby arrangements# which will complement the transmission link.It is hoped the decision will provide Shetland’s renewable developers clarity about future network charges, helping them make investment decisions and provide the evidence required by Ofgem for the regulator to approve the proposed transmission link to the Shetland Isles.

The soloists for the evening were Jonathan Davison, Laura Bryans, Caitlin McMullan and Tracey Brush. The newly formed First Ballymena Children’s Choir made their debut appearance and have undoubtedly secured their slot in the programme for future years. Interpretive readings of Advent poetry and prose were expertly delivered by Louise Nelson and Paula Stronge. All of which was woven together in an unfolding narrative of Jesus bringing light into darkness both historically and in contemporary experience.Tickets are not sold for the event but a collection is taken each year for a cancer charity. This year the proceeds which amounted to over pound, were donated to CLIC Sargent.Valerie Cubitt, local representative for the charity, spoke movingly about their work and thanked those present for their amazing generosity.First Light is coordinated each year by Paul Brush, Musical Director at First Ballymena and hosted by the Minister, Rev. William Sinclair. A team of people behind the scenes responsible for artistic design, sound, lighting, catering, stewarding and more, make it all happen.First Light  will take place on Saturday, December  .

The Colin area representative has replaced newly elected MP for North Belfast John Finucane.Co-opted to Belfast City Council in Janaury , the -year-old told the Andersonstown News that it will be a “huge honour” to represent the people of Belfast.“What can I say, it’s amazing,” he said. “I’m honoured to have been asked by Sinn Féin to be the next Ard Mhéara of Belfast. “I have been an activist in the Colin area since I was . I’m very much about grassroots politics and that theme is something I want to continue. “I want to use the office of Mayor to bring politics from the ground up.” Having topped the council election poll in May, Danny spoke of how he will be continuing the civic work of party colleague John Finucane. “The role of Mayor is city-wide, I want to be a Mayor for all communities and to represent everybody. I want to champion the need for improvements to our mental health services. It’s something that has really impacted the Colin area. I want to use the office of Mayor to help in whatever way I can. I will work with our young people to ensure that they are included in decision-making that they have a brighter future and better quality of le.”The Lagmore father-of-three said he will be straight into Mayor business when he takes over the ‘chain’ today.“I want to do this for my family.  has been a dficult year for our family with the loss of our mother Edna. Mum was probably my biggest supporter and I want to do her, my we and children proud. I want to show my kids that there is nothing you can’t achieve through hard work and doing your best.”Sinn Féin group leader on the Council, Ciarán Beattie, described Mr Baker as a “well-respected and grounded community activist in the Colin area”.He added: “He has also been a vocal campaigner for LGBT and Irish language rights, climate action, community empowerment and for mental health awareness. “Danny will take this grassroot style of representation into the role of Mayor and ensure that all the needs of the citizens of this city are reflected in Belfast City Council. I want to pay tribute to outgoing Ard Mhéara John Finucane. He placed human rights social justice, environmentalism and defending Belfast against Brexit at the heart of his term.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"health workers begin 12 hour","story":"THOUSANDS of health workers across the north have begun -hour strike action in a dispute over pay and patient safety.The Royal College of Nursing, who represent around , nurses, are taking strike action for the first time in its -year history.About , other nurses, who are members of Unison have also walked out.On Tuesday night, leaders of the five main parties met the head of the NI Civil Service, David Sterling, and Health Department Permanent Secretary, Richard Pengelly, in a th-hour bid to avert the strike action and state their “collective support for the restoration of pay parity”.The Northern Ireland Office later said that Health was a devolved matter and Mr Sterling rejected the idea of restoring pay parity on the grounds of public interest.UNISON Regional Secretary Patricia McKeown said: “Everyone with power and authority in this society has conceded that our cause is just. We have had ‘sympathy’ from the UK Government through the Secretary of State, from all political parties that stood on our picket lines and from the leadership of the health service. But we have no resolution.“UNISON has agreed emergency cover and our members have volunteered to provide it. We have never seen such determination in health workers who have been devalued and disrespected for almost  years. For  weeks they have stood up for their rights and have now put the health service at the top of the political agenda.“Despite their sacrice there is still no action from those in power. It would appear that health workers, patients and the public at large are being used as pawns in a political game.“As we enter this signicant period in the industrial struggle the consequences lay firmly on the shoulders of the UK Government, our elected politicians and the leadership of the civil service.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"welcome organisation be kind to those living on the street","story":"I meet with Welcome Organisation CEO Sandra Moore in a room stacked from floor to almost ceiling of sleeping bags, which I’m told, have been donated by the Marine Society and Sea Cadets. Most,not all, of these will be gone over the coming nights to those sleeping rough in the city centre. Offering tea and coffee on tap from am until pm at their Townsend Street HQ, Sandra told the Andersonstown News that the need for their service is very much “ days a year”. “We have service users coming to us with ious needs, whether it’s clothes, a cup of tea or somewhere to have a bit of refuge. We do make targeted appeals throughout the year via our Facebook page and we do have people ringing to ask is there anything in particular we need. We always need decent trainers, sturdy, durable. We can’t hold out to jeans, in smaller sizes of waist, new underwear on which there is a massive demand all year round, socks and toiletries. “We can’t hold out to coffee, tea, sugar, washing powder, toilet roll, those things make a big dference to us,” she said.“We would ask for those who are donating that there is a reasonable le left in the items they want to give. We always have a need for sleeping bags and we don’t distribute tents on the streets as they would pose a danger.”Established  years ago, the Welcome Organisation has provided a vital shelter for those sleeping rough and who are experiencing homelessness. Sandra spoke of how the need for the service has “changed dramatically” in that time.“We are dealing with a greater number of people, people with more signicant issues, drug, alcohol, mental health, not all the people we work with do, its some, not all. What we are finding is that the age profile of those seeking the service is much younger, and there are more women coming to the Organisation. When I came  years ago we had six women in service. Now a third of our service users are female.”She continued: “We are working with homelessness in its most chronic form. We can’t forget that there is hidden homelessness. By that I mean people sleeping on sofas, moving from pillar to post. Nobody has a handle on that. One in  people within their le in Northern Ireland will experience homelessness. Le expectancy of someone who has had periods of continuous homelessness is  for a woman and  for a man.”Sandra said that currently those service users at the centre are predominantly young males from North and West Belfast.As  comes to a close, Sandra said that the issue of homelessness is facing a constant struggle in the New Year.“All services are facing pressure, lack of mental health services, lack of drug and alcohol support service and not just in Belfast, right across the North. We do not have detox or rehab facilities here, what services are there, due to severe pressures, aren’t responsive enough. We are trying to bridge that gap. It’s quite evident right across the city that there is a growing drug problem, there is a real need for education in communities. “People have to bear in mind that there is a back story to each and every person who is homeless. This is someone’s son, somebody’s daughter. Nobody has ever set out on that path. What child do you ask and they say ‘I want to be ill’, ‘I want to be struggling with addiction’, ‘I want to be homeless’. It’s not an aspiration but unfortunately it’s were we are. In Belfast I think we have a chance to not end up like Dublin, like London, the big cities. We still have a chance of doing something to contain it, but the agencies need to work together.”“No-one knows what the budget is for Ireland next year. How can you possibly plan while we have no minister for finance or minster for health  We, along with others, are highly dependent on the good will of the public, we couldn’t survive without the public,” she said. “I’ve been here  years and every year I am still overwhelmed by the generosity of people, people are very kind, however homelessness is an issue  days of the year.”Sandra said the levels of increased poverty within households job losses and the impact of Universal Credit are contributing factors to homelessness. “Regardless of whatever way Brexit goes, the economy is shrinking again, there is higher unemployment. “As my grandmother always said ‘when poverty comes in the door, love goes out the window’. We see so many times relationships breaking down because of the stresses of poverty linked to job losses. Statistics show that children growing up in poverty that their le chances are much worse. Someone who experiences homelessness as a child is much more likely to experience it as an adult – we need more preventive services going forward.”With the Organisation’s core team of staff, Sandra said that they couldn’t provide their service without their “ volunteers”. “We had  for Christmas dinner last year and so far we have wrapped over  Christmas presents,  of those bespoke for our regular users. We are inundated with people wanting to volunteer with us on Christmas Day – it’s a lovely day but it’s a hard day for a lot of people as you can imagine. We try to keep familiar faces around for the people that are coming in.“We just want to thank everyone for their continued support, we couldn’t do our work without it. We have a fantastic team of staff, of volunteers and the support of the public and the community. All I would ask is that people continue to be kind. That’s all I ask, is for people to be kind to those on the street. We don’t always know the story of how or why it has come to that.”For more information on the Welcome Organisation or to donate visit www.homelessbelfast.org"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"young people saying yes to yeha project","story":"ESTABLISHED over ten years ago, the YEHA Project has gone from strength to strength in helping young people in North Belfast.Based in the Flax Centre and the Houben Centre in Ardoyne, YEHA stands for Youth, Education, Health and Advice.The YEHA Project is made up of a small dedicated team of five full-time staff, sessional workers and a team of volunteers. One such youth worker is -year-old Cara O’Kane, who has been involved with YEHA Project for four years.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Cara explained more about the work of YEHA Project.“The YEHA Project supports young people in North Belfast aged  to  to tackle issues affecting their health and emotional well being,” she said.“Our work with young people embraces the core principles of youth work with therapeutic approaches.“Basically, we were set up over ten years ago to tackle health inequalities in North Belfast.“Our focus is on trying to get young people to focus on healthy lestyles and make positive and healthy choices regarding their wellbeing.“We do a lot of mentoring and support work where a young person would work with a youth worker informally centered around mental health and wellbeing. This may involve building coping skills and strategies for any dficulties they are facing in their le and looking at their interests and skills.“We want young people more involved in the community and activities instead of just going home after school as well.“It is about getting them out and about and giving them opportunities to try dferent things“We have had fantastic feedback from the young people themselves about the work that we do. They are testament to the work that they do themselves with our projects.“Our projects are all voluntary and everything is in the young person’s hands. Sometimes you have to step out of your comfort zone but the benefits are massive.The YEHA Project is also involved with cross-community work, alongside an organisation based on the Woodvale called Streetbeat Youth Project.Another successful project is the Carezone in Schools project, a pilot programme which is currently into its second year, based at Mercy College.Cara explained: “It is a model where we run one-to-one support within the school and have someone from YEHA project in the school daily to work with students in school.“After running a research programme, we found that over  per cent of young people would be more likely to speak to another young person about their problems rather than an adult.“We run the one-to-one mentoring service alongside a Peer Mentor programme where young people are trained up in Peer Mentoring to help support other young people on issues affecting their mental health and enables them to signpost to relevant support agencies.“It was a successful first year and last year we delivered  sessions to  pupils covering a range of issues including building coping skills and resilience, relationships, communication and social skills, health and well-being and anxiety.“We have a nice room in Mercy College where young people can come and relax and they are more likely to open up in such an environment.“It is all voluntary too, of course.”One young person, who took part in the programme, Jodie Shevlin, praised the benefits of it during the pressures of school exams.“The Carezone in Schools project is a way for pupils to distress and escape from the pressure of school work and exam,” she said.“The one-to-one work the project does is a chance for us to get worries or problems off our chest and be able to just have a more relaxed chat where we are really listened to.“It has really helped me get through my last few years of school.”YEHA ProjectFlax CentreArdoyne AvenueBelfast BT DATel:    "},{"url":null,"title":"meet the northern ireland mum who raised 23k to ensure no child was left without a","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have , people on the waiting list for a hospital appointment and we have a severe nursing shortage, which is highlighted by the NMC figures,\" added Ms Cullen.\"Our members have been out on strike to fight for patient safety and to improve conditions for everyone. Quite simply, we cannot afford to wait any longer to address the problems facing the health service.\"Another winter like this and the health service will be irreparably damaged.\"Further strikes are planned for January  and  ahead of the January  deadline for politicians here to re-establish the Assembly.A breakthrough to bring an end to the health service crisis appeared unlikely on Wednesday night, with the relationship between the Secretary of State, the Department of Health, unions and politicians disintegrating even further.Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith has refused to budge from his position that health is a devolved matter.After roundtable talks with the political parties, he said again he was unable to intervene and approach the Treasury for additional funding.However, unions have rejected this stance. They have also accused Mr Smith of using the crisis as leverage to force the political parties back into talks to re-establish the Assembly.Patricia McKeown from Unison launched a stinging attack on the head of the local Civil Service, David Sterling.He and the permanent secretary of the Department of Health, Richard Pengelly, have insisted that they cannot bring pay into line with the rest of the UK because it would mean overturning a ministerial decision.In an open letter to Mr Sterling, Ms McKeown argued this position was incorrect and hit out at comments he made in a letter sent to the leaders of the political parties on Tuesday.In the correspondence, Mr Sterling said that in order to meet pay parity demands, the Department of Health would need an additional £m every year.He said this money could alternatively be used to pay for additional activity to reduce the number of people on waiting lists each year by ,.\"It is important to note that other Northern Ireland departments are currently dealing with serious budgetary pressure, including pay pressures,\" he wrote.\"Indeed, there are currently industrial disputes in other parts of the public sector.\"The principle of public sector pay parity is clearly cross-cutting, with potential implications well beyond health.\" In response, Ms McKeown hit out at the fact that Mr Sterling has still not responded to a letter Unison sent to him on November , in which the union sought his intervention to resolve the ongoing dispute.Describing Mr Sterlings letter as \"a deeply unhelpful intervention\", she said she was \"shocked by the apparent attempt to mislead party leaders and the overtly political tone of the letter\".She said a letter from the five political parties providing cover to allow civil servants to meet unions pay demands was sufficient political authority for him to act.\"This having now been provided, we seriously question your failure to act,\" she added.She also said Mr Sterling and the Department of Finance have been creating pay policy in the absence of ministers, such as a recent announcement of a review of public sector pay.Ms McKeown also rejected the argument that there was no ministerial decision to break parity and said that it had instead been argued that the move was necessary to enable the Department of Health to break even.She added: \"We have repeatedly stated that the Treasury should provide whatever additional resources are needed to restore the pay gap.\"You have a clear role in making that argument to them.\"Health workers have kept the system running in the face of continued cuts and austerity.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic and travel latest updates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

Sinn Feins Michelle Gildernew won the seat with a majority of just  votes over the UUPs Tom Elliott. A candidate who wants to contest an election result has only  days to do so.New MP and leader of the SDLP Colum Eastwood has called for a full review of Northern Ireland’s voting system and Electoral Office processes. Mr Eastwood said he will raise the matter with the Secretary of State Julian Smith.The whistleblower told the BBC that:Valid applications for postal votes were rejected by the Electoral Office due to errorsSome applications to register to vote were only processed  hours before the deadline to submit additional evidence, such as proof of identity or addressPotential voters were given an incorrect date for the deadline to submit additional evidence to support their applicationHelpline operators on one occasion were asked to share one Nokia phone to field calls from all over Northern IrelandSteve Aiken said: \"Confidence in the electoral system is absolutely essential.\"If the serious allegations from the whistle-blower are confirmed, then last weeks’ election was neither fair nor open for potentially thousands of voters across Northern Ireland.\"Allegations of members of the public being deliberately mislead over deadlines would be especially unforgivableproven to be true. \"Even before these latest allegations came to light my Party had serious concerns regarding the recent operation of the EONI and we had planned to pursue this directly with the organisation.\"We were aware of examples of hand delivered applications for votes – for both new registrations and for absent votes – simply never being processed and when we sought explanations we were told the forms were never received. Crucially, we have examples of such forms being delivered in person to Belfast for voters in the Fermanagh  South Tyrone constituency.\"The centralisation of the EONI to Belfast has been a total disaster. Phone lines were jammed, paperwork was going missing and clerical errors were common-place.\"We are currently taking legal advice in relation to what steps we may now take.”The Chief Electoral Officer Virginia McVea released a statement to the BBC. She said: \"The team at EONI work tirelessly for the people of NI and have done for many years. NI receives expert service from an expert team.Chief Electoral Officer for Northern Ireland Virginia McVea.\"We, like every electoral team across the UK have to employ temporary staff at election times to answer the thousands more calls we get.\"Our phone system is adequate but BT lines were down in Belfast one day.\"We followed their advice on what to do and were treated as priority urgent customers but we have no way to control external infrastructure failures. The staff are well trained over a number of days and continually supported.\"\"Very importantly it is our whole team, including me, who answer queries and resolve issues through the election period by phone email and in person.\"We are very well used to dealing with queries as our team is expert. Staff advised the public to get evidence in by  December at the start to be sure they would have it in in time.\"In the last few days of the lead up staff told people  December and every single piece of evidence to midnight on  December was processed.\"I have been able to double-check that. All election timetable dates were on our website and available throughout the election.\"\"We are duty bound by law to keep processing until the deadline and so its true sometimes we have to ask for evidence right up to the last hours, evenwe think a person could not get information in in time, because that is the right of the public and indeed they will go on the register albeittoo late for voting that time\".Mr Eastwood described the claims as \"signicant\".\"The claims made by a whistleblower this morning are signicant and confirm reports we have received from a number of people who tried to vote in the election only to be told they were not on the register.\"The SDLP raised concerns on an inidual basis with the Electoral Office but it’s clear that there must be a full review of the processes which led to this.\"People must have confidence in the democratic process. I understand that there was an immense amount of pressure on the Electoral Office and the closure of regional offices has contributed in a big way to that pressure. But there is no excuse for disenfranchising people.\"The SDLP has consistently made representations to the Electoral Office about comprehensive oversight of registration, postal and proxy voting. A full review is now necessary and I will be raising the matter with the Secretary of State today.\"The whistleblower claimed he lost his job after advising a caller to the helpline to contact a local councillor with a complaint about the registration process.\"I felt like a lot of people were being impacted... a lot of people were very upset. Members of the public were phoning and finding out they wouldnt be able to vote in the election, people that had followed all the given steps and done everything correctly.\"There was a massive backlog of registrations that the electoral office needed to process and they didnt have the manpower to do it.\"The whistleblower said that ten agents answered helplines in the office in a working environment he described as \"chaos\".On one occasion, the helplines failed and they were given one Nokia phone to pass around to field calls from all over Northern Ireland, he alleged.He said a backlog in voter registrations sat for several weeks, leaving voters only days to send evidence to prove address, which is usually only requested after an initial application is filed.There was also internal confusion over when the deadline to register was, he said.\"A Thursday at the start of December, I came in and asked  the deadline was last night. And there was a  minute debate about when the deadline was. We told people that it was the third [of December], in reality it was actually the fourth.\"We were told \"dont tell people its the fourth\". On the letters we sent out it was clearly given as the third. We didnt even know what time [the deadline] was.\"The whistleblower said he was worried about the number of people the alleged issues around voter registrations may have affected.\"I would fear for the amount of people who just thought everything was OK. When it came to December , wait - whats going on here \"\"The only reason I know this is because people rang chasing it up,\" he said. In a further statement, Ms McVea said: \"Deadlines to register to vote are set in law. All applications receive before the deadline were processed in time for every successful applicant to be on the register in time to vote on December  election. \"It is a requirement in law that application forms are checked and we are required by law to seek additional advicewe cannot match the personal data against records. \"All absent vote application forms were processed in accordance with the law.\"Sinn Fein MP Francie Molloy has said the Electoral Office must be held fully to account in the wake of serious allegations about the operation of the office.Mr Molloy said: \"If people can’t get registered then they are denied their most fundamental democratic right. \"There are clearly serious issues around the competency and effectiveness of the Electoral Office in relation to registration, postal and proxy voting applications and other matters during the most recent election campaign.\"There are allegations which go way beyond human error and incompetence. This needs urgently addressed. \"We also warned the Electoral Office that closing local offices would lead to further problems. \"If these serious and deeply worrying allegations are veried, and they certainly reflect the experience of people who contacted Sinn Fein, those responsible for the operation of the Electoral Office at its most senior level must be held fully to account.\"People had until .pm on November  to register to vote in the General Election."},{"url":null,"title":"varadkar targets creation of 50000 new jobs","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The station docking was scrapped, and Boeing and Nasa decided to bring the spacecraft home as soon as possible.Flight controllers are working towards a pre-dawn touchdown in the New Mexico desert – always the planned landing site but six days earlier than expected.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A failed clock on Starliner put the capsule into the wrong orbit after launch on Friday After about  hours in space, the Starliner will fly over Mexico’s Baja Peninsula, across northern Mexico and then west of El Paso, Texas, into New Mexico for its touchdown.The orbital demonstration was supposed to be Boeing’s chance to catch up with SpaceX, which completed a similar flight test last March.Nasa hired the two companies five years ago to transport its astronauts to and from the space station in the wake of the end of the shuttle programme, but commercial crew flights have been hit by numerous technical problems and delays.Jim Chilton, a senior vice-president at Boeing, said on Saturday that the timing problem in the Starliner’s automated system has since been corrected and the re-entry and landing systems have checked out well.For unknown reasons, the Starliner’s clock did not sync up properly with the timing on the Atlas V rocket that launched the capsule.#Starliner is set to land Sunday at : a.m. MT at @WSMissileRange.

Flight controllers tried sending commands to fix the problem, but the capsule was in a bad position to receive them and there was also a gap in communication coverage.By then it was too late, and there was not enough on-board fuel to permit a space station visit.During a launch abort test landing last month in New Mexico, only two of Starliner’s three main parachutes deployed because of a rigging mistake.Mr Chilton said workers veried the rigging for this Starliner, and Nasa checked photos to make certain.This video shows a key #Starliner Orbital Flight Test objective: separation from ULA Centaur second-stage.

This fit and active PSNI officer, who ran four miles a day, is suddenly faced with the prospect of never talking, walking or having a normal le again.The early chapters of the book make for terrying reading.Clodaghdescribes how the inability to move or talk can turn simple thingsinto hours of unimaginable torment.Imagine lying in an uncomfortable, painful position, just adjusting an inch would help, but knowing that you will stay in that position for hours and hours on end. Or worse still, when you fear that the unbearable heat in the room is literally a matter of le and death.

Its not just that she overcame locked-in syndrome that is remarkable, but the strength and grace she displayed as she overcame it.Finding ourselves inClodaghs position, I think a lot of us would be broken fairly quickly, worn down by the boredom and the pain and frustration. Happy moments for others would be bitter reminders of all we cant have, the normal day-to-day problems of our loved ones lives would seem insignicant to what we are dealing with.

Before her stroke she travelled around Africa in a tentand skyed in Namibia. This locked-in syndrome messed with the wrong woman – she is a lionheart.It says everything aboutClodaghas person that when she cant even raise her hand, she worriesthat her partner isnt eating right at home. When a family argument swells up, she blinks four times – at that stage pretty much the maximum physical movement she is capable of – to lighten the mood.Even when she finally is able to communicate through a spelling board, she puts the feelings of others above what must be her aching need to be heard again after so much silence. In some of her first words with her partner, she makes sure that he apologises for the way he spoke to a nurse. She spells out jokes so that people wont feel uncomfortable when they visit her.Which is not to say that everything is rosy onClodaghs journey to recovery. The dficult parts are here too – the fights and frustrations, the tears and tantrums, setbacks and dark moments – all here without being glossed over. Maybe thats the policewoman shining through in her writing – this is the way it really was. Just the facts. googletag.cmd.push Here too is the truth of dealing with an imperfect NHS. Some staff ignore or patroniseClodagh, or think it makes sense to ask questions like “Whats wrong ” to a person who can only answer with blinks.Others treat her with the utmost care and kindness, nurses who take the time to put themselves in their patients shoes, to sing to them, to go out of their way to find a special item that means the world to a patient.A lot of books like this are about people in recovery – they say they are in it, a passive environment they find themselves in. A Return to Duty is dferent because it is about creating your own recovery. Its a testament to looking a crisis dead in the eye, then putting your head down, gritting your teeth and slowly grinding out a victory.Clodaghs story is one of determined struggle and mental strength when the worst – and this is the worst – has happened. It is a story of continued hope, when hoping seems utterly pointless, even damaging.“I must block my ears to anything negative,” she says, and keeps pushing and pushing and justwill notaccept the situation.Heres hoping that this book is there to provide advice to the NHS on improving stroke services, insight to families struggling to understand what their loved one is going through and comfort to someone dealing with locked-in syndrome, who can be read this book and know they are not alone.A Return to Duty is available to buy now at local bookstores or online atwww.beatinglockedin. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He attended St. Peters from  - and left with one O Level in English. This week he was awarded a PhD for a thesis assessing the readiness of domestically violent men to engage in domestic violence rehabilitation programmes. In the midst of the Troubles it was a dficult time for young people to focus on their studies.Maurice said: “For me, leaving school with one O Level and thinking I was stupid, to get into such a prestigious course and successfully completing it is a proud moment.”The Derry man is proof that le is about learning as despite leaving school with few qualications he immersed himself in study and has used it to help others through decades of social and community work.After spending some time on the dole, at -years-old Maurice began voluntary work as a youth worker and enrolled in an Addiction Studies course at Ulster University Magee.This coincided with work at Northlands Addiction Treatment Centre. Maurice believes alcohol was, and still is, the single biggest issue facing Derry. “The problem is that people don’t even view it as a drug, but it’s more powerful than most and one of the few drugs that actually damages the body just by taking it.”The heavy binge drinking culture that exists in Ireland is the source of many social ills, he said. “The main reason children are taken into care, neglect, is often down to parents having a drink problem.” googletag.cmd.push Treatment projects In January  he moved to London to work in a residential alcohol treatment project where he attained a diploma in alcohol counselling at the University of Kent. The following year he got a job as manager at the alcohol treatment centre, a post he held for four years.When planning toto live in Derry he believed that with a social work qualication he could secure a steady job and therefore applied for the professional social work training course at the University of Ulster.“The best thing about it was that it gave me an academic qualication and also a professional qualication which would allow me to be employed.“I graduated in  and started working right away with the Foyle Health and Social Services Trust in the Leaving and After Care Team, supporting young people who are leaving care and preparing to live independently in the community.”In  he, and local community worker, Frankie McMenamin, established the local charity, Zest, an organisation providing supportive care and counselling to young people struggling with suicidal ideation and self-harm. Maurice managed Zest for  years before leaving to pursue other interests.At the turn of the millennium until  he was part of the first Drug Arrest Referral scheme in Northern Ireland. The scheme was managed by the Western Health and Social Care TrustAlcohol and Dug Service and required daily attendance at the Strand Road Police Station. It was an innovative project through which all persons detained at the police station were offered support to address alcohol and drug problems. googletag.cmd.push PhD studies  In  he was grant aided by the Public Health Agency to undertake a fellowship at Queens University Belfast.His PhD involved “assessing the readiness of domestically violent men to engage in domestic violence rehabilitation programmes” in Northern Ireland. “A lot of men drop out of these rehabilitation programmes and what research has found is that when these men drop out they actually present as a greater risk to victims compared tothey had never been referred. “Amongst other things, the research established the men who completed the programme stopped drinking before or at the start of the programme, whereas the men who dropped out of the programme had continued to drink alcohol.“Because of the way alcohol affects the brain,you’re not drinking you’re far more alert and your brain can make connections and you can develop insight to understand yourself.“Butyou’re drinking during the week then it slows the brain’s ability to make sense of things.”He is now working to rehabilitate men who have been domestically violent. “We know prison doesn’t work and most of the men never receive the help that they need,” Maurice said. ‘Compassion’ When he ed to the WHSCT from his secondment at Queens University Belfast, Maurice began working as part of the Domestic Violence Team. Here he set up the first group-based and inidualised domestic violence treatment programmes run by the WHSCT. The demands entailed in establishing the new programme meant that it took longer than initially anticipated to finish the PhD.However, this year he successfully completed the PhD which is the culmination of eight and a half years of hard work.Sadly, his parents aren’t alive to share what is a high point on le’s journey but his children and other family members attended the graduation ceremony. “I’m really looking forward to the event, my daughter and son are going with me,” he said.Asked about the lessons he’s learned through his studies and decades of paid and voluntary work, he said: “No matter what sort of problems a person has, human beings have a massive capacity to change but you have to have the right support and help, which has to be provided in a non-judgemental and compassionate manner.“You can condemn behaviour, but not the person. You have to believe in the persons inherent worth and in their ability to bring about the change they need. Change is possible but people need the right support network in place.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

They have also been the standard bearers in Ulster and a commanding display against Antrim champions Dunloy saw them lt a third Ulster title. Derry CCCs reformatted structure has breathed a new lease of le into intermediate and junior hurling. Banagher were intermediate champions but, like Lavey and Swatragh before them, they fell short in their Ulster campaign. At junior level, Coleraine were back as champions and romped to Ulster success and join Slaughtneil in the quest for All-Ireland glory next month. googletag.cmd.push  – Daryl McDermott One of the biggest surprises was the fact Sticks has yet to pick up a hurling All-Star, after being selected in the intermediate football team last year. Cool, calm and collected , his puck-outs were the launchpad for Banaghers attacks. Had a slip in their Ulster clash with Naomh Eacuteanna but flawless otherwise and will surely be highly sought out by both John McEvoy and Rory Gallagher. Oisin ODoherty is more than a worthy mention for his Ulster final performance against Dunloy on his comeback. [st All-Star]  – Karl McKaigue The Emmets defender missed out on last years selection but is back to his consistent best. When Ryan Farren scored an early point for Lavey, he was moved across on him and blotted him out. In the final, he was briefed to pick up Niall Ferris and did so with little fuss. He helped keep Middletown to a mere eight points but it was in the Ulster final where he really earned his stripes with an expert shackling of Dunloys Conal Cunning. [th All-Star] googletag.cmd.push  – Paddy Kelly Its a first award since  for the experienced defender who had a selection in the forwards in . He was a vital cog in Derrys defence under John McEvoy and carried his form into club action. Against Ballinascreen in the semi-final, he held Ryan Scullion scoreless. In the final against Slaughtneil he played a captains part. He held Seacute McGuigan scoreless, was immense, repelled attacks and was unlucky to end up on the losing team. [th All-Star]  - Pearse Dallas A first award for the Eoghan Rua defender who caught the eye on their way back to the All-Ireland stage.Of their five championship games, they have shipped just one goal and Dallas has been pivotal to that record. He had a fine outing against Na Magha and hasnt put a foot wrong since, excelling in the Ulster final against Newry Shamrocks – his side’s toughest test to date. [st All-Star]  – Eamon McGill For the second year in a row, Lavey have negotiated the opening round of the senior championship and McGill has been the central figure. Despite defeat to Slaughtneil, he powered his way forward to score Laveys goal.He gets the spot ahead of Mark Lynch, who he edged for man of the match against Banagher. Lavey trailed by seven points but McGills goal led the fightback. When the Feeny men chased the game late on, he was back winning breaking ball in Laveys defence. [nd All-Star]  – Shane McGuigan After being handed a debut by Michael McShane in the  Ulster final defeat to Cushendall, he has been an ever-present in Slaughtneils defence. In a defensive unit thats all about match-ups, he went up against Keelan Molloy in their win over Dunloy. Molloy scored - from play during the season but McGuigan blotted him out and was still able to operate at centre-back. Richie Mullan didnt score from play off him in the county final either. [th All-Star]  – Meehaul McGrath Played at centre-forward as a runner under Collie McGurk for Derry and also had spells up front for his club. In the absence of Paul McNeill, McGrath has been shted back and in his role at wing-back he enjoyed a great season. He kept Corey OReilly to a point from play in the county final. Against Dunloy, he was paired with the strong running and direct Nigel Elliott. He made a goal saving intervention, cut out a dangerous diagonal ball and floated over a point of his own. [nd All-Star] LISTEN - Michael McShane happy for Slaughtneil to silence the doubters...  – Chrissy McKaigue The most decorated player since these awards began, McKaigue picks up a ninth award. In Slaughtneils cause, he leads and everyone follows. He lashed over four points in their facile win over Lavey and in the county final, he shaded a war of attrition against Thomas Brady but he saved his best for last. Once again he was tasked with putting Paul Shiels on the back foot and he did just that with a surging run in the opening moments that set the tone. [th All-Star]  – Gerald Bradley Was hurler of the year in  and followed suit this season. He registered - against Lavey, including the goal that broke them. In the final, it was Bradley who would pop up to win possession after a Kevin Lynchs score. Ballycran didnt play a sweeper against Dunloy but when McShane dropped Bradley back there for the final, his aerial ability and positional sense set them up. Then, of course, there was his monster score to cement his sides early control. [th All-Star and Hurler of the Year]  – Sean Leo McGoldrick A first award for McGoldrick who has been Coleraines ray of light on their march to the All-Ireland semi-final. It took him one game more, but he matched Cormac ODohertys championship tally of -.Ever-accurate from frees, he offered much more and he landed a super point from out on the wing against Newry Shamrocks in the Ulster final after he had his initial shot blocked. Thats the natural instinct he brings. [st All-Star]  – Cormac ODoherty Still only , the Emmets wizard picks up a fth award. By his own standards, he was quiet in the Ulster final but scored the penalty he won himself. His duck that allowed Gerald Bradley to float over the wonder point highlighted his awareness. He scored - as they downed Kevin Lynchs but its the overall link play that sets him apart. He floats between wing and centre forward, while also popping up behind midfield. [th All-Star]  – Brendan Rogers While making his name as a blistering inside forward, this years campaign saw him play on the wing. It forced teams to reshuffle their plans. He was a puck-out target but still ghosted into scoring positions. His side looked in dire straits in the county final before Rogers manoeuvred his way past the converging Kevin Lynchs defence to land the crucial goal. Pulled a save out of Ryan Elliott in the Ulster final and took Kevin Molloy for three points. [th All-Star]  – Niall Ferris Ferry has already picked up three junior football awards in the colours of Drum. He scored in every league game to help Kevin Lynchs into the top two and clinch a semi-final spot.They were pushed to the pin of their collar against Ballinascreen but Ferris weighed in with -. His goal was fortunate but his positioning was perfect to capitalise on an error by Sean McBride to clinched the game. One of two players to score from play off Karl McKaigue. [nd All-Star]  – Tiarnaacuten McHugh McHugh had an impressive  championship. Derry manager John McEvoy liked what he saw and called the youngster into his plans. He led the Kevin Lynchs attack once again and in the final against Slaughtneil he tormented Sean Cassidy with his uncanny knack of winning possession. When Mark Craigs high ball landed in the square, his presence was enough to put off Morgan McEldowney. After half-time he crashed the sliotar to the net to put the Lynchs in the box seat. [st All-Star]  – Jerome McGuigan Michael McShane has a track record of putting his faith in newcomers and McGuigan paid him back with - from play across four championship games. Scored four times against Lavey to nail down his spot for their pressure-cooker final against Kevin Lynchs. Massive in stature but still has a deft first touch. He gave Dunloy a dferent dimension to consider and allowed the Emmets to build a dferent shape to their attack with Rogers at wing-forward. Edges out Banaghers Tiarnaacuten McCloskey.

They have also been the standard bearers in Ulster and a commanding display against Antrim champions Dunloy saw them lt a third Ulster title. Derry CCCs reformatted structure has breathed a new lease of le into intermediate and junior hurling. Banagher were intermediate champions but, like Lavey and Swatragh before them, they fell short in their Ulster campaign. At junior level, Coleraine were back as champions and romped to Ulster success and join Slaughtneil in the quest for All-Ireland glory next month. googletag.cmd.push  – Daryl McDermott One of the biggest surprises was the fact Sticks has yet to pick up a hurling All-Star, after being selected in the intermediate football team last year. Cool, calm and collected , his puck-outs were the launchpad for Banaghers attacks. Had a slip in their Ulster clash with Naomh Eacuteanna but flawless otherwise and will surely be highly sought out by both John McEvoy and Rory Gallagher. Oisin ODoherty is more than a worthy mention for his Ulster final performance against Dunloy on his comeback. [st All-Star]  – Karl McKaigue The Emmets defender missed out on last years selection but is back to his consistent best. When Ryan Farren scored an early point for Lavey, he was moved across on him and blotted him out. In the final, he was briefed to pick up Niall Ferris and did so with little fuss. He helped keep Middletown to a mere eight points but it was in the Ulster final where he really earned his stripes with an expert shackling of Dunloys Conal Cunning. [th All-Star] googletag.cmd.push  – Paddy Kelly Its a first award since  for the experienced defender who had a selection in the forwards in . He was a vital cog in Derrys defence under John McEvoy and carried his form into club action. Against Ballinascreen in the semi-final, he held Ryan Scullion scoreless. In the final against Slaughtneil he played a captains part. He held Seacute McGuigan scoreless, was immense, repelled attacks and was unlucky to end up on the losing team. [th All-Star]  - Pearse Dallas A first award for the Eoghan Rua defender who caught the eye on their way back to the All-Ireland stage.Of their five championship games, they have shipped just one goal and Dallas has been pivotal to that record. He had a fine outing against Na Magha and hasnt put a foot wrong since, excelling in the Ulster final against Newry Shamrocks – his side’s toughest test to date. [st All-Star]  – Eamon McGill For the second year in a row, Lavey have negotiated the opening round of the senior championship and McGill has been the central figure. Despite defeat to Slaughtneil, he powered his way forward to score Laveys goal.He gets the spot ahead of Mark Lynch, who he edged for man of the match against Banagher. Lavey trailed by seven points but McGills goal led the fightback. When the Feeny men chased the game late on, he was back winning breaking ball in Laveys defence. [nd All-Star]  – Shane McGuigan After being handed a debut by Michael McShane in the  Ulster final defeat to Cushendall, he has been an ever-present in Slaughtneils defence. In a defensive unit thats all about match-ups, he went up against Keelan Molloy in their win over Dunloy. Molloy scored - from play during the season but McGuigan blotted him out and was still able to operate at centre-back. Richie Mullan didnt score from play off him in the county final either. [th All-Star]  – Meehaul McGrath Played at centre-forward as a runner under Collie McGurk for Derry and also had spells up front for his club. In the absence of Paul McNeill, McGrath has been shted back and in his role at wing-back he enjoyed a great season. He kept Corey OReilly to a point from play in the county final. Against Dunloy, he was paired with the strong running and direct Nigel Elliott. He made a goal saving intervention, cut out a dangerous diagonal ball and floated over a point of his own. [nd All-Star] LISTEN - Michael McShane happy for Slaughtneil to silence the doubters...  – Chrissy McKaigue The most decorated player since these awards began, McKaigue picks up a ninth award. In Slaughtneils cause, he leads and everyone follows. He lashed over four points in their facile win over Lavey and in the county final, he shaded a war of attrition against Thomas Brady but he saved his best for last. Once again he was tasked with putting Paul Shiels on the back foot and he did just that with a surging run in the opening moments that set the tone. [th All-Star]  – Gerald Bradley Was hurler of the year in  and followed suit this season. He registered - against Lavey, including the goal that broke them. In the final, it was Bradley who would pop up to win possession after a Kevin Lynchs score. Ballycran didnt play a sweeper against Dunloy but when McShane dropped Bradley back there for the final, his aerial ability and positional sense set them up. Then, of course, there was his monster score to cement his sides early control. [th All-Star and Hurler of the Year]  – Sean Leo McGoldrick A first award for McGoldrick who has been Coleraines ray of light on their march to the All-Ireland semi-final. It took him one game more, but he matched Cormac ODohertys championship tally of -.Ever-accurate from frees, he offered much more and he landed a super point from out on the wing against Newry Shamrocks in the Ulster final after he had his initial shot blocked. Thats the natural instinct he brings. [st All-Star]  – Cormac ODoherty Still only , the Emmets wizard picks up a fth award. By his own standards, he was quiet in the Ulster final but scored the penalty he won himself. His duck that allowed Gerald Bradley to float over the wonder point highlighted his awareness. He scored - as they downed Kevin Lynchs but its the overall link play that sets him apart. He floats between wing and centre forward, while also popping up behind midfield. [th All-Star]  – Brendan Rogers While making his name as a blistering inside forward, this years campaign saw him play on the wing. It forced teams to reshuffle their plans. He was a puck-out target but still ghosted into scoring positions. His side looked in dire straits in the county final before Rogers manoeuvred his way past the converging Kevin Lynchs defence to land the crucial goal. Pulled a save out of Ryan Elliott in the Ulster final and took Kevin Molloy for three points. [th All-Star]  – Niall Ferris Ferry has already picked up three junior football awards in the colours of Drum. He scored in every league game to help Kevin Lynchs into the top two and clinch a semi-final spot.They were pushed to the pin of their collar against Ballinascreen but Ferris weighed in with -. His goal was fortunate but his positioning was perfect to capitalise on an error by Sean McBride to clinched the game. One of two players to score from play off Karl McKaigue. [nd All-Star]  – Tiarnaacuten McHugh McHugh had an impressive  championship. Derry manager John McEvoy liked what he saw and called the youngster into his plans. He led the Kevin Lynchs attack once again and in the final against Slaughtneil he tormented Sean Cassidy with his uncanny knack of winning possession. When Mark Craigs high ball landed in the square, his presence was enough to put off Morgan McEldowney. After half-time he crashed the sliotar to the net to put the Lynchs in the box seat. [st All-Star]  – Jerome McGuigan Michael McShane has a track record of putting his faith in newcomers and McGuigan paid him back with - from play across four championship games. Scored four times against Lavey to nail down his spot for their pressure-cooker final against Kevin Lynchs. Massive in stature but still has a deft first touch. He gave Dunloy a dferent dimension to consider and allowed the Emmets to build a dferent shape to their attack with Rogers at wing-forward. Edges out Banaghers Tiarnaacuten McCloskey.

I knew him from gigs and as a customer of Cool Discs when I worked there. More than that though I felt I knew him more through other people’s recollections of him and to deliver the eulogy I give you me and Mickey’s friends.Joe Brown said: “Derry sadly lost a man you don’t meet every day. There was nothing lying beneath, no agendas, no jagged edges. “A rock solid partner to Breige and an inspirational man of music, art and literature. I saw his band Idol Threat with The Undertones a number of times and became friends with him in the early s, going to gigs. “People were drawn to him and the inspirational effect he had on them. I heard so many bands for the first time through his record collection. I’ll always remember Mickey as a man who embraced le and had an incredible gt of bringing people together, loved a party and kept me from going sane Derry feels like a dferent place without him, every now and then nature conjures up someone very unique and special, who so many had barrels of affection for and who’ll be sadly missed by us all”.Mickey Rooney said: “His flat was always open to the outsiders, his heart was open to all no matter what creed or colour and his mind was always open to whatever experiences came his way”.Raymond Gorman said: “There was definitely no one like him, it took real guts to dress as a punk back in the day, it was a very violent time, Mickey was fearless and hated bullies. The last time I spoke to him he was enthusing about his latest music pourchases and gigs he’d been to. I think he’d be annoyed with everyone being too sad about his passing, remember him with the smile he put on your face when you met him”.Louise McIntyre said: “I first knew Mickey as a teenager growing up in the Brandywell, he was in my older brother’s class in school, I never actually got to talk to him back then as he was a quiet sort. “My earliest memory is looking across at Mickey’s backyard flat roof extension roof and seeing him lying up there with a small radio to his ear listening to his music, even then I knew he was dferent   cool. Several years later we crossed paths again and became a true friend he was doing best man at our wedding. He always remembered birthdays and special occasions. “Mickey stood head and shoulders above everyone  in more ways than one. He was an inspiration and a Derry legend. I somehow hope that he knew this, and that Derry will be an emptier place without him. Thanks for the memories Mickey xx”.Liz Brown said: “One of lasting memories Ill carry of Mickey was his genuine love and kindness towards his friends and loved ones. Like gravity, Mickey had an unseen force that pulled people together and kept their feet on the ground”.Paul McCartney paid a touching tribute in the Journal the day of Mickey’s funeral. “As the s began, you’d usually touch base with Mickey in the town centre on a Saturday. He had a band called The Idol Threats and soon the band I played in, Graffiti, ended up regularly supporting them. I don’t think I saw a local group as musically adventurous until That Petrol Emotion came along. It was a million miles apart from The Undertones and The Moondogs and Mickey was crucial to this process. He wasn’t just the drummer - he was the lyricist also. Just as the music was very involving and mysterious, so, too, were the words and song titles - ‘Lonely Beach Now, ‘Postcard from Abroad’ and the legendary ‘Little Green Men on The Moon.Mickey was a kind and generous guy, but also grateful and reciprocal for everything he received. He remembered everyone’s birthday and was always there with a card or gt. He constantly exuded a spirit of fun and that amazing sense of humour of his was just non-stop and incredible - you simply didn’t know what would come next.“Politics  He didn’t do them, and they did not happen in the many get-togethers in his legendary Abercorn Place flat. I think I can genuinely describe him as an “Enemy of Sectarianism”. When Mickey was cruelly affected by ill health in recent years, this sense of civility never eroded. So lucky are many of us for having this wonderful and inspirational human being around for many years”. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

LSC project is a Peace IV funded programme that The Verbal, in partnership with The Housing Executive, are currently delivering. It’s a four-year programme working across Northern Ireland delivering Reading Rooms to ious cross communities. As the event coincided with International Human Rights Day, guests were also treated to a fascinating workshop led by Roberta Bacic, curator of ‘Embracing Human Rights’ exhibition.  The exhibition uses textiles, namely ‘arpilleras’ to depict a iety of themes including local and international issues, human rights issues and the experience of new communities. As part of the event, which was held on Tuesday, volunteers also took part in a festive-themed Reading Rooms session before having lunch together. Speaking following the event, LSC Programme Director, Andrea Doran said: “Our LSC project is about maximising meaningful community integration by working with others, giving back to the community and developing awareness and understanding. We used Tuesday’s event to give something back to the people who make it possible for us to deliver our programme. We felt that International Human Rights Day was a fitting day to do this.” Concluding, Mrs Doran said: “I would like to take this opportunity to thank all our fantastic volunteers who have worked tirelessly throughout the year to bring communities together. What they have achieved in the short le-time of the project is remarkable. We’re really looking forward to continuing that great work with all our LSC volunteers and groups in the new year.”Gareth Doran, Housing Executive Listen Share Change Northern Sector Co-Ordinator, has also been working with the LSC Project to deliver the Reading Rooms model in the Northern sector. He said: “The first year of this project has been a massive success, and I would like to thank all the groups for their participation in Listen Share Change year one programme and hopefully continuing to engage with them into year two.“Special thanks must go to all the volunteers for the time they invested in the project, their contribution has been amazing,” he said.

From Princess Diana to Strabane-born astronomer Annie Maunder, the audience was treated to a erse and eclectic showcase of women’s histories.Dr Maeve O’Brien, programme co-ordinator of the Herstory Project, said: “This project, and the women whose lives we have profiled, shows that women’s histories – whether of ‘bad’ or ‘good’ women – are alive and well in the minds of women in our community.” Dr OBrien added the showcase showed that women in the North West had a “treasure trove”of stories to tell. She concluded: “It is essential that these stories be written down and recorded to ensure that the lives of all remarkable women – including our own - are never forgotten.”  googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The competition aims to encourage interest in Mandarin Chinese language and Chinas culture, with Mandarin ranked as one of the most vital languages to the UK over the next twenty years.This is the third year the competition has taken place in the North and saw entrants from both groups and iniduals, with abilities ranging from beginner to advanced. Speaking at the competition was Jonathan Stewart, director, British Council Northern Ireland.“Congratulations to all of the pupils from Lumen Christi College who took to the stage today speaking in Mandarin. “Like last year, the standards during today’s heat were very high and we hope again to see some of the students in London for the UK final. This competition allows pupils to demonstrate the hard work and effort they have put into learning Mandarin. It’s really important that more young people have the chance to learn languages such as Mandarin, which provides an important insight into dferent ways of thinking and living. Languages open up exciting study, travel and work opportunities in our increasingly interconnected world.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The result was the Atari Video Computer System .Released in September , the VCS was priced at the hefty sum of around pound – the equivalent of approximately pound today. The first incarnation of the system included a console, two joysticks, a pair of paddles and the Combat game cartridge.There were, however, eight other games available to be sold separately that included – Air-Sea Battle, Star Ship and Street Racer and Breakout. Perhaps the most memorable of all the games of this era was Pong - the two-dimensional table tennis simulator. The game, originally developed as a training exercise in programming for an Atari employee, was one of the earliest arcade video games back in  and proved hugely commercially successful. A separate home version that could be played on a TV was released in .Players controlled game paddles by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen to hit a ball back and forth. The aim was to win by amassing eleven points. A point was won when one failed tothe ball to the other. The game was then included in the games for the Atari VCS two years later.Despite the obvious huge advances in gaming technology in the ensuing four decades the enduring appeal of Atari for people of a certain age remains.

The marketing team charged with selling what was essentially a large foam sphere, emphasised the safety aspect of the product by stating: “You can’t damage lamps or break windows. You can’t hurt babies or old people.” This simple message was very effective because four million Nerf Balls were sold in its first year in existence.  The Evel Knievel Stunt Bike was one of the most popular toys of the decade. Undoubtedly, another of the favourite and best toys of the era was the Evel Knievel Stunt Cycle.Ideal Toys launched its popular line of toy bikes in  and zoned in on the antics of the crazy American stuntman to boost their sales. Knievel made a total of  jumps on his Harley Davidson that year, including a leap over  vans at the start of that year. Whilst Evel is probably best remembered for his spectacular crashes rather than his successes, the sales of the toy did not crash and sold in millions.One of the few toys that made a full-blownto the commercial market  years after its original launch was Stretch Armstrong. googletag.cmd.push  Stretch Armstrong was relaunched  years after his debut in .  Introduced to the world by the Kenner toy company in , the muscular male figure made of laytex rubber and filled with gelled corn syrup allows it to be stretched from its original size of  inches up to around five foot before reverting back to its normal shape.If a tear developed it could be repaired with an adhesive bandage and instructions on how to fix Stretch were included inside the box. Hasbro who bought the brand, very successfully brought Stretch Armstrong back to the market at the New York Toy Fair in .

The mini machines were replenished by refill packs sold at stores such as the now long-gone Woolworth’s chain.  Cadburys honed in on a novel way of selling more chocolate in the s. The dispenser was also marketed on the basis that it had an added attraction of doubling up as a money box. But it’s suspectedthat after a while the chocolate refill packs were consumed without ever having seen the inside of the dispenser with the “saved” two-pence pieces retrieved and spent quickly on something .  Ideals Crossfire table top game was also extremely popular.  First to three goals was the aim in the table top game Crossfire in the s. The object was to push one of the pucks through the opposing player’s goal by firing small metal ball bearings at them using the attached guns.  Star Wars toys are still selling in their millions  years on.  The effect of the Star Wars film series on popular culture has been immense. But with the filmmakers initially dubious about the success of the first film in , manufacturers were seemingly reluctant to launch a toy franchise based on the film.As a result, Star Wars toys were slow to hit the shelves  years ago. When they did, the Kenner company found the demand was enormous and to begin with launched four figures. They expanded the range in  and effectively became a license to print money. But still demand often exceeded supply and the range was often hard to come by. As filming began for The Empire Strikes Back in spring  children were screaming for new merchandise that Christmas. And nothing has changed since.  CHECK OUT THE TOYS WE ALL GOT FOR CHRISTMAS IN THE s All that’s left to ponder about this range is the fate of the executive of the American toy company Mego who took the decision to turn down the chance to manufacture the Star Wars toy range.

If you want to buy an original s Girl’s Word made by Palitoy in good condition, it’ll cost you around pound on vintage toy sellers website. The original cost was pound – roughly the equivalent of what a vintage version will cost you now. Launched in the mid-s, Girl’s World was a brunette or blonde model hair and make-up styling head. She had suction caps on the base so the toy could be attached to a table top whilst hair styling and make-up techniques could be practised.She also had an extraof hair inside the head, a small handle on the side of the base was turned to either make the hair grow or shrink back into the head, allowing her “stylist” to change her hair style orwithout resulting to a pair of scissors. It could also be washed and styled using “human products” without much damage to the hair itself.  Tiny Tears won a Toy of the Year Award in the s.  Tiny Tears was the must- have “hi-tech’ doll of the s. No other toy possessed the ability to wet itself or cry ‘real-le’ tears, nor a baby’s bottle from which the liquid disappeared to produce the aforementioned seepage. Such was the level of innovation of the toy that Palitoy won the toy of the year award for it. Sexual equality has never been an issue for the toy manufacturing industry with its dedicated adherence to commercial gain based on pandering to the pockets of the parents of boys and girls.In the s, The Bionic Woman and The Six Million Dollar Man covered these markets perfectly and won equally huge financial success which was ensured by the importation of the American TV series to these shores.  The Bionic Woman doll cashed in on the success of the hit American TV show of the era.  Starring Lindsay Wagner the show aired between  and . The Bionic Woman series featured Jaime Sommers, who took on special high-risk government missions using her superhuman bionic powers. The Bionic Woman series was a spin-off from the s Six Million Dollar Man television science fiction action series.Like its parent programme, The Bionic Woman spawned its own line of toys. Kenner produced a -inch doll of the character, with similar features to the Steve Austin version , except instead of a bionic eye the dolls head would click when turned, simulating the sound of Jaimes bionic ear. Accessories for the doll released by Kenner included additional fashions, and a Bionic Beauty Salon playset.A metal lunchbox for children was available, as was a vinyl story record produced by Wonderland Records. Kenner produced a series of stickers and temporary tattoos featuring Jaime Sommers inidually and with Steve Austin.  The Space Hopper was invented in Italy in the s.  Considered as much a symbol of the s as much as any other item, the space hopper was actually invented in Italy by a company called Ledragomma which special- ised in manufacturing rubber balls. Essentially, the hugely popular toy was a large heavy rubber balloon with two handles sticking out of the top and was inflated by a bicycle or car tyre pump. Children sat on the top of the hopper, held the two handles and bounced about to their hearts content.

E Football Lumen Christi -Inver College - Derrys Lumen Christi College were crowned Ulster Nannery Cup champions after a hard fought win over Carrickmacross side Inver College in terrible conditions on Wednesday afternoon in Garvaghey. It is only the second time in its history that Lumen have won the competition but went into the final as favourites, having performed strongly throughout the competition.They were - to - semi-final winners over over St Aidans Derrylin - A strong and freezing wind combined with constant rain to make it very dficult for any decent football to be played. googletag.cmd.push However, to their credit, both sets of players did their best to put on an entertaining contest for the large crowd of supporters from both schools. With the wind behind their backs, it was Inver College who started the game more positively.The Monaghan side scored two points in the opening ten minutes. Despite playing into the strong wind, Lumen refused to lie down and took the game to their opponents. Lumen captain Mark Chester hold the Nannary Cup However, clear cut chances were at a premium as the game often got bogged down around the midfield area as players were hesitant to kick it long because of the windy conditions. googletag.cmd.push As the half wore on, Lumen were definitely the stronger side but had yet to convert that supremacy into scores. However, shortly before the half-time break, they got the breakthrough that they deserved. After some neat passing in the half forward line, midfielder Flionn McLaughlin broke through the Inver full back line and smashed the ball into the net, leaving the half-time score at - to - in favour of the Derry team. As the second-half got underway, Lumen would have been hoping to take advantage of the wind and they quickly went about doing to. Two points from Cathal Deery opened up a three-point gap and it looked like Lumen were getting ready to finish off their opponents. However, the game then swung on a pivotal moment. Inver were awarded a penalty and a goal wouldve levelled the game but the Inver penalty taker crashed his shot off the post. It was the boost Lumen needed but the next score was crucial and it soon arrived in Lumen’s favour through another well-taken goal from Flionn McLaughlin. His fellow midfielder Eoin Canavan then got in on the act, scoring a goal and a point to open up a comfortable lead for Lumen.Inver, to their credit, never gave up and continued battling in the closing stages. However, they were unable to register any more scores and Lumen held on to take the title.

The principal cast performed like seasoned professionals, bringing the iconic characters to le with flair and panache.Eoin McGuinness and Ellen McGurnaghan were outstanding in their comic portrayals of Gomez and Morticia Addams, while Annie Haughey and Eoin Moore were superb as the sinister siblings, Wednesday and Pugsley.The hilariously embarrassing grandmother was played by Aisha Oladipupo, and Year  student Conaire Laverty brought endless laughs as the grunting Lurch. Conn Murnin, as Uncle Fester, was a particular audience favourite and his departure on a rocket to seek the love of his le mdash the Moon mdash was a highlight of the show.The ever present long dead Addams ancestors were a tight and focused chorus including a stunning range of costumes from cavemen to flappers. All-American family, the Beinekes, played by Malachy McGrady, Elisha Tumelty and Tomaacutes Harkinleft the audience in stitches as they struggled to deal with ways of the weird and wonderful Addams family. All ended happily ever after, however, as both families moved towards the darkness and embraced who they really were.Featuring an exceptional live orchestra led by Head of Music Celeste McEvoy and music teacher Ciara Coleman, and with magnicent set, costume, lighting and sound complementing the breathtaking musical and dramatic talent of these students, it really was a show not to be missed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Ballynahinch.jpg","title":"Ballynahich Post Office remains  ","story":"RESIDENTS in Ballynahinch will continue to have access to a first class Post Office service in the New Year after all.Days after it was suggested that the current office in Lisburn Street would close temporarily on January , it was confirmed this week that there will be no break in service.The current postmistress will vacate her position on January  with M Retail Ltd taking over the service the following day.Mrs Donna Carlisle mdash who is the current postmistress mdash said everything will continue as normal in the New Year and that there will be no interruption to services.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker, who said last week that it was his understanding that the Ballynahinch Post Office was to close temporarily, is delighted that normal service is to continue.He said post offices are at the heart of communities and are used by a wide range of people, in particular the elderly, who enjoy the face-to-face contact with staff.ldquoBallynahinch is the districtrsquos third largest town and I am pleased that there will be no interruption to postal services, he continued.ldquoMany elderly people prefer to conduct their business at post offices rather than banks.

The boys are all training hard and we are working on a few dferent permutations for the decider, but it will definitely be horses for courses.ldquoTony McIlhone, Jack McLaughlin and Adam and Gareth George will be key for us in the final. Their experience should stand us in good stead, but I have absolutely no doubt that our young players will rise to the occasion, he added.Fitzsimmons paid tribute to Gerard Kelly, who led the team, to Harry Clarke Cup success last season with Kieran Sharvin and who is still in the management team.ldquoIt is a pleasure and honour to work alongside Gerard, who puts so much effort into keeping the club going. We have been friends for many years and work so well together, he said.ldquoWe have come up with a few ideas on how to get at Ballynahinch Olympic, but we will leave that information to the changing rooms in Meadowvale.Barry McGoran and Marty Sloan have moulded Ballynahinch Olympic Town into a force to be reckoned with, despite the fact that they rarely field with the same  every week due to first team call-ups.As a reserve team, people tend to write them off in the big games, but theyrsquove consistently proved that theyrsquore good enough to compete with anyone.The squad has done exceptionally well to get to another final, but they wont be happy until they get our hands on the cup.McGoran and Sloan like to play the same way as Killough and use the tactic of attack being the best means of defence and Barry feels that Olympic arenrsquot far away from lting the trophy.ldquoWersquore only half way there and need to stay focused. We got a bit carried away last year, but wersquove learnt from that. We need calm heads now, hesaid.ldquoKillough will go into the final as favourites.

In addition, roads officials only have eight electricians to repair faulty street lights across the Province, with just five of these working full-time.The crisis facing street lighting repairs has been highlighted this week by South Down MLA Colin McGrath who has been contacted by many concerned residents across the constituency.He said that the government departmentrsquos failure to sanction work to repair street lights mdash which includes replacing faulty wiring and defective bulbs mdash is a major concern for many, in particular, the vulnerable and elderly.Mr McGrath said that while the issue may appear trivial and mundane to some, to a signicant number of others, itrsquos literally is a matter of personal safety.He said many are fearful of injuring themselves due to faulty street lights which plunge areas around their home into darkness.The MLA declared: ldquoThere is barely a street or road in South Down that does not have street lights which are not working. When there are several defective lights in a row, this creates problems.Mr McGrath said that he and his colleagues have been ldquoinundated with repair requests which are passed on to the departmentrsquos street lighting team.He said that while he is full of admiration for the local team who work tirelessly to resolve faulty streetlights in a professional and courteous way, they can only work with the budget they have been given, one which he said falls well short of what is required.ldquoI have written to the Department for Infrastructure and have found out that the budget for street lighting should be poundm a year. It is currently a mere poundm which is totally inadequate and falls well short of what the public expect, declared Mr McGrath.ldquoApparently, there are only eight full time staff managing the work of replacing and fixing street lights across the whole of North and this is wholly unacceptable. Eight staff from Derry toNewry, and Enniskillen to Ballycastle is not enough and represents a situation that demands action.The MLA confirmed that he has also raised his concerns with the permanent secretary at the helm of the government department asking that in the depths of winter and reduced daylight hours, additional funding will be made to address the issue.Mr McGrath added: ldquoWe are literally in the dark over what will happen next and need to see some solution to this problem.A spokeswoman for the Department for Infrastructure has confirmed that officials have discussed the street lighting situation with Mr McGrath.ldquoWhilst we appreciate his concerns, we have explained that in common with many other parts of the public service, the Department continues to face budget challenges and resources are not available to provide for a full street lighting repair service, she continued.ldquoThe Departmentrsquos current budget for street lighting repairs is approximately poundm, which is much lower than the pound.m that would be required to provide a full street lighting repair service.The spokeswoman explained that repairs are now generally limited to those that can be carried out by the departmentrsquos internal street lighting workforce, which consists of five full time and three part time electricians.She added: ldquoDue to the restricted service, outages may take much longer than usual to be repaired, with priority being given to hazardous electrical defects and group outages..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Devaney.jpg","title":"Devaney elected as new chairman of Down GAA  ","story":"DOWN GAA elected a new chairman at the annual convention in Newry last Wednesday evening.

But it is only the only project.ldquoThere is quite a lot we can achieve in other areas, on and off the fields of play. Coaching, refereeing, administration, club development and fundraising will also require our attention, he added.ldquoAnd we also want to have the ambition for our teams to reach their potential and challenge for honours. So, the future has real potential for us, but it will require a lot of support, goodwill and a unity of purpose across the county.

Muriel worked in the office of the now defunct Ulster Transport company.They met on a bus from Belfast to Portaferry and the rest, as they say, is history.ldquoI think we were both on the bus from Belfast and my mother, who knew Muriel, sat beside her and they began to talk and then we were introduced, said Alan. ldquoI was sitting behind and my mother then invited her down for supper the next night.Muriel interjected jokingly: ldquoI was supposed to be going to a shorthand class, which would have made my dear father much happier, but I mitched off and went to the Ritz pictures instead.ldquoHis mother had already spotted me and approved me as a likely candidate for her son as she believed that I knew how to keep house since I was doing it at home as my mother died when I was very young.Alan said that his motherrsquos approval of Muriel very much matched his own.ldquoI had clapped eyes on her before and I thought she will do very nicely for me. It was a private thought, but my mother must have picked up on it and had some insight, he added.Muriel did come for supper the next night and an invitation to a dance was given by Alan. They courted for over a year and more whenever he was home on leave.Alanrsquos parents, Rachel and Ian, were in the next room when Alan later asked Muriel to marry him and they celebrated with tea and supper again.ldquoI was completely flabbergasted but I would say that it was a romantic proposal, recalled Muriel. ldquoAlanrsquos father was great at tending to an open fire in the sitting room and his mother was a great hostess in making scones and cake for supper, so I think just after his father tended the fire, Alan turned tome and asked me to marry me. I think I said yes with a laugh as it was so unexpected.The couple spent the early years of their marriage in Malta where Alan was stationed and where the eldest two sons where born.While the family spent a short time living in Bangor, they have spent the last  years living Downpatrick where Alan went on to work for Radio Rentals in the town, and later in the British Red Cross Society in Belfast, while Muriel worked for the Saul playgroup and later in Downpatrick Library.The couplersquos love of music and going to the theatre, both in Belfast, and at the former Theatre Upstairs, in Irish Street, Downpatrick, was a shared passion over the years.Even today, they both love to watch or listen to concerts on the radio or TV, with performances perking up them up from a trying day or calling on their Alexa to play some Glen Miller music.Muriel said: ldquoWe both love the theatre and we both absolutely love music of all sorts. If therersquos anything that doesnrsquot suit us, we have a wee word with Alexa and say itrsquos your turn to chose.Alan added: ldquoIrsquove often said isnrsquot it wonderful that we have the same tastes in common and thatrsquos a great start to a marriage as well as a good sense of humour and a short memory.Muriel said: ldquoI think it did help that we did like the same things but I would say donrsquot leave it too long before you say sorry for whatever may have happened or been said between you.

Cllr Enrightrsquos assertion has been rejected by council officials.ldquoThe long-standing plans to publicly finance the redevelopment of public lands in Downpatrick town centre have been abandoned, he claimed.Cllr Enright said business representatives who attended the meeting in Downpatrick were not informed that a proposed road linking Irish Street with St Patrickrsquos Avenue as part of a new one-way system was not proceeding.He said such a scheme mdash which roads officials have said is not viable given the cost and the small impact that it would have on congestion mdash would have eliminated the need for traffic lights on all the main junctions and ldquomassively reduced congestion around the centre of town.Cllr Enright claimed that when he queried the decision, he was informed that the councilrsquos priorities are the Ballynahinch bypass and Newryrsquos southern relief road.He added: ldquoAll this comes hot on the heels of the scandalous proposed closure of Downpatrickrsquos visitor information centre in favour of Newry, progressing greenways around Newry but not Downpatrick and the abandonment of the promised Edward Street one-way system, which was supposed to have been delivered on a short-term basis in  until the new council revisited the roads priority list.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman said the local authority has allocated poundm to the Newry City Centre regenerationproject, with poundm secured from the Belfast Regional City Deal, not the poundm quoted by Cllr Enright.She continued: ldquoIt has been proposed that the development of Downpatrick town centre and the old PSNI station should be done collaboratively between local and central government with intervention from other public sector bodies.ldquoThis remains the case. However, the one-way system for Downpatrick town centre was considered by Transport NI who have advised that this is not viable.The spokeswoman also confirmed that a report was tabled to the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourismlast month which considered the future opportunities for visitor information centres within the district.She added: ldquo This report was held lsquoin committeersquo and no decisions have been made by Newry, Mourne and Down Council with regards to the closures of existing visitor information centres.

He has said before that he doesnrsquot have the authority, yet he made the last offer.She stressed that none of the union members wanted to take strike action but felt compelled to do so as a last resort.Speaking as her union entered the fourth week of industrial action, she said: ldquoThe fact that Unison, RCN, Unite and NIPSA are all taking strike action today reinforces the fact that health care staff feel passionately about the preservation of the NHS and want to restore it to a service that they can be proud of again and will last for generations to come.ldquoAgain we ask the public to support us as they have previously and join us in the fight to restore our health service to a high standard.She called on recently elected MPs to fulfil their promises of support at last weekrsquos strike and added: ldquoWe look to our local MLAs, Department of Health officials and the Secretary of State to address these issues now.She said that Unison would like to thank local businesses which provided the striking staff with food and refreshments during this time, in particular Molloyrsquos in Downpatrick  A in Crossgar, and Down Community Health Committee members for their support..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Sinn.jpg","title":"Sinn Fein\u0027s candidate sails home on night of drama at Titanic Centre  ","story":"THE re-election of Chris Hazzard largely went under the radar at last weekrsquos election count in Belfast.Originally due to take place in Magherafelt, the South Down count was switched to the Titanic Exhibition Centre in Belfast in the shadow of the iconic Harland and Wolff shipyard and its imposing Sampson and Goliath cranes which dominate the city skyline.The mainstream media effectively ignored the South Down contest in the run-up to last weekrsquos election and, during the counting of votes across six constituencies in the huge Titanic centre, it was more of the same.Predictably, the media focus was on the North and South Belfast seats where DUP heavyweights Nigel Dodds and Emma Little-Pengelly lost out to Sinn Feinrsquos John Finucane and the SDLPrsquos Claire Hanna respectively.Television cameras were focused on the reaction of the winners and losers in the Belfast constituencies and the arrival of DUP leader Arlene Foster mdash on what was a particularly dficult night for her party mdash and Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald and the republican partyrsquos northern leader Michelle OrsquoNeill.Mr Hazzard, who made history two years ago when he broke the SDLPrsquos -year stranglehold on the South Down seat, was officially declared the winner shortly before .am, but his acceptance speech was brief. As was that of SDLP runner-up Michael Savage.They were the only two South Down candidates who made their way to the podium to thank those who voted for them on a night when Northern Irelandrsquos political environment changed signicantly.With voters across the province electing a majority of nationalist MPs for the first time, it truly was a night of edge-of-the-seat political drama. Itrsquos often said that first itrsquos news then its history, but at the Belfast county centre news and history were inextricably intertwined.Minutes after the South Down result had been declared, the glare of the media spotlight was on official confirmation that the DUP had lost South Belfast.As SDLP supporters and the party faithful cheered loudly for Claire Hanna, the Sinn Fein contingent took a moment out of celebrating Mr Hazzardrsquos victory to watch proceedings.Hazzard was always the favourite for the South Down seat and used a sporting analogy to explain how he felt about the contest. He said favourites donrsquot always win, pointing out how hard he worked on the ground, emphasising that the was never complacent about the challenge he faced from the SDLP.From early in the count, SDLP members said that it looked as though their man was in with a real fighting chance and from the boxes which had been opened, the duo were neck and neck.While some of the Sinn Fein contingent appeared to be sporting furrowed brows early into the counting process, they were always confident that their man would emerge victorious and that he did, albeit with a reduced majority.There were suggestions that unionist voters in the Crossgar area had backed Mr Savage, who was clear throughout his campaign that he would not only be an MP for all, but one who would take his seat in the House of Commons.And while it was reported close between him and Mr Hazzard at one stage, the Sinn Fein man eased ahead in the race to cross the winning line, with the SDLP man left wondering what might have been.He had been given a relatively short lead-in time to last weekrsquos parliamentary pole and while pleased with his performance, he clearly felt he could have done even better and pushed the Sinn Fein man all the way to the line.Elsewhere, Alliancersquos Patrick Brown was one of a number of his partyrsquos candidates who built on their recent success at the EU and local council elections.The Westminster poll was viewed as a key litmus test that would rigorously challenge Alliancersquos recent election surge in a first past the post electoral system which did not rely on the votes of other parties.Mr Brown, who in May trebled his Newry, Mourne and Down Council vote in Rowallane, was at it again. His election agent and fellow councillor, Andrew McMurray, stood for Alliance in  and polled , votes, but Brown more than trebled the Alliance vote, a performance which helped his party leapfrog the Ulster Unionists to become the third largest in the province. Overall, Alliancersquos vote in South Down increased by an impressive . per cent, marking a remarkable performance by Brown.Most signicantly, Alliance now has its eyes focused firmly on securing an Assembly seat and while Mr Brown refused to be drawn on whether he would like his name to go forward should such a contest arise, there is no doubt that he will be the partyrsquos preferred candidate. He left the count centre a happy man his stock within his party continues to rise.Elsewhere, the DUPrsquos Glyn Hanna was pleased with his performance, despite his vote decreasing, and he didnrsquot rule out being the partyrsquos flag bearer in a future Assembly electionthis weekrsquos talks at Stormont fail to restore the power-sharing executive.Ulster Unionist, Jill Macauley, defied pundits suggestions that her party would not do well in South Down, by increasing the UUP vote by almost three per cent.Province-wide, the UUP polled , votes but with a new leader in charge the party did not produce the performance it had been hoping for.

I am so joyful and thankful as is my husband Dermot and our families.Orkambi was made available freely available following a surprise move by Department of Health Permanent Secretary Richard Pengelly at the end of October.Scotland and the Republic of Ireland made the drug free available to CF sufferers earlier but NHS England wrangled with the drug company over price.Once a deal was agreed in England, it paved the pay for Northern Ireland to introduce Orkambi for patients as young as Lorcaacuten, along with Symkevi, which can be given to children aged  and over.Jen was only informed on Monday that the drug was available for Lorcaacuten following a phone call from his treatment nurse.She said: ldquoI was absolutely shaking holding the phone when they told me that Lorcaacuten could get his medication as he has been fighting off the pseudomonas infection since last November.ldquoOrkambi was being given to those children with the higher clinical need and Lorcaacuten got it because of his infection, but I know of so many other families who have campaigned long and hard as we have.ldquoItrsquos just a matter of sufficient quantities of the drug becoming available as I know that the medical teams are working around the clock to distribute to as many patients as they can.Lorcaacuten was observed for five hours in hospital before he was allowed to go home with what his mother calls his ldquomagic medicine. He will need to take it twice daily from now as well as taking his antibiotics and being nebulised several times a day.However, Jen says that studies have shown that children with CF who take Orkambi from the age of six can live with the condition for an extra  years.ldquoThis is not just a Christmas present for this year, but for all the extra years we hope to have with Lorcaacuten, said Jen.ldquoWhilst I love Lorcaacuten to the bottom of my heart, these past three years have been very dficult.

A long, gruelling winter lies ahead.Have you heard the phrase ‘Ne’er cast a clout til May is out ’ The wisdom of that saying has been burned into my memory for many years, since I stood outside on a bitterly cold May day during a protest by journalists. I remember thinking: we are supposed to be on the verge of summer..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Therefore in December it is still another six long months ahead before we can be confident of reasonably warm conditions.And yet early December is not in fact gloomy, due to the seasonal festivities.While the hours of daylight are limited, it does also often seem to be sunny, for reasons that have never been explained to me. Or perhaps it is just an illusion, and we notice sunny December days more than other sunny days, due to the low angle of the sunlight, and the unusual way it can penetrate some rooms.This December has had plenty of sunny days .Yesterday, when I was not working and visited Crawfordsburn Country Park with relatives, it was one of the brighter recent days.As the sun faded. pictured above, it was almost the darkest point in the calendar, just before today, the shortest of the year.But the still blue sky made it seem even more optimistic than an average winter solstice, which in any event I always find a happy time. Now the light is ing and by one measure — hours of daylight — the worst moment of the four seasons is already past.

Yet in Kafaesque style that element of the talks has been as secretive as the Stormont which existed until January .Arlene Foster, Michelle O’Neill and senior civil servants talk about mending their ways and acting to such basic standards of government as minute-taking and obeying the law.Yet it takes greatfaith to believe that largely the same people running largely the same system will produce a markedly dferent result.Ben Lowry: So much for Boris Johnson helping unionists out of a sense of guilt for his betrayal of them Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"We should be sceptical rather than cynical and it is possible that there has been a genuine damascene conversion. The greatest incentive towards improved behaviour is the glimpse of public fury which politicians and civil servants observed over the RHI scandal – followed by the recent electoral punishment for the DUP and Sinn Fein.Allied to that is the realisation that the practices of Stormont ultimately proved destructive. What might in a state of hubris have seemed than an untopplable institution in which the DUP and Sinn Féin would forever be joint masters now must look very dferent on the other side of the RHI Inquiry’s probing into dark corners and three years of powerlessness.However, there is at least one reason to believe thatStormont s in coming weeks it could be even less productive than that which spectacularly imploded three years ago.In , for the first time since , Stormont finally came to have an official opposition, ending a position in which all but a handful of MLAs were members of governing parties.The SDLP, UUP and Alliance joined smaller parties such as the TUV and People Before Profit in sitting outside the government. Thanks to the enterprising John McCallister, Stormont’s rules were changed to ensure speaking time for the opposition and the ability to ask questions of Stormont ministers.What in any other society would be considered the basic building blocks of a democratic system radically altered how Stormont ed, evenmost of us could not fully see that at the time.Recently the respected think tank the Institute for Government published a report on the Stormont vacuum. The authors spent time talking to senior Stormont civil servants and buried in their final report is this fascinating line: “The decision of the UUP and SDLP not to join the last administration created [an opposition] for the first time – exposing the executive to a degree of accountability that officials told us ministers found uncomfortable.”For the first time, the Assembly became a chamber which wielded real power of its own, showing that executive power is only one form of governmental influence. Rather than being subservient to the Executive, the Assembly asserted itself as a genuine forum for debate and for minsters being held to account.Although uncomfortable, that was ultimately in the Executive’s strategic interests it would only surviveseen to be part of a credible institution rather than one which articially shut down challenge. But such a change carried risk for parties unused to such scrutiny and their handling of the new reality exposed the Executive’s inadequacies.It is unlikely that Stormont would have fallen over the RHI scandal had it not been for an opposition harrying ministers, demanding answers, calling witnesses before hearings of Stormont committees and providing an alternative administration.Some people – including perhaps some people in the NIO – might say that the collapse of Stormont is a good argument against opposition.But that is a simplistic understanding of the scale of Stormont’s problems. The entire edice was built on sand andit had not fallen over RHI, it was probably inevitable that collapse would come over something  – and the longer spads, ministers and civil servants acted as they did unchecked, the more destructive they became.\u2028The opposition parties had less than a year and, with the exception of Alliance, fared poorly in the Assembly election following collapse.For that reason, they appear keen to go back in to a new Executive – and Sinn Féin in particular appears desperate to ensure that the SDLP commits to doing so, itself a hint of Sinn Féin concern at facing full-throated criticism rather than the necessarily muted iety possible from a government partner.If that happens, then ironically a Stormont which fell in large part because of secrecy and a lack of accountability could be more secretive and less accountable.And regardless of what happens with the smaller parties, a new Executive is likely to be weaker at the top. Arlene Foster is a greatly diminished figure from the politician who once presided over Stormont like a queen and who – it is now almost forgotten – was for almost a year an exceptionally popular leader of unionism.Wounded after last week’s latest electoral disaster and fighting internally for her career as ious DUP sharks circle, Mrs Foster is both weak within unionism and a leader who is now instinctively loathed by most nationalists.Similarly, Michelle O’Neill carries none of the gravitas of Martin McGuinness and is now in an unprecentedly weak position for a Sinn Fein leader, with a third of her party having recently voted against her and in favour of John O’Dowd while she has shown an inability to make the sort of grand reconciling gestures which became associated with Mr McGuinness in his latter years.This week the efforts at the talks, such as we can discern, appear to be around issues such as an Irish language act and reform of the petition of concern, something which is almost tangential to the scale of the problem.Much is at stake: If devolution is rushed back and fails again, the public may not give it a third chance.try catch  TrendingMan dies after serious two vehicle collision -

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But right now, more and more people in the Vale are being forced to our food bankrsquos doors.ldquoThis isnrsquot right.ldquoWhile our help is needed, wersquore dedicated to ensuring that people in our community without enough money for food are able to access emergency support.ldquoOur vital work in the community has only been possible because of the incredible generosity shown by local people who have donated food, time and funds.ldquoThank you.The Vale Foodbank is particularly in need of UHT milk, fruit juice, tinned meat, and tinned vegetables.The charity has asked for festive donations to be donated in early December at the latest, to ensure volunteers have enough time to process and distribute these donations to people before Christmas. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The station docking was scrapped, and Boeing and Nasa decided to bring the spacecraft home as soon as possible.Flight controllers are working towards a pre-dawn touchdown in the New Mexico desert ndash always the planned landing site but six days earlier than expected. -- vw,vw,px, px\"A failed clock on Starliner put the capsule into the wrong orbit after launch on Friday  --After about  hours in space, the Starliner will fly over Mexicorsquos Baja Peninsula, across northern Mexico and then west of El Paso, Texas, into New Mexico for its touchdown.The orbital demonstration was supposed to be Boeingrsquos chance to catch up with SpaceX, which completed a similar flight test last March.Nasa hired the two companies five years ago to transport its astronauts to and from the space station in the wake of the end of the shuttle programme, but commercial crew flights have been hit by numerous technical problems and delays.Jim Chilton, a senior vice-president at Boeing, said on Saturday that the timing problem in the Starlinerrsquos automated system has since been corrected and the re-entry and landing systems have checked out well.For unknown reasons, the Starlinerrsquos clock did not sync up properly with the timing on the Atlas V rocket that launched the capsule.#Starliner is set to land Sunday at : a.m. MT at @WSMissileRange. On Saturday, Boeing SVP of Space and Launch Jim Chilton said, ldquoMake no mistake, we still have something to prove on reentry tomorrow.

Flight controllers tried sending commands to fix the problem, but the capsule was in a bad position to receive them and there was also a gap in communication coverage.By then it was too late, and there was not enough on-board fuel to permit a space station visit.During a launch abort test landing last month in New Mexico, only two of Starlinerrsquos three main parachutes deployed because of a rigging mistake.Mr Chilton said workers veried the rigging for this Starliner, and Nasa checked photos to make certain.This video shows a key #Starliner Orbital Flight Test objective: separation from ULA Centaur second-stage.

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important. I was delighted we were able to add to our already strong team with the recent addition of four new partners in Ashleen Feeney, Paddy Doherty, Neil O’Hare and Dominic Mudge within our Deal Advisory, Tax and Audit teams.  “My role is to ensure that when I hand over to the next partner in charge, we are in an even stronger position than we are today. That’s the challenge and the goal but given the strong team and our market position, I know that I will relish the opportunity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
