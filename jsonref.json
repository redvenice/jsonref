And while there is evidence of broad disparities in the quality of education these pupils are receiving, the majority are unlikely to return to school before September. For certain age groups though, the school gates opened again earlier this month, meaning that students at pivotal points in their learning could have face-to-face access to their teachers for the first time since March.Before reopening the doors of Bonneville primary school to reception, year 1 and year 6 pupils on 3 June, headteacher Andrea Parker spent weeks preparing pupils, staff and the school building itself for a safe and productive end to the summer term.From installing hand sanitisers and distance markers to iding children into “bubbles” with their own classrooms, equipment and playtimes, Parker took pains to keep staff, pupils and teachers safe.Before her doors were opened to the children, she communicated the changes to everyone involved, including in weekly newsletters and a video hosted by teachers showing pupils what to expect on their return.“To see everyone sticking to the timetable – to see parents coming in and lining up on the 2-metre lines as you planned them to do, bubbles of children moving at the right times, and everything running smoothly, makes me exceedingly proud,” says Parker.“It’s been a community effort, and has taken a lot of hard work from education professionals who’ve spent hours perfecting what we need to do in order to get children back to school – we’ve been living and breathing it.“But the result was that there was no reluctance on the children’s part when they came back – they’re thrilled to see their friends and be able to play with each other. The parents have been very grateful too, and our teachers are really happy to be back.”The safety measures put in place at Bonneville have run as planned, with the addition of Friday afternoon “induction days” for any staff who are returning to school for the first time the following week.“Any teachers who were anxious before coming back were reassured as soon as they saw how everything worked,” Parker says. “So we introduced the induction days to give them the opportunity to walk through and see the school in action for themselves before returning.”“We were apprehensive, obviously, but I was desperate for my daughter to go back to Bonneville because she was getting a bit down at home,” says Miriam Paridjanian, whose 10-year-old daughter Rosa was one of those returning. Paridjanian, who is a qualified teacher, found home schooling “very challenging”, and jumped at the chance for her daughter to be able to work alongside her friends again.“Rosa is normally very bright and bubbly, but she just wasn’t feeling happy,” says Paridjanian. “I had a really hard time motivating her – she was getting a bit despondent and unmotivated, and she didn’t want to do the work.“The school seemed to have prepared for reopening very well – there was lots of communication, and I knew if I had any queries they’d be answered – so whenthe offer came to send her back, I took it.“Psychologically, I think children need that routine of getting ready and leaving the house in the morning, and since we sent Rosa back after half term she’s perked up so much – she’s like a different child. It’s made a difference to the whole family.”Despite some initial misgivings, Rosa is equally happy to be back at Bonneville.“I was excited when Mum told me I’d be going back to school but nervous too, in case it didn’t work and we’d have to go back to being home schooled,” she says. “Some parts aren’t great – we have to eat lunch in our classrooms, then go out to play, whereas we’d usually just all eat together in the dinner hall, which is better.“But I’ve made some new friends, because we all play together in our bubble in the playground now, and lessons are easier to do in school because we’ve got help from our teachers. I also like seeing my friends – everything’s more fun with friends.”With primary schools such as Bonneville reopening, the next stage of the UK government’s plans to bring children gradually back into formal education began on 15 June. Years 10 and 12 are encouraged to receive some “contact time” in advance of the summer break, and exams taking place in 2021.Hinchingbrooke school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, is one of the secondary schools that has reopened its doors to years 10 and 12.“I’m extremely proud of our teachers and the whole army of support staff who’ve worked really hard to make the school safe,” says Andrew Goulding, chief executive of a four-school academy trust that incorporates Hinchingbrooke school.“Teaching is a lot more than just imparting knowledge and giving pupils the opportunity to develop their skills. It’s about supporting iniduals and their complex emotions.“Although Hinchingbrooke and many others have done a great job with online learning, there’s no real substitute for being face-to-face with a teacher, because a good teacher motivates students in ways online learning can’t. Fundamentally, teaching is about human interaction.”To prepare for its new arrivals, the school has split its year 12 pupils into two groups, who attend one day a week on Monday and Tuesday. Similarly, the larger year 10 has been ided into three groups, each attending on Wednesday, Thursday or Friday.Between the year groups, some children will attend school every day of the week, and the system allows the school to manage a large number of students across each week during what are key educational years.“It’s really clear from the feedback we’ve had from parents that they’re desperate for their children to get back to school,” says Hinchingbrooke’s school principal, Mark Patterson. “They need that safety net and routine.“Quite a lot of the students, particularly the younger ones, are struggling with self-discipline. But while it’s important for everyone to be back at school, you have to prioritise those students who are nearer to their national exams, because they’re the first ones who’ll be tested externally next year. Giving them some time in person before the summer, so we can direct their learning, is crucial.”Like Parker, Patterson has prioritised communication to reassure students and ease them back into lessons, via weekly virtual assemblies and video call sessions for each tutor group.“We’re one community, and have had to rise to the challenge of keeping that sense of identity through the crisis,” he says. “But when students come back, it’s a dramatically changed picture from the one they left before lockdown. Familiarising them with school again shouldn’t be underestimated.”Returning children have received a set of safety guidelines, and both students and parents have been asked to sign a contract agreeing to abide by them.Safety measures put in place at the time include red circles marked on the ground 2 metres apart to help with queueing, reorganised classrooms with distanced desks and chairs, and one-way systems to ensure students don’t have to pass each other in close proximity. There’s also signage around the school reminding everyone of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand-washing and keeping their distance.Year 12 Hinchingbrooke student Rheeya Makwana, 17, had to learn how to adapt when she returned to school on 15 June – and so far, she’s pleased to be back.“I can study quite well independently anyway, but it’s better to be back at school,” she says. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom – and although it was obviously quite different being 2 metres away from the teacher, they still tried to teach as normal.“Seeing my friends again was so great, too. During lockdown, I FaceTimed them every day, but it’s different seeing them at school.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

But using his skills to work as a mortuary technician was an experience that had a profound impact“If it was my mum, grandma or son, I’d want someone looking after them”, says ex-Royal Marine commando, Sam Murray, who in April found himself volunteering as a mortuary technician, in response to the strain key workers suddenly faced. Having served in the marines from 1988 through to 1996, Murray had spotted a plea for help from fellow former marine Richard Sharp on social media. As CEO of charity Re:Act Disaster Response (formerly Team Rubicon UK), Sharp had requested military veterans urgently lend their skills to the crisis, which Murray says he was eager to do.“When Covid-19 was starting, I could see it all unfolding and wanted to help,” he says. “I thought: ‘I can’t just sit here, I need to do something.’ I saw they needed veteran volunteers, so I rang Richard up and said: ‘Right, get me involved.’” It meant Murray was given the daunting task of selecting, training and heading up a team of 12 veteran volunteers to work as mortuary technicians for five weeks. Stationing the teams across two hospital mortuaries in the north-west, Murray worked across both for three weeks. What he saw changed his life.Tasked with handling the deceased before taking measurements for their coffins,the volume of work the technicians faced was staggering, he says. “In a normal 24-hour period in hospital you’d have one or two deaths occurring – not including people arriving in ambulances. At the spike, they were receiving 20 a day, sometimes more. I can’t imagine how the technicians did it before we got there.”Any discomfort Murray initially felt was quickly put into perspective. “At first it was horrible and one guy had to leave because he didn’t like it, understandably. Then I thought: ‘Well someone’s got to do it.’” But having previously suffered from depression and PTSD, friends questioned whether the role was a good fit. “People were asking me if it would be good for my mental health and I thought: ‘Well, it is, because I’m doing something.’ If the bodies had suspected covid, we’d put them into sealed coffins, which meant families didn’t even get to see them. I kept thinking: ‘I’m the last person who’s going to see them’, which gave me a sense of purpose and duty, like I was doing something worthwhile. It felt like I was helping my country, really, just as I did in the marines. At least I could make sure they were looked after.”Murray is one of a growing number of veterans who have lent their support during the Covid-19 pandemic. As Johnny Mercer, minister for defence, people and veterans, says: “Those who’ve served in the armed forces have developed a vast array of skills during their career, meaning they can play a huge part now in our national effort to tackle coronavirus. We have seen many veterans making a fantastic contribution during the pandemic, through helping out the vulnerable in their local communities, to running mobile testing sites nationally. We cannot thank them enough for their efforts.”To date, Re:Act has deployed more than 200 volunteers and has helped to ensure 2,700 deceased patients have been cared for, 1,000 hospital beds have been installed and 5.4m PPE items distributed.Now Murray wants to share his experience so we can learn from it. “People need to know that Covid-19 kills people and if you don’t act sensibly, it’s going to happen again. I can see people out and about already forgetting and it can be frustrating when you’ve seen what I’ve seen,” he says.He is passionate about ensuring the work of the mortuary technicians – like the doctors, nurses and supermarket workers before them – is talked about. “Those technicians were on their own before we arrived. I dedicate everything I do to them, they were absolutely amazing, brave and cheerful. That’s the commando ethos – cheerfulness in the face of adversity. They’re incredibly brave, doing a job nobody wants to do.”But while many veterans are volunteering for the first time, Murray is no stranger to this work. After leaving the marines – where he specialised in Arctic warfare – he turned to security and close protection services, running his own surveillance business until last year. “It was a horrible world, but one of the last jobs I did was for an animal rights company,” he explains. “I remember thinking: ‘I’m doing something worthwhile – I’m helping animals and using my skills.’’’ It led Murray to change tack completely, leaving behind his successful business. “I thought: ‘I can’t go back to that world, I’m going to do good,’” he says.Having suffered from poor mental health after leaving the marines, Murray explains he attempted to take his own life five years ago. It meant he was put in touch with armed forces charity Rock2Recovery, which sparked a friendship with Dan Elliot. “I went to hospital and they helped me get back on my feet,” he says. “I formed a friendship with Dan, who is an amazing guy. You can’t put a finger on how many lives that man has saved. I’ve lost four close friends to suicide in the past four years and I’ve been in hospital in various states of PTSD or depression, whatever you want to call it,” he says.Murray’s involvement with the charity – and his friendship with Elliot – opened his eyes to the volume of military and blue light workers also suffering from poor mental health. Now in a stable, healthy place, Murray devotes his time to connecting withthese workers via social media, where he shares videos about his experiences. “There are thousands of people who want help,” he says. “I tell them about my problems and we speak for hours – they’ll call me at night to talk. Many of them have never opened up to anyone before.”They meet in person, too. Having discovered the Wim Hof method – which combines cold-water exposure, breathing techniques and meditation, and Murray credits with saving his life – he invites veterans and those still serving to visit his home in the Peak District, sharing the vital skills and techniques. “They drive hundreds of miles and I take them to the river and we do Wim Hof breathing and jump in the river,” he says. “I’ve had lads and girls saying: ‘You’ve saved my life.’ I think it shows young people that suicide is not the answer and that you can come through the other side. I’m starting to live my life now and I’ve never felt so alive. It saved me, so I teach it.”While his role in the mortuaries has come to an end, Murray is still volunteering with Re:Act, with his latest job safely housing homeless people in nearby St Helens. “I believe this is what I was supposed to do – helping people. It’s my calling”, he says, when asked why he’s doing it. “I think by doing good things and by volunteering, it helps them and it helps me. I also hope that by teaching – and showing people through doing – that they might volunteer more. I’m confident we’ll find positives during this terrible time.”Next, Murray plans to buy a camper van to travel throughout Britain, visiting members of the armed forces, blue light workers and now, mortuary technicians too, to further spread his message and teach the breathing techniques he practises daily. His hope for the country is simple: “During Covid-19, I noticed we’re a community and everyone was looking after the vulnerable and the elderly, which was great but we should be doing that anyway. My message? To keep that going and get people to be kinder, that’s all I’m trying to do.”In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

In 2018, 178mm fell. In 2019, only 127mm fell.So far in 2020, Wild says more than 500mm has fallen on the cattle and wheat property.Photographs Wild took in December 2019 and then again in March 2020 show the area escape from a moonscape of rocks, dust and dry creek beds.“It was probably the longest prolonged dry period in recorded history. We really did get to a dire situation with a lot of these townships looking at day zero and not knowing what was going to happen.”Merenele is now run by a caretaker with Benjamin’s father John, 71, and mother Vicky, 70, living in the nearby township of Warren.Benjamin Wild, an occupational therapist and poet, lives in Lismore, but goes back regularly to Merenele.“I had a really strong affinity with nature growing up,” Wild says. “I was very much attuned to it. I used to collect seeds and rocks and fill up my drawers with all the junk I found.”Benjamin was born and raised on the farm with his two older sisters Julia and Kate, and older brother Tom.“It was just a state of freedom but, on reflection, it’s growing up in a workplace. Mum and dad were always around and I’d be out shooting or doing farm work. It becomes ingrained in you.”In a good year, the farm now runs more than 400 Shorthorn Charolais cross cows but by December 2019 as Benjamin returned for Christmas, they had de-stocked to 50.He remembers taking a picture as he entered one of the property’s main grazing paddocks, with a cow in the foreground.“That was a horrible day – hot and windy. We were out feeding all day and it was filthy. It would blow a dog off a chain,” he says.“That day showed just how bad it could get. Dad has been out there all his life and it’s rare that the ground gets stripped back to the bone.”The farm faced a bill of about $10,000 every six weeks just to feed the cattle.“The biggest commitment is just keeping everything alive,” Benjamin says.Wild’s photographs show the paddocks returning to life, and the creeks and rivers of the property and other spots close by filling with rain.Marthaguy Creek that forms the eastern boundary of the property was a place Wild watched black cockatoos and water rats play. He doesn’t see those anymore.“The saddest thing has been the numbers of tree deaths over recent years. That stands out for me.”Wild says the region has always had variable weather – with cycles of wet and dry – but he feels something has changed.“I feel like a tourist in my own town because I go back and see these extreme changes. It would always get to 38 or 40 degrees (centigrade) in the late summer, but recently it’s been getting up into the 45s and 47s for extended periods.“I hear the climate change denial in people, and I ask them when was the last time the Arctic and Antarctic was melting?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f8e7011fc9799d245c06176a5ac98c515cff672/0_182_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec6223632efd470b6a3a76a838913633","title":"national gallery exile lockdown coronavirus visitor londn","story":"Director unveils coronavirus measures and says visitors can ‘linger’ at London venueAfter the longest closure in its 196-year history, the National Gallery in London will reopen to visitors on 8 July with three one-way art routes of about 25 to 35 minutes through the collections and a promise that people will be allowed to linger.The gallery will be the first big museum to open in England after the government announced it was easing the lockdown from 4 July.Its director, Gabriele Finaldi, said it felt like the gallery was coming “out of exile” after 111 days of closure. During the second world war it was shut for only two days.“All of us at the National Gallery felt a responsibility of reopening as soon as we could. The tradition here is one of resilience, staying open through the war years and so on, so we felt the weight of that responsibility and we wanted to be there for the visiting public as soon as we possibly could.”It will reopen seven days a week with all visitors having to book time slots online. Once at the gallery they can walk through the collection on one of three routes.Route A will take visitors from the Wilton Diptych medieval panel painting via Michelangelo to Raphael route B from Rubens via Caravaggio to Van Gogh and route C from Bronzino via Hogarth to Van Gogh.Finaldi said the routes had been given approximate timings of 25 to 35 minutes but they will not be compulsory. “People will of course be allowed to linger … we want people to feel they can visit the gallery freely.” If a room gets busy staff may ask people to move on.Visitors will be encouraged to wear face coverings and the distancing will be 2 metres. There will also be high-efficiency filters in the air conditioning, perspex panels at visitor desks, enhanced cleaning and hand sanitisers. Toilets will be one in, one out.Finaldi said it was “hugely exciting” to be reopening and symbolic to be first.“We want to be a part of the nation’s recovery story and by opening the doors and letting the public back in to see our inspiring pictures, we want to make an important contribution to the process,” he said. “We are the same gallery you know and love, just with added social distancing and one-way art routes.”How keen people would be to return to galleries remained an unknown, Finaldi said. He pointed to the example of the politan Museum in New York, where it took five years after 911 for numbers to return to normal.Visitors were going to see some changes in the gallery, Finaldi said, including the reopening of its largest room, which houses Italian Baroque paintings, after a two-year restoration.Van Dyck’s monumental Equestrian Portrait of Charles I will be back on show in Room 21 after more than two years, following conservation work.The gallery’s Titian: Love, Desire, Death exhibition, which closed after only three days, will also reopen and has been extended until 17 January 2021.Tate announced it would reopen its four galleries: Tate Modern, Tate Britain, Tate St Ives and Tate Liverpool, on 27 July.Maria Balshaw, the Tate’s director, said: “Art and culture play vital roles in our lives, and many of us have been craving that irreplaceable feeling of being face-to-face with a great work of art.“Our top priority remains that everyone stays safe and well, so we will continue to monitor the situation in the weeks ahead, work closely with government and colleagues, and make all the changes necessary for a safe reopening.”The Royal Academy of Arts will open for “friends” on 9 July and the public on 16 July with its Picasso and Paper exhibition extended until 2 August.

As the UK and EU start from a position of having similar financial services regulation, this should be a straightforward process.“The UK has been able to complete our own assessments on time and we are now ready to reach comprehensive findings of equivalence as soon as the EU is able to clarify its own position.”There are concerns in the British government that the EU wants to delay a decision until there is clarity over the ongoing negotiations over a trade and security deal.It is understood that the government received 1,000-plus pages of questions in April and May, with the last 248 pages arriving on 25 May.British officials are understood to be frustrated that the questions posed are fara broader in range than necessary for an equivalence decision to be reached.If Brussels decides that the UK’s regulatory regime is equivalent to its own, market access to British companies is expected to follow. But Barnier, in his appearance via video message at the thinktank event, appeared to confirm Britain’s fears over the EU’s motivation by suggesting that Brussels wanted to be able to take into account the wider picture.“These assessments are particularly challenging,” Barnier said. “Firstly, because they have to be forward-looking, given the UK’s publicly stated intention to erge from EU rules after 1 January 2021. Last week, the UK published a paper on its future regulatory framework for financial services. This is a useful document. We are now analysing it in detail to gain clarity on how UK rules will evolve.He added: “But let us have no illusions: the UK will progressively start erging from the EU framework. This is even one of the main purposes of Brexit.”The row broke out as the UK’s chief negotiator, David Frost, and Barnier resumed talks over a comprehensive free trade deal, their first face-to-face meeting in Brussels since February.The equivalence decision is outside the negotiation, but the two teams are seeking to agree on a form of cooperation on regulation of the financial services sector.Barnier said he could not accept the UK proposals, which he described as seeking “the benefits of the single market without the obligations”. He accused the UK of trying to limit the EU’s ability to unilaterally withdraw “equivalence” in the future – a claim British officials denied, saying they were merely looking for ample warning and assurances of equitable treatment.Barnier also said the UK government was trying to “make it easy to continue to run EU businesses from London, with minimal operations and staff on the continent”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/325dad4e06cae9a2530b7cb7f87e51a167319306/0_203_3038_1822/master/3038.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3553b306deaff6be42b5276f6273f7aa","title":"tesla shareholders urged to oust elon musk over 55bn pay deal","story":"Adviser Pirc says Musk’s pay and Twitter outbursts pose ‘serious risk of reputation harm to the company’ Tesla investors are being urged to vote to remove Elon Musk, the electric company’s founder and chief executive, from the board of the firm as anger mounts over his bonus deal that could pay him a record $55.8bn (£40bn).Pirc, an influential adviser to shareholders, including the UK’s local authority pension funds, on Tuesday recommended that investors voted against Tesla’s executive pay deal because it “unfairly enriches the chief executive”.Pirc said the deal had exposed the company to a lawsuit, alleging that: “The board, including CEO Elon Musk, awarded themselves excessive compensation packages over a three-year period that allegedly allowed directors to ‘enrich themselves at the company’s expense’.”The shareholder adviser called on investors to vote against re-electing Musk to the board because of the pay deal, and warned he posed “a serious risk of reputational harm to the company and its shareholders”.Pirc said Musk’s frequent controversial outbursts on Twitter had cost Tesla millions of dollars in settlements and also represented an “unnecessary reputational risk to the company”.Last year Musk was sued for $190m in defamation damages over derogatory tweets about the British caver Vernon Unsworth, who was helping to rescue 13 people trapped in a Thai cave. A jury found the tweets did not reach the legal standard for defamation, and Musk was not found liable for damages.In 2018 the US Securities and Exchange (SEC) regulator fined both Musk and Tesla $20m over the chief executive’s tweets that he planned to take the company private at a substantial premium to the share price, causing the stock price to surge. As part of the settlement with the SEC Musk was forced to give up his position as Tesla’s chairman.The SEC ruled: “In truth, Musk knew that the potential transaction was uncertain and subject to numerous contingencies. Musk had not discussed specific deal terms, including price, with any potential financing partners, and his statements about the possible transaction lacked an adequate basis in fact.”Pirc said the episode had “prompted accusations of stock market abuse, with the SEC alleging that Musk had lied to investors. Mr Musk and Tesla settled these claims with the SEC, paying $40m, causing financial damage.”Pirc’s shareholder report also raised concerns about Musk’s tweets in opposition to Covid-19 lockdown measures. “Mr Musk has been a vocal opponent of the Covid-19 quarantine, and reportedly required workers to return to work during quarantine, without sufficient precautionsprotections and despite protests from workers,” Pirc said. “This concern is furthered as it has also been reported that multiple Tesla employees have tested positive for Covid-19 since returning to work.”Investors were also urged to vote against re-electing Robyn Denholm as Tesla’s chair. She succeeded Musk when he was forced to step down in November 2018. Pirc said she should step down because of her role overseeing Musk’s pay award as independent non-executive chair and as a member of the remuneration committee.Tesla’s annual general meeting was due to take place on 7 July, but the company on Sunday delayed the vote until September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7640a0803dca9fc9407a733a65ed78c2147da0c7/0_267_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=54b725eef9873c34d68731d6166bd3f2","title":"the future may be v shaped but it would be rash to count on it","story":"Sadly, it’s very easy to see how the early stirrings could be crushed by a surge in unemploymentIt’s obligatory these days, even if you’re the chief economist of the Bank of England, to play the game of ascribing a letter to the likely shape of the UK’s economic recovery, so here’s Andrew Haldane’s take: “It’s early days, but my reading of the evidence is so far, so V.”As a headline-grabber, it is excellent. Most of the forecasting world rejected the V-shaped thesis weeks ago. The IMF, as it knocked another chunk off its global GDP forecast for 2020 last week, summed up the mood: “A crisis like no other, an uncertain recovery.”Haldane’s V-shaped claim, though, is supported by evidence, albeit of the sketchy “fast indicator” variety, meaning payments data, business sentiment surveys and suchlike. But the chief economist is right: those indicators currently suggest a materially faster recovery than the Bank was expecting in May.That, though, is not much of a boast. In case anyone imagines a V-shaped recovery is now in the bag, read the rest of the speech. Two paths are possible in the second half of this year, said Haldane, and they lead to very different outcomes. One is the happy route of higher spending and lower unemployment. The other is the reverse – higher unemployment and lower spending. “As things stand, it is unclear which of these scenarios, or feedback loops, will prove the more potent,” said Haldane.Yes, an awful lot now rests on the labour market. It is, unfortunately, very easy to see how the early V-shaped stirrings could be crushed by a surge in unemployment as the Treasury’s furlough scheme is wound down – it is due to taper from August and finish at the end of October. July has arrived already and still the number of furloughed workers is rising – up by 100,000 to 9.3 million, the Treasury said on Tuesday.So take Haldane’s eye-catching V-shaped remark for what it is: a description of the early action in a long game. While the outlook may have improved since May, risks “remain skewed to the downside” and it’s vital to avoid “a repeat of the high and long-duration unemployment rates of the 1980s”.Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, should take note. He’s probably delighted somebody’s talking about V shapes, but it’s the next step that matters. The biggest short-term danger to the recovery is that the end of furlough causes a relapse. Sunak should be prepared to extend if necessary for those sectors where demand can be expected to return within a reasonable timeframe. That would be a more useful measure than his boss’s weak attempt to dress up old infrastructure announcements as a “new deal”.The airline and aerospace industry, unfortunately for those employees whose jobs are now at risk, is probably not one where extra furlough support from government would make a meaningful difference. Demand is not coming back soon.There was a feeling of inevitability about Airbus’s extreme restructuring, which envisages 15,000 job losses, including 1,700 in the UK. Less demand for flying means fewer orders for planes from cash-strapped airlines. If, as the entire industry seems to agree, it will take until 2023 to recover 2019’s level of activity, survival means fewer workers.“Airbus is facing the gravest crisis this industry has ever experienced,” said chief executive Guillaume Faury, echoing last month’s analysis from engine-maker Rolls-Royce, which is cutting 9,000 jobs from its commercial aerospace ision.The best way for the government to limit the damage to the UK engineering base is to accelerate demand in the sectors it can control. So bring forward defence orders, speed up investment in renewable energy, and so on. And do it quickly.Three years after merger, Standard Life Aberdeen is back in the fresh start game. Stephen Bird, a Citigroup long server, will be the new chief executive, replacing Keith Skeoch, one of the architects of a deal that, in share price terms, has underwhelmed.Picking an outsider looks wise since, whatever the official script says, tribal loyalties always take longer than three years to fade. The asset manager fudged the issue at creation by having Skeoch and Matin Gilbert perform an awkward “co-executive” dance, which never works.Bird arrives with a reputation as a digital whiz (essential these days) but it’s really now up to the fund managers to produce the goods. Current choppy markets, with uncertainties in every direction, ought to provide fertile conditions for active managers to beat the passive tracking brigade. If SLA can’t step up in this climate, it never will."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4a979f2a1e6793f53d3420cf52aa23ddd618566/0_194_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1baaeb799a48fdb28880e119c33d59cd","title":"leicester local lockdown","story":"No one really knows why coronavirus has hit our city again so hard. All we can do is sit tight in the rooms we have grown tired ofOn a traffic island to the west of Leicester, my adopted city, a small replica of the Statue of Liberty stands and guards our freedoms. A plaque explains that she was not placed there out of pro-American feelings, but as a gesture by the manufacturer of liberty bodices, which once had factories nearby.I walked past the statue this morning after hearing the news that Leicester would return to local lockdown as the rest of the UK opened up from Saturday. When I got home, I saw a post on Facebook suggesting that outbreaks of coronavirus in the city can be traced to the factories that sustain Leicester’s now diminished rag trade. And the Conservative MP for North West Leicestershire, Andrew Bridgen, has said the garment industry was partially to blame for the outbreak. Small, non-unionised, heavily staffed by non-English speakers: these factories make a good scapegoat, but few of us will ever know the truth about why Leicester became a hotspot for Covid-19. Still, with information in short supply, people invent their own.For the past few weeks, I’ve been awaiting news of when I’ll be allowed to visit my partner’s house. We live separately during the lockdown, when we’ve relied on the company of housemates and have been deprived of much contact beyond a Regency-style constitutional walk, we’ve counted the days until home visits are permitted. When the government announced that old freedoms would return from 4 July, we exchanged ecstatic texts.A few mornings later, I woke to a message from my mum informing me that Leicester might be facing a fresh outbreak of coronavirus cases. “I doubt they’ll sort it out in time,” I replied, “it’s not like there’s been great organisation so far.” Still, I started to keep my eye out for reports. My partner, who works in libraries, mentioned she’d heard talk of a local lockdown. No one seemed to know exactly what this entailed. I stopped planning a celebration for 4 July.The was more confusion than clarity in the week before the lockdown was announced. One moment the home secretary, Priti Patel, was suggesting that Leicester was definitely facing lockdown, the next our mayor, Sir Peter Soulsby, was saying it was the first he’d heard of it. Soulsby reportedly said he’d received an email in the small hours with information about the lockdown, but said he had been unable to access the data to assess the situation himself. I found myself hoping guiltily for official incompetence to save us from more time indoors. Months of bored isolation had to come to an end. Rumours began to swirl about which parts of the city were infected. The north, the east young people, old. Some places had never closed down – others were about to.When the first wave of lockdown ended, people no longer walked in defensive, hunched-up shuffles. The streets were quieter than before the lockdown, the meadows emptier of people doing their daily exercise, but people ambled along as though they were no longer at risk. Cyclists started using the roads again. Today on my morning stroll, it felt as though paranoia had set in. Leicester was closing again before it had really opened. I spoke to one shop assistant who said he was waiting to hear from his manager about whether to come to work next week. He had been told nothing about any plans for a local furlough scheme (it has now been confirmed that there will be one). My partner was at work preparing for libraries to be re-opened. They were still waiting for official confirmation this wouldn’t be needed. No one seems to be in charge.Leicester is poor, in some parts shockingly so. It has a multiethnic population with large groups of people who are at heightened risk from the virus. It has factories that have stayed open and workers who travel to them by bus. We have an inconvenient habit of voting Labour. If anywhere was going to suffer, it would be Leicester. For now, we sit tight in rooms we’ve grown tired of, missing our loved ones and jumping at any news. It can only be a matter of weeks, we tell ourselves. Leicester has always felt left behind. It took coronavirus to make that a matter of fact.• Rob Palk is the author of Animal Lovers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac96d8471195bf44ce18d8ef955d21072685d210/0_89_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=058f345a3f144d5e57d2f0ac68393f6c","title":"the switch to cloud how public services are becoming more agile and innovative","story":"The cloud offers the scope for a more responsive, flexible approach to delivering online services – enabling government departments to innovate in ways that were once beyond their reachYou may have noticed it’s a lot easier these days to get things “done” online with government departments. After years of relying on the public to post forms or queue in an office to pick up the right documents, government bodies are now using the cloud to launch services which in the private sector would probably make headlines for being years ahead of their time.Whether it’s filing and paying taxes online, renewing a passport, booking a driving test or registering to vote, online services are instantly and seamlessly connecting citizens with the information and services they need in their daily lives. When they are accessed, users are also finding data is being freed from silos so the latest information is made available and acted on.The Driver and Vehicle Safety Agency (DVSA) is a good example. Deloitte has developed an innovative app for the organisation that allows assessors to check and record all aspects of a vehicle’s safety digitally, reducing processing times and removing the risk of lost paperwork. It can scan licence plates for immediate access to a vehicle’s test history and take and upload photos of any faults. When a vehicle passes, it is certified instantly.This is a classic use-case for cloud technology. Opening up access from any mobile device or location ensures the safe and efficient transfer and processing of safety information, and means enforcement teams out on the roads have up-to-date data at their fingertips, so they can more easily identify unsafe and non-compliant vehicles. And, using only serverless technologies means it’s infinitely scalable and cost effective.Mobile services such as this would not be possible without the cloud. It enables a new way of developing solutions to support business challenges and it frees up an organisation from traditional functions such as hosting and servicing data centres and patching software, allowing services to run via a third-party platform and empowering employees to focus on more value-added functions.According to Kerry Appleton-Norman, partner for public sector cloud at Deloitte, the appeal of this approach comes down mainly to speed, flexibility and, sometimes, cost.Moving to the cloud not only saves time on purchasing and managing physical environments, it also opens up access to a suite of software on the internet as a service. It is far quicker to amend these to an organisation’s requirements, rather than have software written from scratch. “Traditional procurement and development processes could take several months, by which time an organisation’s needs may have moved on,” Appleton-Norman explains.By moving to the cloud, Appleton-Norman has found that Deloitte’s public sector clients are able to embrace the pioneering attitude found at exciting startups where new ideas can be tested at breakneck speed.“The cloud empowers companies to be part of the new wave of fail-fast, agile development,” she says. “With the cloud you can leverage the necessary storage capacity very quickly and there are usually software packages you can try out and adapt that already work on that platform. The real beauty for organisations is that the technology enables them to get pilot projects set up really quickly. If they work, it’s great, if they don’t, they can be shut down immediately with no extra expense incurred.”This flexibility applies to the server space required, too. One of the drawbacks of traditional software development has always been that a server would be commissioned and set up to permanently handle the peak flow of traffic it needs to deal with.“You would typically end with situations where a computer system was set up to be able to permanently work at maximum performance, but that’s just not necessary all year round,” says Appleton-Norman.“It works out way too expensive to have that capability available to you all the time when, say, a tax authority only needs to handle their maximum level of traffic around particular deadlines at known times of the year. Most organisations will have peaks that are far more efficiently handled by moving to the cloud where capacity can be dialled up or down as needed, it doesn’t have to be permanently available.”Experience of working with public sector bodies has shown there is more to digital transformation than the project at hand. One of the biggest impacts is a change in how the organisation serves the public and this often changes the roles of employees. For this reason, Appleton-Norman believes they need to be aware of the need for strategy and to consider the knock-on effects of what they are trying to achieve.“Most organisations start out considering the cloud as part of their digital transformation work, they generally want to work more efficiently and provide new frictionless online service to the public,” she says.“The thing they don’t always realise, without guidance, is that the programme will impact their entire organisation, it’s not just about servers and software. If you’re rolling out new interfaces that staff or the public use, you will also need to look at how to best structure your organisation to do this and how to equip your staff with the right skills to execute. A move to the cloud is part of a broader organisational transformation, and organisations need to understand how this will often require a change to the culture of the organisation. How can you support increased collaboration, how do you deal with more focus on the citizen, what are the new roles and responsibilities that are going to be created?”This extra strategic perspective empowers public sector bodies to test and launch innovative services that make citizens’ lives much more convenient while also getting the most out of IT budgets. Forward planning also makes sure that the organisation’s employees are prepared for their changed roles in serving the public in a new way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cc208e6aa4dc5b5e2206c479f41f1534dc2a1d5/0_75_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0391a78063bb4a36cf45de536197cb01","title":"ban burning and burying of animals in us covid 19 farm culls ngos urge","story":"As coronavirus forces many farmers to cull their animals on-farm, burying animals in unlined pits or burning them in open air pyres could pose risk to the public, activists argueAs the row over mass animal cullings in the US continues, public and environmental health NGOs are asking the government to ban two livestock carcass disposal methods – burying in unlined pits and burning in open air pyres – until the Covid-19 pandemic is “resolved”.Risks to the public from the methods, say the groups, include increased air pollutants such as carcinogenic compounds, or bacterial and fecal matter leaking into local water ways.The coronavirus crisis has hit the US’s largest slaughterhouses particularly hard. As a result, there is a lack of slaughter capacity, and farmers are being forced to cull their animals on-farm.About 10 million hens have already been killed and the pork industry warned in May that 10 million pigs could die by September.More recent estimates, said Iowa Pork Producers Association spokesperson Dal Grooms, suggest the pig figure is far too high, however.“Right now, one analyst says 2.1 million hogs have ‘disappeared,’” Grooms said. “We know those all weren’t euthanised, because we heard countless stories from across the US where pork producers were working on innovative ways to keep pigs in the food supply, including donations to food banks and private sales to iniduals who wanted to have that closer connection to their food.”Jim Monroe, the spokesperson for the National Pork Producers Council (NPPC), called the petition, filed with the US Department of Agriculture and Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS), on 29 June by NGOs including Center for Biological Diversity, Earthjustice and the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), “an attempt by anti-livestock agriculture activist groups to use an unprecedented crisis to pile on hard-working farmers during a very challenging time”.Monroe said: “Pork producers follow all appropriate human health and environmental protocols for safe disposal and have been working with federal and state authorities to address this crisis since it started.”The NGOs fear that “under-regulated and poorly monitored animal disposal during the pandemic” will create serious public health risks. Where animals are incinerated on farms, “on-site incineration by pyre” risks exacerbating the air pollution, which is “a factor linked to higher Covid-19 death rates.”Pollutants emitted during open air incineration, it said, include “carcinogenic compounds associated with reproductive, developmental, and immune system problems”.For unlined burials, where there is no barrier between animal carcasses and the soil, “there are health risks from bacteria and fecal matter leaking into the water table,” said Hannah Connor, a senior attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity.To make it easy for people to find out if carcasses are buried or burned near homes or water supplies, the petition asks APHIS to create an “electronically searchable and sortable database”.For chickens, said Connor, one of the main cull methods is foaming. “Foam can have PFAS in it, that’s the family of chemicals that includes PFOA and PFOS. PFAS chemicals are linked to a range of health issues including cancers, kidney problems and suppressed immune systems.”Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, are sometimes called “forever chemicals”. A recent film, Dark Water, inspired by a true story, portrays the damage done by PFOS to people in the West Virginia town of Parkersburg, starting in the 1950s. The PFOS, or C8, was used in the manufacture of Teflon.“These chemicals are harmful even in extremely low levels and very persistent in the environment,” said the senior NRDC attorney Valerie Baron.Neither the American Medical Veterinary Association (AVMA), which publishes depopulation guidelines, nor USDA-APHIS replied to questions about PFAS in foams used for depopulation. Nor was there an immediate response from chicken trade body, Delmarva Poultry Industry (DPI). DPI has previously been unresponsive to questions about culls and methods.NRDC staff scientist Anna Reade said “nothing prevents industrial animal producers from using PFAS containing foam, which is firefighting foam, for poultry depopulation, and we have heard reports it is happening. Most foams on the US market contain PFAS.”The USDA-APHIS spokesperson did confirm it received the petition. They said the department “will look into it. At this time, that’s all of the information we have available.”The petition gives USDA-APHIS seven days to respond. If nothing is done by then, Connor said the NGOs will consider going to court.In a separate US development, 12 animal activists are facing charges including burglary and misdemeanours related to a recent undercover video investigation of a mass pig cull in Iowa using an approved cull method called Ventilator Shutdown Plus (VSD+). The method involved shutting down pig shed ventilation and introducing steam to cause death by hyperthermia.On 19 June, local Iowa paper the Des Moines Register reported that the pork producer where animal rights organisation DxE said it filmed the VSD cull had stopped using the method. The producer did not respond to emailed questions or calls.Send us your stories and thoughts at animalsfarmed@the• This article was amended on 30 June 2020 to correct references to PFOA chemicals when PFOS was meant."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fbd8bd9ab2cb273955b3671a8eae0f6fdb86c55/0_313_4032_2421/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9bb578bd78933b7e64026d0c3328cf68","title":"earths final frontier the global race to map the entire ocean floor","story":"An ambitious project to chart the seabed by 2030 could help countries prepare for tsunamis, protect marine habitats and monitor deep-sea mining. But the challenge is unprecedentedOn a wall facing Vicki Ferrini’s desk hangs a giant map of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. At 6ft by 8ft, it’s the largest size available on the printer at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, where she works as a geoinformatics researcher. “I of course want it even bigger,” she says.The map is busier than a usual world map. Rather than showing featureless, flat blue ocean, here the seafloor bursts with detail: mountains, canyons, channels and plains that resemble the texture of land. Ferrini encourages her staff to print pictures of the seafloor features they’re researching and tack them to the map. One example off the coast of Argentina shows ripples in the seafloor reaching a hundred metres high. The map has a distinctly Sherlock Holmes-about-to-break-a-big-case look to it. “I’m trying to see the scale of the ocean,” she explains. “The big picture – but also the fine details.”Mapping requires an ability to see the forest as well as the trees – or in this case, the coral as well as the sea. It’s a particular challenge when it comes to the ocean, the vast majority of which is not just unmapped, but unknown. Ferrini’s map is humanity’s best effort to date: a crucial document in what has become a race to map the entire seafloor by the end of the decade.The stakes are high. A series of reports have warned of the ocean’s impending collapse. The First World Ocean Assessment, published by the UN Environment Programme in 2015, revealed that the ocean’s very ability to function was in jeopardy. The following year, an OECD report estimated that the ocean economy employed 31 million people full-time and generated $1.5 trillion each year. Maps – or the lack thereof – play a role in nearly every critical ocean issue, from sea level rise to ocean acidification to bioersity.It’s often said that humanity knows more about the surface of the moon than we do the seafloor. It seems astounding that faraway planets can be more accessible than our own. But we tend to skip over why it is so difficult to map the seafloor: there is a massive obstacle in the way called the ocean. Light travels far and fast in space, but the laser altimeters that we use to chart celestial bodies are ineffective in water – the lasers are simply absorbed.Sound, on the other hand, travels more efficiently underwater than it does in air. The gold standard for seafloor mapping today is a multi-beam echosounder, which can be attached directly on to the hull of a ship. The device sends down a fan of sound waves, which computers decipher into a three-dimensional portrait of the seafloor’s shape and composition. Additional techniques also collect water temperature and salinity along the way.It is slow work. Ferrini recently sent another version of the map, this one blacking out all the uncharted ocean today. The coastlines were lit up with data. So, too, were well-traversed shipping lanes. The rest sat in darkness, except for a few pinpricks of light.Few countries need accurate maps of the seabed more than Japan, an island nation whose future is uniquely intertwined with the ocean’s, and it is the Nippon Foundation , a Japanese non-profit organisation run on the gambling proceeds of motorboat racing, that is backing Seabed 2030 with $2m every year. In the past, the foundation has addressed thorny global challenges such as eliminating leprosy or fighting food insecurity, and a complete seafloor map fits within its mandate, as well as Japan’s wider national interests. Seabed 2030 would improve Japan’s fisheries management and its tsunami and typhoon preparation, as well as clarify territorial claims in the South China Sea.But the mapping is a truly global collaboration, public and free to use, ided among four regional centres. The Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany took the Southern Ocean Stockholm University and the University of New Hampshire cover the North Pacific and Arctic New Zealand’s National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research are responsible for the South and West Pacific Ocean. That leaves the largest swath, the entire Atlantic and Indian Oceans, to the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University – Ferrini’s team.The finished map itself is created by a fifth centre, based in the UK: the British Oceanographic Data Centre in Southampton. It collects the analysed data from the four centres and compiles it in the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (Gebco). The data is in the public domain, free to use, adapt and commercially exploit.It is making remarkable new discoveries all the time. Off Florida, a reef of mid-ocean corals turned up in the Gulf of Mexico, a shipwreck. A forthcoming study on ice sheets will use Gebco to unpack how the ocean influences melting and raises sea levels. Where Gebco could be used in deep-sea mining, however, would be to help the ISA to better regulate the industry, he says – something of a double-edged sword, depending on your point of view.Another potential controversy is whether mapping introduces more noise to an already noisy ocean. Air guns, naval sonar and shipping traffic are increasingly edging out marine mammals that rely on sound to hunt, navigate and communicate. New research from graduate student Hilary Kates Varghese at the University of New Hampshire revealed that the multi-beam echosounders used by Seabed 2030 did not disrupt the feeding behaviour of Cuvier’s beaked whale, one of the more sonically sensitive marine mammals. However, research biologist Annamaria DeAngelis at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration pointed out that because Seabed 2030 is mapping the entire ocean, “more studies will be needed to expand our knowledge of how their particular echosounders will affect marine mammals in a variety of habitats.”One way to reduce noise is to crowdsource from ships that are already charting the ocean. When the multimillionaire Victor Vescovo went on a mission to reach the deepest point of all five oceans, Seabed 2030 mappers collected soundings along the journey. Other industry partners are donating whatever data they can. Crowdsourcing is crucial – from cruise ships, hydrographic offices, even weekend boaters with a decent sounder. By itself, a single ship would need 200 years to map the rest of the uncharted seas.However, “sharing data is a little taboo”, says Tinah Voahangy Martin, a member of Ferrini’s staff who often approaches institutions located on the Indian Ocean to ask for seafloor information. Seafloor data is often considered proprietary, classified or simply too valuable to give away. “You don’t want to be the person who comes in and says ‘Hi, you do this and we expect this.’ You take them on as a partner. That’s the best way to get them involved.”Ferrini adds that, because science in the US is often taxpayer-funded, it creates the expectation that data will always be freely available. “We have to remind ourselves that the whole world doesn’t work that way, and figure out how we can make it mutually beneficial.”Nevertheless, at their rate of progress, the finish line of 2030 seems possible. But completing the map on Ferrini’s wall is just the beginning. “There’s still so much more for us to do and know than the shape of the seafloor,” she says. “This is just one piece of a much bigger picture.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd738fbb29e66c1eecb81cef5279e12744bc226e/0_8_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f86e167b9385e08c6ee9ab74df32643","title":"likelihood of 40c temperatures in uk is rapidly accelerating","story":"Such deadly heat may become regular occurrence later this century, scientists findThe likelihood of the UK experiencing deadly 40C temperatures for the first time is “rapidly accelerating” due to the climate crisis, scientists have found.The research shows that such searing heat could become a regular occurrence by the end of the century unless carbon emissions are cut to zero. Global heating has already made UK heatwaves 30 times more likely and extreme temperatures led to 3,400 early deaths from 2016-19.The highest temperature recorded in the UK is 38.7C, set in Cambridge in July 2019, while the summer of 2018 was the joint hottest on record. The new analysis found an increasing risk of even higher temperatures.Greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, forest destruction and other human activities are trapping heat and putting more energy into the climate system.\u0026nbspHotter air means heatwaves are much more likely. For example, scientists now say the unprecedented heat and wildfires across the northern hemisphere in 2018 “could not have occurred without human-induced climate change”. In Australia, the scorching summer of 2016-17 in New South Wales was made at least 50 times more likely by global heating, linking it directly to climate change.Hotter air can also carry more water vapour, meaning more intense rain and more flooding.\u0026nbspAnother important factor in the northern hemisphere is the impact of changes in the Arctic. The polar region is heating more rapidly, reducing the temperature difference with lower latitudes. There is strong evidence that this is weakening the planetary waves (including the jet stream) that normally meander over Europe, Asia and North America.When these waves stall, weather gets fixed over regions and becomes extreme. This has been linked to past floods in Pakistan, heatwaves in Russia and drought in California.\u0026nbspMost of the planet’s trapped heat goes into the oceans and rising sea temperatures mean more energy for hurricanes and typhoons. Record-breaking cyclones hit Mozambique\u0026nbsplast year. The deluge delivered in the US by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was made three times more likely by climate change. Rising sea level also means storms cause more coastal damage.Today, a high of 40C is expected once every few centuries. But this would be every 15 years in a medium emissions scenario, in which carbon cuts are made but not enough to meet the 1.5C or 2C limits agreed by nations in the 2015 Paris climate deal. In a worst-case scenario, with emissions continuing the trend of recent decades unchecked, somewhere in the UK would reach 40C every 3.5 years.The new analysis follows research in 2019 that used the same medium emissions scenario to indicate that by 2050 London will have the same climate that Istanbul has today, Leeds will be like Melbourne, Cardiff like Montevideo in Uruguay, and Edinburgh like Paris. All these foreign cities have already broken 40C.“The probability of recording 40C, or above, in the UK is now rapidly accelerating,” said the scientists in the study, published in the journal Nature Communications. Its lead author, Nikolaos Christidis, at the Met Office Hadley Centre, said: “The rate of change is remarkable.”Prof Piers Forster, at the University of Leeds and not part of the Met Office study, said: “Heatwaves are a real risk to life in the UK, especially if we do not begin modifying our homes, workplaces and hospitals to manage their expected overheating.”The government’s official advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, said on 25 June “the UK is poorly prepared for the very serious impacts of climate change, including … overheating”.“However, we should note that in terms of heatwaves, the UK will get off lightly compared with most other nations,” said Forster. “Heatwaves in the major crop-growing regions of the world could have more profound effects, both globally and for the UK.”The Met Office research combined temperature measurements at 1km scale across the UK with 16 large-scale climate models to calculate the likelihood of an extreme temperature being reached somewhere in the nation in a particular year.The significantly larger risk in the high-emissions scenario compared with the medium-emissions scenario shows cutting carbon emissions makes a big difference in reducing the frequency of extreme heat, from breaching 40C once every 3.5 years to once every 15 years.The scientists also examined the likelihood of exceeding 35C. This occurs in the UK about every five years at present, but would be an annual occurrence by the end of the century in either emissions scenario.The south-east and south regions of the UK are most affected by the rising heat, because other regions benefit more from the cooling influence of the Atlantic ocean. The study found that many areas in the north for which 30C is extremely rare may exceed that level at least once per decade by 2100."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72494dbd2c098c747b497c94abcf5a775bc04a5b/109_0_988_593/master/988.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ffc12b5129599580c2cbc159ea34ec4","title":"ms j alexander americas next top model judge","story":"The former America’s Next Top Model judge and catwalk coach talks big bows, the power of Pride and a surreal meeting with Imelda Marcos in ManilaThe bow, I kid you not, I made at 7.40am on the morning of the Oscars.

He played Saul Bloom, the elderly conman and droll mentor to the two dudes in charge: Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt), a role he reprised in two sequels. When Rusty initially tries to engineer a surprise meeting with Saul at the racetrack for recruitment purposes, it is Saul who catches Rusty unawares, tolerant but unimpressed. “I saw you at the paddock before the second race, outside the men’s room when I placed my bet. I saw you before you even got up this morning.” And he isn’t tempted when Rusty asks what he would want to get involved: “Nothing. I’ve got a duplex now, I’ve got wall-to-wall and a goldfish. I’m seeing a nice lady who works the unmentionables counter at Macy’s. I’ve changed.”Reiner delivered the lines with a terrific naturalism, humour and grit. Yet his work rate continued unabated and almost 20 years later, in 2018, he had another sensational moment in the public eye – as the oldest celebrity on Twitter. He caused social media uproar by lambasting Trump before the 2018 midterms. “I’m 96-and-a-half years old. I lived through the Great Depression I served in World War Two in our fight to defeat fascism I’ve seen the invention of television and performed on television, even before my family owned one. But what I’ve never seen is the American people being lied to every day …”This was a weighty intervention from American showbusiness royalty – or maybe deity. As writer, producer, director and actor, the indefatigably funny and productive Reiner had been around Broadway, around television, around Hollywood for six decades one of the great titans and founding fathers of postwar Jewish American humour. Actually, his Trump broadside was hardly his first political adventure. In 1947, as a member of the American Labor party, he MC-ed a charity evening at Carnegie Hall in New York for veterans of the Spanish civil war, an event that caught the attention of the FBI. At the height of McCarthyism the bureau sent two agents to Reiner’s house to ask if he might care to name the communists of his acquaintance in the television industry. In his memoirs, he recalls: “I’m afraid I can’t,” I answered, smiling sincerely. “And why can’t you?” “Because I don’t know who they are,” I explained. “Communist actors don’t go around telling you that they’re communists!” It was a bravura performance that sent the G-Men on their way.After his wartime service, Reiner acted in Broadway musicals and got his big break acting in and writing for Sid Caesar’s Your Show of Shows in the 1950s. He became part of the great generation that included Neil Simon, Larry Gelbart, Lucille Kallen, Selma Diamond, Woody Allen and Mel Tonkin. After this, Reiner’s tall, handsome bearing and rich voice got him work as host of game shows and panel shows, and it also made him an excellent straight man to the comedian who was to be a longtime partner: Mel Brooks. With brilliant intuition, Reiner improvised feed lines to Brooks’s “2,000-year-old man”, the elderly sage who would pronounce wisely on all topics.But his great moment on television was as creator of The Dick Van Dyke Show, about the writer of a fictional TV programme, equably played by Van Dyke himself with Mary Tyler Moore as his wife – who was to graduate away from this demure stereotype with her own show, a feminist landmark in the way TDVDS obviously wasn’t. But Reiner almost singlehandedly created a comedy language which was to endure for decades, giving us later Jerry Seinfeld in Seinfeld, Tina Fey in 30 Rock and Larry David in Curb Your Enthusiasm.As a film-maker, Reiner worked from the late 60s to the late 90s, most memorably collaborating with Steve Martin as writer or director or both, particularly on the lovingly detailed 40s thriller pastiche Dead Men Don’t Wear Plaid (1982), and on the comedies The Jerk (1979), The Man With Two Brains (1983) and All of Me (1984), starring Martin and Lily Tomlin. He also directed Oh, God! (1977) from a screenplay by Larry Gelbart, featuring George Burns as the benign God who appears to John Denver’s harassed supermarket manager. Reiner often professed a fondness for his early, cult black comedy Where’s Poppa? (1970) starring George Segal as a depressed man who tries to scare his elderly mother to death.And all this ran alongside a staggeringly productive line in acting work, which won Reiner a shelf-full of Emmys and also Grammys for the perennially popular recordings of The 2,000-year-old Man with Mel Brooks. And he created a kind of dynasty in that his son Rob was of course to be a great movie director on his own account, and it was Rob’s mother Estelle – that is, Carl’s wife – who delivered the legendary line “I’ll have what she’s having” in When Harry Met Sally.Carl Reiner was a great master who had proved his worth and staying power over years. For me, one of the funniest and most fascinating parts of his autobiography, I Remember Me, is his recounting of an intense discussion he had as a young TV writer about which number was the funniest, as the punchline for a sketch about roulette. Just as “chicken” is funny because of the hard “ck” sound, so there must be a funny number — and Reiner incidentally discounted “69” because of the sexy connotation. He wanted something more purely funny. Finally, mysteriously, he and his colleagues settled on 32, and 32 duly got a massive laugh. Reiner was the Gandalf or the Merlin of the American comic tradition."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71d1e9b39e3cd707097b310ebdef78e2f5f8893a/1577_1063_1988_1193/master/1988.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b2e7ca6c937bd14aaba4eb09f647a32","title":"cinema giants delay reopening in uk and us","story":"Cineworld and AMC push restarts back three weeks to end of July, blaming rescheduled summer blockbusters – while debate over hygiene rules continuesThe UK’s largest chain of cinemas has pushed back its scheduled reopening date by three weeks, in response to further delays to the opening of key titles such as Mulan and Tenet.Cineworld, which runs multiplexes and the Picturehouse chain in the UK, as well as Regal cinemas in the US, will now open the doors to its venues on 31 July. In a statement, the company attributed the move to shifts for release date to Christopher Nolan’s Tenet (now due 12 August) and Disney’s Mulan (now due 21 August).The company said: “We hope that we will be able to reopen the doors of all Cineworld cinemas across the UK and Ireland at that time, subject to UK government restrictions. With the ongoing pandemic, this new date remains subject to final confirmation.”Cinemas in England are, in theory, allowed to reopen this weekend, on 4 July, with Odeon currently planning to stick to this date. At the time of writing, the Vue chain is sticking with a 10 July reopening date.The world’s largest chain of cinemas, AMC, announced overnight that it, too, would delay reopening in the US from 15 July until the end of month. About 450 of AMC’s sites in the US are now expected to reopen on 30 July, and the company has said it hopes most of its 600 cinemas will be operational by early August.However, some key US territories, such New York City and Los Angeles, are yet to pass legislation permitting such a reopening, and other states have again shuttered businesses over the past few days following fears accelerated reopenings have led to an increase in infections.Both AMC and Cineworld have outlined plans for new safety, hygiene and cleaning protocols on their premises. A backlash to the news that patrons would not be required nor encouraged to wear face coverings prompted U-turns from both companies, with all AMC venues and Regal cinemas now making masks mandatory.However, no such requirement is currently in place at any UK cinema.

Does it matter which pasta goes with which sauce? Italian food experts dish out advice• Do you have a culinary dilemma? Email feast@theHow do I choose the right shape of pasta for my sauce? And does it really matter?Maya, LeedsAs Oretta Zanini de Vita writes in Shapes \u0026amp Sauces, “The truth is that almost any kind of pasta goes reasonably well with almost any kind of sauce, and people who get all serious and talk about the importance of correct sauce pairing are probably overthinking.” While I daren’t quibble with such an authority, it’s worth remembering that pasta is the vehicle for the sauce, so there is method behind those winning unions.“A lot of famous pairings came about because of the geometry of the pasta and regional habits, which over time have become entrenched,” says the ’s Rome-based food correspondent Rachel Roddy, who is currently penning The A-Z of Pasta (out next year). “I’ve found a lot more freedom than I expected, as well as hilarity, because choices are sometimes eccentric and subjective.”However, certain characteristics lead to more harmonious combos. Tubes, Roddy says, are “begging for a bean”, while wide noodles are for thick, rich, meaty sauces. Jacob Kenedy, chefpatron of Bocca di Lupo in London, matches chunky pastas with “things with big lumps in”, while finer shapes with more surface area require more delicate sauces. You could argue that carbonara, for example, goes with two very different shapes: Roddy pairs hers with rigatoni instead of the more traditional spaghetti, and this is where personal taste comes in. Then again, as Roddy points out, the “basic tenet of most Italian food is: let’s disagree”.The undisputed joy of Italian food is its sense of origin. “If you serve pesto Genovese with trofie,” Kenedy says, “adding potato and green beans as you cook the pasta, it speaks of a place. It’s nice to get that journey on a plate, especially seeing as we can’t travel at the moment.”Some sauces, however, welcome all. “A well-executed, tomato-based sauce can go with any shape,” says Phil King, head chef at Pophams, where pastries and pasta unite. He slow-cooks Sardinian antonella plum tomatoes with garlic and olive oil, while Roddy boosts hers with chilli and serves it with penne or, even better, garganelli. “The world is full of penne haters, but I’m a great lover of it,” she says. One such person is Kenedy, who prefers rigatoni, which he serves with punchy, meaty sauces of ’nduja, a soft, chilli-spiked sausage.If lockdown shopping has taught us anything, it’s that certain shapes have fallen out of favour (no, I don’t know why orzo and orecchiette were left on the shelves, either). It’s time to expand your horizons, and Kenedy suggests starting with paccheri: “It’s not used enough and is a very versatile shape.” These large tubes from Campania pair just as well with tomato sauce as with seafood such as squid or clams, he says. King recommends looking even farther south, and in particular to the eggless doughs of Sardinia and Sicily – orecchiette, capunti and malloreddus, which, pre-Coronavirus, Pophams served with baked olive tapenade and radicchio.As ever, the quality of the pasta plays a part: “The better the pasta, the more lovely, starchy stuff you get, which thickens and transforms the sauce,” Roddy explains. She rounds up the ends of said packets of pasta “like unruly children” to store in a jar ready to use in soups with beans or potatoes and sausage – just make sure the pasta cooking times are similar. All wayward carbs are welcome round Roddy’s: “There’s no shape I don’t like. I feel like a protective mother, because I love them all.”• Do you have a culinary dilemma?

That view will get even better if they fail to beat an Atletico Madrid side who have been in superb form since lockdown.

Their home form has been almost faultless this season, with 15 wins out of 16 in the league. But home advantage ain’t what it used to be, and this match is fraught with peril for Barcelona.

That was clinical, and excellent at every stage: header, control, pass, run, cross, finish.That’s a lovely break, and it’s game over!48 mins: Brighton already seem to have significantly improved in their new-look 4-2-2-2 formation. Shaw brings down Bissouma, and gets booked.46 mins: Peeeeep! They’re off! I have a couple of half-time substitutions to report: Brighton have brought off Tariq Lamptey and Davy Propper and brought on Leandro Trossard and Neal Maupay.This game has been slightly tediously one-sided. This, though, is the kind of tedium that Manchester United fans have been desperate for for several years now. They look a team capable not just of qualifying for Europe but achieving something once they get there. Brighton have Liverpool and Manchester City still to come to the AmEx over the next couple of weeks, and could probably do with banking three points at Norwich this weekend before their confidence gets too badly nobbled.45+3 mins: Manchester United go into the interval with the double advantage of two goals and complete superiority.45+2 mins: United ping the ball about on the left for an age, and eventually Montoya’s had enough and throws himself at Rashford. Free kick.45+1 mins: There will be about two minutes of first-half stoppages.44 mins: Brighton actually threaten! Propper’s cross from the right is pretty handy, and there are six home players in the penalty area, but the ball just evades them all, with Burn coming closest.44 mins: United get numbers forward, Brighton get numbers back, and a very promising attack ends with Dunk intercepting Pogba’s underhit pass infield.42 mins: A telling stat here from Tim de Lisle:41 mins: There have only been two shots on target in this game.39 mins: Dunk has the ball inside his own penalty area and Martial and Fernandes combine to gang up on him, eventually forcing him to hit out of play for a throw-in. Nothing comes of it but still, good work.37 mins: United play the ball across their backline almost comically slowly, waiting on each occasion to be closed down before laying it off. Eventually it reaches Bruno Fernandes on the left, who smashes it high into the air. Given what came before, it seems almost an act of protest. Dunk wins the header.33 mins: Brighton have an attack, and win a free-kick out on the right touchline. United eventually win it back, and play the ball out of defence in a manner which is can only be described as extremely competent.32 mins: Brighton have a shot! Mac Allister is the man responsible, blasting the ball into Maguire’s ankles from inside United’s penalty area.Another one! Rashford plays Shaw in on the left, who gets to the byline but can’t pick out Martial with his pull-back. It runs to Pogba outside the penalty area, who touches inside to Fernandes, whose first-time shot hits Mac Allister and spins past Ryan and inside the post!28 mins: Lindelof goes on an endearingly optimistic run down the right, which ends after about 40 yards as he tries to trick his way into the penalty area without actually doing any tricks, and is consequently dispossessed.26 mins: Play resumes, and United take control of the ball once more. Eventually Wan-Bissaka miscontrols and it rolls out for a throw-in.23 mins: United win a corner, take it long to Maguire beyond the far post, and he beats Dunk to the header but sends it across goal and wide. The drinks break follows.22 mins: Fernandes shoots, and gets the ball to dip savagely, but it never threatens to dip enough to get under the bar.21 mins: Now they have a free-kick in a very handy position, as Pogba is fouled just outside the area.20 mins: This is all looking excellent for the visitors. They are attacking at pace, in numbers, with width on both flanks, and Brighton can’t plug every gap.The chance comes, the shot follows, and United lead! Greenwood pretty much makes it for himself, running infield from the right, leaving Stephens in his wake, bursting into the box, squaring up Dunk, jinking this way and that, and then shooting low and hard inside the near post!12 mins: Bruno Fernandes hits the post! Maguire’s long ball from left to right starts the move, Pogba’s pass infield finds the Portuguese, and his early, low shot from just outside the area thumps the near post.11 mins: A few seconds later Mac Allister tries it again, and this time Connolly is on the move, but he uses an arm to control and that’s the end of that.11 mins: Mac Allister picks the ball up in midfield and plays it through for Connolly, who hadn’t got the memo and was entirely flat-footed.8 mins: United are hogging the ball, but not doing so much attacking. Bruno Fernandes nearly unlocked the home defence a couple of minutes back, but his Ryan ran out to booter his through-ball into touch as Rashford raced towards it. 5 mins: A breather for Brighton, as Maguire chests a long pass towards Lindelof, and Connolly nips in and goes down, winning a bonus cheap free kick.3 mins: United have already put together two decent attacks down the left, but on both occasions the attack was snuffled out after they got into the box.2 mins: Kick-off is preceded by a noisy countdown, on the stadium’s big screens and loud speakers. 10 ... 9 ... 8 ... 7 ... it goes. 6 ... 5 ... 4 ... 3 ... it continues. 2 ... 1, it concludes. And then, 10 further seconds of awkward silence while the referee completes his last-minute whatevers, noisy countdown completely ignored. The players take the knee for a few seconds after kick-off.1 min: Peeeeeep! United get the game started.The players are out, and the coin has just been tossed. Action imminent.The players are making their way into the tunnel, with kick-off just a few minutes away.“While I’m cheered that the fans are practising some social distancing by sitting one seat apart, I’m appalled they’re not wearing masks,” complains Eric Schwab of Brighton’s Thank You NHS Stand (photo below). “This seems like a very narrow, two-dimensional approach.”Graham Potter submits himself to the Sky-flavoured inquisition:I think we’ve had a positive couple of games, but we have to start again. We play against a really good side, a side in good form, so all that we’ve done is gone and we have to start again tonight and do our best. It’s a chance to win three points, that’s how we look at it. They’re a good team, and they’re fighting for the Champions League, but ti’s a chance to win three points and that’s what we have to focus on. I’ve reminded them that they’re good players, they need to work hard to get a result. History’s fine but it doesn’t count for anything tonight. We need a bit of luck against this quality of opposition, but we need to make sure we do our best.He says the decision to play Aaron Connolly instead of Neal Maupay is “purely tactical”, because he hopes the Irishman’s pace could come in handy. “I think Neal can help us off the bench. We’ve got a big squad, everybody’s ready to help and we’ll need that going forward.”Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has a chat with Sky:This is the same team as played less than a week ago against Sheffield United and played really well, so hopefully we can see that again. Everything has to be right. We’ve been here the last two years, we haven’t got any points. We know it’s going to be hard, we know we have to focus on one game at a time. Brighton make three changes to the team that drew 0-0 at Leicester last Tuesday, bringing in Shane Duffy, Davy Propper and Martin Montoya. Manchester United make either no changes or eight of them, depending on whether you count the FA Cup game against Norwich or the last league game, against Sheffield United last Wednesday.The team sheets are in, and these are the names upon them:Before the restart I thought Brighton, winless in 2020 and with a pretty nasty fixture list, might end up in a hideous battle against relegation. Two games, two decent performances and four points later and given the miserable form of Bournemouth, West Ham, Aston Villa and Watford below them I make them a win away from safety. They are more likely to get that victory at Norwich on Saturday than against Manchester United tonight, with the visitors another side that has had a decent restart and motivated by the vicious scrap for European qualification in which they find themselves, but I wouldn’t put it past them. They are, after all, unbeaten at home against Manchester United since April 1982 (with four wins and a draw since then).In memory of which, here’s the track that was No3 in that week’s hit parade and indeed also the next, when it held off This Time (We’ll Get it Right) by the England World Cup squad - to my mind perhaps the great classic squad-actually-singing, no-fancy-pants-pop-stars football record - which rose to No4."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7aa7fb598cabc5f88e2ff855aeb503bc86d3c796/171_261_2496_1498/master/2496.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c27937c5c475418d41d70ee4dd20614a","title":"reading v brentford cardiff v charlton leeds v luton and more championship clockwatch","story":"Five minutes to go at Elland Road, and even less at Wigan, who are cruising to victory against a Stoke team in all sorts of trouble. Luton are having to contend with waves of Leeds’ attacks.Elsewhere, Man Utd are cruising by the seaside:Leeds go close – but Patrick Bamford brushes the side-netting! Alioski crossed from the left, Bamford took it on first time and almost pounced. Might we see Poveda?Leeds are gunning for victory but Luton, too, haven’t given up hope of taking victory away from Elland Road, with striker and top scorer James Collins introduced a few moments ago. Elsewhere, Stoke have made a raft of changes, with Michael O’Neill presumably fuming at his side’s defending. Nathan Collins, Ryan Shawcross and Stephen Ward have been hauled off. James Chester, Tommy Smith and Bruno Martins Indi enter. Just as well no Stoke fans are there to see it ... an abysmal performance, littered with inidual errors, none more so than those by Butland.A worldie in every sense of the word. The substitute drives inside on to his left foot and then lets fly ... and it zooms into the corner.From bad to worse for Stoke and Michael O’Neill. And it is another blooper from Jack Butland, who fails to deal with a hanging cross. England goalkeepers have form for high-profile errors but his fall from grace rivals the best of them. Ah, hang on a minute ... Leeds level. The substitute Pablo Hernández, two minutes after coming on, works the ball to Alioski and he feeds Dallas, who calmly slots home.Nathan Jones has certainly breathed life into Luton, whose chief executive, Gary Sweet, warned they needed “to hit the ground sprinting” if they had any chance of staying up. If they eke out another victory at Elland Road this evening, they would have taken seven points from the last available nine:Well, then: bottom-of-the-table Luton lead top-of-the-table Leeds. It can only be the Championship ... meanwhile Wigan still lead Stoke with half-hour to play but Michael O’Neill has made changes. Lee Gregory and Tyrese Campbell came on a few minutes ago, in place of Jordan Thompson and Tom Ince.Half-time sub Harry Cornick makes an instant impact. A wonderful strike by the former Bournemouth man, who curls a beauty into the corner. As a pointless aside, Cornick, who attended Poole Grammar school, got the better of on-loan Ben White, who went to Queen Elizabeth’s school up the road in Wimborne. Leeds are back under way at Elland Road! And Marcelo Bielsa has tweaked things at the interval, with the substitute Gaetano Berardi replaced by Ezgjan Alioski, who celebrated victory over Fulham last weekend by thanking the 15,000 ‘crowdies’.Stoke are in a real hole at half-time. They made six changes this evening – but Michael O’Neill must be tempted to ring the changes at the interval. They trail to Wigan and are in grave danger of being sucked into the relegation zone. “There was a brief period of hope when O’Neill took over but that has evaporated,” emails Joshua Reynolds. “We are Sunderland without the TV series.” Some soundbites from earlier results. “In every department Brentford were stronger than us,” says Reading’s manager, Mark Bowen. “We didn’t lay a glove on them all night.” Elsewhere, the Barnsley boss Gerhard Struber is feeling understandably chirpy. “We are still in the relegation zone, but the change is our very good mindset,” he says. And in the top flight, Manchester United lead ...Stoke are in real trouble, aren’t they? For Jack Butland that was, what they call in the business, an almighty clanger:Cyrus Christie’s screamer from distance settles it.Kieran Dowell shoots from the byline and – somehow – drills it beyond the Stoke goalkeeper Jack Butland, who will not want to see that again. Ever. “As a Stoke fan I’m not sure what stage of the five stages of grief I’m in right now but it’s not acceptance, sadly,” emails Joshua Reynolds. “Probably denial.”QPR rattle the crossbar! Ryan Mannings heads against the bar from a corner. Rodak had no chance with it but it cannons off the woodwork. We are into second-half stoppage-time at Loftus Road but elsewhere, Kal Naismith has replaced Michael Jacobs, whose had to go off injured for Wigan v Stoke.Up at Leeds, Bielsa is barking at his players and the drinks break provides another opportunity to get instructions on. Luton had a header at goal saved. Meanwhile Barnsley’s form should be of real concern to those around them, having won five of their past seven. Their next three games? Stoke, Luton and Wigan.A rocket from Cyrus Christie. After a fairly underwhelming team performance, Christie lights up the game at Loftus Road by hammering in from distance. A big goal that might just keep Fulham in the hunt for automatic promotion.Helder Costa volleys over for Leeds at Elland Road! Tyler Roberts also went close a moment ago and Leeds have had a couple of early half-chances but Nathan Jones’s Luton, who drop to bottom after Barnsley’s win, are looking pretty compact.Another cracking result for Lee Bowyer’s Charlton. Elsewhere, a blow for Leeds, whose captain, Liam Cooper, has been forced off 13 minutes in against Luton. He has been replaced by Gaetano Berardi after failing to shake off a back injury.A priceless win in Barnsley’s fight for survival, with Chaplin and Brown striking to condemn Blackburn to a disappointing defeat.Mbeumo, Dasilva and Valencia strike as Thomas Frank’s free-scoring side cruise to a fourth successive victory. They move within two points of West Brom, who take on Sheffield Wednesday tomorrow before hosting Hull on Sunday.Game over. Joel Valencia lashes in from 20 yards.Peeeeeeeeeeep! They’re under way at Leeds, where Marcelo Bielsa’s side host Luton, and Wigan, where Stoke are the visitors. Barnsley’s form continues to wreak havoc for Stoke and co.That second Barnsley goal is very bad news for a number of clubs in the muck, notably Hull, Huddersfield, Stoke and Middlesbrough, even if Neil Warnock will surely work his magic there ...An extraordinary few minutes at Oakwell and an outrageously composed finish by Jacob Brown. Barnsley are heading for three h-u-g-e points! Blackburn are heading for successive defeats.Ben Brereton has made an immediate impact: the Blackburn forward has been sent off within a couple of minutes of coming on. It’s not clear why – a possible stamp – but, purely by coincidence, the referee is Tony Harrington, who failed to spot Aleksandar Mitrovic’s elbow on Ben White last weekend ...Er, Blackburn have just made aBrentford are breathing down West Brom’s necks now – victory would take them to within two points of Slaven Bilic’s side. Neither Cardiff or Charlton have registered a shot on target in south Wales with half-hour left to play. A late change for Luton at Elland Road. Glen Rea misses out having been named as a starter. Martin Cranie steps in and Jacob Butterfield comes on to the bench.Josh Dasilva, who was brilliant without scoring in victory over West Brom on Friday, doubles Brentford’s advantage at the Madejski. Chaplin has been mustard since Struber took charge in November that’s his 13th goal of the season and his 12th since the Austrian’s arrival. There is a reason the 23-year-old made the below list:That is a huge goal, and one that keeps the great escape alive for a Barnsley team rejuvenated under Gerhard Struber. Chaplin has particularly blossomed under Struber and, within seconds of stepping off the bench, the former Portsmouth forward heads home to open the scoring. That goal takes them to within one point of safety. Elsewhere, it’s QPR 1-1 Fulham at half-time.Get yer team news for Brighton v Man Utd:Rhian Brewster speaks after helping Swansea to a point:Stoke travel to Wigan tonight in what is a massive game. They head into it a point above the relegation zone, while Wigan could not be in better form, having won five of their past six matches, as well as keeping clean sheets in all of those. “There is a lot at stake for both teams,” said manager Michael O’Neill, who has made six changes. Nathan Collins, Ryan Shawcross, Stephen Ward, Jordan Cousins, Tom Ince and Sam Vokes come into the side, while Nick Powell is suspended against his former club. “They will be coming into the game knowing they are a victory, or a couple of victories away from securing their own Championship future.”Rhian Brewster’s free-kick – officially a Bartosz Bialkowski own goal – cancels out Mason Bennett’s opener. That result doesn’t do a lot for either side. Millwall – winless since the restart – stay in mid-table, while Swansea are three points off the play-offs, though Cardiff could stretch that gap with victory over Charlton. Scott Parker’s side level things up. Arter, the manager’s brother-in-law, wallops a left-footed effort at goal from 20 yards and it squeezes beyond Liam Kelly at the near post. The QPR goalkeeper will not want to see it again. That’s Arter’s first league goal since he scored for Bournemouth against Huddersfield in November 2017.Millwall rattle a post! With less than a couple of minutes to go, Murray Wallace sends a header against a post. Millwall are asking questions of Swansea as stoppage-time approaches. Matt Smith is also on for Gary Rowett’s side. Can they find a winner?Team news at Elland Road: Leeds are unchanged, with Pablo Hernández again on the bench after injury. Robbie Gotts also returns to the bench for Marcelo Bielsa’s side. Meanwhile Luton make four changes, with Danny Hylton among those to start. Callum McManaman, James Bree and Ryan Tunnicliffe replace James Collins, Elliot Lee, Harry Cornick and Jacob Butterfield.Concern for Swansea and Ben Wilmot, the Watford defender who went to ground smacking the pitch in agony. After a period of treatment, Wilmot was back up and moving but has since hobbled off. His knee seemed to be buckle in an innocuous coming together. Swansea, manager Steve Cooper confirmed, are already likely to be without Wales defender Joe Rodon for the rest of the season. Marc Guehi, the Chelsea loanee, is on in Wilmot’s place.Millwall go close to taking the lead! Murray Wallace arrives unmarked at the back post but heads just wide. Swansea get off the hook. Elsewhere, the QPR goal will doubtless have been gladly received by West Brom, and Leeds, who kick-off against Luton in an hour’s time. Fulham are sliding down the table as it stands ...QPR are piping crowd noise into the stadium and, within 50 seconds, it had the desired effect, with Hugill rising above Tim Ream to nod in. Elsewhere, Cabango collides with Tom Bradshaw on the edge of the box and Millwall are adamant it’s a foul. They are incensed but, even if it was given, it would have been a free-kick.A blistering start at Loftus Road. Not what Fulham had planned.That is Brewster’s seventh strike since joining on loan from Liverpool in January – and what a priceless goal it could prove. Saying that, a draw does neither Millwall or Swansea too many favours in their pursuit of the play-offs. Elsewhere, Cardiff are being kept at bay by Lee Bowyer’s Charlton, who have won their past two matches. Robert Glatzel has been promoted to the starting lineup after scoring in his last two matches. Marlon Pack and Mendez-Laing are also in from the off.A beautiful free-kick! Stunning strike. The Liverpool loanee takes aim from 20 yards and curls a right-footed shot beyond Bartosz Bialkowski, who couldn’t keep it out. It was not in the very corner but the power took it past the Millwall goalkeeper.A corner is kept alive and Mbeumo heads in from close range! Brentford are back at full strength, with Mbeumo returning to the starting lineup to complete their exhilarating “BMW” attack, which also comprises Ollie Watkins and Saïd Benrahma:Not an awful lot to report around the grounds, as Millwall continue to keep Swansea at arm’s length. Bersant Celina, who was left out last weekend, has replaced Yan Dhanda, once of Liverpool, approaching the hour mark. The Queen is in attendance at the Den:A couple of big Football League stories:Let’s get stuck straight in, with Swansea already trailing at Millwall in the (even eerier) 5pm kick-off courtesy of a Mason Bennett goal on the counter-attack. Swansea came close to an equaliser through Rhian Brewster, only for Jake Cooper to clear off the line, but they need to turn things around in the second half if they are to stay in the mix for the play-offs. As for Millwall, that three points would be most welcome after a fairly disappointing restart for Gary Rowett and co. And yes, there are another six matches – including league leaders Leeds v Luton – to come this evening. Reading warmed up for their match with Brentford with a poignant tribute to those who lost their lives in the Forbury Gardens terror attack 10 days ago. We will be keeping an eye on the following matches:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/884d1b80e2b37b5c98b88fddf763612a93191f7e/1075_2225_604_362/master/604.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c6bee8d7d6f1b7b0c741b4a7b978992","title":"my day starts at 3am coronavirus fuels gruelling harare commutes in pictures","story":"Lockdown measures have meant getting to work is fraught with risk for those manning essential services in Zimbabwe’s capital. Three frontline staff reveal how they are coping with erratic buses, exhaustion and dangerIt’s a dark, nippy June morning before dawn and a queue is forming at Glen View 8 bus stop. A dozen or so people, mostly men, are there as 41-year-old Mairevei Mupombwi and her friend arrive at 4.43am carrying fleece blankets. The two women spread cloths on the ground to sit on and cover themselves with their blankets to keep warm. Mupombwi starts dozing.At 5.30am, the queue is now long and a man starts moving around with a permanent marker, writing numbers on people’s hands. Although it is still dark, Mupombwi is number 31 and by 5.44am, the last person in the queue is number 65. Muffled voices can be heard as people try to make conversation through their masks.Moments later, Mupombwi stands up, telling her friend she can feel ants getting into her clothes. She folds her cloth and puts it in her bag but keeps the blanket over her shoulders.As the first rays of the sun appear, there is no sign of the bus. Several buses pass but they’re all going in the direction opposite to central Harare, where she and the rest of the people in the queue want to go. As the sun warms up, she puts her blanket away. The conversation at the bus stop is now getting louder. You can clearly see men and women, young and old, wearing face coverings, others have them but have chosen not to wear them.At 7.10am, the first bus comes and parks a distance away. There is chaos, and the once orderly queue disintegrates as dozens of people run towards it. No one is allowed to board and no one knows exactly what is going on. The people start coming back to the queue saying that no one can get into town as all roads have been sealed off by the police and security forces. They start urging others to go back home.A few minutes later, another bus arrives, and Mupombwi and her friend manage to get on. There is a man at the door, squeezing sanitiser on to passengers’ hands as they board. Once on the bus, passengers observe social distancing.It is now 8.18am and the bus stops at Market Square. Mupombwi gets off and makes her way towards Avondale, where she works in a supermarket. She hails a private car at 8.43am and by 8.48am she arrives at work.Mupombwi says: “My typical day starts at 3.30am where I have to warm my water to bathe and by 4am I am leaving the house. I wait for my friend and we walk together to the bus stop and it takes us about 30 minutes. The bus sometimes comes at 6.45am, and if it is late, it comes after 7am. It’s the same coming home from work. We have to wait in long queues. I get very tired, and during my off-days, I just want to sleep.”Mupombwi’s story is not unique, and many frontline workers in key industries have been affected by the country’s lockdown. They are spending more time travelling to and from work, and being deprived of sleep and quality time with loved ones.Zimbabwe imposed a lockdown on 30 March to curb the spread of Covid-19. Under the current restrictions, only the government-owned and run transport operator Zimbabwe United Passengers Company (Zupco) is permitted to run. Private operators have been banned and directed to register under Zupco if they hope to continue operating.Many workers have been forced to start their day earlier than usual, walking in the dark, sometimes hitchhiking – a dangerous pursuit in Zimbabwe. While travelling, these workers are at risk of contracting the virus as commuter queues rarely observe social distancing.Sandra Chikore, 33, works at a tobacco auction floor and faces the same transport problems as Mupombwi. The tobacco industry is key to the country’s economy, and this is a busy time of year. She rises at 4.35am and by 5.45am she leaves the house, walking close to 2km to get to work on time.“I leave the house while it is still dark and walk along the main road, flagging private cars. My mother’s asked me if I am not afraid for my life. I am, but have no choice. When coming back from work, I have to wait for the bus and sometimes I get home around 8pm, and I am just tired and want to take a bath, eat and sleep. I do not have much time to spend with my son any more.”On the main road at 6.29am, an open truck stops and Chikore hops in with one other passenger, who sits in front. There are three other people in the back, all male. Along the way, the truck stops and two more men jump in. Eighteen minutes later, she arrives in town and walks to Market Square, where she boards a bus. Almost an hour later, at 7.25am, Chikore reaches her workplace.Archiford Zisengwe, 38, works at a petrol station, an essential service. He has been going to work since lockdown began. Zisengwe lives in Harare’s south-west suburb of Waterfalls and works in Groombridge, north of the capital.“There is no transport to take me directly to town so I leave the house at 4am every day and I go to Mbare. From there, I find transport into town and then from there, Groombridge. Some of the places we pass through are very dangerous.”The government recently relaxed social distancing rules and all buses now carry to capacity. However, the move has not alleviated the transport problem and for workers such as Mairevei, Chikore and Zisengwe, they continue to wake up early and spend much of their time waiting in queues.Besides sleep deprivation and losing time with loved ones, many key workers are at risk of infection on public transport due to difficulties with social distancing. They also face the threat of physical attack in a country where violence and crime are rife."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d2969cad7c3a89c2205ca91e91b4f1a356f373c/3_0_5340_3206/master/5340.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=676784d35dab2c38e5947010e936fa95","title":"i love my partner but cant stop fantasising about other men","story":"I am a gay man who has been in a happy relationship for several years – but I often find myself thinking about me or my partner having sex with other peopleI am a gay man and have been in a relationship for several years with my partner, but we struggle sexually due to my lack of sexual attraction.

I love my partner wholeheartedly and he is extremely attractive, amazingly attentive and understanding, but I find that, as soon as someone has become familiar, I lose sexual interest.

The very forbidden nature of them makes them more exciting. Your fantasies are yours alone: you can choose when to indulge in them and when to set them aside you can choose whether to share them with another person or to keep them to yourself. You seem to be afraid that you may not always have choices when it comes to acting them out or not, but you do.

Presumably, we’re talking Triassic v Jurassic, something like that, when dinosaurs roamed the land, squelching about, squelch, squelch … Actually, a bit more recently than that. More like last week.Really? Swamps in Britain? The ones teeming with giant alligators, anacondas and swarms of malarial mosquitoes? Do you mean the Fens? The Norfolk Broads, perhaps, or the Somerset Levels? Because those areas are lovely. Nope, swamps.Glastonbury can get pretty swampy. It was cancelled.

More specifically, the New York Times.The Gray Lady, winner of multiple Pulitzers, with a worldwide reputation for thoroughness and accuracy? That one.Go on, what did it say? An article by a London-based reporter, Ceylan Yeğinsu, about the behaviour of some Britons in the heatwave, said we’d flocked to parks, beaches, and “cavorted by the hundreds in swamps”.I wish! To be fair, a few people did get stuck in the mud at low tide at Weston-super-Mare.Mudflats, as there are all around the coast, but hardly a swamp. Nor did they seem to be cavorting. The piece implied that we went to the swamps specifically to cavort. What about Bournemouth? Remember the scenes when half a million visitors descended?Oi! Sorry, it’s one of our loveliest beaches, if a little busy at times. Definitely not a swamp.Was it perhaps more metaphorical, about the behaviour of the ravers, the litterers and the urinators? Like a moral swamp? Oh, I see. A drain-the-swamp kind of swamp. No, it’s just another example of them getting us wrong, I’m afraid, or trolling us, like the TikTok tea lady. At least the New York Times had the grace to admit the error.It ran a correction? Front page, I hope. No, just a few words, but a correction, at least. “An article on Saturday about a heatwave in Britain referred incorrectly to one of the areas where crowds had formed during hot weather. People flocked to parks, beaches and streams, not swamps.”Swamps, streams, you like tomato and I like tomahto. It is tricky, just ask Daniel Marc Hooper. Ah, good old Swampy.Yes, the environmentalist anti-road protester. Well remembered. And he lived in a tree. Do say: “Hang on, I don’t even remember cavorting in the streams, either. New York Times? Yes, corrections and clarifications, please.”Don’t say: “Cor, blimey, lovely jubbly out there. Gonna have a swamp party, innit.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da5856eb6df9cafa70e71f94d9eed3b164c768e7/0_2985_10296_6180/master/10296.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=147e255c4d6e9a163763cd4989e66506","title":"khruangbin psych rockers texas rise","story":"How the Texan trio’s woozy sound, inspired by Thailand, Mexico and west Africa, perfected the art of ‘Earth music’Onstage, the Texan trio Khruangbin are a strange sight to behold. At their sold-out show at London’s near-5,000 capacity O2 Academy Brixton last December, guitarist Mark Speer and bassist Laura Lee, dressed in long, black, heavily fringed wigs, sway in unison, while bald drummer DJ Johnson sits calmly in his poncho, pensively holding the groove. All three sing amorphous vowel sounds over Speer’s downtempo, wailing guitar melodies while the crowd of teens, jobbing musicians and parents savouring a night out howl along to the strings, trying to keep up with their electric range.Formed in 2013 in Houston, Texas, Khruangbin have come a long way from their origins playing in the band of the same church that Beyoncé used to attend. With only the backing of the indie label Night Time Stories, the group have built a sizeable following who have kept them on the road almost continually for the past four years, a singalong crowd dedicated to the blend of easygoing funk, Tex-Mex and touches of west African rhythm they have showcased over two albums. They count Jay-Z among their fans, have 3.9m monthly listens on Spotify and were set to headline London’s 20,000-capacity Cross the Tracks festival this month. All this with a band name (meaning “airplane” in Thai) that most of their fans struggle to pronounce. On the face of it, the band’s crossover success is as peculiar as their stage presence.“When you see us play, it should look like we just fell on to this planet,” Speer says from Oakland, California. “We play Earth music, like we’ve listened to all these different genres – from west African rhythms to Mexican and south Asian melodies – and now here we are.” This unpredictable blend of sounds has led to a slew of miscategorisations when it comes to the band’s output it’s regularly referred to as either “Thai funk”, “classic soul” or “psychedelia”.For Speer, their “Earth music” is an amalgamation of cultures filtered through their own Texan lens a recapitulation of the contentious othering of “world” music. “When you normalise English-language music in the west and decide to call everything else ‘world’, belittling it in the process, that’s fucked up,” he says. “There’s so much other music out there, of all languages, that needs to be appreciated and it’s why we try to make our own output as universal as possible.” This means an emphasis on impressionistic, almost parodically simple lyrics (the repeated “white cat” on 2015’s Mr White, for instance, or the “yes, this is the third room” refrain on 2018’s Evan Finds the Third Room) that are sung by all three members in unison.“We all sing together in the band, so our lyrics need to resonate with all of us and with the audience, too,” says Laura Lee, with her wig on, over a video link from Miami. “It makes sense to me that we’ve grown such success internationally since our instrumental music largely tries to avoid language barriers and we’re just inviting people to have an emotional connection with the music on their own level.”Some might see this anything-goes attitude to music as a form of cultural appropriation, yet Speer justifies it by virtue of their living in Houston. “There’s such ersity here, from west African to south-east Asian, Mexican and Caribbean communities, it’s impossible to ignore how their music makes up the identity of Houston,” he says. “That all feeds inevitably into what we make.”In a rare break from being on the road, she went on a hike to a waterfall with a new friend, Mordechai, and ed in. “That jump really did something for me: I realised that we had all been swimming deep underwater without breathing and without really knowing where we were going for the past few years, just chasing every opportunity instead,” she says. “I had to stop to ask what’s important to me and why.” She spent the following day in self-imposed silence in Houston, writing stories based on her experiences in the group and her family’s history that would form the basis of the band’s new record, named after that new friend who brought about this transformative experience: Mordechai.The album is a typically transporting Khruangbin listen: 10 tracks filled with reverb-heavy guitar, rumbling dubby basslines and that ever-present compressed groove, yet there is also a marked change in the presence of lyrics. Each number now features the band’s voices more prominently, from the communal dancefloor yearning of Time (You and I) to the repeated question “Where are you now?”, directed at Lee’s grandfather, on Dearest Alfred. It is a more personal venture for a band usually so shrouded in costume and presentation.In a way, Mordechai is the perfect anxiety-busting album for our frantic times. “We record in a barn out on a remote Houston farm, which has played a big part in our sound,” says drummer Johnson. “The serenity of having nature surround us means it doesn’t make sense for us to then be playing hard and fast. We don’t want to take up all the sonic room when you can hear birds and bees outside there should be space for that, too.”Forced to pause their touring schedule in support of the new record, each member is isolating apart and getting their head round not permanently being in each other’s company. “Four years flew by on tour and I missed four years’ worth of weddings, birthdays and babies being born,” says Lee. “But I also created an incredible family in the process with Mark and DJ, so I feel very grateful for that. Maybe now I can make time for my other families and friends, too.”The break has helped shed a new light not only on the band’s career but on the larger, mystical questions of life. “The whole experience of making this album has just helped me focus on the process rather than the results,” she says. “Life is the journey and death is the destination, so we shouldn’t be in such a rush to get there.”Mordechai is out now "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8adc192e377b3c9508dea8e753470f456fa44a4c/0_5_1811_1087/master/1811.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45a77918c232bbad6ab2a007eccef78d","title":"off their heads the shocking return of the rave","story":"With clubs shut, thousands of young people are breaking the Covid-19 rules to attend parties organised on social media – and more are being set up every dayWhen Daisy Nook started trending on Twitter on the evening of 13 June, many users of the site thought it was a reference to the popular video game Animal Crossing, which features characters called Daisy and Nook. But Paul Carroll knew better. The 59-year-old police trainer had seen the saucer-eyed teenage girls and lads swigging from cans of beer flooding into Daisy Nook country park, in Greater Manchester, as he took his dogs for a walk that evening. Carroll stared at the revellers in astonishment. Illegal raves simply do not happen in Daisy Nook.It was not a restful evening. The traffic outside Carroll’s house was relentless, as was the whoosh of the nitrous oxide balloons the young people were huffing as they marched through the country park to the rave site, an empty field accessible from a canal path. Just after midnight, Carroll found a group of young men urinating on his garden wall. Insults were exchanged. “I wasn’t scared,” Carroll says. “I would have given as good as I’d got!” He backtracks. “Well, there were seven of them and I hadn’t got any shoes on.” After that encounter, Carroll’s wife told him to stop going outside. But he couldn’t sleep, so Carroll sat and watching the road, enraged. More cars. More balloons. Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh.About 4,000 people raved in Daisy Nook that night. Meanwhile, another 2,000 people attended a “quarantine rave” in Carrington, 15 miles away. Similar raves have popped up throughout June. Staffordshire: 1,000 people raved in Brookhay Woods, near Lichfield. Liverpool: hundreds of revellers danced to house music in a forest near Kirkby. Bristol: 1,000 people gathered in Stokes Croft. Leeds: police shut down a rave in an underpass of the M1 motorway as shocked motorists watched participants flood on to the road one clubber Vogued his way down the hard shoulder. Manchester: hundreds gathered in a courtyard in Moss Side. The DJ kept shouting: “Welcome to Manchester.”Across the country, young people are ignoring lockdown, strapping on bumbags and making for woods and fields. With the coronavirus pandemic having closed bars and clubs and cancelled or postponed festivals, raves are sweeping the UK, just as they did during the “second summer of love” in 1988, when acid house swept the country and ecstasy and bucket hats were everywhere.But some of those who were around for the summer of rave in 1988 say the comparison ends there. Those raves were “about everyone coming together”, says Alon Shulman, the author of The Second Summer of Love: How Dance Music Took Over the World. “If we’re putting vulnerable people at risk due to coronavirus, that’s not in the spirit of the summer of love.” Sacha Lord, Greater Manchester’s night-time economy adviser – and the owner of the club The Warehouse Project – quickly condemned the ravers in Carrington and Daisy Nook. “You aren’t clubbers, just selfish idiots,” he tweeted.Hanging over these parties are the fears that such mass gatherings could lead to a second wave of coronavirus infections. “The idea that: ‘Yay, this is over, let’s celebrate,’ is very premature,” says Dr Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds. “The prevalence of coronavirus is not nearly down far enough. This has not gone away yet.” Griffin points to recent figures from the Office for National Statistics that show that the decline in new Covid-19 cases has levelled off he says this, plus the absence of an established testing system, is deeply concerning.“Raves are a bad idea, even if they are outdoors,” Griffin says. “It’s a myth to say you can’t spread coronavirus in the open air. You’re exerting yourself, meaning that you have a higher respiration rate you’re in close proximity and you may have been taking drugs or drinking alcohol, meaning your awareness of physical distancing will be reduced.”The artist Jeremy Deller, whose rave documentary Everybody in the Place showcased the explosion of acid house, is more sanguine. “I think young people always want to be involved in illegal activity,” he says. “It’s a rite of passage.” However, he suggests that young ravers take a leaf out of the electronic music duo Altern-8’s book they wore chemical warfare suits and gas masks to DJ. “Thirty years ahead of their time,” Deller jokes.With the stakes so high, history may not be kind to these young ravers. “Perhaps, in 20 years’ time, people will turn around and say: ‘I went to a rave during the coronavirus pandemic,’ says Shulman. “Some people will say: ‘Amazing!’ and others will say: ‘You idiot. You’re the reason it went on for another six months.’”Finding these parties is simple: Instagram pages with names such as “Secret Forest Rave” or “Secret Quarantine Rave” link to Snapchat accounts, where locations are shared an hour before the event. Other raves are organised via WhatsApp groups. What is more difficult is getting illegal ravers to talk to me. Ravers who break the omertà can be blacklisted from future events – a risk many don’t want to take when they are facing a summer of cancelled plans. So, young people who hours before posted videos to their social media accounts of themselves dancing in a packed field tell me that I have the wrong person, or feign ignorance. “Jog on,” writes one. “Leg it, ya grass,” says another.Illegal raves are popping up faster than velvety mammals in a game of whack-a-mole. “Every time I look at Instagram I see another 10 raves being organised,” says Matty. “It’s going to get so much worse.” Supt Jonathan Davies of Merseyside police, which disrupted the Kirkby rave, says his force has attended four raves this month alone. “They are cropping up very fast,” he says. “It’s a national issue. All the forces are flagging them up. They are gathering momentum.”Young people were obeying the lockdown rules – until suddenly they were not. “The raves started to boom about a month after lockdown, once most people realised they weren’t going to get sick,” says Matty. Penny, a 27-year-old performer from London, recently went to an illegal rave in Hackney, east London. “A month ago, people would have said: ‘No you can’t go partying, that’s awful!’ But the way it’s been handled by the government, now we have a different perspective. They’ve given us such mixed messages all the way through … Boris Johnson wanted herd immunity, didn’t he? He’s achieved that, by being so wishy-washy about the whole thing.”The rave Penny attended was held in some artists’ studios she spent the evening banging a drum she found on the dancefloor and doing tarot readings for guests. “There was a postapocalyptic, glamorous vibe,” she says. “I really enjoyed it. Everyone was in the moment, dancing.”Davies says that some commercialised illegal raves – at which you have to pay for entry – have links to organised crime. “This looks like a group of people involved in criminality who’ve decided to start doing raves, charging £10 a head, and they are relentless. The same people are planning further events.” Greater Manchester police have issued a similar warning, stating that several of the 13 illegal raves they have stopped in recent weeks had links to organised crime, specifically the gangs that control the drug supply to the north-west of England.But enthusiastic amateurs are also getting in on the act. “I’m not a criminal or nothing,” insists Andy when I call him. “I didn’t think it would be as big as it was. It just snowballed.” Andy, who is in his early 20s and lives in Yorkshire, recently organised a rave for 400 people in some woods near Manchester (doing it closer to home seemed too risky). “It was banging,” he says. “I think everyone was just chuffed to be out the house. Everyone was off their heads, like, obviously.”These young ravers are unrepentant about breaking lockdown. “No one is physical distancing,” says Penny. “There’s a sense of nihilism now, like: whatever will be, will be.” Penny sees people in shops and in parks none of them are physically distancing, so why should she? Andy says the same was true at his rave. “Everyone was sweating and dancing together,” he says. “There was no two metres or anything like that.” In any case, says Andy, “the rules don’t make sense. You can’t go see your nana, but you can go to Primark? People are thinking: if you can go to Primark and buy yourself some thongs for a quid, you can go get some Es and get down a field and get out of your head.”It is not hard to see why illegal raves can act as a pressure valve for young people who have spent months indoors, away from their friends, schools, colleges or workplaces. “People feel trapped at the moment,” says Matty. “No one is on holiday. No one is at festivals. Nothing is open for the youth.”But it is more than that. For young people who have experienced only a commercialised club scene, illegal raves feel like discovering dance music in Technicolor. “Everything has got so commercial,” says Andy. “There was none of that. You could just do what you wanted.”“It feels like the 80s, like the resurgence of acid house,” says Katie, 23, who works in the music industry. She attended an illegal house music rave in woodland near Glasgow. “We had lockdown and now this is coming out of it … I think there will definitely be more and more raves throughout this summer.”Katie wore a face mask to her rave, but most people did not. A recent investigation by Vice into an illegal indoor rave found that clubbers had their temperatures taken on entry, as a precaution against coronavirus, but this was not the case at the rave Penny went to, which was held indoors. “If I was responsible for someone’s death, that would be awful,” she says.Spreading coronavirus is not the only thing that makes these raves so dangerous. At Daisy Nook, a 20-year-old man died of a drug overdose. In Carrington, three men were stabbed and a woman was raped. A girl was burned at the Kirkby rave. Two people were fatally shot at the Moss Side party. “These are dangerous places,” says Davies. “They tend to be derelict, there’s lots of water and electricity and they are isolated.” Even if you escape injury, rave-going can be a logistical nightmare. It took Katie and her friends hours to get home, after they persuaded a stranger who was camping nearby to give them a lift. “I did feel completely safe, but I definitely wouldn’t go alone as a woman,” says Katie.Yet, after so many months spent indoors, going out has never tasted so good. “It felt so lovely to let go for the night when everything is going crazy in the world,” says Katie. “And because it was risky, it gave you that extra bit of adrenaline.” Part of the thrill, too, is knowing that you got away with it. “Ah, mate,” whistles Andy. “It was a rush. We were proper buzzing all the way home.” They continued the party into Sunday daytime. Thankfully, Andy, who is a key worker, had taken Monday off.Promoters who don’t want their parties shut down by police should minimise the non-coronavirus risks. “Put security there,” Davies says. “Have adequate lighting. Don’t have your generator in a pool of water.” Although these raves are illegal under the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and the Coronavirus Act 2020, police can exercise discretion when it comes to enforcing the legislation. “If we came across one that we deemed to be safe and there was no risk there, why would we cause the disruption to close it down?” says Davies.But what about when the party ends? Andy and his friends were in such a rush to get away from the site before police caught them that they did not clean up. “We tried our best,” he says, sounding sheepish. “But when it’s 6am and the sun’s coming up, and you’ve been up all night, you just want to get out of there.” Shulman is disapproving. “You’d never have had rubbish on the ground back in the day,” he says. “People were respectful.”It took 40 volunteers nine hours and 400 bin bags to clean up the devastation in Daisy Nook. Sandra Lord, a receptionist, was one of them. “It looked like a war zone,” she says, sighing. The promoters even left behind their equipment: having made £40,000 on £10-a-head tickets, Lord guesses that they did not fancy carrying it back up the hill. “I found used tampons, sanitary towels, faeces, wipes everywhere,” Lord says. Carroll’s neighbour found a used tampon in his hedge. Worse still were the thousands of discharged nitrous oxide gas canisters, which are made of metal and can be fatal to birds and other wildlife. “It was a sea of silver,” Lord says. “I couldn’t even guess how many of them I picked up. Thousands and thousands.”Despite the stakes for public health being so high, it is clear that something is catalysing in teenage bedrooms that were previously heavy with ennui: a second summer of rave, held in the squelching fields, tangled hedgerows and damp forests of Britain. Katie remembers looking up at the lights on the trees while dancing in the woodland near Glasgow. She says: “I had this feeling of: wow, people really will go far for a party, won’t they?”Some names have been changed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ecd4beae976d6cdedd2b846e0cf5cf3e6b1f79c/0_64_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3212df302b8a245869b2784b9ffd8492","title":"after a decade of austerity what now","story":"Columnist John Harris has spent the past decade touring the country and reporting on what devastating budget cuts have meant to communities.

This will ensure members’ votes count.”In another sign of the transformation wrought in the party under Starmer’s leadership, it emerged that Seumas Milne, Corbyn’s most senior adviser and an executive director of the party, is leaving his Labour post. Friends believe he is planning to write a book.Asked about Milne’s departure, a Labour spokesman said, “we don’t comment on staffing matters”.Starmer and his allies believe the change to a proportional voting system, which had the support of the Electoral Reform Society, will dilute the power of “slates” of rivals from either wing of the party.But it was fiercely resisted by leftwingers on the NEC, amid simmering tensions in the wake of Starmer’s sacking of Rebecca Long-Bailey last week, over claims of antisemitism.One NEC member, Huda Elmi, from campaign group Momentum, said the NEC had “decided to wage war on member democracy”, calling the change a “stitch-up”.A group of NEC members, including Unite’s assistant general secretary Howard Beckett, are threatening to launch a legal challenge against the decision, which they say constitutes a “rule-change”, and should be put to a full Labour conference for approval.With this year’s gathering cancelled, that could potentially delay any change for more than 12 months.NEC members were also told by the party’s new general secretary, David Evans, that Labour’s membership is 580,000 – as high as the level reported during Corbyn’s leadership.During the meeting, which lasted more than six hours, Starmer and his deputy, Angela Rayner, were repeatedly challenged by left-wing NEC members over the switch to STV and other fraught issues such as his comments on Black Lives Matter.Starmer’s allies have insisted he was using the word “moment” in the sense of “epoch”, to emphasise the significance of BLM – but some party activists and staff complained that the remarks appeared to suggest it was a passing phase.Challenged about what he meant at the NEC meeting, the Labour leader spoke for four to five minutes, but declined to engage in an argument, NEC sources said. One person present described his response as “sucking the air out of the room”.Separately, 13 NEC members wrote to Starmer and Rayner in advance of the meeting, claiming that the party’s press office had dismissed concerns about potentially discriminatory behaviour by Labour staff revealed in a leaked report.The 860-page internal report, which emerged in April, described what it called an “abundant evidence of a hyper-factional atmosphere prevailing in party HQ in this period, which appears to have affected the expeditious and resolute handling of disciplinary complaints”.It included hundreds of private WhatsApp exchanges between named members of Labour staff, discussing Jeremy Corbyn and his close aides in insulting terms.The report’s contents, and the leak itself, are now being investigated by an independent review, chaired by Martin Forde QC.In a the strongly worded letter, seen by the , the 13 NEC members demanded an explanation of comments released to the website Open Democracy by the party’s press office.The comments appeared to dismiss as “po-faced” concerns about insulting WhatsApp messages revealed in the report, stressing they were private communications.In their letter to Starmer, the NEC members said: “The comment from the Labour party defends racist, sexist and abusive language in the WhatsApp groups, and denies that these messages between then senior party staff display a discriminatory culture within the Labour party.”Signatories included Howard Beckett, Mick Whelan, the secretary general of Aslef, and the NEC’s chair, Andi Fox.A Labour party spokesperson insisted the comments actually formed part of a statement from Labour’s lawyers, responding to claims made by Open Democracy about a specific member of staff, which should not have been sent via the press office.“For the avoidance of doubt, we are clear that the comments that have been quoted do not in any way represent the party’s position in relation to the contents of the leaked report overall and do not prejudge the outcome of those investigations,” the spokesperson said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1a5e740409dcbb0401a12bef1c3d9d91e7a0b56/233_45_1399_840/master/1399.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6dc7441f06c9474375bd2253588f4638","title":"theresa may says david frost uks new national security adviser has no proven expertise","story":"Former prime minister adds to outcry over David Frost’s appointmentTheresa May has launched a forthright attack on Boris Johnson’s government over the appointment of the EU negotiator David Frost as the UK’s national security adviser.The former prime minister accused the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, of promoting someone “with no proven expertise” to a crucial role at the heart of the UK’s safety.It follows an outcry from security officials and former senior civil servants at the decision to hand the job to Frost, who is expected to prioritise his role negotiating the UK’s deal with the EU while learning his new job.Though formerly a long-serving diplomat, Frost, known as “Frosty” among Johnson’s closest aides, has little direct experience of security matters. Unlike other national security advisers since the role was created in 2010, Frost is not a civil servant, but a political appointee.Frost will receive a peerage and replace Sir Mark Sedwill, who will also step down from his roles as cabinet secretary and head of the civil service, as part of a Whitehall shake-up announced on Sunday.May, who served on the national security council for nine years as home secretary and then prime minister, made her comments as Gove responded to an urgent question about Frost’s role in the House of Commons.She paid tribute to Sedwill, saying she had listened to expert independent advice from national security advisers for nine years, and noted that Gove had made a recent speech saying the government should be able to promote experts to key roles.“On Saturday, my right honourable friend said we must be able to promote those with proven expertise. Why, then, is the new national security adviser a political appointee with no proven expertise in national security?” she said.Gove replied: “We have had previous national security advisers, all of them excellent, not all of them necessarily were people who were steeped in the security world. Some of them were distinguished diplomats in their own right. David Frost is a distinguished diplomat in his own right.” As Gove spoke, May grimaced and shook her head.The former Labour minister Angela Eagle asked Gove to return to May’s question, saying he had failed to answer it. “What are his specific qualifications and expertise and why on earth was he considered for a second for this role?” she said.Gove replied: “The broader point is that David Frost is involved in one of the most complex diplomatic negotiations ever conducted and a diplomatic negotiation that relates specifically to defence and security cooperation as well as tariffs and trade.“He has been a civil servant for decades and it is the case that Mark Lyall Grant and Kim Darroch, who were national security advisers, were not people who were steeped in the world of intelligence and security. .”It is the first time that May has launched an attack on Johnson’s administration since she was forced from office last summer. She appointed Sedwill to the role as national security adviser in 2017.Later, the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, backed Gove, saying in front of a defence select committee that it was not necessary for Frost to have a national security background, arguing instead that his experience dealing with Brussels would help. “I think negotiating with the EU sets you up pretty well to tackling an octopus which the national security construct can sometimes be,” the minister added.Wallace also said that Sedwill would “make a fantastic secretary general of Nato if he is successful in getting that appointment”, making him the first minister to publicly confirm that the outgoing cabinet secretary and national security adviser would be put up by the UK as a candidate for the top job at the military alliance next year.Frost, 55, will be the secretary of the 15-strong National Security Council, which meets regularly to discuss strategy. Meetings are chaired by the prime minister and include the heads of MI5 and MI6, GCHQ, and the country’s most senior military officers.“Although one does have to wonder about the masterly-ness of a mind that thinks a good way to test one’s eyesight is to go for a 60-mile drive,” she said.Despite occupying what was once a neutral role, Frost could be introduced to parliament as a Conservative, a Tory minister confirmed. Lord True told the House of Lords: “It is my understanding that he may be introduced as a Conservative peer, but I can’t confirm that.”In Gove’s speech on Whitehall reform on Saturday, he called for a push to retain expert advisers. “There are systemic problems which mean we often lose institutional memory and fail to build on hard-won success,” he said.Sedwill, the UK’s most senior civil servant, will step down from Downing Street in September and has also been handed a peerage. Johnson has discussed the possibility that Sedwill could be officially nominated to become Nato’s next secretary general. However, the post is not likely to become free until the end of 2022, when the incumbent, Jens Stoltenberg, is expected to retire after eight years in the role."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff6e67acc03717a1b8fd3541222f99647b3facfa/145_128_2542_1525/master/2542.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d77c120b2d3a24265521acaa1cc37821","title":"swing low sweet chariot makes me feel uncomfortable englands maro itoje","story":"Maro Itoje has revealed the England rugby anthem Swing Low, Sweet Chariot makes him feel “uncomfortable” but he does not believe supporters should be banned from singing it at Twickenham.This month the  revealed the Rugby Football Union was conducting a review of the song – originally an American slave spiritual – conceding that many supporters were unaware of its roots.A ban on supporters singing the song would be practically impossible to enforce but the RFU is consulting with players and fans and intends to educate Twickenham goers as to its origins. The RFU’s chief executive, Bill Sweeney, has said he no longer sings the song but would not consider supporters who do to be racist. The union is also likely to rethink its marketing and branding campaign that uses the song’s lyrics, which are visible all over Twickenham.It is believed the song was first sung at Twickenham when Martin “Chariots” Offiah featured at the 1987 Middlesex Sevens tournament. In 1988 it became popular among England supporters when Chris Oti scored a hat-trick against Ireland. The song’s origins are rooted in US slavery, however, and it is believed to have been written by the American slave Wallace Willis around the 1860s.Itoje told the BBC’s Today programme: “The context in which it was originally sung was with African American iniduals to try and give them strength, give them hope. What makes me uncomfortable was its introduction with it being sung for Martin Offiah, it being sung for Chris Oti, who are obviously two black players that played the game at Twickenham. It is a great opportunity to educate people about the context of that song.“I am not too sure if banning works because you can’t regulate what comes out of people’s mouths but I think people should be educated about the background of the song and it will be down to any inidual if they want to sing it or not.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de7f4311a67ef9aa773d1935f8f978ca06c4c3a8/155_37_2641_1585/master/2641.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8272305bef1f80af0342a5b04c5e02f","title":"hamilton review disney plus lin manuel miranda","story":"Disney+Lin-Manuel Miranda’s musical is smart, witty, funky and leaves us reflecting on America’s past and futureHamilton was hailed as revolutionary theatre in 2015, with its rapping 18th-century statesmen, its funky, feelgood hip-hop and a cast predominantly comprising actors of colour. It went on to conquer Broadway and West End audiences. How does that original Broadway staging fare on the flat screen, streamed by Disney+ in the midst of lockdown?It spoke to the moment then, and it speaks to us now, say director Thomas Kail and Lin-Manuel Miranda, the creator and star, in their short, socially distanced preamble to this highly anticipated film of the show. “We are all thinking about what it means to be American,” they add. Even if these words are not in direct reference to the America of the past few weeks, with its upsurge of anti-racist protest, their story of the Caribbean-born immigrant hero and founding father of the US, Alexander Hamilton, speaks to us obliquely of all that remains neglected in America’s history while shifting the parameters at the same time.Its rousing opening scenes remind us of that great American ideal of equality and speaks of slavery and civil rights in the 18th century. “I never thought I’d live past 20. Where I come from, some get half as many,” sings Hamilton at the start, and his words echo the dangerous fate that awaits so many of America’s black or immigrant underclass now, as debate around Black Lives Matter protests has highlighted.Even more remarkably, it keeps all the power of a live performance while simultaneously adding a filmic pizzazz including some breathtaking aerial shots. There is extraordinary direction – again under Kail – so that the cameras capture the mise en scène of theatre without losing any of the closeup intimacy of film.Miranda’s lead performance brims with understated brilliance. Every actor alongside him performs with just as much conviction though some with more swagger: Phillipa Soo is a demure Eliza Hamilton until she breaks out, gloriously, into beat-boxing Daveed Diggs is a funny, scrappy Thomas Jefferson with his edgy raps and his attitude Renée Elise Goldsberry is a heartfelt Angelica Schuyler, with a sensational, and soulful, singing voice to boot.The film keeps all the energy of the stage, from the large-scale war scenes to the political power battles which are staged as rap battles. But it also takes us into tight shots of Angelica as she sings of her secret love for Hamilton, or of King George (Jonathan Groff), the camera so close we can see the spittle of his anger over the loss of his American colony.There are profanities and urban speak, but it never sounds brash or uncouth, and the period costume (breeches for men, Gone With the Wind style dresses for women) has an edge of modernity to it. All its radicalism comes wrapped in fantastically infectious songs, stirringly delivered, and the lack of book is no hindrance to the complications in its plot.“It takes on a different meaning when you see black and brown performers telling the origin story of our country,” says Miranda, and he is right in that these performers remind us of the contribution of immigrants like Hamilton to American history. But more than this, it is the intelligence in the lyrics, and the clever subversions of the “period drama” form that make this such a joyous musical to watch.It has political intrigue, personal tragedy, a sex scandal and lightning changes of mood that sweep us along at speed. Best of all is the wit that sits neatly alongside its politics: “Immigrants, we get the job done”, says one character archly, and the audience laughs knowingly.“What is a legacy?” says Hamilton, in the heart-stopping last moments, and the film leaves us reflecting on America’s.

They argue a Chinese company poses an unacceptable long-term security risk to western phone networks.Rebel Conservatives believe they have enough votes to overturn Johnson’s 80-seat majority whenever the new 5G rules are put to the vote in a fresh bill, but they are hoping Downing Street will capitulate before then.One rebel who sits on the defence committee, the backbencher Mark Francois, said: “Are you really telling us that there’s still a possibility we will allow a company effectively owned by the Chinese Communist party to have a meaningful role in our telecommunications network?”Francois repeatedly pressed Dowden on whether the UK government believed that high-risk vendors such as Huawei should be removed in future. The minister agreed but added the government had “not set out a timetable” for doing so, which is a key demand of the rebels.A bill to legislate for 5G supply rules is due to be introduced before the summer recess in July, but Dowden conceded that if the Huawei policy changed as a result of the review, he would have to “ask parliament’s forbearance” and seek “a slight delay”, suggesting draft laws might not emerge until September.After the committee hearing, Victor Zhang, a vice-president of Huawei, said the company remained committed to the UK. “We are investing billions to make the prime minister’s vision of a ‘connected kingdom’ a reality, so that British families and businesses have access to fast, reliable mobile and broadband networks wherever they live.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7c51b0d9d83e89091b105962b5f9f100fd5aebd/170_125_4758_2857/master/4758.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=572f4398ddb4dab1f6502c8c3981f277","title":"are you thinking of booking a holiday abroad","story":"We want to hear from people who are considering or have booked a holiday abroad for the summer holiday or later in the yearThe current Foreign Office travel warning against all but essential international travel will be lifted from 6 July for countries deemed safe.

In some ways it still is. But as an early adopter of western things, from ideas to clothes, it is easy to see Japan as a familiar place. Even its unfamiliarity – Shinto shrines, sumo bouts – is recognisable as “Japan” nowadays. What is less recognisable is what Japanese writers say about their own country. Authors – not the documentarists about families living with robots – uncover the mystery. These books speak for a Japan that is often spoken for and about, and speculated about by others they speak for its history as it unfolded, for its culture as it is practised and its society as lived in and fought against.Ryū Murakami’s stories never shy away from shining a light on the darkest corners of society. In this 1980 novel that beam is amplified as it follows the entire lives of protagonists Kiku and Hashi, and all the ghastly goings-on they encounter. Both “coin locker babies” – children abandoned in one of Japan’s coin lockers (an issue arising in the 1970s) – the boys find themselves adopted by a childless couple living on an island off Kyushu, the south-westernmost of Japan’s main islands. They grow up against a background of urban and rural decay. Soon transplanting themselves to “Toxitown”, a fictional area of mayhem in Tokyo – home, it seems, to all that is swept under the rug in Japan, from foreigners and homeless people to drug dealers and other criminals – what follows is a surreal coming-of-age horror story that runs wildly through the heights of love and superstardom, and the lows of insanity and murder.“A convenience store is a world of sound.” The opening line of narrator Keiko’s breathless story of working part-time at a konbini (convenience store) is wonderfully evocative. Throughout, she likens the sounds of the store to church bells, and herself and her coworkers as members of a religion. It’s not just a testament to the minutiae of Japan’s selection of Lawsons, 7-11s and Family Marts, but also an existential challenge to normality. In an attempt to become a member of society, Keiko becomes a “cog” by working at the convenience store, before finding out there’s more to it than that. Like Jean-Paul Sartre’s waiter who is too “waiter-esque”, Keiko embodies how a convenience store worker should act – Japanese society in miniature – but in doing so, she moves further away from actual society, with its conventional marriages and babies, and the haughty couples concerned with all that.Part Lord of the Flies, part Oedipus complex, this book is a postwar howl of anguish. Actor, model, director and author Mishima’s protagonist, Noburo, is an adolescent boy living with his single mother, Fusako, in Yokohama. He also happens to be in a nihilistic gang with his schoolmates who are superficially “good” students. Though sex is alluded to throughout – Noboru discovers a peephole into his mother’s bedroom, for one thing – it’s the extreme disappointment Noburo feels in Fusako’s new lover, a sailor named Ryuji, whom he once admired, that sets the wheels in motion for an altogether brutal plan to restore glory. In real life, Mishima grew disillusioned with Japan’s postwar situation, and in 1970 he – along with other members of a right-wing militia that he founded called Tatenokai – stormed a military base in Tokyo and attempted to inspire a coup, delivering a speech to soldiers stationed there. Met with jeers, he committed seppuku (ritual suicide with a sword).This depiction of the interactions and pursuits of Tokyoites is a gentle, modern-day version of the Edo period (1603-1858) ukiyo or “floating world”, referring to the era’s burgeoning urban lifestyle. Kawakami’s transient world is one of endless dining out at izakaya (Japanese bars), of hanami (flower viewing) parties during cherry blossom season, and discussing baseball, a national obsession. Now, add the story of a thirtysomething woman’s growing relationship with a much older man, whom she calls “Sensei” – an elder-junior theme somewhat echoing Natsume Soseki’s bestselling Kokoro – and Strange Weather In Tokyo will have sweep you up in a heartwarming haze. Sōseki’s inaugural novel satirises Japan’s Meiji era (1868-1912), and its uneasy adoption of western ideas, through the life of a schoolteacher — his stupidity, his circle of friends, and what he does with his time. He’s a regular member of middle-class Tokyo, and is a fussy sort of person who gets annoyed when the neighbourhood children keep hitting a ball into his garden with a wooden stick (baseball had newly arrived in Japan at this time). The twist is that the whole novel is narrated by a cat with a holier-than-thou attitude, a wild take on authorship at any point in time, but even more so considering this novel’s serialisation from 1905-06. Japanese features multiple pronouns for “I”, but the cat uses wagahai to refer to itself (a high-register phrasing more appropriate to a nobleman), rare even at the time of publication. But the popularity of the book resulted in a resurgence of wagahai – and is still infrequently used by fictional, anthropomorphised characters.An insight into Japan’s past as much as a blueprint for understanding the country’s idiosyncratic style of westernisation, Tanizaki spins a web of conflicting interests in his 1929 novel. Kaname and his wife Misako are married, but not happily. Kaname’s father-in-law, “the old man”, thinks orce is out of the question, a western solution for problems caused by western ideas. Attempting to instil Japanese ideals in the couple and his young mistress, O-Hisa, the old man hopes to uphold traditions as Japan changes around him. Kaname, however, loves western things. He admires American film stars of the day. His dog even has an English name.Perhaps owing to the 2006 translation by Meredith McKinney, The Pillow Book reads as naturally as if it had been written today. Except it was written in the 990s and early 1000s by a lady-in-waiting of Fujiwara no Teishi, empress consort of Emperor Ichijo. This era in Japanese history, the Heian period (794-1185), was one of great significance – to nobles, anyway. Sei’s book is basically a collection of random thoughts, an ancient blog. She makes lists – of rivers, markets and other places that are either famous or have some poetic connection, or both – and writes opinionated indices with titles such as “people who seem enviable” and “things with terrifying names”. Most of the time, however, she provides a window into the courtly world: nocturnal visits from men, Shinto festivals, and the constant exchanging of witty poems between courtiers like carefully considered tweets.Dazai may be better known for his swansong – the autobiographical No Longer Human (1948) – but it is Schoolgirl, a 1939 novella, that made him famous. Narrated by the eponymous girl, the book is an unsung, prewar Japanese Catcher in the Rye for her everything is depressing, pathetic, disgusting: “Mornings are torture.” The narrator is sometimes an androgynous voice, at odds with herself and the world around her, but 81 years after publication her thoughts chime with the modern day. Possibly a veiled critique by Dazai (who was a Marxist) of ultranationalism, the schoolgirl is at one point “bored” by a teacher who went “on and on, explaining to us about patriotism, but wasn’t that pretty obvious? I mean, everyone loves the place where they were born.”The title may put some off, and depending on what edition is available, it may or may not have an electric pink cover, but Vibrator is glorious. The novel is set in Tokyo, at least for a bit, as protagonist Rei Hayakawa begins yet another trip down to her local convenience store. She’s a bulimic freelance writer who drinks too much, by the way. After a chance encounter at the store with a truck driver, Okabe, she leaves her usual, self-destructive routine and hops in his cab for a road trip. Japan’s highways are not pretty and its winter landscape is not always the delicate woodblock print scenes you may know, but this book shows both in their supreme mundanity as Rei journeys to the deep north with a stranger, and further into herself.Only half of this book takes place in Japan. That’s because every other chapter is set somewhere that exists (or doesn’t exist) called the “The End of the World”, whose inhabitants are poignantly mindless, perhaps soulless even. Every chapter in between, on the other hand, is set an alternate Tokyo, “Hard-Boiled Wonderland”, in which the narrator works as a sort of human data-processing machine. It’s a head-scratcher of a story. The nameless narrator spends a memorable portion of the novel below ground, in a monstrous kind of sewer system crawling with up-to-date kappa (amphibious demons of Japanese folklore), emerging from this secret subterranean labyrinth at Aoyama-itchōme station, one of a handful of Tokyo locations name-dropped throughout."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/013864de9db0abfcb98ca8eeae44f8d609c9503c/42_519_6507_3904/master/6507.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f0662460816228035751f6f62aac2f4","title":"timmy mallett childrens tv what he did next interview","story":"A huge children’s TV star in the 1980s, Mallett is now an artist and has written a new memoir. It charts the bike ride he took, inspired by his older brother, who had Down’s syndrome and lived an extraordinarily rich lifeChildren’s television presenters occupy a strange place in one’s memory, somewhere between grandparents and primary school friendships. They are not mere celebrities, but a part of your childhood, and if you grew up in the 80s and spent most of your time watching TV, as I did, then Timmy Mallett will occupy such a space. In the mid 80s, he was one of the team of presenters of Wide Awake Club, the Saturday-morning children’s show, although it is only Mallett, with his garish clothes and colourful glasses, that I can really remember. He quickly also became the face of the school-holiday show Wacaday. A whole generation of children grew up hitting their siblings over the head with a cushion, or worse, as they recreated his word association game Mallett’s Mallet at home.\u0026nbspMallett, now 64, has written a memoir, following the journey of a two-month bike ride through France and Spain two years ago, taking the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage route. The book is punctuated with memories of his life and career, which is why we are talking, on a sunny day in lockdown, over Zoom. Mallett is mostly an artist these days, so life has changed very little.“I suppose going off on a longer adventure would be something I would like to do, and also seeing friends,” he says. But he paints every day, doing a live session on Facebook, where he always appears wearing a different pair of coloured glasses. He recites poetry and stories, and seems utterly delighted with life, even in the middle of lockdown.It’s still spring when we speak, and he has been painting the season. “It’s a magnificent spring,” he says. “Is that a coincidence?” I don’t know, I say – is it objectively more magnificent, or is it that we have slowed down to notice it? “We’re certainly noticing it. This is a spring we’ll all remember and there’s never been a brighter, more colourful, more spectacular spring. I was out on my bike doing my bit of daily exercise and I was surprised to see, about a week ago, the horse chestnuts in flower, like candelabra. I’m just noticing colour. Colour, colour, colour.”The inspiration for the Santiago bike adventure was Mallett’s brother Martin, who was two years older than him and died shortly before Mallett set off. Well, the inspiration was Martin, and Mallett’s great heroine, Eleanor of Aquitaine, the 12th-century queen over whose lands he travelled. (Mallett’s book is a fun read – at once a history lesson, travelogue, love letter to cycling, autobiography and motivational manual, with some perhaps unintended but endearingly hilarious lines such as “tarmac is the same all over the world”.)Martin had Down’s syndrome, and his whole life, says Mallett, was about “reaching his potential”. He lived in a supported community in Aberdeen, where he worked in the bakery. Although Martin had early-onset dementia and died at the age of 64, “it’s not the length of your life, it’s the depth and breadth and all the rest of filling it all. And boy, did Martin fill it,” says Mallett.\u0026nbspMallett was the youngest of three boys. “I always knew Martin was different,” he says. “But it was quite useful having a bigger brother who would play the games I wanted to play. For Martin, it was always just about being together, that was the important thing. When he would come to visit us in later years, our Billy’s an only child and he would say: ‘Come on, Uncle Martin, let’s do this.’ ‘Yeah.’ I instantly saw it again, the same pattern. How nice is that, to just have somebody to play with?”The boys grew up in a small town in Greater Manchester, their father working as an artist for a textile company before joining the clergy. Mallett remembers his mother giving talks about being the parent of a “mentally handicapped” child. “That phrase just sounds awful, doesn’t it? She would say: ‘Martin was born a mongol.’ Wow. That’s how people talked about it.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMartin was born in 1953, at a time when it was common for babies with Down’s syndrome to be institutionalised. “Mum and Dad didn’t hide him away,” says Mallett. “They allowed him to make the most he could of his abilities.” There is only one instance that sticks in his mind of Martin being bullied, as the two of them were on their way to Cubs. “A group of kids picked on us. One of the group said: ‘He goes to our school,’ pointing at me, ‘get the other one.’ There was a bit of pushing and shoving and roughing up Martin, and we ran off in tears. And the big Cubs, when they saw us arriving, dishevelled and upset, went out to go and sort out our attackers.\u0026nbspWhether they ever did or not is irrelevant the fact is, Martin was part of the group and they weren’t going to have that.”What Mallett mainly remembers about his brother is how adventurous he was. “He would get lost he always had wanderlust, he was always off exploring. Now that I’m a parent, you know that must have been really worrying. I remember my dad going down to the canal and dreading that moment where he’d have to look over into the lock.” Martin, like other people with Down’s syndrome growing up at that period, was not expected to live for long. Did it feel like that was hanging over the family? Mallett pauses. “I’m not sure it hung over me. I was aware that people said that, and that people with Down’s syndrome don’t necessarily live as long as others, but that’s not really true these days.”Once Mallett and his eldest brother, Paul, left home, their parents would hear Martin talking to himself at night and realised it was time for him to move on with his life, too. He moved to a Camphill community, for people with learning disabilities, in Aberdeen. Mallett is proud of how much financial support Martin received from the local authorities throughout his life. “Are we as good about doing that these days?” he says of the cuts that have hit hardest among people with disabilities.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspGrowing up, Mallett wanted, like many children, to be a pop star. “I didn’t think that would actually happen and I would have a No 1 hit around the world,” he says – his single Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Yellow Polka Dot Bikini, released by his band Bombalurina, was unavoidable in the summer of 1990. “I mean, that makes me go: ‘Wow, that was a dream I had.’” Was he always a show-off? He laughs. “Yeah. In my book, I talk about our pop group, The Kettle Holders. Paul couldn’t remember the words, Martin couldn’t say the words, so I just made them up and sang them.”By the time he got to Warwick University, to study history, “I knew I wanted to go into broadcasting. I knew I wanted to be a DJ, an entertainer.” He had a university radio show, then got a slot on Radio Oxford, and then at Manchester’s Piccadilly Radio, where a series of helpers included the young Chris Evans, Nick Robinson and Brian Cox. When the TV station TV-am launched in 1983, Mallett was brought in to host the children’s shows.\u0026nbsp“I loved it. I liked the fact that it was make it up as you go along, and try things out. You’d have a week going: ‘Here we are in Blah-lin, in Blah-many.’ You just repeat those gags and it becomes part of the language. Here’s a nice little thing, I’ve got something to show you …” He goes off, and returns a few seconds later with Pinky Punky, the soft toy mallet from the show (Mallett sells them, along with a full range of other themed merchandise, on his website). “He made his first appearance on Wacaday 30 years ago. What soft toy lasts 30 years?”\u0026nbspMy sister and I used to play endless games of Mallett’s Mallet, I say. “Good!” He says it’s “lovely” that there is a whole generation who have fond memories of him. “It also reminds me that, you know, there’s a responsibility here.” The other show I loved, I say, was Jim’ll Fix It, presented by Jimmy Savile, whose horrendous serial sex abuse came to light only after he died. Did Mallett ever have any dealings with him? He suddenly goes quiet and serious, a dark cloud passing. “No. No. Never met him.” Were there stories going around in children’s TV circles about him at the time? “No,” says Mallett. “If there were, I never heard them.”\u0026nbspWacaday came to an end in 1992, when TV-am closed. Did he worry about what he would do next? No, he says. He went into TV production, did some panto, some stage shows. For a while he played the student circuit. “I remember thinking: ‘Why would I be being booked for students?’ Well, because little Wideawakers had suddenly grown up and gone to uni.” He wondered if he needed to make Mallett’s Mallet edgier, to entertain a drunken student crowd. “But no, you keep it as wholesome and as lovely as it was when you were eight years old.” He still tours holiday camps, though not this summer. “I guess they’ll come back next year,” he says.\u0026nbspMallett has a wardrobe full of his “original colourful Timmy gear. That’s weird isn’t it?” Does he still wear it? “I do occasionally, yeah. If I’m going on stage and stuff, yes, I would do – it’s funny, isn’t it, to see all those bright and colourful things, but colour has always been a part of who I am. What am I wearing here?” He looks down at his green shirt with darker splodges on it, and takes his glasses (also green) off to see which pair he is wearing today. Does he feel under pressure to perform, in everyday life, as the wacky “Timmy Mallett”? “No. I’m quite comfortable in who I am and what I do and, honestly, it’s not a pressure. I am Timmy Mallett and this is who I am.”There hasn’t been much TV work in recent years – in 2008, he was a contestant on I’m a Celebrity and featured in a Skepta music video – but he says: “I don’t sort of hanker for it. I’ve got a busy life.” What plans does he have? “I’ve got quite a few, but here’s the thing – I haven’t discussed them yet with Mrs Mallett, and I’m very much aware that when I started planning for the Camino, she did mention ‘it would have been nice if you’d asked’.” And, yes, he does call Lynda, his wife of 30 years, Mrs Mallett in real life, he says. “There’s something about ‘Mrs Mallett’. It’s quite respectful and it adds a certain stature to the relationship, if you like. What do you call your partner?” By his name, like a normal person. Mallett smiles.\u0026nbspThe Camino had been planned for a long time before Martin died, he says, although he set off two days after his brother’s funeral. “It wasn’t planned as a grief ride it was planned as a celebration of reaching your potential, with Martin as the inspiration. He knew I was going on the bike ride because I had discussed it with him. I said: ‘I’m going on a bike ride, Martin, a big bike ride.’ ‘You and me,’ he said. Wow. And that’s when I knew that I was going to carry him in my heart.”\u0026nbspThe ride taught him about planning for the unexpected, and a willingness to be vulnerable. “Being vulnerable opens you up to the possibility of acts of random kindness. ‘Be kind to yourself’ – I’ve been hearing that phrase in this lockdown.” The other thing he tried to remember, he says, is “these are the golden years. And, you know, life is a whizz through at a million billion gazillion miles an hour. The important thing to do is to fill every moment, like my dear brother. Reach your potential. It’s not about being the best in the world, just be the best that you can be.”It looks like a platitude when it is written down but, delivered in a voice from childhood, eyes sparkling beneath wacky glasses, pink foam mallet just visible, it sounds wise.• Utterly Brilliant!

Fauci said he could not provide an estimated death toll, but said: “It is going to be very disturbing, I guarantee you that.”The stark warning came after Schuchat told the Journal of the American Medical Association: “What we hope is that we can take it seriously and slow the transmission. We have way too much virus across the country for that right now, so it’s very discouraging.”She added that there was “a lot of wishful thinking around the country” that the pandemic would be over by the summer.“We are not even beginning to be over this,” Schuchat said. “There are a lot of worrisome factors about the last week or so.“We’re not in the situation of New Zealand or Singapore or Korea, where a new case is rapidly identified and all the contacts are traced, and people are isolated who are sick, and people who are exposed are quarantined and they can keep things under control.”Testifying before the Senate committee, Fauci said he was “quite concerned about what we are seeing evolve right now in several states” which had moved quickly in attempts to return to normal.On Monday, the governor of Arizona ordered bars, movie theaters, gyms and water parks to shut down for a month, weeks after reopening. Texas, Florida and California, all seeing rises in cases, have rolled back reopening efforts. Oregon and Kansas have ordered people to wear masks in public.Responding to widely shared images of people not following guidelines – including not wearing a mask and gathering in large groups – Fauci said better messaging was required.“What we saw were a lot of people who maybe felt because they think they are invulnerable – and we know many young people are not because they’re getting serious disease – that therefore their getting infected has nothing to do with anyone else,” he said.“When in fact it does, because if a person gets infected they may not be symptomatic but they could pass it to someone else, who passes it to someone else, who then makes someone’s grandmother, grandfather, sick uncle or leukaemic child on chemotherapy, get sick and die.”Fauci said: “We’ve got to get that message out that we are all in this together and if we’re going to contain this, we’ve gotta contain it together.”New daily cases are rising in 38 states, according to NPR’s pandemic tracker, but the White House continues its attempts to downplay the severity of Covid-19. At a briefing on Monday, press secretary Kayleigh McEnany ignored the surge.“The people who are being infected tend to be those – as Vice-President Pence has noted – half of those testing positive are under the age of 35. This means we’re catching people in their communities,” she said.She added: “We’re aware that there are embers that need to be put out.”Fauci said on Sunday the US was unlikely to achieve herd immunity to the coronavirus even with a vaccine, given a third of Americans say they would not receive it.“There is a general anti-science, anti-authority, anti-vaccine feeling among some people in this country – an alarmingly large percentage of people, relatively speaking,” Fauci said, adding that the government has “a lot of work to do” to educate people about vaccines.Even states where the rate of new infections has decreased are rethinking plans to allow businesses to reopen. New Jersey has postponed plans to allow indoor dining, while the governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, said he may reverse plans to allow restaurants and bars to reopen.Broadway theaters will remain closed until January 2021, an industry group said on Monday. Theaters had planned to reopen in September.People in the US are expected to be barred from non-essential travel to the EU when it releases a “safe list” of countries on Tuesday. Russia and Brazil, each experiencing rising coronavirus cases, are among the other countries to be excluded from the list."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/674911e72fcf0b8862676c5874ff03d2c81b452b/0_0_5025_3014/master/5025.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd443581d058d9453422bb848c033fa4","title":"gcse and a level exams in all subjects to be available in autumn","story":"Pupils dissatisfied with results based on predicted grades will be able to sit traditional examsGCSE and A-level pupils in England who are unhappy with their predicted grades this summer will be able to sit exams in all subjects in the autumn to try to improve their mark, the exams regulator has confirmed.Ofqual said a full series of exams would be made available to students who were unable to sit their summer exams after they were cancelled because of the Covid-19 crisis, and are dissatisfied with grades based on teacher assessment.Students who believe their results may have been affected by bias or discrimination will be told to take it up with their school in the first instance, according to new draft guidance. If there is evidence of serious malpractice, exam boards will be expected to investigate.Headteachers had argued that the autumn series should be restricted to A-levels and GCSE English and maths because of concerns about the practical challenges already facing schools as they open up to all pupils from September.However, following a consultation, Ofqual ruled that exam boards must make exams available in all subjects at all levels in the additional autumn series beginning in October. Results will be based on exams alone, while pupils doing art and design will be set a task to complete under supervised conditions.Exam boards will be expected to have the usual arrangements for reviews of marking and appeals in place, and students will be able to request a replacement certificate.Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said pupils and parents could be confident this summer’s grades would be every bit as valid as in any other year, without the need to enter for exams in the autumn.“We are concerned about how schools and colleges will be able to accommodate and manage a full suite of autumn exams alongside the huge challenge of bringing all their pupils back in September, identifying learning gaps, and putting catch-up support in place,” he said. “All of this will have to be done while managing the risks associated with coronavirus.”The University and College Union (UCU) warned that disadvantaged students who were unhappy with their results could still miss out. UCU’s general secretary, Jo Grady, said: “Research has shown that disadvantaged students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds are more likely to be predicted lower grades than their more affluent counterparts.“The only option for students who are unhappy with their results is to spin the roulette wheel with high-stakes exams, which will not be the right fit for all and may disadvantage those with special educational needs.”Ofqual said anyone with concerns about “bias, discrimination or any other fact that suggests that a centre did not behave with care or integrity” when issuing calculated grades this summer should complain to their school in the first instance.“Where there is evidence, we require exam boards to investigate allegations as potential malpractice or maladministration,” Ofqual said. “We expect such allegations to be rare, but this is an important safeguard for students and their overall confidence in this year’s grading arrangements.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32d0906c1bcea2c9ab2abb7f15f07ea2c0c3cbea/0_219_3164_1898/master/3164.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6778e50da57654efb3f7134b53f3af07","title":"leicester how have you been affected by the local lockdown","story":"We want to hear from people living in Leicester about how restrictions are affecting themLeicester is the first city to experience a local lockdown with non-essential shops and schools closed from Tuesday.Restrictions are set to be in place for two weeks after infections rose, with Leicester accounting for around one in 10 of all coronavirus cases in the past week.We want to hear from local people, schools and business about their experiences.

More precise and targeted lockdown rules would lead to higher levels of acceptance among the population, he said.R, or the \u0027effective reproduction number\u0027, is a way of rating a disease’s ability to spread. It’s the average number of people on to whom one infected person will pass the virus. For an R of anything above 1, an epidemic will grow exponentially. Anything below 1 and an outbreak will fizzle out – eventually.At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the estimated R for coronavirus was between 2 and 3 – higher than the value for seasonal flu, but lower than for measles. That means each person would pass it on to between two and three people on average, before either recovering or dying, and each of those people would pass it on to a further two to three others, causing the total number of cases to snowball over time.The reproduction number is not fixed, though. It depends on the biology of the virus people\u0027s behaviour, such as social distancing\u0026nbspand a population’s immunity. A country may see regional variations in its R number, depending on local factors like population density and transport patterns.Armin Laschet, the state premier of North-Rhine Westphalia and one of the candidates vying for the leadership of Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU), said he would lobby his political colleagues to revise the “emergency brake” mechanism so that future lockdowns would not have to “take out” entire districts but only “those places where there is a real danger”.Currently, pandemic measures passed by the German government foresee that any community with an infection level exceeding 50 people per 100,000 over the previous seven days must return to lockdown.The outbreak at the Tönnies meat processing plant in Gütersloh, where some 1,500 employees tested positive, has been met with anger in the region, as locals fear they will be forced to miss out on summer holidays that were due to start at the end of last week.Abattoir boss Clemens Tönnies, dubbed Germany’s “sausage king” in national media, on Tuesday announced that he would step down as chairman of the supervisory board of Bundesliga football club Schalke 04 following fan protests.In keeping with Germany’s initial nationwide lockdown, local restrictions in the Gütersloh district have been relatively light-touch.Some 7,000 employees at the Tönnies processing plant have been put under house quarantine, where they are being visited by a mobile medical team that tests them for the virus and confirms their whereabouts.The teams consist of employees from the local orderly office, containment scouts from the health authority, members of the German Red Cross, members of the German military, and translators. Most of the abattoir workers come from Bulgaria and Romania and speak little or no German.The majority of Gütersloh’s 363,000-strong population, however, can move freely within and even travel out of the area as long as they adhere to social distancing rules.Some German Länder, including Lower Saxony, Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria, have issued bans to stop people from the Gütersloh area staying in their states overnight. Hotels and holiday home rental companies have been advised to check their bookings and either contact visitors from the locked-down area in advance or turn them away at the door.On the Baltic Sea island of Usedom, 14 tourists from Gütersloh were told to curtail their holidays and travel back to their home region, though a spokesperson for the district said he did not know whether they had actually done so.Some politicians, like the Social Democrat health expert Karl Lauterbach, have called for stricter local lockdown rules that would stop people from Gütersloh travelling outside their community unless they can provide a certificate showing they had recently tested negative.But officials in the affected region say it is still unclear whether the virus has actually managed to spread in significant numbers from staff at the Tönnies plant to the wider population.Karl-Josef Laumann, the health minister of North-Rhine Westphalia, said while it was “not yet certain” whether the outbreak could be confined to the abattoir, the paucity of newly recorded cases had made him “optimistic”.Last week, between 22 and 28 June, the region registered 100 cases of Covid-19 not directly linked to the slaughterhouse outbreak – an “unremarkable” rate of infections, a district spokesperson told the .Authorities say they have carried out 28,000 tests via six new walk-in test centres and general medical practices since the start of the second lockdown. Any resident can undergo a test free of charge."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/638d4aae9914c7776afd8a0af3acb4213539fcaf/0_62_4097_2459/master/4097.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e18494b0fb46f88a38991d5815bf1e1d","title":"make masks compulsory in public says virus expert peter piot","story":"Prof Peter Piot nearly died of coronavirus and says he now wears one wherever he goes Face masks should be compulsory for adults in all public and enclosed spaces, such as shops, according to a leading infectious diseases expert.Prof Peter Piot, the director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said he did not understand why the government had only ordered their use on trains, tubes and buses in England.“I don’t understand why it is not official policy to have compulsory face masks not only on public transport but when you go into public places, enclosed places and shops and all that,” said Piot in an interview with the .He contrasted Britain with Japan, where people use face masks even if they have a cold in the interests of protecting others, and have done since the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918, he said. Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan have also adopted masks as “an act of civic duty and of the collective wellbeing”.The US, he said, was “a natural experiment” with some states requiring people to wear masks while others do not. Recent data has suggested that in those where masks are compulsory, “they have much lower incidence”, he said.But it seems to have become a political issue there, he said. “Someone who wears a mask is a Democrat or a Republican who doesn’t support Trump.”Piot was seriously ill with Covid-19 himself. The virologist co-discovered Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1976 when he was just 27 and is the former head of the UN’s programme on HIV and Aids, leading research in Africa.But he said  it was the coronavirus that nearly finished him. Now, he believes he is immune, at least for a year or two.“I wear a mask wherever I go. For me, it is to remind people that there is an epidemic.”He added: “We need to take stock, with infections and deaths falling, and learn lessons for the spikes to come”, warning that the virus could be around for many years. “We need to realise – and it’s sobering – that we are at the beginning of what may be a multi-year type of epidemic.” Acute outbreaks could give way to more endemic infection with waves that flare up.“We probably will have to get to a situation of societies living with covid. We have seen it with HIV, although it is very different. But first there were active epidemics and now it is ‘normal’ that there are 700,000 people dying every year and we still have infections. But this is a respiratory virus and far more infectious than HIV.”Without a vaccine that works well, “we will have to constantly live with this kind of risk that we have at the moment”, he said. “The biggest concern I have is for older people.”As with HIV, “an epidemic reveals the fault lines in society. The big one this epidemic has revealed is how we treat the elderly. We often park them in pre-mortuary type institutions and give a bit of money and hope it is OK”.Masks would help to safeguard them and care homes would need “constant and intensive testing to make them a safe environment”. “The key for policy today is to make certain that high-risk situations and places are safe – the whole of the NHS and health services and care homes and now meat-processing plants and there may be others.”We need to apply the lessons, he said. “It could be Leicester, another factory, a university, a neighbourhood. We should be better prepared. It is a combination of national action and local policies but also inidual behaviour. I understand – I’m dying to get out and see friends and family but let’s hope people are going to respect as much as possible all these absolutely essential precautions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3507a10ebec4f931a068d40281c9a027172c583a/0_145_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80dbea2a04dc258f1f547ed703587583","title":"man given almost zero chance of covid 19 survival due to return home","story":"Mal Martin, 58, from Cardiff, spent 11 weeks in intensive care and could still lose fingers due to diseaseA woman allowed to see her husband to say goodbye when told he had “almost zero chance” of surviving coronavirus, said he could shortly be home after more than 11 weeks in intensive care, much of it on a ventilator.Sue Martin, 49, from Cardiff, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that her husband, Mal, 58, had survived against all the odds, but the family was now preparing for the unknown ahead.Mal, the chairman of a recruitment firm, was admitted to hospital on 29 March. In an interview in April, Sue, a civil servant, told of the emotional moment she and their children Hana, 16, and William, 14, all wearing personal protective equipment, were given 10 minutes to say their goodbyes.He is now expected to be discharged within days, but the physical toll of the virus could mean that he will lose some fingers, and he may require long-term dialysis.Doctors were “just completely astounded” at his determination and focus, she said. “Everybody in the hospital has been saying to him they did not expect him to survive. We were told he was slipping away, that he was as close to death as anybody they had seen that had then managed to survive.”She and the children had discussed his potential funeral. “To think we were at that stage, and it was almost so hopeless, and to now talk about him coming home, well we just can’t believe it. We’re just so incredibly grateful,” she said.Unable to see him in person, they initially saw him through FaceTime, but stopped because it was too depressing “to see him just lying there, lifeless, and obviously unresponsive”.When he eventually came out of his coma, “it was a one-way conversation”.“He was so weak, all he could do was blink, or perhaps raise an eyebrow, or nod. He couldn’t even move his arms, or hands, or legs, in the beginning. He had so much muscle wastage from being on a ventilator for so long.”After a while, with a voice setting fitted to his tracheotomy, he was able to respond. “The day we were able to hear his voice was just incredible,” she said.“Every time we see him now, it is more like him, he is just a very thinner, weaker version of himself. He’s just now realising how close he came, and what we went through as well, which is quite difficult I think for him to process.”Several fingers and his thumbs are “all shrivelled up” as result of medication given to keep him alive. “It’s a small price to pay if he requires some amputations of fingers and thumbs,” she said. He might always suffer from breathlessness, and could require dialysis long term. She has been told his hallucinations may last for years.“So we will continue to take each day as it comes. Him actually being here physically with us will make a massive difference. And we will just do whatever we need to do to get him to the best place we can get him to.“But we will all be very different. But hopefully there will be some positives to come from it and we will just continue to be as positive as possible and support him in the best way we can.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/976c297047730e9f5b371a5df58b8ab615541c42/131_0_3465_2080/master/3465.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5cbfdc58b420770bb03e1127f8863e3b","title":"netanyahu hints at delay to plans to annex the west bank","story":"Israeli PM’s suggestion that deadline may be missed follows Benny Gantz saying Covid-19 is more urgent than annexationThe Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is struggling to push through his West Bank annexation plans, slated to start as soon as Wednesday, facing opposition from Palestinians, the international community and even his own government.Netanyahu had pledged to begin the process of annexing Israeli settlements and the Jordan Valley from 1 July, as part of a peace plan devised by Donald Trump’s US administration. But he hinted at a delay on Tuesday, saying annexation talks would continue “in the coming days” with US officials.The remarks came a day after the alternate prime minister, Benny Gantz, said annexation must wait while the country tackles the coronavirus pandemic, pointing to deep isions arising from Washington’s initiative.Unveiled in January, the Trump administration’s plan supported annexation, but also foresaw the eventual creation of a Palestinian state – a red flag for many Israeli settlers, who believe their government should control the entire West Bank. A map published with the US plan shows a fragmented Palestinian state, pockmarked by Israeli settlements that are joined by Israeli access roads.Washington’s proposal was rejected by the Palestinian leadership immediately, as it offers them a rump state while rejecting their fundamental demands, such as a capital in East Jerusalem.Despite Palestinians’ firm rejection of the US plan, anti-annexation protests in the West Bank have failed to draw large crowds. The largest rally drew a few thousand people, including foreign diplomats, to Jericho in the Jordan Valley in June. Under Washington’s plan, the city would remain Palestinian while the surrounding area including the border with Jordan would be annexed by Israel.The Palestinian prime minister, Mohammad Shtayyeh, said a counter-proposal to Washington’s plan had been submitted to the UN, the US, the European Union and Russia, which make up the Quartet.While Shtayyeh did not detail the proposal, the Palestinian Authority said it was prepared to resume negotiations with Israel, according to a letter seen by AFP news agency.There has been no public response to the Palestinian proposal and the international community has pressed Israel to halt annexation, deemed illegal by the UN.“I am deeply concerned that even the most minimalist form of annexation would lead to increased violence and loss of life,” the UN’s top human rights official, Michelle Bachelet, said on Monday.Jordan, which along with Egypt is the only Arab country to have a peace accord with Israel, has threatened to downgrade or scrap the 1994 agreement.The EU is weighing up retaliatory measures, and Netanyahu’s government has lobbied the foreign ministers of Germany, Greece and Cyprus to tone down the bloc’s response during their recent visits to Israel.In the face of opposition from abroad and at home, Netanyahu may amend his plans and annex settlement blocks close to Jerusalem only.The US team, which includes the White House envoy Avi Berkowitz, is reportedly seeking an agreement between Netanyahu and Gantz before giving its backing to annexation in any form."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4292956.1593545288!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish holidaymakers left in a no man s land consumer advocate says","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan  has said people should “restrict travel to when it is absolutely necessary” this summer and urged people to holiday at home in the weeks ahead. Photograph: iStockIrish holidaymakers continue to have their rights “trampled over” and people are being told to forfeit thousands of euro or “risk their own health and the health of others” by travelling overseas in the weeks ahead, a leading consumer advocate has said. “The reality is consumers have been left in a no-man’s land and have seen their rights trampled over without any consideration for the fact that they paid in advance for trips with all that money now held by airlines and travel companies,” said Dermott Jewell of the Consumer Association of Ireland. He said he had been “astounded” when the former Minister for Transport and Tourism Shane Ross “actually went against provisions that consumer groups across the world had taken years to put in place to say that vouchers were the same as refunds”. He said the situation has now “worsened with airlines saying that if their flights are not cancelled people will not get a refund despite the fact that if people take those flights they will be doing so in direct contravention of the advice from the State’s top medical authority.”The new Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan, meanwhile, has said people should “restrict travel to when it is absolutely necessary” this summer and urged people to holiday at home in the weeks ahead. “What we are seeing now is an absolute mockery of the rights of people,” Mr Jewell said. He said Irish authorities and officials at an EU level “are doing very little and seem exclusively focused on getting business back in business and giving consumers nothing”.“The last Minister for Transport did very little to help consumers and we really do need to see a very different approach from the Eamon Ryan, the new minister to help citizens who have paid sometimes huge sums which is not at risk.”He said that if the “leading health expert is saying don’t go, then people need to listen to that and if that is the case then something has to give and it can be done either legislatively or simply by the Government telling the public not to travel and telling the travel companies to treat their customers fairly.”Meadbh Hayes is one holidaymaker who faces losing thousands of euro in the weeks ahead. “We booked our trip to Spain for July 28th to August 8th in February,” she said. “As yet, Ryanair have not cancelled our flights and having spent endless time on hold with them, they cannot update me on that flight status.” She said she was “very nervous about travelling with children and concerned about what would happen if we fell ill in Spain? We are stuck in the position where we are being advised by the government not to take non-essential travel and yet risk losing a serious chunk of money.”The situation is arguably more perilous for Keith Lawler. All told he and 13 family members are due to fly to Almeria next Saturday. “Our flight has not been cancelled,” he says and the group stand to lose €4,734.The  contacted both Ryanair and Aer Lingus to see if they planned to operate an increased number of flights to and from Europe in the weeks ahead in spite of the comments from the chief medical officer. In response an Aer Lingus spokeswoman said: “Thank you for the opportunity to provide a comment but we will decline on this occasion.” Ryanair had not respondent at the time of writing.

Public health expert Dr Gabriel Scally said international travel should not be encouraged at this time. Photograph: Colin KeeganCollins DublinIrish Travel Agents Association chief executive has said the new Government should move to cancel flights so people who have booked foreign trips can get their money back. Giving permission to fly and yet saying not to fly was unfair, Pat Dawson said.He also called for clarity on so-called air bridges. Under the Government’s air bridges plan, it was understood Irish tourists could go on foreign holidays from July 9th to other countries that have brought coronavirus under control.Mr Dawson’s comments come after chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said people who had booked overseas trips should not travel at present due to the risk to themselves, their families and wider society. Asked on Monday whether people should cancel their summer holidays abroad, Dr Holohan said public health officials would like them not to travel in their inidual interest and in the collective interest.Mr Dawson told RTÉ Radio’s Today with Sarah McInerney show on Tuesday there were three important issues that needed to be addressed before travel could return to normal: safety in airports, safety on airlines and up-to-date information on countries it is safe to visit because they have low Covid-19 rates.Mr Dawson added he is encouraging people to postpone their holidays to the end of this year or next year.Public health expert Dr Gabriel Scally told the same programme he did not think air bridges were the solution and that there was in fact no real solution other than to “get rid of the virus in Ireland”.Ireland should follow the example of countries like New Zealand and introduce strict quarantine measures for people arriving into the country, he said, adding there were enough hotels near the airports to do this.Dr Scally said he agreed with the concerns raised by Dr Holohan about travel. “The last thing we want is people going off on holiday and then bringing back the virus or find themselves in the midst of a flare-up.”People could find themselves “stuck” abroad with no insurance cover, Dr Scally said, adding this should be the year people holiday in Ireland. “That’s the right thing to do. The country has done well so far – we shouldn’t encourage international travel.”If there were zero cases in Ireland it would mean people could travel around the country with fewer restrictions, he added. The current system of self isolating was not strong, and the Government should introduce compulsory quarantine. That was the only safe way, he said.Virologist Dr Kim Roberts agreed on the issue of compulsory quarantine. She said international travel was a privilege and people needed to value that privilege and the only way to have control was to have restrictions. “If people abuse them then we will be back to lockdown,” she warned.Dr Roberts said young people seemed to think they were bulletproof and could pass on the virus to others while not experiencing symptoms themselves. If there was compulsory quarantine then people would be in a place where they could be monitored.For people who survive Covid that was “just the beginning of the journey – there are long lasting health implications,” she said.According to the DAA, which operates Dublin Airport, there was just over 4,000 passengers arriving and departing on Monday, down from 116,000 on the equivalent day last year. Nevertheless, flight activity is expected to significantly increase over the coming month. Ryanair is expected to lead the way in an escalation beginning on July 1st - in May it announced its intention to restore 40 per cent of its schedules, including 139 routes from the Republic. How full flights will be remains to be seen but in a recent interview with the  the airline’s chief executive Michael O’Leary, critical of government policy on quarantine rules, predicted a “stampede” of Irish families rushing to go on foreign summer holidays with a surge in recent bookings. Aer Lingus declined to comment, and Ryanair did not respond to requests for comment on Dr Holohan’s latest travel appeal or on the recent level of demand they have experienced for flights. The Government did not respond to requests for comment.

This brings the total number of deaths linked to the disease at 1,736NPHET also reported another 11 new confirmed cases of the disease, bringing the total number of cases to 25,473.Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan noted that Tuesday marked six months since the World Health Organisation first received reports of what is now known as Covid-19. Since then, there have been 10 million cases and 500,000 deaths reported worldwide.“We know more about this virus and how to limit its spread than we did six months ago. It is very important that we keep up the national effort to reduce the impact of this disease in our country.”Up to Monday, 429,698 tests have been carried out for the disease in Ireland, including 24,607 tests over the past week. Some 116 tests were positive, giving a positivity rate of 0.5 per cent, official said.Eleven counties recorded no new confirmed cases last week, and just one additional case was reported in Cork, according to the HSE’s Health Protection Surveillance Centre. The biggest increase was in Wicklow, where 26 cases were notified, followed by Dublin, with an increase of 22.The number of Covid-19 clusters reported in private houses jumped from 358 to 728 in the space of a week, according to the report, though a note says most of the additional clusters just reported actually occurred earlier in the pandemic.The reports says 221 clusters remain open, while 1,208 are regarded as closed because two weeks have elapsed since the last case cleared.There remain 60 open clusters in private homes, 58 in nursing homes and 27 in hospitals. Deputy chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn urged people to risk assess their own environment so to inform their personal decisions and actions during the pandemic.“We know how this virus spreads, we know the public health behaviours required to protect ourselves and others, we must continue to be aware of the disease and limit its spread.”Meanwhile there were no further coronavirus linked deaths reported in Northern Ireland, with the toll recorded by the Department of Health remaining at 551.

Photograph: Liam McBurneyPA WireBobby Storey did more for Irish freedom, peace and unity than either Leo Varadkar or Micheál Martin, former Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams said at the funeral of the leading republican in west Belfast on Tuesday.Mr Adams said that republicans such as Mr Storey helped defeat the British army.Thousands of people congregated in west Belfast on Tuesday for the funeral of the 64-year-old former IRA member and later senior Sinn Féin figure who died while undergoing a lung transplant in England last Sunday week.The cortege left his home at Owenvarragh Park in Andersonstown around 10.30am for the short journey to St Agnes’s Church, where Requiem Mass was celebrated by Fr Gary Donegan, former rector of Holy Cross Church in Ardoyne, north Belfast.The hearse was led by two kilted pipers. Among the airs they played were The Minstrel Boy, Seán South of Garryowen, A Nation Once Again and On Raglan Road.A guard of honour of men and women dressed in black trousers, white shirts and black ties lined both sides of Owenvarragh Park as the cortege made its way to the church.Hundreds of republicans formed a guard of honour along the road from the church in Andersonstown to the republican plot at Milltown Cemetery, off the Falls Road. Black flags flew along the funeral route.The hearse itself was flanked by men and women in dark suits and ties. In an attempt to follow coronavirus regulations, about 30 people were allowed to walk behind the hearse. Many hundreds more lined the footpaths.Unionist and Alliance politicians however complained that the attendance along the route, in the church and at the republican plot was a clear breach of the social distancing rules.Among those in attendance were Mr Adams, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald and the North’s Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill. Many other Sinn Féin politicians and former IRA members also attended.In his homily Fr Donegan referred to how Mr Storey had grown up in north Belfast where his family were intimidated from their home. He also described Mr Storey as “devoted” to his partner Teresa and to their children and grandchildren.Police maintained a discreet presence in west Belfast during the funeral although they did conduct a security check of the area around St Agnes’s Church ahead of the service.Mr Storey was one of the most senior figures in the IRA during the Troubles. He joined the IRA when he was 16 and at 17 was one of the youngest people to be interned in 1973. In all, he served about 20 years in prison. He was central to the escape from the Maze prison in 1983, the biggest jailbreak in UK history.Several security sources said he also was behind the 2004 £26.5 million Northern Bank robbery and that he planned the St Patrick’s night break-in at the PSNI special branch’s office at Castlereagh in east Belfast in 2002.At the republican plot at Milltown Cemetery, Mr Adams recalled how Mr Storey when alluding to his more than 20 years in prison said that “a life of struggle is a life well lived”.“We are proud and glad that Bob and other former IRA volunteers are part of what we are,” said Mr Adams. “We are also proud of Bob and the others when they were IRA volunteers. They and their support base and republican Ireland defeated the British army. They brought us and their political masters to the negotiating table,” he said.After the oration Mr Storey’s coffin was brought to Roselawn cemetery in the east of the city for cremation.Politicians such as Doug Beattie of the Ulster Unionist Party, Jim Allister of the Traditional Unionist Voice party, Alliance leader Naomi Long and DUP East Derry MP Gregory Campbell complained that Covid-19 rules were broken during the funeral.Mr Campbell said: “The presence of senior Sinn Féin personnel such as Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill and others will lead many to conclude it is ‘do as I say not as I do’. Police action needs to follow and be seen to take effect.”The North’s Minister for Health Robin Swann said the PSNI were investigating. “I sincerely hope that this isn’t the Dominic Cummings effect in Northern Ireland because in our health service we can’t afford it to be,” he said.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"bobby storey the ira strategist and enforcer who stayed in the shadows","story":"Nearly 1,800 men and women, dressed in black trousers and slacks, white shirts and black ties, lined up along the black-flag draped Andersonstown and Falls roads in west Belfast on Tuesday for the funeral of Bobby Storey.Behind them stood thousands more as the hearse containing the Tricolour-covered coffin of Storey, a senior Sinn Féin and IRA figure for decades, passed by, applauding as it did. Even with the Covid-19 lockdown regulations in place, they were determined to pay tribute to a man they considered a hero.However, there are others who experienced the brutal side of the 64-year-old, who hold sharply different views about the man lauded in Anderstown and the Falls Road.Storey, who died on June 21st after an unsuccessful lung transplant in a National Health Service hospital in England, may be the “most famous Provo” that most people, with no connection to republicanism, have never heard about, or know little about him, if they had.However, “Big Bobby”, as his closest friend for decades, former Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams, generally called him, never wanted to be known by people at large, just by his own.Within the Sinn Féin and IRA family, he was viewed as a top commander – involved from his youth in the Troubles, with years behind bars, and a place at the top table right up to very recently when illness forced him from the scene.The two people he most admired, as he said himself, were Che Guevara and Gerry Adams. “He was grafted on to Adams,” was one well-put portrayal of their relationship.Studying his history, Storey, who was the IRA’s director of intelligence in the eyes of those who knew that world well, was “a planner, operator and an enforcer”.Illustrating that latter side to him, one former police officer, recalled a beating delivered by Storey to another republican who had dared to challenge the Adams-McGuinness leadership at one of key moments in the peace process.“The man was a repeat murderer, with a penchant for cutting people’s throats, but even he was scared of Bobby Storey,” the former officer recalled.Though he rarely took the microphone outside of speaking to usually-private, sometimes public Sinn Féin gatherings, Storey was able to come up with the memorable quote when he had to go to the front of the stage.One such moment came during a west Belfast press conference in August 2015 attended by Adams, the late Martin McGuinness, Mary Lou McDonald and some other leading republicans.Matters were then fraught. Kevin McGuigan had just been shot dead in Belfast in a revenge murder for the killing of senior IRA figure Gerard “Jock” Davison that May.Storey had been arrested for the McGuigan murder, but released without charge. The killing threatened the already shaky Northern Executive. Storey insisted that the IRA had had nothing to do with it.The then PSNI chief constable George Hamilton had said some IRA members carried out McGuigan’s murder, although they had acted without the authority of the leadership. Storey’s denials were treated with scepticism.“I think the chief constable and other perspectives out there see this in terms of the IRA being the caterpillar that is still there,” waxed Storey. “What I think is that it’s moved on, it’s become a butterfly, it’s flew away, it’s gone, it’s disappeared.”The butterfly metaphor, which prompted a smile from Adams, had the colloquial colour and rhythm of a remark from one who could talk softly because they carried a big stick.Storey was a “made man” in the IRA from his teens. In 1979, when in his early 20s, he was sent to London to try to free the late IRA leader Brian Keenan from Brixton prison using a helicopter.It failed and Storey and three others were arrested. He was acquitted but in 1981 was sentenced to 18 years in prison over a gun attack on British soldiers.That led to the Maze prison escape of 1983 and the beginning of Storey making his way into republican legend. Storey and North Belfast Assembly member Gerry Kelly were two of the masterminds in what was the biggest jailbreak in UK prison history, dubbed by republicans, The Great Escape, after the film. In all 38 IRA prisoners made it out of the prison gates in September 1983, half were recaptured but 19 got away.Storey, too, was caught and had another seven years added to his sentence. Prison officer James Ferris who was stabbed during the escape died, although a court later ruled that it was a heart attack that killed him.Storey in a 2008 interview with the republican paper An Phoblacht recalled the escape. “It was a great achievement for the IRA. It showed the degree to which comrades could work together, not just those who escaped but those who formed the back-up inside the jail, prisoners who weren’t going on the escape. Then there was the teamwork of people outside the jail: the drivers, the safe houses. Even getting captured didn’t dampen the event. We shafted Maggie Thatcher.”Storey probably is best known for the 2004 Northern Bank robbery. Adams and the IRA denied that the IRA did the job, and there are people who accept that denial, but not many.It was months in the planning, coming shortly after a failed attempt to resurrect the powersharing Executive and Assembly which had collapsed in 2002.Intelligence and security services put Storey at the heart of its planning. “The robbery was carried out by the Belfast brigade, and Storey was a key player in the brigade, so he would have been up to his neck in it,” said a former senior Police Service of Northern Ireland officer.It should be remembered that the IRA was on ceasefire at the time and supposed to have eschewed such criminality. The same source recalled how over the years the IRA engaged in numerous bank, post office and other robberies. When Border fuel laundering and other activity was taken into account it all amounted to a multimillion pound criminal empire.It prompted the late and former IRA member Dolours Price to comment at the time about slipping republican “standards” and to wonder: “The war is over, we are told . . . so what is all this money needed for?”It is a question that has never been properly answered.Storey had been involved in major robberies before. Stung by multiple truck hijackings in the early 2000s Gallaher’s cigarette manufacturers in Ballymena began to ship supplies bound for Dublin first to Liverpool by ferry, and then onwards to Dublin.The change soon drew the attention of the IRA to Gallaher’s use of Belfast port. In a raid in June 2001 that never drew the attention of the Northern Bank robbery, the IRA targeted a £4 million consignment of cigarettes bound for Rotterdam in the Netherlands.The planning was impeccable, even in the words today of security sources. The Belfast brigade of the IRA provided the people, the IRA in south Armagh handled the logistics, while Storey was at the centre of the web.“One night about 30 men appeared in Belfast dock. They took over the entire dock. They knew exactly what they were doing, they knew exactly what containers they were looking for, they knew exactly where those containers would be,” said one source.“The only mistake they made was that they were a little bit late and a couple of those containers were loaded by the time they got to the quayside. So they put a gunman in the cab of the crane with the crane driver and made him unload them again.“A fleet of lorries then appeared provided by the south Armagh brigade. The containers were dropped onto the lorries which headed off for the Border. The IRA held up the dock for another four hours, and then disappeared.“By the time the alarm was raised I reckon some of those cigarettes were almost in Cork. Bobby Storey would have been at the heart of that as well.”If the Gallaher’s raid made few headlines, the Northern Bank raid dominated bulletins across the world. Anxious to keep the IRA on board British prime minister Tony Blair’s “peace train” played down charges that the IRA was responsible for the cigarette job.“But it was absolutely obvious who did it. No organisation in Northern Ireland had the capability to do that job but the IRA,” said one security source involved in the investigation.Then there was the St Patrick’s night break-in in 2002 at the PSNI special branch offices at the Castlereagh police complex in east Belfast, supposedly one of the most impenetrable security centres in Europe. Three smartly-dressed men, one reputedly with an Oxbridge accent, almost casually got through the various checks, flashing what appeared to be genuine security passes.It was a Sunday, a quiet night, and the men walked along the corridors of the building, just as IRA men did in the Belfast docks raid, knowing exactly where they were to go.Within minutes, the three men were in the office where information about police agents, their police handlers and other highly-confidential documentation were kept.They got out with that hoard just as easily as they got in, a lone constable in the office being punched in the face and then hooded, bound and gagged as the three carefully and methodically assembled their haul.Millions of pounds were spent rehousing compromised detectives and others whose security was threatened by the break-in.Highly embarrassed, then chief constable Ronnie Flanagan referred to the Castlereagh raid as “an inside job”, giving rise to speculation that this was some sort of faction fight between the different elements of British intelligence. But it then emerged that Flanagan appeared to be referring to someone in Castlereagh assisting the three well-dressed robbers.The IRA denied involvement while senior Sinn Féiners complained of dirty deeds by “British securocrats”, to use a favourite and much-used phrase of Adams.Whitehall mandarin Sir John Chilcot, who later investigated the causes of the Iraq war, conducted an inquiry and found no evidence that any section of the British security agencies was involved.Once more Storey was blamed. Remembering the raid, a former senior police officer has no doubts but that he was central. However, that same source believes that Storey was criticised internally by at least one Sinn Féin leader who, whatever about the haul of information found at the break-in, was unhappy with its timing because it put pressure on the Northern Executive and Assembly.The then Ulster Unionist Party first minister David Trimble was under severe strain at the time for sharing power with Sinn Féin. Allegations that the on-ceasefire IRA had broken Castlereagh did nothing for his temperament, or his position.Storey was seen as a man who had “sleepers” in many sensitive positions who could be used at opportune times. Storey, this inidual believes, had “an asset” with knowledge of Castlereagh and that he decided to “use that asset, rather than lose it”. Not every element of the republican movement was kept in the loop by a man who kept secrets well.Storey was said to run a meticulous, almost obsessive intelligence gathering operation. Every IRA brigade in Northern Ireland, possibly apart from south Armagh which tended to do its own thing, supplied information to himHe carefully collated and stored it, much of it in a large bag, a “bit like a Gladstone bag”, according to the source. It was described in court as a “rucksack”.“Republicans were reporting back intelligence all the time, picking up information on prison officers, on police officers, taking down car registrations, getting family details, where children went to school, getting gossip about people’s finances, who was having affairs – all of it being fed back to Bobby,” he explained.It was around then, said the same source, that the PSNI devised a plan to bring him down. And here the story gets convoluted but it all leads up to Stormontgate in October of 2002.StormontgateThat month a long line of PSNI special branch and regular officers trooped into the offices of Sinn Féin at Parliament Buildings and seized material. Amid allegations of an IRA spy ring operating at Stormont – hence Stormontgate – Trimble could no longer hold his people together and the whole powersharing structure came crashing down, not to be rebuilt for close to another five years – an occasion in which Storey also featured.Sinn Féin’s head of administration at Stormont, Denis Donaldson was arrested, as were two other men, Donaldson’s son-in-law Ciarán Kearney, and William Mackessy. Storey’s “big bag” – stored in Donaldson’s home – was seized during a PSNI raid.They faced a range of charges but gradually some of them were withdrawn. In December 2005, the prosecution case ended, lawyers reporting it was no longer in the “public interest” to proceed with the case – a term that not infrequently is shorthand for protecting undercover sources or agents.The following day, Friday, December 9th, Donaldson posed with Adams and McGuinness on the steps of Parliament Buildings, the three looking rather self-satisfied.That did not last long. The following week a forlorn Donaldson gave a statement to the press admitting that for about 20 years he had acted as a British agent. At Stormont Donaldson came across as a quiet and decent inidual who kept to the background. On that day he appeared pitiful. He went to live a life of isolation in a cottage near Glenties in Co Donegal where he was brutally murdered the following April. One of his arms was almost blown off by a shotgun blast. The Real IRA said it had killed him, but there are still questions over whether that was a genuine admission.The outing of Donaldson allowed Adams and other Sinn Féiners to claim the whole Stormontgate affair was yet another example of a British “securocrat” conspiracy and that there was no republican spying at Stormont.Again some people believe that version of events. The other story, as expressed by a number of security, official and other sources, was that the police were trying to get Storey in possession of that bag of secret documents. Revenge was required for Castlereagh.In fact, said the former PSNI officer, the operation to nab Storey and other senior republicans had run for a long period. It was costly and involved many officers. But they just could not get the bag and Storey together. The PSNI for a long time knew Donaldson had the bag but were hoping for a “pass the parcel” moment when it would be handed over to the IRA director of intelligence.The source explained: “The bag had been left temporarily with Denis Donaldson. It was destined for Bobby and we were trying to catch Bobby with it, with all those intelligence records and CDs, but we couldn’t in the end. Eventually it got to the stage where we ran out of resources and had to move on it and take Denis instead.”One of the explanations for Donaldson’s arrest, even though he was an agent, was that he had not told his handlers about all the secret documentation. Another reason for the police moving in was fear that the material would be transported for safer keeping across the Border.The result was that Storey escaped the net while millions of pounds were spent trying to safeguard the estimated 2,000 or so people, many of them prison, police and British army officers, some of them politicians, named in the documents.The former officer also recalled how police did not get a chance to contact one particular man, an alleged drug dealer, on the list. “He was killed by the IRA, using one of its cover names, before he could be warned.”LoyaltySpeaking after his death, Adams was strong in his tribute to Storey, saying that he was “one of the bravest people I have ever had the honour to know”.“Whether inside or outside of prison, or through the years of harassment and beatings, arrests and torture from the RUC and British army, Big Bobby demonstrated time and time again his enormous personal commitment and courage,” he added.In turn Storey had a fierce loyalty to Adams. In 2014, when Adams was arrested and questioned at Antrim police station for a number of days about the 1972 abduction, murder and secret burial of mother-of-10 Jean McConville, Storey rallied to his cause.“That they would dare touch our party leader, the leader of Irish republicanism,” Storey thundered at a public gathering in west Belfast. At the same meeting Storey repeated a famous line from Adams about the IRA: “We have a message for the British government, for the Irish government, for the cabal that is out there: we ain’t gone away, you know.”During research for this article, several political, security and republican sources have emphasised how critical Storey was to the peace process and strategy pursued by Adams and McGuinness. They provided the strategy, he provided the muscle to ensure they got their way.Following the August 1994 IRA ceasefire, senior Sinn Féiners went to IRA units across Northern Ireland, and in the Republic, to argue for the peace strategy. Encouraged to speak up, a couple of IRA volunteers attending a meeting close to the Markets in central Belfast did so, and expressed their opposition to the ceasefire.“During all of this Bobby sat at the back of the room,” said one well-placed source. “As the crowd were filtering out Bobby took those speakers aside and explained to them in words of one syllable what the consequences would be if they ever challenged the Adams-McGuinness leadership again. Bobby could be vicious, and they knew that.”One very senior security figure was certain that Storey was important in ensuring that those within the IRA and Sinn Féin who opposed Adams and McGuinness never got the upper hand.“We always believed that Bobby Storey was director of intelligence in the late 1990s and early noughties for the IRA,” he said. “He was very much a key player, extremely close to the leadership. His support for them was pretty vital in containing any iniduals within the organisation who were threatening to throw over the traces, because they were all terrified of him.”“I have no doubt that he played a positive role in making sure that any dissent within the organisation was suppressed,” he added.“He would have been fairly free with his fists when he had to. There were many, many people in the organisation who were frightened of him. If he came around and supported the party leadership then there would be very few people who would cross him.”At the funeral Adams quipped that he did not know anyone who knew Storey “who didn’t like him – except for MI5, MI6, the old RUC, the British army, and prison governors”. Still, he was not universally loved, even within republicanism.In addition to those he threatened, there were other Republicans who had little time for Storey. One in particular was former IRA leader Ivor Bell who last year in court was cleared of soliciting McConville’s murder.That case centred on testimony Bell gave on the Boston tapes – the ill-fated oral history of the Troubles – where it was alleged that one night in 1972, Bell, the late Pat McClure and Adams gathered to settle the terrible end of the life of Jean McConville.Adams, who also gave evidence to the court, insisted no such meeting took place and that he had no part in the murder of the 38-year-old widow.But in the tapes, where former IRA man Anthony McIntyre interviewed Bell, mention also is made of Storey. The court heard that when the IRA and Sinn Féin decided to assist in locating the bodies of McConville and others of the Disappeared Adams sent Storey to speak to Bell. This would have been around 1998-1999.Storey’s task, it appeared from the tapes, was to elicit from Bell what he knew about the Disappeared. But it was clear that Bell felt that Adams was being disingenuous, which led to an infuriated Bell describing Storey as a “clown” and an “idiot” – terms that very few people would have used about him.A clearly annoyed Bell said that he told Storey, “What are you asking me about it for, sure my knowledge of it would be second-hand, why don’t you ask Gerry?”“Oh Gerry knows nothing about it,” Storey told Bell with an exasperated Bell saying to McIntyre, “the annoying thing is he actually believed Gerry.”Storey was loved within most of the republican community but as with Bell there were those who despised him.In July 2018, dissident republicans threw explosive devices at the homes of Adams and Storey in West Belfast. No one was injured. A rally there was quickly organised, with Storey telling dissidents they needed to “go back to where they come from”. “They were on a road to nowhere,” was a message he repeated on a number of occasions.YouthFrom teenage years Storey’s whole life was given over to the IRA and Sinn Féin. He joined the IRA when he was 16. Aged 17, he was one of the youngest to be interned in 1973. He served more than 20 years in prison, quite a lot of them on remand on various charges such as IRA shootings and bombings. Several sources said he was implicated in a number of killings but that because he was so long inside that he is rarely linked to some of the even more notorious multiple-death IRA gun and bomb attacks.“Then there was the massacre on Bloody Sunday when 13 people were gunned down . . . The fact that British paratroopers could gun down innocent protesters had a massive impact on me and from that point on I was attempting to join the republican movement.”Through the 2000s and as the IRA, to a relative degree considering the criminality, retreated into the shadows Sinn Féin leaders such as Adams saw the merit of bringing Storey more into the political fold. They tested the waters first by seeing how he would perform. On one occasion The  and other newspapers were invited to an off-the-record briefing where Storey, a little self-effacingly and with some reluctance, offered his thoughts on whatever was the political issue of that day. “I am not used to this,” he said, but then chatted away. There were no other such invitations for sit-down meetings with Storey.Tall, strongly-built, and with a commanding presence, Storey could be affable man, and with a good sense of humour. Equally, it was clear that he was not one to be crossed.His civility did not stretch to all journalists. The Belfast writer and journalist Malachi O’Doherty, who has been a regular critic of Sinn Féin and the IRA, remembers how in the mid-1990s he was tackled by Storey after he had delivered a piece on BBC Radio Ulster’s Talkback programme in which he referred to Storey’s “enforcer” status.Storey was 6ft 5in. O’Doherty is 5ft 2in, or little more. O’Doherty had been attending a lecture in the Felons’ Club in west Belfast when Storey approached him. O’Doherty recalled: “He put me up against a wall and told me I was a slug and not welcome in west Belfast.”“After that incident another journalist went to speak to him and said, ‘Look what’s the score with Malachi?’ And he said, ‘Well, Malachi shouldn’t feel that he is free to just walk into west Belfast given that he has been so critical of us’.”This was not a teasing, semi-jocular act by Storey, says O’Doherty: “Oh, no, it was clear intimidation of a journalist.”Some people have characterised Storey as little more than an IRA hardman who carried out the orders given to him and who could barely think for himself. McIntyre, who spent time in prison with him and who was no friend of the Adams-McGuinness leadership, and who himself took some serious gyp from Storey, strongly contradicts that view.He recalled occasions in prison when inmates were shown films. “I hated sitting beside him because no matter how complicated the plot of the film he’d work it out immediately and ruin it for you,” he said.“He was very competent and very well got. He was absolutely hated by the cops, they absolutely despised him.“He was exceptionally bright. I never found Bobby thuggish or a bully in a personal sense although a whole lot of others did. Whenever he was talking he always carried the authority of the IRA.”“In terms of practical intelligence and practical ability you would meet nobody brighter. People used to say to me, ‘He is stupid’, and I would say back to them, ‘You are stupid for thinking he is stupid’. You don’t put operations like that together if you are stupid.”Journalist Ivan Little while writing about Storey paramilitary past in the Belfast  also had a memory about his “softer” side. “At a talent contest I hosted in west Belfast some years ago he and his mother watched with pride as Storey’s brother Brian who had Down’s syndrome stole the show as an Elvis impersonator,” he recalled.But there are few such anecdotes.Across the Border he was also very well known to senior Garda and Army intelligence officers. “He was certainly on our radar he figured a lot in our intelligence reports down the years, he was an interesting character,” said one former Garda source.And while Storey is seldom mentioned as being on the IRA Army Council a former Army intelligence source said the view in the South was that “he was on the army council, or very close to it”.“Membership of the army council was fluid we think he was on it for a while. Storey was very influential. He mostly stayed behind the scenes but we had him at the very top of the tree,” he said.That 2008 An Phoblacht interview was another example of Storey’s switch from paramilitarism to politics although one security source said that even in his Sinn Féin days “he was somewhere between the two”.He held a senior position for Sinn Féin at Stormont and also served as party chairman for a period. He was a prominent backroom figure at times of political crises and during elections. He could energise the footsoldiers when the vote had to be got out. Perhaps jaundiced by the necessity to deal with journalists it seemed, however, that elected politics was not for him.In his graveside oration Adams spoke about how Storey was devoted to his partner, Teresa, their children, and grandchildren, brothers Seamus and Brian, and sister Geraldine.One of the repeated arguments from senior British security figures and some unionist politicians over the years is that a chief reason for the IRA finally ending its “war” was because it was so riddled with and damaged by informers and agents, some of them operating at very elevated levels such as Donaldson and Freddie Scappaticci, also known as Stakeknife, and some purported high-rankers yet to be exposed.Differing viewsThere are different views of Storey. Most unionists and many others will see him as just another ruthless terrorist who was part of an IRA murder machine that killed up to 1,800 people and badly injured thousands more in an unjustifiable and unnecessary conflict.That view was reflected in a piece in the Belfast  on the day before the funeral by historian Ruth Dudley Edwards which was headlined: “Bobby Storey: a violent thug who played role in the collapse of Stormont on three occasions”.The counter view was offered in that same day’s Irish News where senior republican Jim Gibney wrote: “If it is possible for one inidual to embody the spirit, the dynamic, the duration and durability, the depth and complexity of the republican struggle over the last 45 years then it was Bobby Storey.”But in the often dispassionate warts and all world of the British and Irish intelligence and security services that battled with Storey and his like there remains an objective regard for his nerve and skill.That same former Stormont official had one lasting memory of Storey that acknowledged his place in the republican hierarchy and in the “long war” tussle between the competing forces. It was May 2007, two months after Adams and Ian Paisley after much coaxing from the British and Irish governments, struck their truly historic deal to restore the Northern Executive and Assembly. This was after close to five years of direct rule from Westminster and now finally powersharing was being reinstated.While below in the chamber the politicians went about the business of formally reactivating the Executive and Assembly, in the visitors’ gallery above the likes of taoiseach Bertie Ahern, Blair and other VIPs observed proceedings, enjoying some of the reflected light of a job well done.Just a few seats from them sat three of the most senior IRA figures of the Troubles, the late Brian Keenan, Brian Gillen and Bobby Storey.“This is how central he was to PIRA and also to the peace process – while it would have infuriated unionists, their presence was a vindication of the Adams strategy and the peace process,” said the former official.He said that Blair and some of the other dignitaries “probably wouldn’t have recognised Storey anyway, which again says something about him”.And in a neat encapsulation of Storey’s significant but in many way reticent place in republican history and in the peace process he added: “He was very low profile, as befits an intelligence person – he was an observer.“But I do remember the respect my intelligence colleagues had for his operations. Quite apart from the Maze breakout to have planned the Northern Bank robbery and the Castlereagh break-in was extraordinary: respectively one of the largest bank robberies in history and the single biggest breach of UK national security ever. Quite a CV and he certainly didn’t lack ambition.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4292709.1593530274!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"parties did not co ordinate on cabinet appointments says varadkar","story":"Tánaiste Leo Varadkar has acknowledged that the three coalition parties did not co-ordinate in the appointment of the Cabinet, which resulted in no senior Minister in Government from the west.

In the Dáil, Sinn Féin TD for Roscommon-Galway Claire Kerrane said that no matter what the Government does from now on “it will always be remembered as the Government that did not see fit for the very first time in the history of the State to appoint a senior Minister from the western region, from Donegal right down to Limerick”.The coalition is expected to appoint 20 Ministers of State in the next day or so but Ms Kerrane said the “damage is done”.‘Very unusual’Mr Varadkar said that when he appointed his cabinet three years ago as taoiseach “we had two senior members from the west but when you’re three parties doing and perhaps not co-ordinating it you turn up with unusual results. We’ll co-ordinate better with Ministers of State in the next couple of days. He acknowledged that “it is very unusual for there not be a senior Minister in Connacht, west of the river Shannon.“I don’t doubt that will be rectified at the reshuffle if not before but in the meantime we do have Hildegarde Naughton and Dara Calleary there.”People say “they don’t have a vote but there hasn’t been a vote in Cabinet since the 1970s or early 80s.“So their weight and their voice will be equal to that of any other member of the Cabinet and I want people to know that.”The Tánaiste said he had a “very strong view that every Minister should see themselves as having a national remit.“As somebody who is a Dublin-based politician I am very aware of my responsibilities to be a national Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4292650.1593526940!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"t%C3%A1naiste questions number of construction workers on pandemic payment","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLeo Varadkar is Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation and his department will take over Employment Affairs, which had been part of the Social Protection portfolio. Photograph: Damien EagersPA WireTánaiste Leo Varadkar has questioned the large numbers in the construction industry still getting the pandemic unemployment payment, despite the increased level of building activity.He said there is something “not right” about the numbers in the sector in receipt of the payment.Mr Varadkar told the Dáil that construction activity had been back for six weeks and “we are told that 80 per cent of sites are now open”. But he said “there are still 45,000 construction workers in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment. “There is something not right there. I do not know what it is, but we need to dig down into that and get people back on site.”Mr Varadkar is Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation and his department will take over Employment Affairs, which had been part of the Social Protection portfolio.He was responding to Green Party TD Neasa Hourigan who called for supports to get those on low incomes back to work and to assist labour intensive work “particularly in the building industry, rather than what we tended to do in past recessions, which was to focus on large-scale investment projects”.They were speaking during a debate on revised Estimates for the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.Mr Varadkar pledged that the July stimulus package the Government is preparing will be “radical and far reaching” and of a scale to meet the challenge facing businesses and the economy.He also said the Government would decide “in the next couple of days” whether to appeal the High Court judgment that legislation making a sectoral employment order in the electrical industry was unconstitutional.Mr Varadkar opened the debate on the revised Estimates for his department which is seeking authorisation for an additional €483 million in funding to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic.Later today the Government will also seek approval for the authorisation of almost €2 billion in additional funding for the Department of Health, bringing expenditure to over €20 billion.The Tánaiste said there was “no time to waste”, more needed to be done and it would be outlined in the July stimulus programme. He also said there would be additional measures when the economic recovery plan is launched in October.Mr Varadkar also referred to Budget 2020 which he said “recognised the potentially disastrous effects of a No Deal Brexit” through provision of a contingency fund in such an event.He warned that the “possibility of no agreement cannot be ruled out” and the contingency fund “may well be required and will have to be given further consideration in the months ahead”.The revised funding for the department will bring total expenditure from €970.9 million in the original estimate to over €1.4 billion, including €1.115 billion in capital funding.Sinn Féin spokeswoman Imelda Munster said her party would support the Estimates but she believed there was “no sense of urgency” from Government to deal with the need for adequate grant aid and interest-free easily applied for loans for those not in a in a position to borrow. Fianna Fail’s Niall Collins said the temporary wage subsidy scheme should be tapered off over time and “not just come to a shuddering end”. He said the “warehousing of tax liabilities” would have to be made available to the business sector.Labour’s Ged Nash criticised the 5 per cent and 6 per cent interest rates on loans that the Government was packaging as “supports” when what they urgently needed were grants and loans at near zero interest rates.“This strategy is akin to handing a drowning person an anchor instead of a lifebuoy. They will simply sink,” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4292883.1593540326!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach speaks to european commission president about pandemic and brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Micheál Martin (FF) spoke to Ursula von der Leyen and Michel Barnier.

Ms von der Leyen said the EU needed “rapid agreement” the EU’s covid recovery plan and “an ambitious partnership with UK that respects our principles” on Brexit. Government Buildings confirmed that Mr Martin had also spoken with the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, who briefed him on the state of the ongoing Brexit negotiations and the prospects for an agreement in the autumn.“They had good and productive discussions,” the Government spokeswoman said.

Video: Oireachtas TV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGreen Party deputy leader Catherine Martin is now Minister   for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht.A new Taoiseach was elected on Saturday and a range of new Ministers were appointed. Here’s all you need to know about them:He became party leader in 2011 just weeks before the general election when Fianna Fáil lost 51 seats in the fall-out from the economic collapse. The five wilderness years were spent reorganising the party and its decimated cohort of TDs.In 2016, Fianna Fáil had a mini-revival, regaining 23 seats and in the 2019 local elections won the most seats of any party. The four years since were spent building up a still volatile parliamentary party but Fianna Fáil suffered further losses in the 2020 election and dropped six seats, partially blamed on the party’s confidence and supply agreement with Fine Gael.The 2020 election had become do or die for Martin, whose Cork South-Central constituency will now be home to three Cabinet members - himself as Taoiseach, his party colleague Michael McGrath and former tánaiste Simon Coveney.The first Cork Taoiseach for 41 years since Jack Lynch, he has been a TD since 1989, served on Fianna Fáil’s front bench since 1995 and held four senior government portfolios during the party’s time in office - foreign affairs, health, education and enterprise.Single-minded and driven with a huge work ethic, the pragmatic Martin can be sensitive to criticism. A good media performer he is however seen by some within the party as distant and colleagues are hoping that communications within the party will improve.Health conscious and very proud of introducing the smoking ban in Ireland, he has pushed the Public Health (Alcohol) Act despite the reluctance of rural TDs within the party.Leo Varadkar, Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and EmploymentAfter a terrible election result and what appeared initially to be a guaranteed trip across the Dáil to the opposition benches, Leo Varadkar’s fortunes have been transformed along with those of his party.His calm and assured leadership performance through the coronavirus pandemic combined with a lengthy stalemate over coalition formation talks have resulted in Fine Gael soaring from losers to clear victors in the opinion polls and with Varadkar moving from spent political force back to key player.Nobody has batted an eyelid at the fact that he will preside over the party’s abandonment of its Civil War stance after a century and move into a historic government coalition with Fianna Fáil and the Green Party.Even less remarked on has been his demotion to Tánaiste for over two years as Fine Gael participates in the previously vilified notion of rotating taoiseach. But he also leads his party into an unprecedented third term in office.A social agenda trailblazer, he is Ireland’s first openly gay minister, the State’s youngest taoiseach and is now Tánaiste. The son of an Irish mother and Indian father, his qualification as a doctor helped during the pandemic and assured him of good publicity when he decided to re-register as a medic and said he would do half a day a week on the helpline for people who suspected they had the Covid-19 virus.Never one to shy away from a photo opportunity, the 41-year-old was also the first taoiseach to assiduously use social media to push his message and his carefully cultivated image. And he got into the much discussed habit during lockdown of quoting a variety of books, films and other media in his speeches.He has also used his speeches to throw out provocative messages reflecting his economic views including his oft quoted controversial remark that Fine Gael should represent those who “get up early in the morning”.He previously served as minister for social protection, for transport and for health and now moves into the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. But it remains to be seen if he will innovate rather than merely manage as he was perceived to have done in his previous portfolios.Michael McGrath - Minister for Public Expenditure and ReformWhen political heavy hitter Michael McGrath (43) became Fianna Fáil’s finance spokesman, then minister for finance Michael Noonan pronounced that the accountant had a big future ahead of him in politics.That future has finally arrived for the Cork South-Central TD who has been finance spokesman since 2011, when Fine Gael was in coalition with Labour and again when Fine Gael relied on Independents and Fianna Fáil’s confidence and supply arrangement.First elected to the Dáil in 2007 he has retained his seat at each subsequent election. It has been a long road for the man who will finally take the helm at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.A constituency rival and colleague of his party leader he is seen as a potential successor, is well liked by his party colleagues and has a well-oiled constituency machine.Originally from Passage West but now living in Carrigaline with his wife Sarah O’Brien and seven children, he secured a first-class honours commerce degree in UCC and qualified as a chartered accountant with KPMG in Cork City.A central member of the party’s negotiating team in the government formation talks, he is a low-key, calm and effective spokesman.Stephen Donnelly - Minister for HealthThe appointment of Stephen Donnelly to Cabinet makes it two Ministers for Health in a row for his Wicklow constituency taking the baton from Simon Harris. It is a job often seen as a political crucifixion for the holder.Elected to the Dáil as an Independent on his first attempt in 2011, he went on to form the Social Democrats with Róisín Shortall and Catherine Murphy in 2015 and surged to a poll-topping performance in Wicklow in 2016.Shortly afterwards however, he left the party following disagreements with his co-leaders.In the Dáil he has since had a number of disagreements with the Social Democrats on the much lauded Sláintecare plan and all eyes will be keenly watching how he deals with the much debated health roadmap.After a short second  as an Independent he joined Fianna Fáil in 2017. While party leader Micheál Martin saw his recruitment as a major coup, his arrival left many noses out of joint in Fianna Fáil. Those tensions and the move, appeared to dent his 2020 election chances but he was elected on the 15th count.Darragh O’Brien, Minister for Housing, Local Government and HeritageAnother member of the Fianna Fáil negotiating team to get a seat at the big table Darragh O’Brien (45) becomes Minister for Housing in the new three-party Government.Party spokesman on housing, planning and local government in the last Dáil, he was first elected to the Dáil in 2007. He lost out in the 2011 decimation of the party in the economic recession. He became one of 51 party TDs to be defeated at the hands of angry voters. He successfully ran for the Seanad that year on the Labour panel and became Seanad leader, keeping a place in the Oireachtas.But his Dáil defeat had a salutary effect, resulting in him building up a strong constituency base with his brother as a local councillor. It may have contributed to local party tensions with Dublin Fingal colleague Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee.He went on to top the poll in Dublin Fingal in the 2016 general election.Before entering politics he worked in the financial services sector for 15 years as an area manager with Life Assurance Company.He was elected to Fingal County Council in 2004 before successfully contesting a Dáil seat in 2007.He is married with a young family.Barry Cowen, Minister for Agriculture and the MarineThe no-nonsense Fianna Fáil spokesman on public expenditure and reform Barry Cowen (52) has been appointed Minister for Agriculture. The man who sealed the fate of the water charges in the 2016 government formation negotiations, was again a key member of the negotiating team this time round.The 2016 talks led to the confidence and supply arrangement with Fine Gael but left Fianna Fáil out of government. The intense five-week\u0026nbspcampaign in 2020 led to government and the reward of a seat at the top table for the Clara, Co Offaly native.A brother of former taoiseach Brian Cowen he has been spokesman in a number of portfolios since his election to the Dáil in 2011. As well as spokesman on public expenditure and reform he also held the position of spokesman on environment and local government and on social protection.A married father of four, he was first elected to Offaly county council in 1999, where he served until his election to the Dáil to the seat vacated by his brother.A member of the Cowen family has represented Offaly in the Dáil continuously since 1977. His father Bernard Cowen was elected in 1969 but lost his seat in 1973. He regained it in 1977 and held it until his death in 1984.Norma Foley, Minister for EducationKerry TD Norma Foley, who nominated her party leader Micheál Martin to be Taoiseach has been appointed Minister for Education, five months after her election to the Dáil for the first time.Martin is said to prefer TDs to have done at least a term on the backbenches but the new TD who is a teacher by profession, has shown herself to be an impressive performer and has been effective at the Covid-19 committee in the questioning of witnesses. Calm, courteous and well prepared, she has a great grasp of detail and the bigger picture.The Tralee native took the fifth and final seat in the general election in Kerry, edging out her running mate and outgoing TD John Brassil.It is her second run at the Dáil, having been on the Fianna Fáil ticket in the 2007 election, when she was selected over Brassil.Since 2004, Foley has represented the people of Tralee Municipal District on Kerry County Council, topping the poll in last May’s local elections.She has also served on Tralee Town Council, and held the position of mayor of Tralee on three occasions, most recently in 20172018. In 20182019 she served as mayor of Kerry.She is the daughter of the late Denis Foley, who served as a TD for the constituency for 18 years, broken up by a three-year stint as a senator. He was named as the holder of an undisclosed offshore Ansbacher account.She is married to fellow teacher Denis Maguire.Simon Coveney, Minister for Foreign Affairs and DefenceHe may have lost his role as tánaiste but Simon Coveney (48) has retained the much coveted position of Minister for Foreign Affairs. Greatly admired by departmental staff as probably the hardest working minister in that portfolio, he has received much acclaim for his efforts in dealing with Brexit and is seen as the driving political force in Ireland securing its temporary seat on the United Nations Security Council.Loved by the party’s grassroots and accessible to TDs and Senators, he still retains ambitions to be party leader and is seen as likely to get there. A cautious and moderate politician, his tearaway teenage years when he was expelled from Clongowes school for drinking and partying, before being asked back – are at odds with his later serious image.From Cork’s so-called merchant class and a keen rugby and sailing fan, he has a degree in agriculture and land management and was catapulted into the world of politics following the death of his father Hugh, a TD and former minister, in 1998.He later successfully ran for the European Parliament in 2004 but returned to Ireland for the 2007 general election and he has successfully retained his seat since. He served as minister for agriculture for all five years of the Enda Kenny-led administration from 2011 later adding defence to his portfolio when Eamon Gilmore resigned as tánaiste.From 2016 he spent just a year as minister for housing, when his pledge to end all emergency hotel and B\u0026ampB\u0026nbspaccommodation backfired, before he moved to the hallowed halls of the Department of Foreign Affairs.Seen as open in his approach and meticulous in his work practices, he has risen solidly and steadily through the party’s ranks and his experience in Brexit talks paved the way for his central role in the government formation talks.Paschal Donohoe, Minister for FinanceAs soon as Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe confirmed he was putting his name forward as a unity candidate for the presidency of the Eurogroup, it was clear he was confident of returning to his office in Merrion Street.Ever cautious and highly political he would have been slow to put his reputation on the line without some assurance of keeping his own job while he applied for the top spot in the influential club of finance ministers from countries that use the euro.The deadline for that role came a day before the outcome of the vote on the programme for government.He is highly popular within the party although less so after his poison chalice position as director of elections for both the Dáil and Seanad elections.The electorate proved less than happy with the party’s budgetary and spending policies and Fine Gael lost 12 Dáil seats. It was also embarrassed by the failure to have any women elected to the Upper House.Nine years a TD for Dublin Central, the 45-year-old has held the finance portfolio since 2017. He previously served as a minister of state and then as minister for transport.A central member of the party’s leadership and key to the government formation talks he is viewed as culturally one of the more rounded Cabinet members with an interest in books, film and theatre.The former sales manager with a multinational firm will need all his skills as a party persuader and negotiator to navigate the traumatic economic conditions facing the State while keeping faith with his wary Fianna Fáil and suspicious Green Party colleagues.He will be happy to leave his one stated regret – not managing to control the costs of the new national children’s hospital – to Fianna Fáil’s Michael McGrath who takes up the re-ided Department of Public Expenditure and Reform portfolio.He is married with two children and lives in Phibsborough, Dublin.Heather Humphreys, Minister for Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the IslandsOne of the Ministers always seen as sure of keeping her seat at the cabinet table, Heather Humphreys fits the criteria for geography, gender and ability.A border-county TD, she was the first woman elected to the Cavan-Monaghan constituency in 2011, when she took over from fellow Presbyterian Fine Gael colleague Seymour Crawford.Now in her third Dáil term and one of three female TDs in the five-seat constituency, she is highly regarded within Fine Gael and viewed as capable and a safe pair of hands.A first-term backbench TD when she was appointed to cabinet in 2011 as minister for arts, heritage and the Gaeltacht she won plaudits for her stewardship of the successful 1916 Rising centenary commemorations.A loyal ally of former taoiseach Enda Kenny she was re-appointed to the portfolio by him in 2016 but was one of the first Ministers to declare her support for Leo Varadkar in the 2017 leadership contest.He promoted her to the Business, Enterprise and Innovation portfolio in 2017 following the resignation of tánaiste Frances Fitzgerald.A business background through her work with Ulster Bank and as manager of Cootehill Credit Union also helped secure her appointment. The coronavirus pandemic brought her biggest political challenge with the crisis facing thousands of businesses and leaving a 25 per cent unemployment rate. Grant and income support schemes, loans and other initiatives have helped cushion the initial blow.The Government will now have to deal with the fallout from a controversial High Court judgment striking out a sectoral employment order and ruling that she had acted outside her powers in making the order for the electrical industry.Her career in finance, experience as minister for business and farming background in Co Monaghan, where she is married with two adult daughters, make her a good candidate for the rural development portfolio.Elected for the first time in the 2011 general election, she lives in Aghabog, near Monaghan town, and her family is from the Cavan-Monaghan border area.Helen McEntee, Minister for JusticeA reserved but smart politician Helen McEntee (33) from Castletown, Co Meath, has been a TD since 2013 when she won the byelection following the death of her father Shane McEntee.Minister of State for European Affairs since 2017, the Meath East TD proved her mettle in the ever present and fraught Brexit crisis, leading the Government’s response on a number of related issues.She has been described as Leo Varadkar’s “secret weapon” and is considered level-headed and a very good negotiator. Former president of the European Council Donald Tusk called her “diligent” and an “exceptional diplomat”. She is one of 10 vice-presidents of the European People’s Party, Fine Gael’s centre-right representative grouping in the EU.Graduating from DCU in 2007 having studied law, politics and economics, she worked briefly in a Citibank subsidiary. She later completed a masters in journalism and communications and worked with her father in Leinster House, first in opposition and then when he was appointed minister of state.A supporter of Varadkar’s from the start she has been by his side throughout the Brexit crisis and has a keen understanding of its intricacies and complexities.Simon Harris, Minister for Higher Education, Innovation and ScienceDespite his increased stature during the coronavirus pandemic as minister for health Simon Harris (33) became a focus of increasing speculation in recent days that he would be demoted from Cabinet.In the fateful 2017 Fine Gael leadership campaign he took sides early on in favour of Simon Coveney as opposed to Varadkar but held onto the health portfolio Kenny appointed him to in 2016.Described as the “teenage” minister when first appointed to the hugely significant but poison chalice department, he has visibly aged in the past three months through the stresses of the Covid-19 crisis.He remained a popular choice in his Wicklow constituency in the election despite concerns about a shortage of hospital beds, the spiralling cost of the new national children’s hospital and the recruitment and retention difficulties around healthcare staff.Those issues disappeared during the pandemic with the unprecedented takeover of all private hospitals and the return home of emigrant doctors and nurses to assist with the crisis.These problems have re-emerged but are no longer an issue for Harris as he moves on from the department described as a war zone.A social media expert, he is one of the party’s top media performers, assured and persuasive in his delivery, accessible and generally guaranteed to avoid political gaffes.He first became engaged in politics while campaigning for his younger brother and other children with autism. He topped the poll in the local elections and secured the highest vote in the country through his social media campaign.While a councillor, he approached then Seanad leader Frances Fitzgerald, became her parliamentary assistant and moved into Leinster House politics from there.Viewed as having an uneasy relationship with his party leader he is far from the inner circle. He is married with one child and lives in Greystones, Co Wicklow.Eamon Ryan - Minister for Climate Action, Communications Networks and TransportIt has been a torrid few months for Green Party leader Eamon Ryan (56) as he enters Government with a deeply scarred and ided party.In all the controversy the spectacular success in winning 12 seats in the general election has been all but forgotten.Now appointed to his long sought role in climate action and transport he will have little time to relish the challenge as he bids to heal the schism within the party.It is a reflection of the party’s isions that when he was mired in controversy after repeating a racial slur in the Dáil that it took a minister from another party, Charlie Flanagan of Fine Gael to publicly defend the Dublin Bay South TD by saying he did not have a racist bone in his body.But through all the accusations, insults and recriminations he has been calm, conciliatory and with party deputy leader Catherine Martin has persuaded the party’s membership to decisively back an unprecedented government with Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.He now faces a leadership contest against his deputy leader but has remained sanguine about the prospect.An impassioned speaker prone to gaffes, including a call during the election campaign for the re-introduction of wolves, he nonetheless led a team to rebuild the party after its disastrous first foray into coalition government after which it lost all six Dáil seats.A councillor before his 2007 election to the Dáil he previously ran a bicycle shop and cycling holiday business.He is married to journalist Victoria White and they have four sons.Catherine Martin - Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the GaeltachtDublin Rathdown TD and deputy Green party leader Catherine Martin (47) emerged as a surprising contender for the top job in the party.Her stance on coalition has strained the previously close working relationship with Eamon Ryan but his move to appoint her as lead negotiator in the coalition talks was seen as an inspired move.Cautious by nature, she is said to seek advice widely and does not say things lightly. Some in her party are said to find it hard to gauge where she stands and those on the other side of the negotiating table have described her as an enigma.As an influential voice in the party she will have a significant role in attempting to heal the party’s schism.From her first days in the Dáil she forged good relations across all parties and founded the Irish Women’s Parliamentary Caucus in the Oireachtas, pressed for anti-bullying protocols in the Leinster House campus.From Carrickmacross, Co Monaghan she trained as a classical singer and after graduating from NUI Maynooth, she taught music and English at St Tiernan’s Community School in Ballinteer.Her initial foray into politics was when she was co-opted to her brother Vincent P Martin’s council seat in Monaghan in the 1990s. She returned to politics in Dublin, was elected as a councillor in 2014 and came from nowhere to win a Dáil seat in 2016.Her husband Francis Noel Duffy became a TD in 2020 and took an opposing view in rejecting the coalition deal. The couple has three children.Roderic O’Gorman - Minister for Children, Disability, Equality and IntegrationLong predicted to make the high table Roderic O’Gorman (38) is one of the Green party’s most experienced politicians. His victory in the 2020 general election marked his 10th foray in 15 years including four general elections, two byelections and four local elections. The party’s justice and equality spokesman he was on the negotiating team and insisted in the talks that the coalition must make a commitment to end direct provision.A former chairman of the party he served from 2011 to 2019.From Tyrellstown he lives with his partner Ray Healy in Blanchardstown. A lecturer at the Brexit Institute and School of Law and Government in DCU he is a graduate of Trinity College and the London School of Economics.Close to both party leader Ryan and deputy leader Martin he is courteous, considered and reflective in his deliberations and well regarded across the party. He is a fan of TV shows West Wing, Game of Thrones and Arrested Development.Hildegarde Naughton - Minister of State at the Department of Climate Action, she will be attending CabinetOne of the survivors of the electoral cull of Fine Gael TDs, Hildegarde Naughton (43) has consistently grown in experience and stature since she first arrived on the political stage in 2009.That was the year the former schoolteacher was first elected to Galway City Council, becoming mayor two years later. Mentored and promoted by then taoiseach Enda Kenny, the Galway West TD was appointed to the Seanad in 2013.In 2016 she seized the chance to get on the Fine Gael ticket in the general election after Barry Walsh stepped aside from politics on health grounds.Chair of the Oireachtas Committee for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment in the last Dáil she fought the green fight in an uphill and forthright battle to persuade many reluctant party colleagues to the cause and has been Fine Gael’s leading environmentalist.That role, that experience and her capability has brought her to the Cabinet table - along with the need to have some gender balance at cabinet and take account of geographical considerations.Outside politics she is a talented singer who has performed and won awards for her roles in musical theatre. While a senator she established a group called Bel Canto with two other sopranos, who sang at charity events. She has described her musical interest as “my golf”.Pippa Hackett, “Super Junior” Minister of StateGreen Party Senator Pippa Hackett’s appointment as a “Super Junior” Minister of State is the first appointment of a Senator to Cabinet since the early 1980s.She takes on the role of Minister of State for Agriculture with responsibility for land use and bioersity.Her appointment has taken some by surprise amid speculation that someone among the party’s TDs might be selected.A farmer from Offaly and the party’s agriculture spokeswoman, she was elected to the Seanad in a byelection in November when a vacancy arose following the election of then Senator Grace O’Sullivan to the European parliament.But the move is as much a surprise because it is virtually unprecedented.The last time a Senator took on a ministerial role was in 1981 when then taoiseach Garrett FitzGerald nominated Senator James Dooge as minister for foreign affairs, a portfolio he held for a year.A vocal supporter of the programme for government, Hackett was elected unopposed to the agricultural panel in the Seanad when the other parties opted not to contest the seat.Formerly an Offaly county councillor she lost out in the general election for the Laois-Offaly constituency when she was eliminated in the final round.Originally from Ballandine, Co Mayo she is married with four children and lives in Edenderry, Co Offaly.Dara Calleary - Chief whipNew Government chief whip Dara Calleary has Fianna Fáil in his DNA. The Mayo TD who has been in the Dáil since 2007 and is the son of late TD and former minister of state Sean Calleary who served in the Dáil from 1973 to 1992. His grandfather Phelim was TD for Mayo from 1952 to 1969.Affable and steady, popular with party colleagues he is deputy leader and viewed as a safe pair of hands.He has had a previous taste of government when he served as minister of state for labour affairs and public service transformation from 2009 to 2011 in the Fianna Fáil, Green Party coalition.A graduate of Trinity College with a degree in business and politics he has served as the party’s spokesman on justice, equality and defence, as well as spokesman on jobs, enterprise and innovation.Paul Gallagher SC, Attorney GeneralThis will be Paul Gallagher’s second time in the job, having previously served from 2007 to 2011. During his first term, he was called to offer legal advice on some of the biggest issues ever to face an Irish government, including the bank guarantee scheme, the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency and the International Monetary Fund Troika programme.He is regarded as one of Ireland’s top barristers, with a fearsome work ethic."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Historic move will allow authorities to crack down on subversive and secessionist activityRisks of viruses crossing species barrier into humans in densely populated regions highlightedWashington plans to target Chinese officials undermining Asian financial hub autonomyJustin Trudeau called on Beijing to cease the \u0026lsquoarbitrary detention\u0026rsquo of two CanadiansMany were struck as they were planting seeds across Bihar state in east of countryThe decades-long project sees a constellation of 35 satellites circling the Earth to rival the US-owned Global Positioning System (GPS)Regime rows back on threat to deploy troops near border amid rising tensionsOfficials prepare \u0026lsquoretaliatory punishment\u0026rsquo after anti-North balloons arrived from SouthBan on cruise ships extended beyond June 30th cases increase as more citizens return homeCovid-19 outbreak in staff at Tyson foods in Arkansas sparks Beijing U-turn on policyChina says draft law is aimed at separatist activity, subversion, terrorism and collusion abroadChina may have shut down its controversial re-education camps, but minorities are still persecutedSamira Imin\u0026rsquos father was incarcerated for three years in XinjiangDelhi says Chinese dammed a river and lay in wait for clash in which 20 Indians diedCases widely seen as Chinese \u0026lsquohostage diplomacy\u0026rsquo following arrest of Huawei\u0026rsquos chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou in VancouverInvestigators say they have found gun and are talking to two \u0026lsquopeople of interest\u0026rsquoTensions remain high despite two governments agreeing to de-escalate confrontationAustralia says it will not name country responsibleKim Yo-jong\u0026rsquos criticism of Seoul illustrates her seniority and potential to become rulerBatons wrapped in barbed wire used in high-altitude brawl in which 20 Indian soldiers diedStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4292677.1593537762!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland left out as eu opens borders to 15 states including australia canada and japan","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA passenger iat El Part de Llobregat airport in Barcelona. Photograph: Ale Jandro GarciaEPAEuropean Union member states approved a list of 15 countries around the world that are deemed safe for travel, agreeing that member states should open their border to them for all travel from Wednesday.Unusually among EU member states, Ireland is not part of the agreement because it is not in the Schengen area of free travel and has a Common Travel Area with the United Kingdom. Ireland was invited to take part in the joint agreement, but could only do so if Britain also agreed due to the open border, and it opted not to do so, The  understands. Denmark is also opting out.The countries deemed safe are: Algeria, Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, Serbia, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia, and Uruguay. China is also to be included, as long as Beijing agrees that EU citizens will also be allowed to travel there in turn.To qualify countries needed to have coronavirus infections that were close to or below the EU average, and to open their borders to EU citizens in turn, but political considerations also came into play.\u0026nbspAgreement on the list of countries was repeatedly delayed as countries struggled to forge consensus, with isions between countries with large tourism industries which pushed for greater opening and those which were more cautious.The United States was not included due to pervasive level of coronavirus infections there.The list is expected to be reviewed every two weeks, and countries could be removed from the safe list if their epidemiological situation changes.To take part, Ireland would need to close off travel to all states but those on the “safe” list. The agreement notes that it “also includes Ireland and the United Kingdom if they decide to align”.While the Schengen countries opted to jointly close their borders to travel from outside the EU on March 17th, Ireland went its own way, maintaining open borders while requiring arrivals to quarantine for two weeks.Due to the quarantine, which also applies to arrivals in Ireland from EU member states, several countries in the EU including Germany, France, the Netherlands and Denmark advise their citizens against non-essential travel to Ireland.“Ireland meets the criteria for low infection rates in the new travel guide model, but we still advise against any unnecessary travel to Ireland because there is a 14 day home quarantine for people traveling to Ireland from abroad,” the advice to citizens on Denmark’s foreign affairs ministry reads.Asked whether it was a concern that some EU countries could have greater ease of travel with the 15 global countries than with Ireland, the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said the situation would be subject to review.“In accordance with government policy, which is based on official public health advice, the Department of Foreign Affairs continues to advise against all non-essential travel overseas. This includes Great Britain but does not apply to Northern Ireland,” a foreign affairs spokesman said.“This advice is subject to review and as per recent statements the Government is giving consideration to a possible roadmap for the resumption of international travel.”.Under the agreement, people travelling for essential reasons are allowed to travel regardless of which country they are arriving from. Essential workers include healthcare workers, seasonal agriculture workers, transport personnel, diplomats, people travelling for urgent family reasons, refugees, incoming international students, and highly skilled workers. Countries taking part in the agreement are free to impose additional precautions on these travellers, such as requiring them to quarantine.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4292699.1593546508!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"why are france and germany advising against travel to ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Aer Lingus planes lined up at Dublin Airport. Photograph: Alan Betson Germany, France, the Netherlands, and Denmark are among the European Union member states that advise their citizens against non-essential travel to Ireland.It’s rare for such countries to advise against travel to a fellow EU member state, since an agreement in Brussels that most countries in the bloc would open their borders to one another on June 15th.Why is Ireland left out? It’s due to its unusual position in the EU rather than our rate of coronavirus infections.Ireland is not in the Schengen area of free travel, unlike most EU member states. Instead, we have a Common Travel Area with Britain that is decades older.Now that the United Kingdom is no longer an EU member state and is choosing not to collaborate even on many things it is still invited to take part in, this puts Ireland in an awkward position.Because of the open border with the North, it has little choice but to follow the lead of the UK.When the Schengen states agreed to close their borders to travel from outside the EU on March 17th, Ireland and the UK went their own way. They kept their borders open, and ultimately introduced a requirement for incoming travellers to quarantine at home for two weeks after arriving.It’s this quarantine requirement that many EU states cite as the reason for advising their citizens against travel to Ireland. Nevertheless, their borders are open to travellers coming in the other direction, arriving from Ireland.“This is an advice from our side against travelling which is due to the fact that Ireland, and also Britain, have quarantine requirements that are in place for German citizens when they enter the country,” a German government spokesman said.“It doesn’t affect at all the status of Irish citizens or people travelling from Ireland.”This has led to the unusual situation that it may be easier to travel between countries like Germany and some of the non-EU states on the list – such as Rwanda, Tunisia and Uruguay – than with Ireland.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Plan to annex parts of West Bank condemned by UN commissioner as \u0026lsquodisastrous\u0026rsquoSome 9.3m Syrians are now food insecure, an increase of 1.4m in past six monthsSeparatist insurgents from Balochistan province claim responsibility for attackNo group claimed responsibility for the attack and Taliban has denied involvementThousands of children could die from preventable diseases because of dire state of healthcare, UN warnsArab world unites in opposition and warns of dire consequences if annexation proceedsOnly under-65s can take part and pilgrims will be quarantined before and after pilgrimageWorld community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideBritish-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Police and security force officers killed in roadside bomb and gun battleHealth authorities confirm more than 3,000 new cases on two consecutive daysOpponents warn that US-backed plan would lead to independent Palestinian stateWar and coronavirus-ravaged country to get $1.35bn from UN and Saudi ArabiaTension rises in region with Israel planning to extend sovereignty to Jewish settlementsStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4292850.1593546790!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus fauci says us could reach 100 000 daily cases","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Anthony Fauci: “I would not be surprised if we go up to 100,000 a day if this does not turn around,” he said. Photograph:  Al DragoBloombergInfectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci has warned that America’s daily coronavirus cases could hit 100,000 as several states across the country continue to report a rise in infections.\u0026nbsp“It could get very bad,” the White House coronavirus task force official said as he appeared before a Senate committee on Tuesday. \u0026nbsp“We are now having 40-plus thousand new cases a day. I would not be surprised if we go up to 100,000 a day if this does not turn around,” he said. “And so I am very concerned.”Dr Fauci was speaking as the European Union announced a plan to reopen the bloc to international travel, but included a ban on visitors from the US.Asked by senator Elizabeth Warren if the pandemic was under control in the United States, as claimed by US president Donald Trump, Dr Fauci replied:“I think the numbers speak for themselves . . . I’m very concerned. I’m not satisfied with what’s going on . . . clearly we are not in total control right now.”He noted that while some parts of the country were doing well, he was very concerned about what was happening elsewhere, stating that four states – California, Texas, Arizona, Florida – were accounting for 50 per cent of all cases.\u0026nbspThe US has reported more than 2.6 million cases and more than 126,000 deaths from Covid-19 – about 25 per cent of the world’s total.Reopening U-turnsArizona became the latest state to change its reopening plan, amid fear of a second wave. Governor Doug Ducey ordered the closure of the state’s bars, cinemas and gyms having reopened most businesses in May.New York and New Jersey – the states worst-hit in the early phase of the pandemic – were also reconsidering their phased reopening plans even though their infection rates are down.New York governor Andrew Cuomo said he would make a decision on the reopening of restaurants on Wednesday, while New Jersey’s governor said plans to allow higher capacity in restaurants would be postponed.Also testifying on Tuesday, the head of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Robert Redfield, criticised the announcement by American Airlines last week that it would begin running planes at full capacity, having previously unveiled measures that would have allowed for social distancing.Meanwhile, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden lambasted the president’s approach to coronavirus in a detailed speech delivered in Delaware on Tuesday.“Month after month, as other leaders in other countries took the necessary steps to get the virus under control, Donald Trump failed us. Month after month, as many of us urged him to step up and do his job, he failed us,” he said.“Donald Trump is in retreat. He called himself a wartime president . . . it seems like our wartime president has surrendered. Waved the white flag and left the battlefield.”Mr Biden announced a range of coronavirus-related measures he would introduce if elected president in November, including hiring at least 100,000 federally-funded workers to perform contact tracing and other health tasks and providing paid leave for those unable to work due to Covid-19.RalliesMr Biden said he would not be holding election rallies, and would continue social distancing, following the advice of health experts, though he has visited Houston and Pennsylvania in recent weeks. He also committed to taking part in the three scheduled presidential debates with Mr Trump in September and October.The former vice-president said that he had not undergone a coronavirus test, though members of the Secret Service stationed at his home, family members and other connections visiting his Delaware house had been tested.Mr Trump had “squandered” the many months of lockdown that “were intended to buy us the time to get our act together”, he said. “We don’t need a cheerleader.

A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this.

You came under the auspices of your father, lived at home, and then your husband ran your life. But now, more than 100 years after women gained the vote, and at a time when they are likely to have enjoyed a good education to university level, earned a salary, moved from the parental home into their own flat with friends before marriage and earn as much or even more than their husband-to-be, they are still passed from one man to the next at a wedding ceremony. Many daughters may have wanted to walk alone but baulked at doing do for fear of upsetting their fathers. Now the Covid-19 restrictions gives them the perfect excuse to do so purposefully as a symbol of a firm and independent intention to marry – a scene that is far more appropriate to the 21st century. What is also appropriate in these straitened times will be how small a Covid wedding will be. Gone will be the lavish ceremony, with hundreds of guests, from your father’s business contacts, to schoolfriends you last saw at a reunion a decade ago, and your future husband’s golfing chums, only there for the flowing fizz and to eye the bridesmaids. That’s not so much a wedding but a social networking exercise and the actual marriage matters not a jot. Now, Covid-19 regulations mean just 30 guests maximum at the ceremony and barely a reception. Groups of two households indoors or six people from different households outdoors can raise a glass to the happy couple. I suspect plenty of people will heave a sigh of relief at this restriction – including a few fathers who lose out on the aisle walks, but gain on the finances. Weddings have become extravaganzas in recent times, with couples feeling bound to organise a day-long celebration, starting with the ceremony, then a sit-down lunch that stretches into evening, followed by a party into the early hours. Add in the dress, the marquees, the country hotel, the band, the food, and the champagne and it’s no wonder that wedding specialists such as hitched estimate that the average cost of a wedding in 2019 was close to £32,000. With today’s events – more akin to the modest ones our grandparents enjoyed during wartime – the focus will be not so much the wedding day as an experience but the marriage – a very contemporary commitment between two equal partners. If it catches on, and becomes the norm well beyond lockdown, it will truly be something to celebrate. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"happened use r rate","story":"Throughout much of the pandemic it has seemed as if ministers and their scientific advisers could barely get through a sentence without mentioning the “R”.A hitherto obscure epidemiological concept which describes whether a disease is spreading or in retreat, the term was referenced incessantly at the daily Downing Street briefings.An R value of less than 1, denoting a decrease in the rate of transmission, was even made an explicit condition of the official strategy to exit lockdown.As with much of The Government’s core messaging, the idea successfully cut through.Ordinary people began to speak of the R as if they were discussing the weather, or the score of a football match.It is striking, therefore, that amid the clamour of public statements made in response to the surge of cases in Leicester, and the subsequent local lockdown, the R value has scarcely been mentioned.Addressing the House of Commons on Monday, Matt Hanock instead spoke of the seven-day infection rate and of cases per 100,000 (Leicester has 135 - three times\u0027 the next highest city).The Health Secretary also talked of daily hospital admissions for Covid-19 in the area (between six and 10 in Leicester, against one at other trusts).Rather than a volte-face, however, Mr Hancock’s choice of jargon reflects a discomfort with the R among policy makers that has been growing for some time.As far back as the second week of June a senior government scientist, speaking to journalists in an off-the-record briefing, issued a “word of caution” about the term, particularly when applied regionally.He explained that as the number of cases comes down, the R painted a less and less nuanced picture.For example, while the R for the UK as a whole on that day (June 19) was 0.7 to 0.9, the growth rate was between -4 and -2 per cent.“R estimates do not tell us how quickly an epidemic is changing and different diseases with the same R can result in epidemics that grow at very different speeds,” a spokesman explained.“For instance, a disease with R2 with infection lasting years will grow much more slowly than a disease with R2 with infection lasting days.“Growth rates provide us with different information to R estimates, by informing us of the size and speed of change, whereas R value only gives us information on the direction of change.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/06/30/19/charlize-theron.jpg","title":"charlize theron how to pronounce name say","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Actor demonstrated how to say her surname on ‘The One Show’Charlize Theron has revealed that most people have been pronouncing her name wrong this whole time.During an appearance on The One Show on Tuesday night (30 June), the South Africa-born actor was asked whether her name is Afrikaans, and how to pronounce it correctly.When presenter Gethin Jones pointed out that many fans pronounce her surname with the emphasis on the “ther” or the “on”, Theron laughed and said: “The truth of the matter is those are not even remotely close to the real pronunciation.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesTheron then revealed her surname is in fact pronounced “Throne”, with a slight roll of the “r”.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A volunteer workforce of expert scientists, technicians and students were drafted in to help get the Lighthouse Laboratories up and running at the beginning of the UK lockdown. As the first tranche of staff arrived on site in Milton Keynes, the challenge became clear.“The simple fact is the Milton Keynes site wasn’t a lab at all,” said one insider. “Most of the equipment we were using was donated and it all had to be set up quickly. All the tests failed in the beginning.”Another added: “They spent the whole first week getting the process up and running and validating the tests with a hospital checking the work. It would have undoubtedly been a faster response mobilising existing labs.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOne said: “It was 200 unpaid people who knocked out the first 300,000 tests and essentially winging it in a very controlled and sensible way but when you talk about preparedness, that doesn’t strike me as being very prepared.”This article was funded by our supporters. If you would like to see more of this important work, please make a contributionSpeaking to The Independent as part of our investigation into the UK’s private coronavirus labs, funded by our Supporter Programme, staff questioned the initial set-up of the three labs, which were opened as part of a centralised push to increase coronavirus testing. Accountancy giant Deloitte managed the operations. The first lab, in Milton Keynes, was opened on 9 April, followed by Alderley Park in Cheshire on 20 April and a third lab in Glasgow a few days later.At the Alderley Park base, nestled on a business park in Cheshire, the feeling was the same: “It was just an office space to begin with, which had to be completely refitted. They started from nothing really.”Local health officials say they’ve been left in the dark on Covid-19How German coronavirus testing stormed ahead of the UK’s modelThe labs received test samples with barcodes, but no other information, then were required to send the test results for each barcode to NHS Digital. The Independent was told the labs did not follow the same standardised processes, meaning there were disagreements on issues such as when to discard damaged or poorly labelled samples, leading to big variations in the void rates between Milton Keynes and Alderley Park.One source said the rates reached as high as 40 per cent and were still at around 20 per cent earlier this month. The Lighthouse Labs and Department of Health said these numbers were not accurate but declined to give an alternative figure.One insider said: “We did have a number of samples that we couldn’t test because the swab had been taken and then it hadn’t been put in the transport tube, which means you can’t test it. Or the sample tube leaked. These are all things that happen when you’re relying on long distance transportation to a testing lab.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

You wouldn’t have had to iron out those things if you were using experienced lab staff.”Another described tube errors as the “biggest issue”, adding: “In the early days when we were trying to ramp up to 20,000 it became impossible because the tubes weren’t processable at all. Deloitte have really got on the case with that now.“Everyone has been given the impression these labs were networked and working to a single protocol but that wasn’t the case at all. They were each left to figure it out for themselves.”When the issue of large variations in the void rate between Milton Keynes and Alderley Park emerged, a meeting was held between the labs in May. A source within the labs said: “It was a big issue, with Alderley Park very unhappy. They felt Milton Keynes was trying to make them look bad.”During April, as the virus reached its peak in the country, staff in the labs described setting up the test process and having to overcome problems and errors that many felt were caused because they were starting from scratch.Staff described being moved to tears when they saw the scale of viral infection in care homes.There were several occasions where it all went really badly wrongOne technician said: “One night we thought there was something wrong with the machines. The signals were so strong from the samples from a care home. It was a shocker you could see how strong the virus was. I admit it made some of us quite upset.”When health secretary Matt Hancock triumphantly announced the UK was now carrying out 100,000 tests staff in the labs said they were “hurt and upset” at the obvious use of postal home-test kits to increase the numbers.One scientist said: “People were upset when they announced the target had been met. I felt quite hurt at that, we had achieved so much so just to lie about it sort of devalued it a lot. A lot of us were p***ed off. We had done brilliantly to get to 65-70,000 tests at that stage.”As many staff begin to return to their normal lives, some told The Independent they had been unaware private companies were behind the labs and felt “exploited” as the labs now looked to recruit paid staff and expand further.“I didn’t really realise there was profit to be made, perhaps I was naive,” said one volunteer who has since returned to their university: “The way things are changing at the labs now, it does make a lot of sense that they’re private companies.They added: “I think they’ve really underappreciated how fragile the processes are. It’s all very well getting these guys in without the experience. And it’s fine when it’s running smoothly but it’s when it goes wrong. There were several occasions where it all went really badly wrong, and we stood the risk of losing thousands of tests.”The Milton Keynes Lighthouse Lab was based at UK Biocentre, a not-for-profit company set up to do academic biomedical research. It employed only 27 staff before the crisis and had no experience of providing infectious disease testing, with one source saying: “It was a very odd choice to create a lab there from nothing.”The company was established in 2011 as a subsidiary of the UK Biobank charity and is funded by the taxpayers via the National Institute for Health Research and the Department of Health, which has gave the company a grant of £653,000 in 2017 after it made a loss. Its latest accounts for the year to September 2018 show it made a loss of more than £11,000 and reported it expected to continue making losses until it could expand services at the site.The Cheshire Lighthouse Lab is run by Medicines Discovery Catapult, described as a technology and medical innovation incubator funded by Innovate UK, an agency of the UK government. It also had little experience in running large-scale infectious disease testing.Along with the third site in Glasgow, these labs have been operating without formal accreditation to confirm they meet the same standards followed by most UK laboratories.Allan Wilson, president of the Institute of Biomedical Science, said: “When you set Lighthouse Labs up, running only with volunteers without registered staff, which are largely unaccredited, then I think that runs significant risks and that’s not a risk many other countries are prepared to take.“The testing strategy for this country has been constantly shifting with more political targets than clinical. Before May there was no clear testing strategy. We should be using testing in a targeted way to try and reduce the transmission of disease.”Medicines Discovery Catapult said the integrity of samples and packaging received by the labs varied and any samples deemed unsafe or which could not be identified were classed as void and not tested. It said efforts were ongoing to improve the packaging across testing sites.MDC said the labs had been working under an open book not-for-profit contract with the Department of Health, and all volunteers have been offered salaries with many taking on the roles.It said the success of the labs meant there was now a need to maintain them, which is why they were now recruiting for longer term staff.A Department of Health spokesperson said: “The Lighthouse Labs form part of the biggest network of diagnostic laboratories in British history and has been set up in a matter of months.“The UK has one of the largest testing programmes in the world and it draws on the expertise and resources of a number of public and private sector partners which has undoubtedly curbed the spread of the virus and saved lives.”Read the rest of our Failing the Test investigation:Slow start and flawed decisions in Britain’s coronavirus testing have cost lives, warn health leadersHow German coronavirus testing stormed ahead of the UK’s modelLocal health officials say they have been left in the dark on spread of coronavirusThis article was funded by our supporters.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.As the UK barely managed 5,000 coronavirus tests a day in early March, Germany was already nearing 100,000 tests per week – significantly ramping up testing with the virus raging in nearby Italy.While Britain had stopped most testing of the virus and entered into lockdown, Berlin took a different path, mobilising its network of laboratories and involving dozens of private labs and companies in what was seen as a national effort.In our investigation into Britain’s efforts to rapidly expand testing, funded by The Independent\u0027s Supporter Programme, multiple sources referenced the German approach as an example of what the UK could have done had decisions been taken earlier. Though the German diagnostics industry is better established than the UK’s, they also pointed to a fundamentally different approach for expansion and conveying results.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis article was funded by our supporters. If you would like to see more of this important work, please make a contributionTom Lewis, national lead for pathology in the NHS Getting It Right First Time programme, said: “If you look at Germany in particular, here is an integrated public health response with testing at the core of that but it’s testing with a purpose. They had a much smaller problem than we did.”Colin Fink, from Micropathology Ltd, said: “Germany is very interesting. There is no public-private ide in the sense that there’s no Victorian prejudice against trade like there is in the UK. They are controlled price-wise, by the government and their competition is really their turnaround time, and their portfolio of organisms.Inside the coronavirus mega-labsLocal health officials say they’ve been left in the dark on Covid-19“They instantly geared up when they saw this coming and so they had a much better infrastructure to be able to address the problem.”When the first cases emerged in Germany in February many of the existing private labs in the country recognised the threat and began to work on increasing testing.Daniel Hefel, from Medicover Diagnostic Services and a member of Germany’s Association of Certified Labs, or ALM, told The Independent: “We started very early to bring together all the competition, usually the laboratories were never talking to each other, but we decided very early in the Covid-19 crisis that we needed to share information.“The most important thing was speed and to scale up very, very quickly so that we can deliver results the same day or one day later.”He said that by the first week of March the country was delivering just under 100,000 tests a week but this rapidly increased and is now in the region of 350,000 tests a week after 10 weeks with the capacity to do much more if needed.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailHe said spreading out the labs as opposed to centralising testing was easier, logistically, and meant faster results.Alongside the mass testing he said any positive result was communicated to local health authorities immediately, initially by phone, though the system is now automated.“We were the laboratory who picked up the first two cases in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, that’s the state in the northeast,” Hefel said. ”We reported at four o’clock on the results and two hours later it was in the media. In these two hours we informed the health authority, the health authority went to the media, but in parallel they contacted the patient and started immediate isolation. This was in the beginning of March.The biggest challenge is when you have a huge centralised lab, and you want to funnel everything into the central lab, and that was also what the US did in the beginning where they had a couple of monster labs set up, but it was not covering the whole state so they opened up to many other labs in the US and then scaling is much easier.”Asked about the UK approach he said: “Building up something from scratch is certainly very difficult. I would have it done differently.”A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “The Lighthouse Labs form part of the biggest network of diagnostic laboratories in British history and has been set up in a matter of months.“The UK has one of the largest testing programmes in the world and it draws on the expertise and resources of a number of public and private sector partners which has undoubtedly curbed the spread of the virus and saved lives.”Read the rest of our Failing the Test investigation:Slow start and flawed decisions in Britain’s coronavirus testing have cost lives, warn health leadersLocal health officials say they have been left in the dark on spread of coronavirusInside the coronavirus mega-labsThis article was funded by our supporters.

They identified a G4 variant of the H1H1 “swine flu” virus strain that caused a deadly pandemic in 2009.Pig farm workers also showed elevated levels of the virus in their blood, found the study’s authors, based at two Chinese universities, the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, and the University of Nottingham.“Such infectivity greatly enhances the opportunity for virus adaptation in humans and raises concerns for the possible generation of pandemic viruses,” the researcher wrote.The study noted pigs were important “mixing vessels” for influenza viruses and systemic surveillance of diseases in the animals was “essential for early warning and preparedness for the next potential pandemic”.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That’s the key context to keep in mind,” he said.He added: “Every indication is that the G4 virus would have to undergo some evolutionary change to spread readily in people, and it may never do that. If it does? We know how to make vaccines for influenza viruses. It could be included in the seasonal vaccine the only issue is timing.”The 2009 H1N1 pandemic, thought to have originated in pigs in Mexico, is estimated to have infected more than 700 million people worldwide. It caused nearly 17,000 lab-confirmed deaths reported to the WHO, but the true number of fatalities linked to the disease is believed to have been far higher.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I have family of every race, creed and ideology.“We must ensure #blacklivesmatter doesn\u0027t morph into #blacklivesbetter.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMany of Crews’s Twitter followers took issue with his suggestion that the movement will lead to black people becoming superior over other races.“I dont understand why ur posts are so pandering to (unfounded) arguments against the BLM movement,” wrote one person. “No one, NOT A DAMN SOUL, said #blacklivesbetter. This is being willfully destructive, disingenuous, w microaggressions towards BLM. I tire of saying do better....but DO BETTER.”Another wrote: “Its actually embarrassing how intent you are at undermining people who are fighting for their humanity to be viewed EQUALLY. Nobody is taking it there except you \u0026amp those uncomfortable with having to address the elephant in the room. I implore you please do better, this ain\u0027t it.”A third said: “You truly are worthless to us.

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.From fashion stylist to farm hand: meet the people helping to harvestThe bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms. Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo?

In what the prime minister Boris Johnson described as a whack-a-mole strategy, flare-ups in other towns and cities across the country could lead to local lockdowns in an attempt to stop the spread of coronavirus. However, the flare-up in Leicester, the largest city in the east Midlands, appears to be much worse than other cities.  Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAccording to the government, Leicester recorded 10 per cent of all positive cases in England in the past week, with an infection rate of 135 cases per 100,000 over the seven-day period. This is three times higher than the next worst-affected city in the country. As a result, Mr Hancock said that non-essential shops would be closed in Leicester on Tuesday and schools would be shut from Thursday. The city will also not move ahead with the easing of restrictions which is planned for the rest of England from 4 July, including the reopening of pubs, cinemas and restaurants.  Leicester sent back into lockdown as WHO warns ‘worst is yet to come’Leicester travel ban could be imposed if people try to leave cityInside Politics: Hancock puts Leicester back into lockdownFirst UK local lockdown imposed in LeicesterFirst local lockdown imposed in Leicester The measures will apply to Leicester and the surrounding area including Oadby, Birstall and Glenfield. Although the East Midlands city has seen a sharper spike in infections than in other areas, the number of confirmed cases is on the rise in 36 of England\u0027s 151 upper-tier local authorities.Doncaster recorded 32 new cases last week up from 11 the week before, while Derbyshire saw a slight increase from 23 to 25 new infections over the same time period. Responding to the situation in Leicester, the shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth, who represents Leicester South, called into question the speed of the government\u0027s response.We were alerted to the situation in Leicester 11 days ago and now we\u0027ve got tonight from the Secretary of State the whack-a-mole strategy, Mr Ashworth said.

Labour is demanding Downing Street holds a press conference to further explain the Leicester situation, after the daily briefings were cancelled, unless the government had something really important to say.Professor Keith Neal, Emeritus Professor of the Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases at the University of Nottingham, said that Leicester was facing a unique situation.“There is clearly a very different picture of Covid-19 in Leicester than other parts of the country, 10 per cent of cases in 0.5 per cent of the population… Each local situation is different and requires a locally targeted approach.“Drawing the boundary was never going to be easy. Including three surrounding areas will have upset some people in why these were included, but not other areas.“Somewhere had to be first for a local increase in cases. It just happens to be Leicester.”Why are there so many outbreaks at meat factories?A council in West Yorkshire has reassured residents there is no spike in cases there after some apparent geographical confusion from Mr Hancock.In broadcast interviews about the lockdown measures being re-imposed in Leicester, Mr Hancock referred to previous actions to combat outbreaks in Weston-super-Mare and in Keighley.But it is believed the secretary of state meant to reference Kirklees – the local authority which covers the Cleckheaton meat processing factory where an outbreak of Covid-19 saw 165 positive cases earlier this month.Bradford Council, which covers Keighley, said in a Tweet on Tuesday morning: Just to calm everyone down a bit ... There\u0027s no new Covid-19 spike in Keighley.MattHancock confused Keighley with a different area on TV and radio this morning. Please keep maintaining social distance \u0026amp washing hands so we don\u0027t need to announce a local outbreak in the future.Additional reporting from PA Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them.

And today, because of the enormous generosity of Virustatic Shield, whose innovative anti-viral snoods we’ve also been producing, 10,000 of London’s most vulnerable people will receive a vital face covering, delivered to them via The Independent’s fantastic campaign.Which star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day It is now mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport, but these coverings are in short supply.That’s why we started The Big Community Sew to encourage people to make face coverings for their friends and neighbours, and by doing so preserve vital supplies of PPE for NHS workers and care home staff who are fighting this virus on the frontline.The science behind face coverings is simple: they help prevent the wearer from unwittingly spreading the disease.

It is a fabulous way of making life worth living.”Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mDame Judi said: “How wonderful that Peter Blake’s amazing artwork will have a new lease of life for such good causes.

We fight for our life, we fight for the life of our brothers, and this is the feeling I have when I contemplate Sir Peter Blake’s masterpiece!

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I would not be here if it wasn’t for this project,’ one helper saysWhat has it been like to volunteer during the pandemic? Social enterprise Bread n Butter – one of the charities supplied by our Help The Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project – closed its doors at the end of March.However, its founders saw a growing need among the city’s most vulnerable for regular home-cooked, nutritious meals, so they joined with community centres Stonegrove Community Trust and the Hive Trust.Since then, Bread n Butter’s team, aided by volunteers, have been cooking and delivering more than 1,000 meals a day to Londoners in need in Barnet, Enfield and Brent. Here, we speak to four people who keep this project going.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRichard Simon, a furloughed IT worker, joined the Stonegrove Community Trust’s OneStonegrove project in Edgware at his wife’s suggestion. The 52-year-old said: “Working in the kitchens was like being on Ready Steady Cook. You don’t know what ingredients you’re going to be working with, so you have to think on your feet.” The father of two, who dedicates 20 hours a week, added that the biggest thing he had learnt was the power of “working together”.“For a group of people who don’t know each other, we just get on with it, working flat out.

The former Oxfam shop worker, who has high-functioning autism, said that because of her condition, having a “structured day” is incredibly important. “Without routine, I can’t cope,” she said. “I would not be here if it wasn’t for this project.”Ms Karbritz, who is also anorexic, said working with food had been transformative. “Working to create healthy, nutritious food everyday has changed my relationship with it. I have also learned how to cook, whereas before I lived out of tins.”Mariana Bassi Da Silva, a software developer, wanted to volunteer as she was not working due to the pandemic. A keen cook, the 34-year-old volunteered for OneStonegrove and said the project had helped develop her love of cooking. The Brazilian-Italian, who moved to London seven years ago, said the greatest impact the project has had on her was the sense of “belonging”.“It is hard to settle in when you move,” she said. “Here, I have a community.

Despite the vast differences between the two situations, Fawcett’s extensive military experiences and qualifications have helped him and his team develop a robust response to the Covid-19 crisis.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I was the only doctor there for about 300 people, which was quite an eye-opening experience,” says Fawcett of his first stint in Afghanistan in 2007 as part of the Army Reserves. Working at the Role 2E Field Hospital in Camp Bastion and at the Forward Operating Base, Fawcett provided key treatment on the Afghanistan frontline.On his second stint in 2007, he spent three months in Camp Bastion as a Trauma Team Leader, and on his third tour in 2011, he was the clinical lead for the Medical Emergency Response Team, a four-person medical team operating from a Chinook flying over Afghanistan, picking up wounded soldiers on the battlefield.What’s more, Fawcett – who also counts a role with the Midlands Air Ambulance Charity as a helicopter doctor amongst his impressive repertoire – has completed an MSc in Disaster Healthcare. Playing an instrumental part of Stoke hospital’s response to the Coronavirus pandemic is just one more string to his bow.“I was able to take a lot of stuff I learnt and apply it from the very start,” Fawcett says of putting his Masters in Disaster Healthcare into practise. “Before the patients even get to the emergency department, we make sure there’s clear boundaries, and patients are directed to the right areas to avoid any cross-contamination.”His army tours also contributed: “Looking at the designs of how they set up field hospitals and stuff helps,” he adds. “And working with international colleagues – it’s good to get a non-UK perspective on how other countries deal with certain circumstances.”This involved an overhaul of the whole emergency area and its processes. “We now run two emergency medicine departments out of one department,” he explains. “We’ve had to basically split the whole department in half.”Now, Stoke hospital features red zones and green zones: the former is for those displaying potential Covid symptoms and the latter is for those who aren’t. As such, the pathways and patient-flow of the hospital have had to be changed to avoid any instances of contact between these areas.“We have separate ambulance entrances for red and green patients. We have two resuscitation departments, two areas for major patients, two areas for walk-in patients, two minor injuries areas, two paediatrics departments, as well as designing alternative pathways to try and stream those patients that don’t have to come through the emergency department to other places.” he explains, noting how such isions have had to be executed throughout the whole hospital to prevent crowding and maintain social distancing.How schools in England are helping pupils return to the classroomThe task may have been monumental, but Fawcett takes pride in the hospital’s response: “This is what we’ve always trained for and it’s been good to see how us as an emergency department have responded to it.

Customs controls coming from the UK to the EU will be implemented in full on 1 January.Alex Veitch, head of International Policy at FTA, which represents freight transport companies, said:  “The logistics industry is keen to learn details of any system to facilitate the export of goods across  EU borders, and is ready to support the preparations of such a system so that it can be ready for January 1, 2021.  We are currently talking to UK government and EU partners to understand all the system requirements and brief our members. It takes two to tango, and we need both import and export systems to be ready, tested, and operational to keep Britain trading.”Despite a long history of UK government IT projects going wrong, HMRC officials say they are confident the scheme can be delivered and point to experience building platforms like the coronavirus furlough scheme as evidence.Asked about the plans, a UK government spokesperson said: At the end of this year we will control our own laws and borders, which is why we have taken the sovereign decision to introduce border controls in a way that gives businesses impacted by coronavirus time to adjust.Created with Sketch.Brexit celebrations in Parliament Square Show all 37Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pro-Brexit supporters celebrating in Parliament Square, after the UK left the European Union on 31 January.

But the test does not state that infections must be falling across the country.PHE said it would be wrong to use the figures to predict possible coronavirus hotspots which might need lockdown restrictions reimposed in future.A spokesperson said that the figures broken down by local authority area were used “as one of a number of indicators to help us and partner organisations to identify trends in local areas and to take action accordingly.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mr Hancock also said the further easing of the lockdown planned for the rest of England on 4 July will not now happen in Leicester. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAnd he warned that further steps would be taken if necessary.

We have been on it.”The emergency crackdown in Leicester follows the revelation that one in 10 new infections nationwide are happening in the cityNon-essential shops will shut and remain closed for the foreseeable future, most schools will be closed from Thursday and plans to relax shielding measures for the most vulnerable have been shelved.With the city’s pubs, bars and restaurants no longer permitted to reopen this weekend, there are fears of people flocking to nearby Derby and Nottingham, for example.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut EU employers are anticipating the end of those right, which will make it harder for Britons to do some jobs that involve cross-border travel.“We are seeing people refused interviews for jobs because those jobs require the freedom to travel across the EU,” Kalba Meadows, a steering group member of British in Europe who lives in France, told the EU Future Relationship Select Committee.UK policies risk ‘retaliatory deportations’ for Brits living in EUWhat happens to UK citizens living in the EU under a no-deal Brexit?“We’re not even at the end of transition yet and there are already real live instances of people’s lives and livelihoods being affected – and that will only increase. So many jobs rely on free movement because of the single market.”Ms Meadows added: “We have a very large number of people whose livelihood is based on working in different countries – people with small businesses, people who are employed, and an awful lot of them face losing our livelihoods. It’s not just about losing your rights on paper, it’s something that affects real lives.”While the Brexit withdrawal agreement protects some of the rights of British citizens abroad and EU citizens in the UK, there are holes in it, notably with regard to jobs not based in a single member state. The integrated nature of EU economies means that occasional travel to other countries is common, particularly in professional-level occupations.There are also gaps in the extent to which Britons’ qualifications will be mutually recognised in the EU after Brexit.Michael Harris, a steering group member of British in Europe who lives in Spain, told MPs: “There’s a stereotype of a Briton who lives in Spain – there are a lot of retired people in Spain who won’t be affected by the need to go and work or provide cross-border services, but around 60 per cent of Britons in Spain are working-age or below. Young Britons in the EU are the people who are going to be most affected by this – to go and study and work.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There are no rights in the withdrawal agreement on cross-border working,” she said.Britain and the EU are currently negotiating a future relationship, which both sides have always said will cover immigration issues. But political pressure in the UK has led to the government ruling out a continuation of free movement.Neither side’s draft agreement includes provisions for free movement rights and the UK’s draft immigration bill contains no provisions for such policies.Ms Golding told the committee: “We haven’t had any indication from either side that this is a topic that’s being discussed in any detail in the future negotiations.”British in Europe\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I think the parents and students now realise how important school is.”Prior to the return, teachers organised a virtual assembly for Year 10 and 12 pupils, and sent a booklet home detailing the new guidelines which would be in place.5 back-to-school tips for parents\u0026nbsp“Don\u0027t give them a lot of small instructions – recognise your child would have had an enormous amount of\u0026nbspinstructions during the course of the day.”“If you are rewarding your child\u0027s behaviour, it\u0027s very important to do it every time.”“For a child who\u0027s been finding it tough,\u0026nbsptalking to another child who\u0027s been in the same situation is by far the best way of letting it out.”“It\u0027s important to encourage a child to work for themselves and get on with their own inner task.”New measures include red circles marked on the ground that are two metres apart and one-way systems throughout the school.“We’ve reorganised all the classrooms that we’re using so the desks and chairs are two metres apart,” Patterson explains. “We’ve got designated areas set aside at break and lunchtime for each group to go to, and we’ve got signage around the school reminding everybody of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand washing and keeping their distance.”Implementing new measuresRheeya Makwana is one of the Year 12 students who has returned to Hinchingbrooke. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom,” she says. “The structure was really good and I felt like I learned a lot more being back at school. I came home in such a good mood.”Rheeya’s father Yogesh Makwana did have some initial worries about his daughter returning to school: “There’s always some concern, but all the communication from school has been excellent in the build up to it and all the measures that have been put in place have reassured us. If you offered our 13-year-old the chance to go back to school tomorrow, he’d do it in a heartbeat. He misses his classes the social interaction. He loves PE and he does so much at school that he misses.Year 10 pupils Vahine and Lucia will also be returning to the school this week. “The twins are really looking forward to it,” says their mother, Alesia Dickinson. “They’ve been messaging all their friends to find out what group they’re in. Less than a week after we said yes to going back we found out what bubbles they were in and we had clear guidelines about times, rooms and what they can expect when they go back to school. They’re raring to go.”Both Makwana and Dickinson agree that their children have missed the structure of school lessons and that the transition back to the classroom has been easier than expected. “I think it’s a positive thing,” says Dickinson. “I think it’s a step in the right direction. We need to let the children start that process.”Going back to Embark schoolsTrust leader at Embark Matthew Crawford, pictured below, has been welcoming back primary pupils to the Federation’s schools across Derbyshire.“The feedback we have had so far from all the schools across the Trust is that it’s going really well in terms of welcoming the children back,” he says. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all. Each school has done a risk assessment based on what they can do.”Most Embark schools are now back at around 25-30 per cent capacity, Crawford says. It\u0027s up from around two per cent when lockdown began, when it was just key workers’ children and more vulnerable pupils in the classroom.“It’s lovely to hear the children playing and see schools becoming vibrant again,” he adds. “As soon as lockdown began, we started work on our Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme, a nine-stage support package to welcome children back safely.”Keyworker Vicki Ellis has two children who have returned to one of Embark\u0027s schools Richardson Endowed Primary - Amelia in Year 3 and Darcey in Year 1, pictured below.The first day the girls were back I was wondering how they were all day. I knew the school had done everything possible to welcome the children back in a happy, positive way but I worried whether Amelia and Darcey were enjoying themselves. But when they came home they were so happy to have had that day at school – and eager to go back next day. Crawford explains that the school has tried to make the transition back to the classroom as fun as possible for the children: “We’re following the guidelines but in a way that’s fun for the children. We aren’t marking big Xs on the floor. Some of our schools, for example, are painting snakes in bright colours to show the way.”Embark has also shared its programme with schools as far as Devon, Durham, South Gloucestershire and Wales.“It’s a suite of resources and activities that schools can adapt to their own settings, taking the bits that work for them,” explains Crawford. “It’s lovely that the brilliant work of our staff is making a difference and impacting the lives of millions of children across the country, not just the 3,000 within our Trust.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

The government\u0027s top infectious diseases expert said that the spike in areas of the country like the South and the West are putting the entire country at risk.We are now having 40-plus thousand new cases a day. I would not be surprised if we go up to 100,000 a day if this does not turn around, Mr Fauci said. And so I am very concerned.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesStates including Florida, Texas and California have seen record rises in cases in recent days, leading governors to pause and in some cases reverse reopening measures.As he was giving evidence to a Senate committee, the European Union announced a number of countries it would allow people to enter from as it loosens its own restrictions – while it included nations like Canada, Australia, Rwanda and Algeria, it excluded the US, along with Russia and Brazil.Dr Fauci said: Clearly we are not in total control right now, I am very concerned because it could get very bad. He said there was no guarantee that efforts to develop a safe and effective vaccine would be successful.More than 2.6 million Americans have been infected with the coronavirus, and about 129,000 people in the US have lost their lives to it.Dr Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, also gave testimony during the hearing. He said the agency was busy preparing a public education blitz to build confidence in the US public for an eventual coronavirus vaccine. The health officials claimed they needed the programme to build vaccine confidence among those who view the government and vaccines with scepticism.

According to Dr Fauci, the education programme will be implemented at vaccine trial sites. It is a reality: a lack of trust of authority, a lack of trust in government, and a concern about vaccines in general.He said it was not just anti-vaxxers who were sceptical of the government but warned that on-the-ground community engagement would be necessary to earn the trust of poor and minority communities where people have not always been treated fairly by the government. Dr Stephen M Hahn, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, pressed the importance of the public\u0027s confidence in any forthcoming vaccines. Arizona shuts down again for 30 days amid spike in coronavirus casesPublic confidence in vaccines is so important. We have an obligation to use all of our scientific knowledge, regulatory framework to ensure that any vaccine that comes before us, whether for authorization or approval, meets our stringent standards for safety and effectiveness, Mr Hahn said. Vaccines are being developed under President Donald Trump\u0027s Operation Warp Speed, an accelerated production programme aiming to have at least 300 million doses of a vaccine ready by the beginning of 2021. The FDA has worked to counter public fears that the accelerated vaccine development process might result in a more dangerous or less-tested treatment.The presumptive Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden, launched a fresh attack on Mr Trump\u0027s historic mismanagement of the pandemic, arguing he could have saved lives and the economy by acting earlier to control the virus.It didn\u0027t have to be this way, the former vice president said in a speech in Delaware, in which he unveiled an updated plan to tackle the pandemic, including more testing and hiring at least 100,000 contract tracers.

There have been more than 170 new cases of Covid-19 since last week, marking the biggest increase since the virus\u0027s spread was close to being eliminated in April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The virus poses a greater threat to my elderly mum than it does to me.Men from working-class backgrounds are more likely to die, as are people from ethnic-minority communities.Coronavirus doesn’t just discriminate when it comes to health. It discriminates according to wealth, too.As we live through the worst economic crisis of our time, some parts of the country will be hit a lot harder than others.The impact the virus has had on our economy is breathtaking. The Bank of England says \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"we are heading for the biggest recession in  years.The fall in output in March and April alone wiped out  years of growth. Claims for Universal Credit have already risen by .million.Behind these statistics are the jobs and livelihoods of hard-working people.\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"Whether this has affected you personally depends on your line of work.Advertising executives, accountants and lawyers are able to work from home.Those with jobs in manufacturing, construction and retail are not.The more labour-intensive an industry is, the harder it is likely to have been hit by lockdown.The types of jobs that are most cushioned from the economic crisis are concentrated in London and the South East.Manufacturing jobs are mostly found in Yorkshire and the North. The West Midlands — where I’m an MP — will take a harder hit than London because much of our local economy relies on car manufacturing.Of course, \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"inequalities between these areas already existed.Before the virus, wages were  per cent lower in the North East than they were in London and le expectancy was nearly three years shorter.Fixing that was a driving force behind our General Election victory six months ago. My concern is that the crisis could make an unfair situation even worse.It’s not just a question of fairness, either. Across the country, towns and cities continue to underperform due to a lack of investment.Putting an end to this tragic waste of potential is a crucial part of boosting the nation’s productivity.The Prime Minister gets all this. That’s why \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"he is gearing up to kick-start growth with a massive package of investment. As he looks to rebuild, he will rightly see this as an opportunity not only to revive our economy, but to set it on a firmer, fairer foundation than before.I’ve been working with the Centre for Policy Studies since we went into lockdown, coming up with ideas to help my colleagues in government secure the strongest possible recovery as we come out of it.I want to make sure that left-behind regions not only share in our economic comeback, but that our plan is specically designed to spread prosperity to every corner of the country, leaving no one behind.Thankfully, we’re not short on options.One of the first things we can do is bring forward plans for a revolution in regional infrastructure.Investing in roads, railways and broadband will increase economic activity and boost communities by creating new jobs and helping businesses grow.Alongside investment in training and skills, this will transform the regions.The Government should also take advantage of record-low rates to massively step up the amount of cash it is willing to invest in overlooked areas.Where this cash goes shouldn’t be led by bureaucrats in Whitehall, but local people who really understand the problems in their area.City and Town Deals have proved a huge success, as have visionaryMayors such as Ben Houchen in Tees Valley and Andy Street in the West Midlands.We shouldn’t be afraid to devolve wider and deeper across England, increasing the powers of local authorities and setting up models that have proved successful.Finally, we need to find new ways of putting money back in people’s pockets, and change the tax system where it is grossly unfair. For towns and cities across the North, we can do both by changing the way council tax works.Bizarrely, your council tax is calculated using property values that are  years out of date.If you move into a new-build, the valuation office tells you what band you’re in based on a guess of what it might have been worth in .Because the value of their homes has soared since then, this system effectively hands rich homeowners a massive discount.That isn’t fair. We should consider a full council tax revaluation to make sure that hardworking people in less well-off areas are not subsidising the rest of the country.This pandemic will change many things about our country. One thing that won’t change is the need to address profound regional inequalities, and spread opportunity and prosperity to every part of the UK.The case for levelling-up is stronger than it has ever been before.With better regional infrastructure, more local decision-making and fairer taxes, we still can — and must — make it happen.  To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mr Sunak said in a speech today: #Our agreement will bring together government, regulators and industry to create a new and better framework for cross-border financial services, across insurance, banking, asset management and capital markets. #The benefits are clear for both countries: it should deliver lower costs, opportunities for new and better revenues, and improved cooperation between regulators.#And this agreement puts our two countries at the forefront of innovation in financial services trade # no-ones ever done anything as ambitious as this, on this kind of scale.#Financial analysts have made predictions about how likely a no deal Brexit is.

An adviser to Michel Barnier has confirmed that the EU trade negotiator will reply to a letter sent by the European Research Group last week.ERG chairman Mark Francois slammed the EUs #unreasonable demands# and said the trade bloc needed to grant Britain #sovereignty, integrity and autonomy# in a letter to Mr Barnier.

Speaking to TalkRadio this morning, George Brandis said he wants it to be easier for Brits to sell their goods and services to Australia. He said: #When it comes to goods and services, what we want is to lower and ideally eliminate tarfs, and reduce and ideally eliminate quotas on both sides, so that Australian goods will be cheaper in the United Kingdom, and UK goods and services will be cheaper in Australia.#As well as that, we will look to free up the flow of investment, which is already very strong by the way # the United Kingdom is Australias second biggest source of foreign investment.#As well, Im ambitious that we can do something to make it easier for our citizens, particularly our young people, to live and work in each others countries. #Because that not only has an economic benefit, but of course in a very human way it fosters greater people-to-people links and greater mutual understanding.#The UK and the EU have accused each other of holding up a key decision.Each side says the other is causing problems when it comes to the City of London’s ability to do business in EU markets from next year.Both parties had agreed to complete assessments of the other’s regulatory regimes for financial services by today, which would allow business to continue next year, thereports.But the deadline for that decision is likely to be missed # and the European commission and the UK government are blaming each other for the delay.Michel Barnier told the Eurofi financial regulation think tank that the UK had answered only four of  questionnaires Brussels had sent seeking information about regulation of financial services. In response, a Treasury spokesman said the commission is working too slowly when compared with Whitehall.Michel Barnier has today said the UK is asking for too much out of Brexit.He told a think tank: #The UK is trying to keep as many single market benefits as it can.#It would like to make it easy to continue to run EU businesses from London, with minimal operations and staff on the continent.#His comments, reported by the Express, came amid talks with UK negotiator David Frost this weekMr Barnier said: “We now know that the transition period will not be extended.“The EU was open to an extension, but the UK refused. #It is the UK’s choice.”Brits living in the EU are increasingly being refused job interviews because of their impending Brexit loss of free movement rights, MPs have been told.Officials from group British in Europe, which represents the .million British people living on the continent, said the loss of rights was “already real” for many people living abroad.UK nationals have free movement in the EU until the end of the transition period in December this year.Group member Kalba Meadows told the EU Future Relationship Select Committee: “We are seeing people refused interviews for jobs because those jobs require the freedom to travel across the EU.#Boris Johnson today unveiled a huge new programme to kick-start the economy.But Sir Ed Davey, acting leader of the Lib Dems, has called the scheme #Boris bluster#.#The Prime Minister says he will build build build but all his Government is building is a wrecking ball for our economy as he recklessly pursues Brexit at all costs,# Sir Ed said.#Johnson promised a green recovery from the pandemic, but as usual his promises are meaningless.#Were seeing yet more mass investment in road building rather than in new infrastructure for cycling, and the construction of new homes without also tackling our existing draughty houses.#Conservative former cabinet minister David Davis has this afternoon offered his support to new clause , which seeks to continue existing arrangements for unaccompanied children to be reunited with close relatives in the UK, and new clause two # which gives children in care indefinite leave to remain under the EU Settlement Scheme.Mr Davis told the Commons: #As an ex-Brexit secretary I see no reason whatsoever to wait on negotiation to takeclauses forward.#Conservative former minister Tim Loughton said that there must be a #clear intent# from the Government that a scheme will be in place post-Brexit to help protect unaccompanied child refugees.Speaking during the Immigration and Social Security Co-OrdinationBill report stage, Mr Loughton voiced his support for New Clause  which would make provision for unaccompanied children to be reunited with family members in the UK.#Weve had fob-offs, frankly, over recent years for why it wouldnt be appropriate to put on the face of legislation,# he told the Commons.#We have a great record, so why on earth would we not want to make sure we continue that great record for some of the most vulnerable children fleeing from danger that weve been able to afford a safe and legal passage to join relatives in the United Kingdom #Campaigners have called on the Government to make changes to the EU settlement schemein light of the coronavirus pandemic.Around  charities and organisations signed a letter to Home Secretary Priti Patel setting out their concerns on Tuesday, which marks exactly a year until the deadline for applications.EU citizens have been told to apply by June next year in order to carry on living and working in the UK after freedom of movement with the European Union ends.The letter said: #We are concerned that the Government has not taken appropriate steps or made the adequate adjustments to the EUSS necessary to protect EU citizens and family members from Covid-.#We believe the Home Office must work with other Government departments to resolve the following issues as a matter of urgency.#The latest estimates show overall ,, applications have been received with ,, finalised since the scheme began, leaving a backlog of around , still awaiting a decision.Image:AFPHere are some of the reactions to David Frosts new appointment as the UKs most senior civil servant: There are big questions over whether Mr Frost will have finished with his duties as EU negotiator by the time he takes his new security job.Today, Michael Gove has said: #Were confident that well be making progress over the next few weeks in EU negotiations.#Theyre being conducted intensively, specically at the request of the Prime Minister and the president of the European Commission.#Portuguese MEP Pedro Silva Pereira has warned there must be #concrete changes# in the UKs position before Brussels agrees to a deal.He says Britain #depends# on its trade links with the European Union. Speaking to Euronews, Mr Silva Pereira said: #I think a no-deal scenario is there, it exists and it is dangerous for everybody, in particular for the UK economy.#The UK depends very much on exports to the European market. #What both parties should do is engage in the negotiations in a constructive manner and try to find a balanced agreement.#Michael Gove has also spoken out in defence of the appointment of Mr Frost this afternoon.The Cabinet Office minister told the Commons: #We have had previous national security advisers, all of them excellent, not all of them necessarily steeped in the security world.#Some of them were distinguished diplomats in their own right.#David Frost is a distinguished diplomat in his own right and it is entirely appropriate the Prime Minister of the day should choose an adviser appropriate to the needs of the hour.#Downing Street has come in for a great deal of criticism on the decision to appoint Mr Frost as the UKs top civil servant # including from former PM Theresa May, as seen in the post below.And today, Tory frontbencher Lord True says the appointment doesnt represent #the politicisation of the Civil Service#.Mr Frost is a career diplomat #perfectly capable of giving dispassionate and wise advice#, he told peers.He was responding to concerns raised by members of the House of Lords following the appointment of Boris Johnsons chief EU negotiator to the key post of National Security Adviser.There has been criticism that, unlike previous holders of the post, Mr Frost is a political adviser rather than a career civil servant, and lacks security experience.He will replace Sir Mark Sedwill, who is also stepping down as Cabinet Secretary and head of the Civil Service, amid reports of clashes with Mr Johnsons chief adviser, Dominic Cummings.Theresa May has today challenged Boris Johnsons decision to appoint Brexit negotiator David Frost as the new National Security Adviser.The former PM says he lacks the #expertise# required. The Government announced the appointment on Sunday after confirming the incumbent Sir Mark Sedwill will step down in August. Ms May has this afternoon challenged Michael Gove over the decision.#On Saturday, my Right Honourable Friend said, ‘we must be able to promote those with proven expertise,# she said.#Why then is the new National Security Adviser a political appointee with no proven expertise in national security #Image: PAForeign affairs minister Wendy Morston said it is #so important# to promote UK interests by having representation in Brussels after the Brexit transition period has ended.It comes as former Tory minister Sir Christopher Chope expressed disappointment that there was no plan to cut the number of FCO staff working in Brussels post-Brexit.He told the Commons: #Its very disappointing thathasnt got a target for the reduction in the number of bureaucrats in Brussels to take effect on January  next year.#Can I suggest that the target might be to reduce the current numbers of  down to . Can she explain why she doesnt think thats possible #Ms Morton responded: #Of course as an independent country,would understand that we want to have representation in Brussels because after the transition period what is so important is about promoting UK interests and UK influence overseas.#The decision to replace Sir Mark Sedwell is all about the #revenge# of the Vote Leave campaign, SNP home affairs spokeswoman Joanna Cherry said.She said: #Of course Sir Mark Sedwill should be thanked for his distinguished service, but the truth is that his card was marked last year when he warned the Cabinet that Brexit would be a disaster.#He also said that the consequent recession could be worse than  and that prices could go up by %.#So this is all about the revenge of the Vote Leave campaign whose so-called mastermindis now pulling the strings of this government.#Although one does have to wonder about the masterly-ness of a mind that thinks a good way to test ones eyesight is to go for a -mile drive.#Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The PMs comments were echoed by new holiday freedoms for Brits, with the Government confirming it would ditch the -day quarantine rules for everyone coming into the country.In a written statement Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the Government will shortly begin to ease the health measures at the UK border which will allow passengers to be exempted from self isolation requirements.The Government will outline later this week which countries will be on the safe list, meaning people wont have to stay home for  days when they arrive in the UK.The air bridges - also known as travel corridors - will be set up with other countries with lower levels of infection.The rules will apply to anyone coming in via plane, rail or boat.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Thats not just about PPE - thats about regular testing so you root out asymptomatic carriers of the virus and I think thats something where we could go a lot further.It comes as pubs, restaurants and other hospitality industries are set to reopen in England on July .But non-essential shops in Leicester will be closed from Tuesday after a rise in Covid- cases.In the past week,  per cent of all positive cases were in city - meaning the planned easing of restrictions there will not go ahead.People have also been advised against all but essential travel.Health secretary Matt Hancock said Leicesters seven-day infection rate was  cases per , - three times that of the next highest city.While the exact area impacted is not expected to be made clear until later, Mr Hancock said Leicester and the surrounding conurbation including Oadby, Birstall and Glenfield would be included.Leicester City Council said there had been  confirmed cases of coronavirus in the city in the past two weeks, and that an indoor testing centre would open on Tuesday at the Highfields Community Centre, with further testing sites planned.Mr Hancock said the measures would be kept under review and would not stay in place any longer than is necessary, adding: Well reviewwe can release any of the measures in two weeks.He told the Commons: These actions are profoundly in the national interest too because its in everyones interests that we control the virus as locally as possible.Local action like this is an important tool in our armoury to deal with outbreaks while we get the country back on its feet.Shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth, who represents Leicester South, said: We were alerted to the situation in Leicester  days ago and now weve got tonight from the Secretary of State the whack-a-mole strategy.Doesnt he agree thatwere as a nation to ease the lockdown smoothly then those areas that do see flare-ups will need greater speed in the response, otherwise we risk no moles getting whacked In the Commons yesterday, Mr Hunt also expressed concerns that antibody testing - which showssomeone has previously had Covid- - was being used on NHS staff.The chairman of the Commons Health and Social Care Select Committee added: Given that it takes up to three weeks for an antibody to show, how can a regime that is meant to stop the asymptomatic transmission of the virus to patients and colleagues before they manage to transmit it possibly work Responding, Mr Hancock said: That regime is the one recommended by clinicians.

Until his recent election the Tories had it easy, confronted by an opposition led by Marxist radical Jeremy Corbyn, whose incompetence was matched by his extremism. But Sir Keir is a far more formidable opponent. He is sharp where Corbyn was dim, pragmatic where Corbyn was dogmatic.Corbyn constantly pandered to the left-wing fringe because he was part of it. But Sir Keir has just proven his toughness by sacking leadership contender Rebecca Long Bailey from the shadow cabinet, after she expressed her support for actor Maxine Peake who used a newspaper interview to peddle conspiracy theories about the Israeli secret service. Corbynista zealots were appalled, moderates celebrated.Furthermore, the dismissal of Long Bailey was just part of a systematic removal of hard Left influence in the party.Much to the fury of left-wing agitators, Starmer yesterday dismissed calls for the police to be “defunded” in the wake of anti-racism protests. Emphasising his past work with the police as Director of Public Prosecutions, he labelled such demands as “nonsense”. Out are Corbyn allies like Jennie Formby, the former General Secretary. And in comes the new chief David Evans, described by admirers as “a stanch opponent” of the hardliners.According to the latest polls, the British public is warming to the new Labour leader. In one survey last week,  per cent expressed a preference for him as Prime Minister, two points ahead of Boris Johnson.Interviewed by the BBC on Sunday, former leader Ed Miliband joined in the cheer-leading, saying: “I never had his approval ratings. I think he has made a great start.”Yet it would be wrong for Labour supporters to be carried away. Sir Keir might be a better leader than Corbyn and Miliband, but those two set the bar very low. The truth is that Labour still has a mountain to climbStarmer is to become Prime Minister. His party is still a deluded rabble, dominated by the worst kind of toxic identity politics, contempt for Britain and student union dogma. Labour is ready for neither victory at the ballot box, nor for the governance of our country.Parallels are sometimes drawn with the situation now and that of , when John Major’s Government was engulfed by the financial crisis of Black Wednesday five months after winning the General Election against Neil Kinnock’s Labour. But the huge dference is that Labour was on the advance, having won a further  seats at the election. Power was almost within the party’s grasp, given that Major only had a tiny majority. But today, Labour is still reeling from the humiliation it suffered last December, when it lost  seats, the biggest loss for any opposition in a century. Moreover, the party is in the wilderness in Scotland. Once Labour’s Caledonian fortress, the party has just one MP there.In total, the Conservatives have no fewer than  more MPs than Labour.That means the job that now faces Starmer is daunting. To be the biggest party, Labour would have to make  net gains from the Tories on a swing of  per cent. Even in the phenomenal landslide of , the swing to Tony Blair was only . per cent.And there is not the slightest sign of that happening at the moment, in spite of all the Government’s recent problems. It is a remarkable fact that the latest two opinion polls both show that the Conservatives, after ten years in office with a very mixed record, are still seven points ahead of Labour.Indeed, there is even a danger that Labour could slip back further. A recent internal review by the party into the disastrous  defeat warned that a further  seats in Labour’s heartlands could be vulnerable on a very small swing to the Tories.The central problem for Starmer is that his party, fixated by fashionable theories of social justice, has alienated its traditional voters. It will take more than the sacking of Rebecca Long Bailey or reassuring words about the police to bring them back. As the sensible former MP Natascha Engel wrote this month, Labour must recognise how far it “has shted from it core. If it wants to sht back again, the party will have to find the right road and prepare itself for a very long walk.” But the journey has barely begun. A party that is willing twice to elect Jeremy Corbyn as its leader is not going to change overnight.In reality, Labour remains gripped by far Left ideology, as shown by its eager embrace of the cultural revolution. Decent, patriotic working-class voters, once the bedrock of the Labour movement, are bound to be repelled by the endless posturing against Britain or the police or family le or even common sense. Despite the change of leadership, the insanity remains. At the weekend, Labour front-bencher Lloyd Russell-Moyle was forced to apologise after disgracefully attacking JK Rowling for using her own experience of domestic sexual assault as “a justication for discriminating” against transgender campaigners.In the same vein, senior Labour MP Dawn Butler recently declared on Good Morning Britain that “a child is born without sex”, a piece of biological nonsense that is about as sane as saying the Earth is flat. The atmosphere of a cult still hangs over the party. The lunatic Left has certainly not gone away, as reflected in MP Richard Burgon’s celebration that teaching unions thwarted “Tory attempts to force schools to re-open. When the row about statues was at its most hysterical, Lisa Nandycalled for imperialist murals to be removed from the magnicent interior of the Foreign Office. Similarly, the Nottingham MP Nadia Whitthome, sounding asshe lived in an occupied country, expressed her thrill at the movement to topple monuments of the past: “I celebrate these acts of resistance.”Sir Keir is not the figure likely to win back the traditional working-class, particularly not in the Red Wall seats of the Midlands and the North. This is, after all, a figure who used to edit a radical magazine called Socialist Futures, who built his reputation as a metropolitan-based human rights lawyer, who presided over the Crown Prosecution Service when it gained notoriety for its failure to take a tough stance on crime, and who battled ferociously for a second referendum on Brexit. For all the ordinariness of his upbringing as the son of a toolmaker and a nurse, he is now the personication of the North London liberal elite. Moreover, he lacks both authority and charisma. With his strangulated vowels and permanently anxious expression, he frequently sounds like a teacher who is surprised at this promotion to be head of department.The political landscape could have changed dramatically by , when the next election is due. Britain may have enjoyed a strong economic recovery. The culture war may have petered out. Public services may have been reformed. Mrs Thatcher was in desperate trouble in , battered by riots and rising unemployment. Two years later she won a landslide. It is perfectly possible that Boris Johnson could enjoy the same fate – especiallyLabour fails to change.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The surplus skin on Aryas arms in particular has left him embarrassed and he tries to hide it with long shirtsleeves. He weighed lbsat his heaviest, at the age of , and struggled to do simple activities like walk down the road to school or even take a bath.Arya was once so obese he was unable to move from his bed, let alone play with his friends.The lad baffled doctors nearly five years ago when footage of him playing in a water tank to cool his body emerged from the small village of Cipurwasari in Indonesias West Java province.And his parents Rokayah Somantri, , and Ade Somantri, , were left in despair as he was missing out on school because it was impossible for him to get there.So, he underwent a gastric bypass to help start losing weight.Arya also followed a stricter diet and undertook rigorous exercise - at one stage walking three miles every day and playing badminton with his pals.The teen has become a regular gymgoer, where hes been trained by Indonesian bodybuilder Ade Rai and a team of health professionals.He told Tribun News that Arya had changed his eating habits as he used to enjoy sweet drinks, and tucked into instant processed foods - wolfing down two plates of meatballs in one sitting.Rai said the boy was a success story because of Aryas own and his familys behaviour patterns and the medical support that Arya has received so far.He explained his role was to motivate the boy take better care of himself, and reduce weight in a healthy way to stop him from developing a chronic disease or dying a premature death.Hopefully the Arya Permana story can be a valuable lesson for us all.And I hope that children in Indonesia have parents and families who are able to positively influence them so they are willing to imitate healthy behaviour, he added.Video of him in the gym has racked up about , views on Rai’s Instagram.Alexander Gomes joined scores of viewers to praise the lad, commenting: Good job sir!Others applauded his willpower, especially as he is still to undergo more surgery to remove excess skin after shedding kg.Despite the obvious health benefits, the teen is still struggling with his surplus skin and is keen to undergo more operations to make him feel more comfortable.Its also meant that when he has participated in sports the excess skin rubs and irritates him.

Moreover, they have uncovered how emulated coughs can travel noticeably farther than the currently recommended six-foot distancing guideline.Their research outlines the procedure for setting up simple visualisation experiments using easily available materials, which may help healthcare professionals, medical researchers, and manufacturers in assessing the effectiveness of face masks and other personal protective equipment qualitatively.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And by the way, unlike everyone  in the media, I mean that as a positive thing.A £ billion post-Covid cash injection will add to the £ billion already granted to the NHS, £ billion to education and, of course, £ billion to infrastructureWhile these plans were broadly spelt out in the Tory election manesto, theyre being sped up thanks to the coronavirus crisis which has seen the economy on a clf edge but provided the ability to borrow big with low interest rates.Thats why the PM is right when he said: We must use this moment now - this interval - to plan our response.There was the right degree of humility regarding certain aspects of the corona response, with an admittance that parts of government had responded so sluggishly it was like a recurring bad dream.There was also a brief nod to his predecessors like David Cameron and George Osbourne. Such vast spending, he said, is only available to him because of the prudent financial management of the past decade.But we can all let out a sigh of relief at his insistence there will not be ato dreaded austerity because the world has moved on since .Pleasingly, Boris made it clear what side of the fence he is on when it comes to the toxic culture wars when he said: I dont believe in tearing people down anymore than I believe in tearing down statues that are part of our heritage, let alone a statue of our greatest wartime leader. I believe in building people up.But he needs to follow his instinct and cut taxes to spark the economy too.Overall this mission to unite and level up the country should be embraced by those on all sides of politics.The time for talk is over now and the government is going to get on and do it.That is what Boris will be judged on in the end.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The authors of the study said the ability of the new virus - dubbed G EA HN - to adapt would raise concerns for the possible generation of pandemic viruses.Asked about the paper at a briefing in Geneva today, WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier said: “We will read carefully the paper to understand what is new.“It also highlights we cannot let our guard down on influenza and need to be vigilant and continue surveillance even in the coronavirus pandemic.”The research laid out in the paper was conducted between  and , when scientists took , nasal swabs from pigs in abattoirs across ten Chinese provinces and one veterinary hospital. From the swabs, they identied  dferent swine flu viruses, one of which was G EA HN, later found to be highly infectious. Part of the reason it is such a concern is that the immunity humans build up to regular seasonal flu does not appear to provide any immunity from G EA HN. A total of . percent of abattoir workers were later found to have the antibodies gained following exposure to the new virus - as were . percent of the general population. The finding means the virus can already pass to humans from animals, but it is not yet known whether it can be passed between humans.The Spanish flu that killed tens of millions during the  pandemic is believed to have been transmitted from pigs to humans in America and then spread to a nearby army camp. Troops at the camp later shipped out to France to fight in World War One, and the disease began to spread throughout Europe. Echoing the WHO, Prof Kin-Chow Chang of the University of Nottingham told the BBC: Right now we are distracted with coronavirus and rightly so.But we must not lose sight of potentially dangerous new viruses.Asked about the new virus today, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry said has been paying close attention to its development.The Chinese government has faced criticism over its handling of the coronavirus pandemic, with widespread reports of an attempted cover-up in the outbreaks earliest stages.

He should have known the rules better than anyone .“If further action is needed then of course we are willing to take it.”He said the city had younger people who are less likely to comply with lockdown restrictions, a large ethnic minority population, multi-generational households and large food processing and garment industries. The Conservative MP told BBC Radio  Live that the garment industry should have been in lockdown, but workers had carried on. Mr Bridgen added: What we have seen in Leicester is a perfect storm really, you have got a city which has generally got younger people living in it. We know younger people have been less likely to comply with lockdown rules. We have got the biggest ethnic minority population of any city, so you have multi-generational households where the young people have probably been out socialising in breach of the lockdown. On top of that there is quite a substantial food processing industry. And on top of that you have got a very large garment industry which should have locked down which my sources are telling me have worked for internet retailers who have been very busy during the lockdown and they have carried on working as well.Councillor Rashmikant Joshi said his North Evington ward had the highest number of new cases - accounting for  of the more than  infections.A huge block party had only just been held in the area last weekend.And according to the  Census, Leicesters houses are the most overcrowded.Councillor Joshi said: We have a lot of inter-generational households, where young people live with their grandparents.

If I was to be more blunt, I would say that we’ll all be six foot under before it’s even half built at this glacial rate of progress. Boris was at pains to tell us he’s no communist. I think we knew that. What we discovered is that he’s no Franklin D Roosevelt either. President Roosevelt is famous for unlocking mega-bucks to lt America out of the Great Depression in the s. Our Prime Minister’s wallet, by contrast, is a bit thinner. While Roosevelt built the Hoover Dam, Johnson promised some bridge repairs in Sandwell. To be fair, there was some good news for Greater Manchester in the speech. We were give £m to clean up brownfield sites and build more homes on them. This will allow us to make some further inroads into tackling the housing crisis, although much more is needed. I was also pleased to hear the £ billion commitment to upgrade school buildings - though it didn’t escape my notice that it came almost  years to the day since Michael Gove scrapped Labour’s £ billion Building Schools for the Future programme. What the North of England needs more than anything is investment in our Victorian rail infrastructure which is responsible for the timetable chaos of recent years.  So we welcome the Prime Minister’s recognition of the “rail bottleneck” in Manchester City centre in his speech. But we’re not sure about his solution. We already have a plan in place to build two new s at Manchester Piccadilly to solve it. Instead of giving that the green light, the PM chose to allocate £m to develop an alternative plan. How does that fit with his much-vaunted Project Speed  Overall, and not for the first time with this Government, the hype before the speech overshadowed the real thing. There are only a certain number of times that you can promise to dual the A before people begin to switch off. As I said on Monday, “levelling up” needs to be about skin and bone as well as concrete and steel. People are crying out for help now and it would helpthe PM acknowledged this before promising any more shiny projects in the dim and distant future. One of the statistics which haunts me from this crisis was the Unison survey of care workers in the North West. It found % said they feared they wouldn’t be paidthey needed to self-isolate. Just think about that. We have a care service in England which has such poor employment conditions that it forces people to stay in work evenare ill. If the PM had started his speech by promising that, from now on, the heroes who work in our care homes looking after our relatives will get paid at least the same as a nurse, then I think the whole country would have risen to applaud him.

But they then also had to wait up to five weeks for their pension to be paid. After the situation was raised by cross-party MPs, campaigners say claimants started being given a one-off payment to bridge the gap.  That transition payment is now being put on a legal footing. From November , all Universal Credit claims will be automatically extended for the full monthly assessment period in which people hit pension age. The move is expected to benefit , people who reach pension age in the next five years. They will gain an average of £ each, the government said. Legislation was announced this week almost four months after ministers first promised to act. The reform is a victory for Alyn and Deeside MP Mark Tami who raised the problem. A campaign was also backed by  MPs from Labour, Lib Dem, SNP, Plaid Cymru, the Greens and DUP after a gap in the law was spotted by a local Citizens Advice office in Flintshire. The Citizens Advice staff said pensioners were risking being left without money for a long period, due to the way Universal Credit and the New State Pension are each paid.Mr Tami said: I am proud to have been able to lead this campaign on a very obscure and technical bit of the benefit system, but which pushed too many older people into poverty.

Itaposs important we lay the foundations for a country where everyone has the opportunity to succeed.Except the £bn is over  years, and for  projects. So thataposs  schools a year, at £m each, even though in  a new primary cost around £m.Between  and , the Tories opened  aposfree schoolsapos, costing £.bn. So that was  schools a year, at an average of £.m each. A much better rate ofthan we are now offered, even though around £m of it went on lawyers.Between  and , the Building Schools for the Future programme rebuilt or refurbished  schools. It was going to invest £bn over  years and rebuild every secondary in the country. Its flaws - a lack of big-project expertise in local councils, PFI fees, and the fact it was a Labour idea - meant the Tories cancelled it. BSF was the biggest school building programme since the Victorian one, which had put a primary school in almost every town and village in the country. Have you spotted the pattern  We have spent an ever-decreasing proportion of our cash on schools, for more than a century.Last year it was revealed weaposll need , new classrooms for a .% increase in primary pupils by . For Johnsonaposs plan to meet that demand, the first  schools he promises next year would need to have , classrooms - each.The National Audit Office says our , primary, middle and secondary state schools need a total of £.bn of repairs - just repairs - but the PM has offered them £m for crumbling buildings. Thataposs % of whataposs needed, or £, per school. With an average primary school refurbishment cost of £, per square metre, that would pay for .sq metres. Or about half a classroom.BSF built schools, slowly, in areas where they were wanted. Free schools has put them, quicker, where they are not needed. A report by the Education Policy Institute last year found far fewer of them being opened in hampered areas. And during lockdown, it is children in those places which have suffered most, had least access to the technology needed to keep up, and now need the most help. To recap, class: the PM has promised £bn over  years for  schools which will be the most expensive, and biggest, ever built. He is also offering % of the repairs we need to existing schools, which still have to find room for .% more pupils in the next  years.He has not mentioned where he is going to get this money from, whether itaposll be raised from taxation, borrowing, or provided by private finance.We do know, however, that it is only % of the £.bn funding by  that he promised in his election manesto just  months ago. His forest of magic money trees seems to have developed a series case of cash dieback.Johnson is threatening to fine parentsthey do not send children into schools where % of repairs will not be carried out, and pupil numbers will grow but classrooms will not. Heaposs cajoling voters with headlines about a schools building programme which would more accurately be described as a £bn cut on just one of the impossible promises he made to voters. Add that all up, and you have a Prime Minister, and a government, that are so antithetical to logic, history, and basic mathematics that they should be kept as far away from the state school system, pupils and parents, as humanly possible. I suggest we send him back to Eton, and throw away the key. Itaposs cheaper than letting him loose, and perhaps its teachers will realise that priding themselves on producing Prime Ministers means that,a pupil is neither great or good, they shouldnapost be allowed to graduate.

From today non-essential shops in Leicester must close all over again and schools will shut their doors from Thursday. As the rest of England prepares to ease restrictions from July , the reopening of pubs and hairdressers in the city has been cancelled because of rising cases. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Leicesteraposs seven-day infection rate is  cases per ,, which is three times higher than the next highest city. A dedicated walk-in centre, extra funding and support, and Covid-secure workplaces have been announced by Downing Street in an effort to fight the virus. Here is a rundown of how the unprecedented local lockdown will work. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.    What are the local lockdown measures in Leicester  Non-essential shops which opened on June  must shut from Tuesday onwards in Leicester. That includes clothes shops, toy shops and shoe shops. It means many retail firms in Leicester must not open their doors on Tuesday morning - despite the lockdown coming with just hours to spare, after they closed up for the night. Primary schools which opened to some pupils from June  must once again close in Leicester, to all but the most vulnerable or children of key workers, from this Thursday.  Pubs, restaurants, hotels, hairdressers and more in the city will not reopen as in the rest of England on July . And shielding for vulnerable people will not be eased in Leicester when it is in the rest of England on July . People in Leicester must once again “stay at home as much as you can” and cease non-essential travel. So is the law now dferent in Leicester to the rest of England  Not yet, but it will be soon. The Department of Health and Social Care is expected to publish a law enacting the measures in the coming days. It is likely to be similar to the laws that enforced lockdown in the rest of England.  It’s not yet confirmedpeople will be hit with fines of £ for breaching the tighter local lockdown. But Mr Hancock said the police would be enforcing the new rules where necessary. Downing Street confirmed regulations will force the closure of non-essential shops and stop the wider reopening of pubs, hotels and restaurants in the city. Will there be roadblocks to enforce it  Matt Hancock did not mention roadblocks in his statement and No indicated they were not the priority. People have been told to stay at home and make non-essential travel only, but the regulations will not impose a legal travel ban - yet. And the Mayor of Leicester said roadblocks would be wholly impractical. However, the Health Secretary also warned: We recommend against all but essential travel to, from and within Leicester. If people continue to travel in and out of the city, the government has not explicitly ruled out such checks in future.  The drastic measures also apply to surrounding areas including Oadby, Birstall and Glenfield. Leicestershire County Council public health bosses have been charged with drawing up areas to fall under the local lockdown. How long will the local lockdown last  It looks like it will last at least two weeks. The local measures have no fixed end date and will be reviewed for the first time in two weeksapos time. Could there be more local lockdowns     Yes, it’s possible. Boris Johnson promised a “whack-a-mole” approach to local outbreaks and Mr Hancock said there could be “local lockdowns”. But the government has also been accused of responding too slowly to Leicester, where concerns were raised weeks ago. Why Leicester  Matt Hancock revealed % of all positive cases in the country over the past week have been in Leicester. He said the  day infection rate in the city is  cases per k people - three times higher than the next highest city. And there are six to  admissions to hospital a day rather than one a day at other trusts.  Sources have told the Mirror meat processing plants and gatherings around takeaways have come under the spotlight as a possible source of the outbreak. And Labour’s Leicester MP Jon Ashworth pinpointed high poverty and a large BAME population who are at greater risk. What support will the city get  Businesses who have used the furlough scheme already can aposre-furloughapos members of staff from July ,they have to shut down during the local lockdown. The city - which has already had four mobile testing units sent in - will now receive further testing capability including a walk-in centre. There will also be extra funding for Leicester and Leicestershire councils for public information campaigns, including translations in “appropriate languages”.  Nick Rushton, leader of Leicestershire County Council, said: “Protecting residents is our main concern and we’re working closely with Leicester City Council and the Government to bring down the number of cases. “Clearly coronavirus does not adhere to lines on a map. And although county rates are below the national and regional averages, we can’t be complacent and it makes sense to step up restrictions in areas closer to the city. “This is the first localised lockdown on this scale and undoubtedly there will be issues to iron out.

A study of , UK motorists found one in  are clueless about whether they are covered for driving their car for business use, have windscreen cover orthey can drive other vehicles. And although  per cent leave the detail to their partner, chances are they havenapost read the small print. Nearly a third wouldnapost know what to do for insurance purposesthey were involved in an accident. And more than one in  have even forgotten who their car insurance is with. Others have just let it renew automatically for so long, they havenapost had cause to investigate deeply. Jason Smith, CEO of MoneyExpert, which commissioned the research, said: Obviously, itaposs important to know exactly what your car insurance actually covers. If you only have third-party insurance, for example, you could be left with a nasty surprise after an accident leaves your car needing expensive repairs. But there are other bits of small print people donapost pay enough attention to - like whether the car is used for commuting or social purposes, or where itaposs parked overnight.  MoneyExpert  have created an online guide on how to claim on your car insurance after the study also found three in  drivers admitted they wouldnapost know what to dothey had to make a claim. The study also found one in five motorists donapost know how much their insurance costs them each year. Just under a quarter are also happy to let their car insurance renew automatically each year, without checking other providers. Although  per cent donapost even know when their policy is due for renewal.  While four in  said they aposcanapost be botheredapos to shop around, a fth simply expect their premium to automatically go down each year - eventhey donapost check. Another  per cent think itaposs too much hassle to change providers when one term ends and another is due to begin. It also emerged the most common cause of insurance claims is major vehicle damage, from things like car collisions. Just under five per cent have had a car stolen, and one in  have used their insurance policy to repair a cracked windshield. But a third admitted they have had an occasion where they didnapost make a claim to their insurers after their car was damaged - with  per cent of those saying it wasnapost worth the paperwork. Another  per cent found the excess on their policy would have cost more than just having the damage repaired themselves.  And  per cent were eager to protect their no-claims bonus, according to the OnePoll research. A huge  per cent of drivers, however, have found themselves using their car less than usual since lockdown and social distancing measures were introduced. As a result, one in five have considered changing their insurance policy.

Michael Alcorn, , of Accrington, Lancashire, made the comment after he was sentenced on Tuesday at Preston Crown Court for a string of burglaries over two days in April. Alcorn was on licence at the time from a nine-year jail sentence for burglary in  when he posed as a builder to con his way into the home of an -year-old severe dementia sufferer and stole cash.Before his outburst on videolink from prison the court heard Alcorn had contracted coronavirus while on remand and that had more of a salutary affect on him than any of the numerous jail terms he had received for a total of  previous convictions for  offences.His barrister Andrea Lock said: He was very poorly and tells me he thought it might be his fate that he would die in custody. He said that had given him more pause for a rethink than anything before. Alcorn pleaded guilty to five burglaries on April  and  at homes in Whitworth, Rossendale, Helmshore and Haslingden, and stole cash from two of the addresses. He also admitted breaching an anti-social behaviour imposed in  which bans him from approaching homes to offer services. The daughter of one of his latest victims, an -year-old man with limited mobility, branded Alcorn a lowle by targeting a vulnerable, old man who has never hurt anyone in his le. The son of another victim, a -year-old woman who lives alone and requires regular care visits, said of Alcorn: The man is a scumbag. Sentencing, Judge Brown, the Honorary Recorder of Preston, told the defendant: You are a person who is prepared to prey on those least able to resist. At a time when the Covid- crisis was close to its highest peak these were elderly and extremely vulnerable people who no doubt had been instructed by the Government that they fell into the special category of people who needed to self-isolate for their own protection.

Spider webs and thick layers of dust and grime cover surfaces and possessions, a womanaposs dressing gown hangs on the back of a door and childrenaposs toys and teddy bears sit in an upstairs room. A Harrogate-based urban explorer who snapped these pictures said the house is stuck in a time warp - and it has a tragic back story. Have you been affected by this story  Email webnews@mirror. It is said the property belonged to a -year-old woman who died alone inside the house in .Her possessions were never cleared out after the property was inherited by her son who is believed to live overseas, said the young explorer, who runs a Facebook page called Lost Places  Forgotten Faces. He said the time capsule is filled with old artacts, family photos, wedding albums, calendars and newspapers that were purchased or delivered shortly before the owneraposs death, and others from the s.In the bathroom,  teeth, toothbrushes, razors and a toy boat rest above a sink, clothes are piled in a hamper, and medication and lotions are still in a cabinet. The toilet and bathtub are covered in grime. Black and white photos, postcards and other belongings are scattered on a bed in a bedroom, where the floor is also covered with possessions and there is graffiti on a wall. Another bedroom photo shows an old record player, a poster of singer Kate Bush and piles of decades-old magazines. Tins of food and bottles of condiments still sit on shelves, there are empty bottles of cognac, an old TV rests on a desk and a three wheel rollator that the woman used to get around is in the kitchen. An old rotary phone hangs on a living room wall and eyeglasses lay on a desk with books, letters that arrived in the post and more photos and postcards.A North Yorkshire Police Athletics Association diary from  has been placed on top of a newspaper from March . A souvenir edition of a newspaper insert, dated February , , commemorates the death of Winston Churchill a week after his death. A History of Royal Weddings calendar from  features photos of Prince Charles and Princess Diana, The explore, who asked not to be named, told : The small house has not been lived in since , as indicated by the most recently dated newspapers.A woman lived there alone after her husband died. Documents within the house indicate she died alone in the house in , aged only . The house is a time capsule of old artacts, ornaments, photographs, wedding albums, calendars, newspapers. Her clothes are still hanging up in her wardrobe, her dressing gown is still on the back of the door, and her  teeth remain resting above the decaying sink.  There are childrenaposs toys and teddies upstairs, which tells me that maybe her grandchildren would once come and visit her. There are also a number of empty vintage cognac bottles found throughout, so itaposs fair to say she enjoyed a tipple once in a while. The explorer added: The house had been set up with assisted living handles to help her get around. The stairs leading to the upper floor were worryingly steep, even for me, so I could only imagine the struggle she would have getting up there.  She evidently ended her le by living only downstairs as a bed had been assembled to the rear of the dining room. She died in bed alone next to her walker. Seeing everything left behind, a letime of possessions now rendered meaningless, made me feel so sad. Apparently, her only son lives abroad and after attending her funeral in , he inherited the house but never bothered to clear out her belongings and they have since remained in a time warp.  His inheritance has subsequently become a battered relic of a once family home. The explorer, who is in his s, has been photographing abandoned places since November last year. He visited this home with his partner earlier in June. He said: What hit me straight away, literally, was a blanket of old cobwebs that have collected over years of abandonment. I had to fight my way through them just to get around inside the house.

The war hero is auctioning the ct gold collectors’ item to help pay for a Royal British Legion foodbank operation. Maj Hunter, , and his team of fellow veterans launched the service during the lockdown. He said: “I am selling off the ring because I believe possessions aren’t everything. It’s the memories that count every time. “The pandemic has left many people isolated and vulnerable. And the knock-on effects will leave an awful lot of people short of food and other supplies. “The foodbank has been a huge success and has been extremely satisfying... We needed more funds to boost the process of getting supplies to people. “During and after my time as a soldier I’ve witnessed how much people suffer in poverty-stricken regions.

New figures show  cities or counties across England are seeing a fresh rise in lab-confirmed cases, meaning infections are rising in almost one in four cities and counties. Doncaster, second behind Leicester, is among the places that have seen a worrying spike. Derbyshire is one of the counties where cases are higher than other regions. Leicesteraposs flare-up means it will not emerge from parts of lockdown as swtly as the rest of England on July , when pubs, restaurants, hairdresses and other non-essential businesses will reopen. Residents have been told to stay at home, with schools and shops to shut this week with the city being one of the countryaposs Covid- epicentres. Public health officials are keeping an eye on Doncaster and other areas that have seen a signicant increase in cases in recent weeks as England gradually emerged from its Covid- lockdown with the reopening of schools and easing of other restrictions. In Leicester there was an unusually high incidence of coronavirus in children, the Health Secretary has said. Matt Hancock told BBC Breakfast on Tuesday that while work was still being done to understand why Leicester had been so badly affected by the outbreak, extra testing had found under-s testing positive for the virus.Lab-confirmed cases in Leicester have been rising week-on-week, from  between June - to  in the week of June -. Mr Hancock said the cityaposs seven-day infection rate was  cases per ,. Leicester City Council said it had seen  confirmed cases of Covid- in the past two weeks. The Health Secretary said that of course the Government was looking at similar places but said the outbreak in Leicester was very signicantly worse than the next worst-hit place. These  areas ranked behind Leicester, which had the highest number of new lab-confirmed cases, according to the latest available data from Public Health England. Many are urban, densely populated and ethnically erse areas. Five are in London and two are in Kent. Doncaster, South Yorkshire New cases between June -:  New cases between June -:  Total cases:  Derbyshire June -:  June -:  Total: , Hammersmith and Fulham, west London June -:  June -:  Total:   Ealing, west London Medway, Kent June -:  June -:  Total:  Ealing, west London June -:  June -:  Total: ,  Hounslow, west London June -:  June -:  Total:   Thanet, Kent June -:  June -:  Total: Westminster, central London June -:  June -:  Total:  Brent, north-west London June -:  June -:  Total: , Staffordshire Moorlands June -:  June -:  Total:   Speaking to BBC Breakfast earlier on Tuesday, Mr Hancock said there was an unusually high incidence of coronavirus in children in Leicester. He said that even though children are less likely to get ill from the disease, the decision to shut the cityaposs schools was made to try to halt further transmissions.  Mr Hancock added: We have sent in a lot of extra testing into Leicester over the last  days or so and one of the things we have found is that there are under-s who have tested positive and therefore, because children can transmit the disease - even though they are highly unlikely to get ill from the disease - we think the safest thing to do is close the schools. The reason I said what I did last night about Leicester is that it is an unusually high incidence in children in Leicester. Mr Hancock also said that the lockdown had been introduced in Leicester after targeted action at factories and workplaces had failed. He added: We have been monitoring it incredibly closely, we have put in extra testing units, some of the schools in Leicester were closed already. We also went into some of the factories and workplaces where there was an outbreak and we put in place measures. These sort of much more targeted measures have worked in other outbreaks. So weaposve been taking this highly localised approach, but unfortunately that targeted action wasnapost working in Leicester and thataposs why we have taken this much broader measure. When asked about possible causes such as poverty, higher ethnic ersity, language dficulties and higher-density housing, Mr Hancock said they were familiar to him.He added: We are still doing the work to understand exactly why the outbreak has been so bad in Leicester. But lots of the reasons that you mentioned just then are familiar to me and people will find them intuitive. North West Leicestershire MP Andrew Bridgen said that Leicester was a perfect storm of a city with younger people who are less likely to comply with lockdown restrictions, a large ethnic minority population, multi-generational households and large food processing and garment industries. The Conservative MP told BBC Radio  Live that the garment industry should have been in lockdown, but workers had carried on.Mr Bridgen added: What we have seen in Leicester is a perfect storm really, you have got a city which has generally got younger people living in it. We know younger people have been less likely to comply with lockdown rules. We have got the biggest ethnic minority population of any city, so you have multi-generational households where the young people have probably been out socialising in breach of the lockdown. On top of that there is quite a substantial food processing industry. And on top of that you have got a very large garment industry which should have locked down which my sources are telling me have worked for internet retailers who have been very busy during the lockdown and they have carried on working as well.

Heatwaves far more intense than recent weeksapos scorchers could become ordinary in the UK by the end of the century, according to scientists.The Met Office has issued a call to action on greenhouse gas emissions - warning that Brits could otherwise face increasingly unbearable heat in cycles of every three to four years.New research says the south-east of the UK would face the hottest temperatures by the end of this century. This would tip the mercury in southern regions from London, to Cornwall, Dorset and south Wales as baking hot as Spain at the height of summer.  Climate scientists have warned for decades of the potential for extreme deadly weather events to become increasingly common,Governments globally face pressure to clamp down on emissions and pursue sustainable energy sources and food production systems. Climate change caused by human activity is already pushing the mercury to new record highs in Britain according to the national forecaster, with .C in Cambridge in July  the highest temperature ever recorded in the UK. Only last Thursday the UK recorded its hottest day of  yet, with Brits sweating of highs of up to C on a June day.Englandaposs beaches erupted into chaos in the coronavirus lockdown heatwave, as overcrowding and disorder saw major incidents declared at beaches including Bournemouth.The new  records prompt the question of whether C heat is on the horizon for the UK, with potentially deadly heatwaves becoming more regular.  Researchers at the Met Office Hadley Centre have used a detailed local-scale dataset based on observations to assess the likelihood of future hot spells in the face of high or medium levels of greenhouse gas emissions. Climate change, driven by greenhouse gas emissions from activities such as burning fossil fuels which heat up the planet, has put the UK on a course to see extremes that would be highly unlikely under a natural climate, the scientists said. Currently the chances of temperatures reaching C anywhere in the UK are extremely low.  Butemissions continue at high levels, worsening climate change, the UK could see days with C heat every three to four years on average by , a study published in the journal Nature Communications and released today has found. Temperatures exceeding C currently occur once every five years on average in the UK, but that could rise to every other year with high emissions. The scientists saidthe world takes action on emissions in line with commitments in the international Paris Agreement to limit temperature rises to .C or C above pre-industrial levels, the risk of extreme heat would be much lower.  Which parts of the UK would be hottest  The south-east of the UK is more likely to see C temperatures, while C temperatures are becoming increasingly common in the region. But the study also found that areas in the north, where it is extremely unlikely to see days that reach C, may exceed that temperature at least once a decade. Lead author Dr Nikolaos Christidis said: We found that the likelihood of extremely hot days in the UK has been increasing and will continue to do so during the course of the century, with the most extreme temperatures expected to be observed in the south-east of England.  Climate change has already influenced the likelihood of temperature extremes in the UK. The chances of seeing C days in the UK could be as much as  times more likely in the current climate than under a natural climate unaffected by human influence. The likelihood of exceeding C anywhere in the UK in a given year has also been rapidly increasing, and, without curbing of greenhouse gas emissions, such extremes could be taking place every few years in the climate of .

The -year-old explained that her sister asked her to be one of her bridesmaids at her wedding in a few months time. As she had never been to a wedding before she was thrilled to be a part of it. When it came to bridesmaid dress shopping, the bride picked out a gorgeous pinky red colour with ruffles on the top for her bridesmaid dress.

As a result, the other bridesmaids decided to pull out until the bride apologises and agrees to let her sister be a bridesmaid again.

The virologist, who is based in Wuhan, was out of the city at a conference when she received a call telling her to get back to her lab immediately. Two hospital patients had an unusual type of pneumonia and the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention needed Zhengliaposs expertise amid fears this new strain of the virus could be a deadly risk to public health. Her director told her to drop whatever you are doing and deal with it now and she was immediately on a train back to the lab in Wuhan.These were the first known cases of coronavirus and for two months Zhengli barely left her lab, working round the clock to learn all she could about Covid-. Within days she and her team had discovered the  coronavirus  gene sequence but they were then aposmuzzledapos from revealing the truth about her incredible discovery in the fight against Covid-.This fuelled fears of a cover up by the Chinese authorities, who had failed to share information or issue warnings early on. Ulitmately they also failed to contain a virus that emerged in Wuhan and then spread around the world, leading to hundreds of thousands of deaths.Chinese journalist Gao Yu said he spoke to Shi during his incarceration in Wuhan, which was locked down for more than two months, and she told him her findings were hushed up, the Mail on Sunday reported.The journalist explained: We learned later her institute finished gene-sequencing and related tests as early as January  but was muzzled. The information about gene sequencing wasnapost made public until a week later. She identied it as a novel coronavirus and within three days had completed its gene sequencing, finding that it was  per cent identical to a virus found in horseshoe bats in Yunnan, a process which can take monthsnot years. Amplying the genetic material of the virus using the polymerase chain reaction technique Zhengli and her team found five of the infected patients had the same genetic sequences found in all coronaviruses. But even after her incredible disocvery, there was one horrying fear gnawing away at Zhengli - had the virus somehow been leaked from her lab. In the  years she had been working with bats, Zhengli had found the subtropical areas of China posed the biggest risk for the coronavirus being transmitted from animals to human - not the centre of the country where Wuhan is located. She said: I had never expected this kind of thing to happen in Wuhan, in central China. I remember thinking aposcould they have come from our lab apos Over the next few worrying days it emerged it did not seem to be a leak and the virus had likely had several previous, small, outbreaks before emerging in Wuhan at one of the cityaposs controversial wildle markets. Zhengli wrote on Chinese social media in February: I guarantee with my le that the virus has nothing to do with my lab. Animals are sold, slaughtered and skinned, as customers browse the stalls in the markets, which have now been closed in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. It would also seem there had been just one point where the virus had passed from animals to human and had then spread through human to human contact - until it covered the world. They sell a range of creatures, such as bats, civets, pangolins, badgers and crocodiles, although Zhengli and her team believe the virus came directly from the bats themselves. Almost two months after the first cases of the virus emerged in Wuhan, China permanently banned wildle consumption and trade. It is estimated this will forced million people out of work and cost the Chinese economy about £billion. For Zhengli the disocvery of the coronavirus gene sequence is the culmination of more than  years work, which has made her one of the worldaposs leading scientists in her field. Zhengli is one of the worldaposs top researchers on coronaviruses and has discovered dozens of deadly SARS-like viruses in bat caves. Her work started in the wake of SARS, which first emerged in  and killed thousands. Since  there have been no known cases of the virus. She studied samples taken from some of the first people to become infected with the new and then-mysterious respiratory illness in China in December and found it was similar to SARS. But it did start a global push to learn more about coronaviruses and Zhengli was part of the early teams who travelled to remote locations to study bats in caves. For months, work on the epedition was relentless with the team waking at dusk to work ovrnight when the bats had left the caves to hunt for food. They would collect blood, saliva and fecal swabs before grabbing a few hours sleep only tothe following morning to collect urine. For weeks there was no sign of coronavirus in the DNA that had been collected. Zhengli was heartbroken. She said: Eight months of hard work seemed to have gone down the drain. We thought coronaviruses probably did not like Chinese bats. It was as the team were about tohome that they were thrown a leline by another lab, who gave them a diagnostic kit for testing antibodies produced by people with SARS. Admitting she didnapost have high hopes it would work, Zhengli said she had nothing to lose by testing the samples and the results were incredible and was a turning project for the scheme. Antibodies against SARS were found in three species of horseshoe bats, which meant they were one step closer to finding the genetic code.  After testing a huge number of sites, the team then narrowed their search down to the outskirts of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan and for the next five years they targeted their research on that area. One cave seem to be the SARS source and with the high volume of bats meant there was a risk new strains of a coronavirus could evolve from there. They also found that the virus could spread to those who werenapost directly handling the animals. People living in a nearby village had seen bats flying around. Six people had suffered from symptoms similar to SARS. And as humans increasingly encroach on areas that have previously been the domain of the natural world, Zhengli fears the risk of infections spreading also go up.  This coupled with the movement of wildle and livestock around the world, along with increased long-haul travel, creates conditions perfect for the potential spread of a pandemic Last year Zhengli and her team published a study warning of the potential of a bat-borne pandemic. Little did they know just  months later their doomsday predictions would come true. Bats are believed to have responsible for six outbreaks of coronaviruses, including the Covid- pandemic, but experts insist problems only occur when people come into contact with the creatures themselves. Zhengli describes the Wuhan outbreak as a wake-up call for the world and work is now taking place around the globe to find a way to prevent another pandemic.

The video was filmed from an eyewitness at a nearby hotel at Acapulco beach in Mexico. They say the apparent sewage outbreak lasted  minutes, with the footage appearing to show a vile black liquid running down the beach and into the sea. The eyewitness told Reuters: “The constant outflow of black water lasted approximately  minutes, which came with a lot of pressure. “They were very stinking waters, they made me nauseous”. The footage sparked outrage on social media.  One person tweeted: Please share this disgusting video with your followers and tag people, celebrities, influencers and news media who need to see this and as dumping sewage black water into #Acapulco contaminating the water  killing marine le is NOT OKAY AND MUST BE STOPPED NOW! Another said: Thousands of gallons of disgusting raw sewage going into Acapulco Bay. Killing beautul marine le, I literally hate to see it . When people pollute the ocean, we are all affected. #savethereef  Enjoy your swimming! another said. That is raw sewage being dumped in to Acapulco Bay. Sadly, this happens all too often.But, according to the New York Post, the Mexican state of Guerrero denied on Facebook that the water was part of the drainage system or a rupture of a sewage tank.The Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources is investigating the spill, according to Reuters. Meanwhile a petition has been started which calls for the banning of dumping sewage onto beaches.The campaign reads: I am going to cut right to the point, I care not only because this is a tourist attraction, it is also a place where local residents can come whenever they please. They can have a relaxing day at the beach, hangout with their families, or even have some alone time with their signicant others.  The thing is they cannot do that when there is raw sewage contaminating the bay.

German researcher Adrian Zenz alleges that Beijingaposs policies in Xinjiang met one of the UN genocide criteria, sparking outrage at Chinaaposs alleged shocking and disturbing policies. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo hit out at the country after the report was published, adding the findings were consistent with decades of Chinese Communist Party practices that demonstrate an utter disregard for the sanctity of human le and basic human dignity. We call on the Chinese Communist Party to immediately end these horric practices and ask all nations to join the United States in demanding an end to these dehumanizing abuses, he said. In his report, published by the Washington-based Jamestown Foundation think tank, Zenz said his findings represented the strongest evidence yet that Beijing was carrying out genocide of Muslims. Zenz said analysis of Chinese government documents showed natural population growth in Xinjiang had fallen dramatically. In its two largest Uighur Muslim prefectures, growth rates fell by an enormous % between  and  and further again in . China has strongly denied the allegations in the report.  Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, saying that some institutions are bent on cooking up disinformation on Xinjiang-related issues. Their allegations are simply groundless and . Documents from  revealed plans for a campaign of mass female sterilization targeting % and % of all married women of childbearing age in two Uighur counties, Zenz says. The campaign, he said, likely aimed to sterilize rural minority women with three or more children, as well as some with two children - equivalent to at least % of all women of childbearing age.

It was almost near completion before lockdown – I was out on a site visit and was very impressed with what I saw then.“The anticipation is that it will be about  weeks, so around four months to complete the works.“There are hurdles to be reached and overcome, in terms of approval processes and handing over the keys to Scotrail to operate the station, but it’s hoped that by that time Kintore will be operating as a station.“There were plans to get schoolkids or a steam train involved in an opening event, but all that is secondary to getting the project complete.”The new station at Kintore is part of the Aberdeen-Inverness Improvement Project, which is sponsored by Scottish Government agency Transport Scotland and delivered by Network Rail.A Network Rail spokesperson said: “The project team are now back on-site at Kintore and work to complete the new station will gradually restart in the coming days.“While the main construction work on s and lts has been finished, there is still a considerable amount of work to do to complete the car parking and passenger facilities at the new station.”The recommencement of the construction project was announced by Network Rail alongside several others around the country, including the £m reconstruction of Glasgow Queen Street station and the £m redevelopment of Dunbar station.Michael Matheson, Cabinet Secretary for Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity, said: “Efforts across Scotland’s Railway, from frontline staff running day to day services to those in planning and maintenance roles behind the scenes, have played a fundamental part in ensuring key workers are able to get to where they are needed during this pandemic.“While many non-essential projects were rightfully paused, our continued investment in maintaining vital rail infrastructure has given reassurance at a dficult time.#As we now make the transition through the Routemap to Recovery, it is important we step up work where we can.“This will enable us safely to resume key projects such as the new Kintore station and Queen Street station improvements, bringing investment at a time when the supply chain and its workers need it most.“I look forward to seeing these signicant projects make progress because their completion will bring benefits to passengers, workers and the economy alike.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

I#d also like to wish the applicant a speedyto business, and best of luck for the future.”Aberdeenshire Council have given the move their backing and said they would allow the sea front ice cream shop to trade while maintaining public safety.A document issued by the local authority said: “The alterations to the shop’s frontage are considered appropriate for the property to enable it to safely trade during the current pandemic.“Proposed finishing materials which match the rest of the building are considered appropriate, as is the proposed canopy.“Overall, the proposal is considered to respect the existing building and the character of the surrounding area.”A design statement issued alongside the plans said they would “ensure the survival” during the Covid- crisis.It said: “The proposals seek to solve the public health and commercial viability issue by changing the shop frontage and internal layout“This arrangement allows customers to maintain a safe social distance from each other and from the staff.“No other changes are proposed to theof the shop, and it is hoped that these alterations will ensure the survival of a very popular Stonehaven business in these challenging times.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

His debut solo album Strand was released in  to critical acclaim.James said: #Gaither reflects the changing role Forvie has played over the course of history in supporting its inhabitants and visitors.#The piece features a bed of audio which I recorded at the Forvie shoreline a few years ago whilst visiting my family in Inverurie. The melody and orchestration aim to reflect the shting sands, the movement of the sea and the constant change of visitors to the area.#The writing and production process took place during the Covid- lockdown with each contributor recording engineering from home.”The music composed by each of the musicians will be released later in the year with accompanying films.A preview of James Lindsay’s piece, Gaither is available now. For more information on James, see www.jameslindsaymusic.The  winning entries were composed by musicians ranging from established artists like Marie Fielding, a lecturer at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, and James Lindsay, a musician with renowned folk band, Breabach, to emerging young artists such as Malin Lewis, Neil Sutclfe and Roo Geddes.Entrants aged  and over were invited to compose a piece of music inspired by one of  national nature reserves across Scotland.

positive steps to get football up and running continue","story":"Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes hopes Scottish football can continue to take positive steps towards ato competitive action.The Dons ed to full contact training at Cormack Park on Monday after the initial two weeks of pre-season were socially distanced.The SPFL and SFA recently confirmed Scottish Government ministers had formally approved full contact training for Premiership clubs could begin on Monday.It is another major step towards the emergence of Scottish football from the Covid- shutdown.McInnes is working his squad towards the SPFL’s targeted August  restart for the Scottish Premiership and a Europa League entry on August .After months of uncertainty during the outbreak Aberdeen now have a clear route marked out for ato action.McInnes is delighted at the recent progress made but accepts there must also be caution.He said: “In the last four weeks we have come quite a long way bit by bit.“Hopefully we can continue to keep making these small steps.“Four weeks ago everything was still a little up in the air.“Although we are not back to normality yet and not out of the woods we have taken big strides to get to where we are now.“A lot of things are now starting to take shape.“We have Europa League dates, the Premiership fixtures coming out soon and the draw date for the Europa Leagueis settled.“Now we have some dates to look forward to in the calendar.#If we take ourselves back four weeks ago, we would have taken that.“We didn’t think it was going to move as quickly as it has done and there is a lot of encouragement for the season to be started as planned.“However, clearly we still have to be mindful of the climate we are living in at the minute.“We know that things can change quite quickly.”Scottish football was shut down at all levels on March  due to the coronavirus pandemic.When Scottish Minister for Sport Joe Fitzpatrick met the SPL and SFA Joint Response Group on May  the football authorities initially proposed July  for the resumption of contact training.However earlier this month the Scottish Government were askedthat time-frame could be accelerated.After careful consideration the green light was given for the resumption of contact training on Monday supported by appropriate public \u2028health measures including regular Covid- testing.Aberdeen players had previously trained on their own for three months due to lockdown restrictions and social distancing.Eventually they ed to socially distanced training a fortnight ago at the £million Cormack Park training facility.Last week Aberdeen made the first signing of the pre-season by securing Jonny Hayes on a two-year contract.Due to the financial hit of the Covid- crisis the Dons have projected losses of £m.Hayes, who was a free agent having left Celtic, agreed to defer his wages for a year to push through ato Aberdeen.Now that contact training has resumed Hayes and his new Dons team-mates are stepping up training intensity as they work towards that August  Premiership restart.McInnes said: “We have to be mindful of the fact that it will almost be five months from the Hibs gameto the first the first game of the season.“The players have had a longer break than they have ever had.“What we did was use the first two weeks to build them up to get players really ready to what they would normally come back for a pre-season.“Then we would use that last month to get them tuned into game related practices.”Another major development in recent week is the growing hope supporters canto stadiums in limited numbers earlier than initially anticipated.Aberdeen are not expecting to have full crowds back at Pittodrie until January next year.However McInnes is optimistic that further changes to social distancing guidelines could yet allow some fans to attend games when next season kicks off.He said: “It is ongoing and it is ever-changing.#We are planning for not having full crowds back in until January  but that may well change.#A fraction of supporters being allowed in I think is a real possibility but it is all dependent on what is happening in society.“If we go down to a  metre rule that might allow stadiums and clubs to be allowed to cope with a certain amount of supporters in.“I think that would be fantastic.“Although there is pay per view and Sky have allowed clubs’ season tickets holders to watch games, supporters are desperate to get back in and watch their team.“If we can get that moving as well that would be another bonus compared to where we were three or four weeks ago when we thought that just wasn’t going to be possible.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation

They are doing the same to support other temporary NHS services across Scotland.Our people have worked around the clock with health boards across the country to offer new, technical solutions to help frontline health workers get on with their jobs during this crisis.Our frontline staff in contact centres across Scotland – including Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Greenock – have risen to this unprecedented challenge. We’ve received a huge surge of customers asking for faster connections to help with home working, home schooling and running their businesses remotely.These colleagues – most of whom can now work from home when they want to – have performed a critical role keeping our customers, including frontline health workers and vulnerable people, connected.The people in our two  contact centres in Scotland are also playing a critical role, answering lesaving emergency calls.I couldn’t be more proud of how my colleagues have responded to these challenges and their desire to help us all through this crisis.Jane Wood, BT Group director in Scotland, Edinburgh.COVID- is seriously not a jokeGlobally kills thousands of folkYou start coughing, you can#t breatheWithout a respirator, this earth you#ll leaveSocial distancing is now in placeKeep two metres apart, not face to faceWash your hands frequently and well hours on surfaces it can dwellShop infrequently, for essentials onlyDon#t mix with othersyou#re lonelyKeep in touch by text and phoneDon#t put yourself at risk, stay aloneIt#s hoped soon this contagion will peakThen we canto normal, so to speakDon#t travel to other towns by carIt can spread the virus near and farSports, socialising and most work on holdThe alternative could cause damage untoldSupport the NHS, essential workers and neighboursThen we#ll defeat this virus by all our laboursDugald MacGilp, Lochgilphead.Sir,We are looking for people who have the passion to bring communities together, believe in the power of co-operation and who hold the well-being of their community at the forefront of their mind.The successful #Member Pioneers# will receive full training and business support as they help groups and iniduals during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond.

Now we find the bullying problem here is equally as bad.The survey results have particular impact and resonance at this point in time, given the dedication of health and care staff during the coronavirus crisis.This type of behaviour has been anecdotally reported for years, so is not a huge shock, but it is nonetheless disgraceful.Apologies are of little use. Action is needed and the bullies must be confronted. That they were allowed to behave in this way for so long is the real shocker.Their own managers have questions to answer.

They deserve the attention, but communities across Argyll equally merit praise for their kindness and community spirit.Again, it comes as little surprise.That#s the way we do it in Argyll."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert spruced up and ready for tee off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMembers will come back # in good time # to a spruced up and tidy Glenralloch.Maintenance and improvement work has carried on at Tarbert Golf Club in line with current guidelines.The committee reports the course is in immaculate condition with  greenkeeper Graham Prentice on top of things.The greens were hollow-cored earlier in the year and are gradually filling in and some welcome heat and rainwill enhance the greens.Other #rainy day# jobs have been carried out by volunteer members, which has helped the overall appearance of the course.Club secretary John MacNab successfully applied for the small business grant.

People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited. The charity has created a free pack full of tips, ideas and videos to help people host their own virtual picnic.You can hold your picnic in your garden, on your balcony or on the living room floor.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

Theyrsquore because of public reaction and public perception of Tourettersquos.ldquoThe fact that Irsquom ticking doesnrsquot make me depressed and it doesnrsquot make me anxious.\"Itrsquos how other people react. Itrsquos only such a huge part of my le because of other people.ldquoItrsquos instinctive for people to turn around and look, but it doesnrsquot take away from the fact that it makes me feel uncomfortable and embarrassed over something that I cannot control.It was not only the tics that made Jack stand out from the crowd during childhood.As a gay teenager, he says he struggled to make any male friends because of his sexuality, which he has never hidden.And the struggles, although manesting in dferent forms, have continued into young adult le.As a result of years of relentless twitching and involuntary leg movements, Jack is battling chronic muscle pain and nausea.Cognitive behaviour therapy reiki reflexology ndash Jack has tried everything to relieve the pain but to little avail.He is prescribed strong painkillers, and at times has had to keep his neck in a brace because of his tics.,params: .pushWhen attempting to enter bars or nightclubs, bouncers sometimes reject him because they believe he is under the influence of illegal drugs.Alcohol consumption can trigger his tics, making them more prominent and frequent.Even in university lectures, he sometimes must call out people for continually turning around and staring at him, despite knowing his condition.Jack insists that suffering from Tourette syndrome has given him a ldquothick skin\".He has always felt fully supported by his parents but has chosen to be independent from a young age, refusing to let his condition prevent him from doing the things he wants to achieve.Attending doctors appointments on his own from the age of , Jack preferred to handle everything by himself.In his third year at Peebles High School, Jack ran a public campaign and was successfully elected as a Member of the Scottish Youth Parliamentfor the region.He said: ldquoI ran because Irsquove always been interested in social issues and wanted to meet like-minded people, which I sometimes felt starved of growing up.ldquoI think I would be a really confident, extroverted guy without my tics ndash they are the one thing holding me back.Since his darkest days battling anxiety and depression, Jack has made friends andhad part-time jobs in bars in Peebles and Edinburgh.Mental health struggles may have stolen parts of Jacks childhood ndash and he continues to live in the spotlight of Tourettersquos ndash but it hasnrsquot stopped him embracing student le."},{"url":null,"title":"bournemouth-major-incident-thousands-pack-beaches-south-coast","story":"A MAJORincident has been declared after thousands of people flocked to the beach in southern England.The sun-seekers - defying official advice -descended onBournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council beaches on the hottest day of the year so far.A multi-agency emergency response has now been activated to co-ordinate resources across the area.Council leader Vikki Slade said: ldquoWe are absolutely appalled at the scenes witnessed on our beaches, particularly at Bournemouth and Sandbanks, in the last - hours.\"The irresponsible behaviour and actions of so many people is just shocking and our services are stretched to the absolute hilt trying to keep everyone safe.\"We have had no choice now but to declare a major incident and initiate an emergency response.Services were left completely overstretched as visitors arrived in large volumes resulting in widespread problems of illegal parking, excessive waste, anti-social behaviour, gridlock on roads and prohibited overnight camping.BCP Council issued  parking enforcement fines ndash the highest on record ndash and responded to many reports of cars parking and causing an obstruction.Roads in and out of the area were heavily congested into the early hours.Crews received widespread abuse and intimidation as they attempted to empty overflowing bins on the seafront. In the stretch between the piers, eight tonnes of waste was collected yesterday on the second collection run of the day.This morning, a further  tons of waste was removed along the full stretch of coastline.There were also a number of incidents reported which involved excessive alcohol and fights.Additional police patrols have now been brought in, security put in place to protect refuse crews and additional parking enforcement implemented to support the management of car parks and ticketing.Signage urging people that the conurbation is full are now in use, including on approach roads.Overnight campers were evicted and further patrols by seafront ranger staff will be put in place.Public health messaging has gone out to ensure people stay hydrated especiallystuck in long traffic queues.Ms Slade added: ldquoThe numbers of people descending down here are like those seen on a bank holiday.\"We are not in a position to welcome visitors in these numbers now or to deal with the full range of problems associated with managing volumes of people like this.\"PLEASE do not come. We are not able to welcome you yet.What have Dorset Police said Assistant Chief Constable Sam de Reya, of Dorset Police, said: ldquoThese are unprecedented times and we are urging people to stay away from the area of Bournemouth Beach and other Dorset beaches.ldquoWe continue to work very closely with BCP Council and other partners to ensure the safety of the public.,params: .pushldquoWe are also deploying additional resources to provide increased patrols in the vicinity to help tackle any issues of anti-social behaviour and other offences being committed.ldquoThe declaration of a major incident allows us to bring agencies together so we can take actions available to us to safeguard the public as much as possible.ldquoWe are also reliant on people taking personal responsibility and strongly advise members of the public to think twice before heading to the area.\"Clearly we are still in a public health crisis and such a signicant volume of people heading to one area places a further strain on emergency services resources.ldquoThis influx of visitors to our area places a signicant increase in demand on our service and we would ask people to please bear with us.ldquoWe would therefore stress again that we are asking people to please stay away from the area."},{"url":null,"title":"lidl-launch-cooling-sun-bed-dogs---less-20","story":"Lidl has launched a new cooling sun bed for dogs.Just as we jump at the chance to soak up the summer rays, many cats and dogs also love relaxing in the warm sun.For both ourselvesand our pets, exposure to the sun helps boost our vitamin D levels and improves our moods.However, while the positives are the same, sadly so are the negatives.

travelling abroad.What are air bridges Also known as travel corridors, air bridges will allow Britons to go on holiday to certain destinations without needing to quarantine for  days on theirto the

Greece and Germany.According to reports, air bridges will be announced in batches, with the second set of destinations likely to include other European countries such as Denmark, Norway, Finland and Holland and ldquolow-risk Caribbean islands.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said air bridges would only be agreed with countries which have a coronavirus test and trace system of the same standard as that used in Britain.When will air bridges be introduced The first air bridges to low-risk countries could be in force from July , but Mr Shapps said no announcement will be made until June  when the

spike in coronavirus cases in the country.Long-haul flights to destinations such as Vietnam, Singapore, Hong Kong are reportedly not expected before late summer.Flights to Australia are thought to be

He knew how to whet my appetite.\"Yet the characters arent the only element getting a makeover: billed as the originals \"spiritual descendant\", the brand-new -part series will transport viewers from Ripper-era London to the Golden Age of Hollywood in  Los Angeles.A time and place deeply infused with social and political tension, the sequel - which opens with a grisly murder - sees detectives Tiago Vegaand Lewis Michenerbattling the citys rich history. From the building of the first freeways and its traditions of Mexican-American folklore, to the dangerous espionage actions of the Third Reich and the rise of radio evangelism.In amongst the uprising, Kinnear plays Dr Peter Craft, a father of two who flits between caring paediatrician and his turn as head of the German-American Bund, an organisation he hopes will keep the United States isolated from the growing threat of war in Europe.\"Peter has a lot in common with a lot of characters in the show in that theyre all complex, conflicted, and struggling to do the right thing whilst coming up against temptation,\" says the star, whos also worked with screenwriter Logan on Bond films Skyfall and Spectre.\"He has a troubled home le, in that his we is an alcoholic and has seemingly cut herself off from looking after their children,\" he continues. \"And his profession is all about looking after kids, so were expecting that [viewers] sympathise with him.\"But obviously in meeting Elsa, the path thats in front of him changes, and as a result the audience may have their sympathies change as well.\"Elsa is just one of a number of guises adopted by Natalie Dormers character, Magda.Dubbed a supernatural demon who can assume the form of anyone she chooses, the Game Of Thrones actress - whose character believes humankind is evil - has her work cut out, as she shts between blonde German housewe Elsa, government assistant Alex, and androgynous freedom fighter Rio.Her goal: to prove her point by nudging the city towards a race war.It was a major endeavour, says the -year-old, \"in so far as its a physical and mental exercise because its four characterisations for the price of one\".\"We realised quite quickly that I had to play them as separate entities becauseyou dont play Elsa and Rio and Alex as fully fleshed out, three-dimensional characters, not only are you doing a disservice to your co-stars, the truth of the entire thing gets completely lost.\"And that actually, speaking in a pure sense as an actor, in terms of craft, its a joy because it means you have a lot of fun playing with the physicality, with voices, accents, and the costume and hair department...\" she notes.\"I was very pleased to be a stage-trained, classically trained British actor because I really did go right back to my training, in order to do this sort of exercise. It was a nice challenge.\"Similarly, Kinnear states: \"I like playing characters with lots of dferent shades [and] Peter comes upon a fairly invincible force in the shape of Elsa and Magda.\"But we dont know how much strength he has in him to withstand that temptation,\" he teases. \"You see over the course of the  episodes that he does try, and hes also trying to stand up to the more radical, Nazi wing of the German-American Bund as well, to try and make the claim for peace.\"Peter is almost the inverse of the Creature, really he is trying desperately to push down his true identity and create someone completely anew. Whereas the Creature was in constant search of his origin and identity.\"\"Magda has this theory that all mankind needs to become the monster he truly is, is to be told that he can, Dormer follows.\"For me, theres a bit of a premise that good people do bad things, whether its to do with threatening their family, their country or their vulnerability. Its that philosophical question of what it takes to bring out the uglier side in all of us.\"As for the shows key political themes - take othering, racism, and isions in society, for example - it seems theyre as relevant today as they ever were.\"What this shows is that all the tensions and dficulties of any large city, which has had a history of oppressing minority groups, have not gone away, and that they will continue to resurfacetheyre not fully addressed or addressed honestly,\" recognises Kinnear.Can he pinpoint a link between the first iteration and this \"I think its that focus on how the supernatural plays out in real peoples lives and the strength of feeling that it can still provoke not only in the s, but today as well,\" he muses.\"The first Penny Dreadful was all about the monsters that lie within us and it was using largely pre-existing literary characters,\" reasons the father of two.\"This one focuses on that same thing, but also the sense of no matter how much you study and learn, there are things that exist beyond us, beyond our comprehension, which we try to give names to.\"That can lead to fears, whether irrational or not, but it can also give succour and strength as well.\"Is there room for another series \"John is always several steps ahead,\" Kinnear finishes. \"Not only is he so extraordinarily prolic in terms of all the output that he has, across so many dferent disciplines, he really enjoys it - and Penny Dreadful was his first time doing long-form TV!\"There are lots of surprises thrown up in that, but you do have to plan your first three series because thats always the hope!\"Watch all episodes of Penny Dreadful: City Of Angels on Sky Atlantic and streaming service NOW TV from Wednesday, July ."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-need-increase-ct-scan-capacity","story":"When the Chinese were short of tests for Covid- they overcame this problem by CT scanning the lungs for confirmation of all suspected of the infection.

Given the traumas of re-location and being housed with strangers schooling must have been dficult to say the least. Since many thousands of male teachers must have died in the First War and many thousands more had been called-up or volunteered in the Second, added to which married female teachers were not allowed by law to teach until , class sizes must have been enormous at a time when teaching resources were very scarce.Yet we now look back at the s and s when these children became the working population as some sort of golden age.

Last week, the UKrsquos chief negotiator castigated the EU on Twitter for ldquounrealistic positions that ldquowill have to change while re-stating the UKrsquos ideological positioning on its sovereignty.Covid- is, of course, the centre of political and public attention. But that doesnrsquot mean there is public support for the type of hard Brexit that Boris Johnson and his Brexiters want. In fact, a recent Kantar poll found % of UK voters now back remaining in the EU. But the UK has left the EU, so \"remain\" is not possible ndash only a rather unlikely re-join option .\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Brexit briefing:  days until the end of the transition period\",\"description\": \"Brexit briefing:  days until the end of the transition period\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media DtdhjwmQ poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests DtdhjwmQ.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": :Kirsty Hughes: Scotland needs to start working now to cement its Euro credentialsBut, in Scotland, the re-join option is not so unlikely nor absent from debate. Independence in the European Union is the Scottish Governmentrsquos clear, long-standing position. Any independent European state can indeed apply to join the EU ndash and despite plenty of hoops to jump through, there is, for now, plenty of goodwill in EU capitals towards Scotland.Meanwhile, in London, Keir Starmer is playing a cautious game on the EU-UK talks ndash hanging back, unlike the other opposition parties, from calling for a two-year extension of transition. Doubtless, Starmer will be ready to critique any basic free trade deal that emerges. But he is playing a long game, and any clear position on Labourrsquos preferred EU-UK deal is not obviously in the offing.In contrast, the Scottish Governmentrsquos Brexit policies are many and ied ndash from independence in the EU to keeping the whole UK in the EUrsquos customs union and single market, or keeping Scotland alone in the single market, or devolving migration policy to enable something akin to free movement of people.But, with deliberate continuity from Theresa May to Boris Johnson, the UK Government has chosen not to engage in any serious way with the devolved administrations. May and Johnson never tried to mend the Brexit ide across the UKrsquos four nations ndash their focus was solely on their core voters and their own backbenchers.So the Brexit fragmentation of the UK has deepened over the last four years, not least since Brexit day on January . Scotland not only voted Remain, together with Northern Ireland, four years ago, but the European debate here remains substantively dferent too.And itrsquos a debate that is intimately intertwined with the independence debate. A recent poll put support for independence at % ndash others have shown a smaller majority or a : split. One factor behind the increase in support for independence is previously pro-UK, Remain voters switching to Yes. While the Conservatives drive Brexit forward and Labour has accepted it, in Scotland, the SNPrsquos option of re-joining the EU will stay a core part of political debate and dynamics.This fundamental dference in English and Scottish political debates is there too in the more specic aspects of the EU-UK talks. The UK Government continues to reject EU demands for a level-playing field to ensure neither side undercuts the other on environmental and labour standards or state aids. Johnsonrsquos agreement, in last autumnrsquos EU-UK political declaration, to negotiate a level-playing field has been discarded by this most ideological of governments.:Kirsty Hughes: Brexit, lies and the Johnson charadeBut the Scottish Government wants its own partial level-playing field in devolved areas, including replicating EU environmental standards as far as possible. How that will play out in the context of other UK trade deals or in UK-devolved politics is an open question.The EU-UK talks are also blocked over fisheries, over judicial and police co-operation, and on overall governance and dispute settlement. Any hints of progress on the technical side in the talks are soon halted by new political pronouncements from London. And consultation between UK and Scottish governments remains non-existent beyond some granular technical discussions between officials.Yet, despite the UK bluster, a deal is perhaps slightly more likely than a no deal outcome. If London can portray a major compromise on its side, with a small sht by Brussels, as EU capitulation, then late October might see a deal ndash allowing time for the European parliament to raty it.But a deal will be thin and damaging. It will re-establish customs and regulatory barriers to trade it will hit the services sector particularly hard. It will slow growth and reduce investment compared to staying closer to the EU. And a no deal outcome will create more chaos and a harder economic hit ndash albeit with the withdrawal agreement still in place, so EU citizensrsquo settled status and the special deal for Northern Ireland will remain.A UK publicity campaign is due in July ndash pushing iniduals and organisations to prepare for the end of transition. But such preparations cannot realistically be done amidst the economic damage and uncertainty from the Covid- crisis, and without knowingthere will be a deal or what it will look like.The double damage from the Covid crisis and a hard Brexit plus premature end of transition will not go unnoticed in Scotland. The SNP faces its own challenges in the months ahead, as the fall-out from the Salmond saga continues. And currently favourable polls for the Holyrood elections next May could sht in our deeply unpredictable Covid era.But the UK, albeit with a special deal for Northern Ireland, is set for a hard orce from the EU. In Scotland, the debate over having that orce imposed on it will continue. The EU debate may be muted in England in the coming years. But in contrast, in Scotland, the European debate is set to stay a central part of the core constitutional debate.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

The tourism industry will reopen in full on July .However, the Arran Ferry Action Group says some tourism businesses on the island are deciding whether to ldquohunker down and remain in mothballs until next year.Sam Bourne, a spokesman for the group, said: ldquoI know some businesses have decided not to reopen, hotels, guest houses, and self-catering accommodation providers.

However, because of the two-metre social distancing rule, the vessel will still only run at about  per cent of its usual , capacity.While as many as , passengers are normally ferried between Arran and the mainland per day in July, numbers are currently limited to .Mr Bourne said that eventhe service s to its usual summer frequency after the tourism industry reopens on July , the reduced capacity means it may not be viable for businesses on Arran to reopen.In addition to the limitations on capacity, Mr Bourne said the new timetable exacerbates the situation facing Arran locals because CalMac will no longer reserve spaces for people who need to travel to the mainland for vital medical appointments.He noted that by the time people receive notice of medical appointments, which is often less than one week in advance, the  places for the key morning sailing off the island andcrossing will already have been taken.Mr Bourne said this contrasts with the position for residents on the Western Isles, who he said have been given a commitment that places will always be made available for people travelling for medical appointments.Mr Bourne said: ldquoThere is no guarantee [for people on Arran]. Is there a special deal for the Western Isles  This is critical. The backlog for medical appointments is huge.Meanwhile, the Arran Ferry Action Group has welcomed confirmation from CalMac that it will permit passengers to stay in their vehicles on the crossing between Lochranza on Arran and Claonaig on the Kintyre peninsula when it resumes on July , after securing an exemption from the Marine and Coastguard Agency . The route is served by the MV Catriona.Mr Bourne said: ldquoWe are slowly making progress, [but] even the north ferry is  passengers maximum and one sailing a day. It is marginal.The intervention from the group comes after it warned earlier this month that ferry capacity constraints due to coronavirus were making le on the island ldquounsustainable.A spokesman for Transport Scotland said the organisation has worked with CalMac to try and move from the essential leline timetable introduced during lockdown to a ldquoshoulderrsquo timetable by July . ldquoHowever, capacity challenges will remain as a result of physical distancing requirements on vessels that are required to protect public health and to ensure compliance with MCA regulations also, he added.The spokesman said CalMac will retain % capacity for ldquoturn up and go travel after consulting islanders who raised concerns over securing space for ldquofamily visits and other allowable trips."},{"url":null,"title":"leicester-becomes-first-city-go-back-lockdown-coronavirus-cases-surges","story":"It comes as the rest of England prepares to ease restrictions on pubs and restaurants from Saturday ndash and on the day Boris Johnson sets out a multi-billion pound plan for Britain to recover from the pandemic.Mr Hancock told MPs that non-essential shops in Leicester will close from Tuesday and schools will shut to most pupils from Thursday.He said the easing of the lockdown planned for the rest of England on Saturday cannot happen in Leicester because of rising cases.He made the announcement in a Commons statement that came at pm, four hours after expected and following a day of talks with Leicester officials.Mr Hancock said Leicesterrsquos seven-day infection rate is  cases per ,, which is three times higher than the next highest city.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Leicester to reintroduce stricter lockdown measures due to a spike in Covid- cases\",\"description\": \"Leicester to reintroduce stricter lockdown measures due to a spike in Covid- cases\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media gjRmdw poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests gjRmdw.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": :A tale of two leaders: Nicola Sturgeon and Boris Johnson during the pandemicLeicester accounts for around % of all positive cases in the country over the past week, and hospital admissions are between six and  per day rather than around one a day at other trusts, he said.He said: ldquoGiven the growing outbreak in Leicester, we cannot recommend that the easing of the national lockdown set to take place on July  happens in Leicester.The Health Secretary advised people from Leicester to stay at home as much as they can while the local lockdown measures continue.He told MPs: ldquoHaving taken clinical advice on the actions necessary and discussed them with the local team in Leicester and Leicestershire, we have made some dficult but important decisions.ldquoWersquove decided that from tomorrow, non-essential retail will have to close and as children have been particularly impacted by this outbreak, schools will also need to close from Thursday, staying open for vulnerable children and children of critical workers as they did throughout.The risk of catching #coronavirus is much less,yoursquore  metres away from an infected person thanyoursquore  metre away.Until the number of cases in #Leicester comes down, please be extra cautious and continue to keep  metres apart from people you dont live with. pic pOTowTIXJmdash Leicester City CouncilJune , ldquoUnfortunately, the clinical advice is that the relaxation of shielding measures due on July  cannot now take place in Leicester.ldquoWe recommend to people in Leicester, stay at home as much as you can, and we recommend against all but essential travel to, from and within Leicester.ldquoWersquoll monitor closely adhering to social distancing rules and wersquoll take further stepsthat is whatrsquos necessary.He said the measures will apply to Leicester and the surrounding conurbation including Oadby, Birstall and Glenfield and promised the exact details would be published ldquoimminently.:Coronavirus: From care homes crisis to surgery and scanning backlog -

Not even in times of extreme emergency or crisis, such as the Second World War, have people been faced with such extensive restrictions as the ones we have all had to live with over the last three months or so.And what has been truly remarkable has been the way in which people have done what has been asked of them.Overwhelmingly, iniduals and communities across the country have done the right thing.They have listened, they have responded and they have stayed the course.When the restrictions were put in place there was, I believe, a high level of scepticism as to how far ndash and for how long ndash people would be prepared to comply with lockdown.That scepticism was justied given the scale of what we were all embarking on.Butthere is one overriding lesson I have learned from lockdown it is that people are prepared to endure a lot, are incredibly resilient and are prepared to go to great s to do their bit for the greater goodthey can see there is a compelling communal purpose.There will be many other lessons to be learned as we emerge further from the crisis. I said at the start that we would make mistakes along the way, and that still holds true ndash but at every point I and the ministers and officials in the Scottish Government have sought to do the right things for the right reasons.That is true of governments around the world, all of whom have handled the pandemic in dferent ways but all of whom have been faced by the same dficult choices we have had to make.As we move further out of lockdown, it is important that we continue to try to strike the right balance between getting back towards normality and at the same time ensuring we continue to guard against a resurgence.Bluntly, this crisis is not over ndash no-one should think that it is, and we all need to guard against complacency, which could be our biggest enemy in the days, weeks and months to come.The virus hasnrsquot gone away, and a look at places around the globe which are now experiencing a second spike shows the dangers of dropping our guard.In those places where the virus is on the rise again, we are looking at perhaps the continuation or resurgence of the first wave. And that is before we factor in the dangers posed by the second wave which many experts are warning of.We may be moving cautiously out of lockdown, but that means it is more important than ever that we stick to the rules in place to protect the progress we have made.We have come a long way, but we must all remain vigilant.Nicola Sturgeon is Scotlandrsquos First Minister and SNP leader.Jackson CarlawThis unprecedented and previously unimaginable situation has had an impact on every person and every business. Not just in Scotland, the UK, or even Europe ndash the entire globe has been affected by it.And of course some have been left worse off than others.At the most desperate end of the scale thousands of Scots have lost their lives, often in the most lonely and heartbreaking of circumstances.Not only have families had to grieve the premature death of a loved one, but that has been compounded by restrictions on visiting them in their final days, and a scaled-down funeral involving just a handful of people.We canrsquot underestimate the impact lockdown has had on mental and physical health too.While some people may have been able to make the most of it ndash perhaps developing new exercise routines and revisiting old hobbies ndash for others quality of le has plummeted.That could take the form of being unable to see close friends, partners and family. For some vulnerable people, being forced out of a daily routine can be disruptive and actually catastrophic as far as mental wellbeing goes.And letrsquos not forget children, whorsquove missed key months of socialising with friends and learning and development opportunities.I think almost everyone understood the need for lockdown, but that doesnrsquot always mitigate the devastating impact of it.And while the UK Governmentrsquos furlough scheme has been a safety net for hundreds of thousands of workers and businesses, it canrsquot last forever, and fears about the future of the economy are widespread and legitimate.But one thing that has been heartening about lockdown is how flexible, imaginative and agile businesses have been in coping with such drastic restrictions.Over time, all kinds of iations have popped up, whether thatrsquos restaurants offering new delivery services, or bars converting their front windows to make a takeaway service for cocktails. It proves that, when the chips are down, business owners and their workforce will find a way to make things work.Now, as we enter the new and more liberal phases of lockdown exit, itrsquos essential the Scottish Government supports these organisations, and shows them the same determination and commitment as the businesses themselves have shown over these last  days.Finally, something we should always remember is that survival through lockdown would simply not have been possible without our nurses, carers, public service and other key workers who showed up every day ndash placing their own health and safety at risk ndash to keep the wheels turning.Jackson Carlaw is leader of the Scottish Conservatives.Richard LeonardToday marks  days since the beginning of lockdown in Scotland. We are living in a very dferent world to the one we left behind  days ago.For some that dferent world is that the old indulgences of consumerism and materialism have been replaced with a new re-acquaintance with quietness and nature, but for too many we have also seen changes for the worse.Poverty and indebtedness have risen, and we are now faced with a massive rise in long-term unemployment, the potential collapse of town centres, night-time economies going bust, entire industries at risk and youth unemployment at levels not witnessed for decades.We have been waging a war, but in so doing we have been fighting for the values of unity not ision, of co-operation not competitiveness.Amongst those workers on the front line in that war we have witnessed self-sacrice and devotion in tackling the virus.We are forever in their debt.Our everyday le has been transformed but communities have pulled together like never before.We must take that spirit of hope and apply it to the post-pandemic world.Our new-found values as a society need to be reflected in the actions of the Government so that we do notto the homelessness of the harsh winter before this lockdown spring, so we strive with renewed vigour to eradicate poverty in all its forms and kickstart our economy with an economic plan.A Jobs Guarantee Scheme, to prevent mass unemployment and to provide well-paid, unionised jobs must be an immediate priority.We must revalue the work of carers, of NHS staff, of supermarket workers too.A re-evaluation of their status in our society is long overdue. And we must establish a National Care Service based on people not profit.We are regularly told that we will emerge stronger from this pandemic.But I say that we must never forget those wonderful friends and relatives who we have lost.It is in their memory that we now have a duty to rekindle a flame of hope among the people and to build a better future.Richard Leonard is leader of Scottish Labour.Willie RennieThis crisis has already changed our communities and the way people look at the world and we have only just begun.Itrsquos proved that wersquore both fragile and resilient. That every nation on earth is tightly connected but the balance of health and wealth is not fair.There isnrsquot a household that this crisis hasnrsquot touched.Whether itrsquos those who have been lost to the virus or patients suffering whilst they wait for a postponed operation.Children who have missed out from not being at school or those who have fallen between the cracks of the financial support schemes or have seen their companies collapse.Or it may be the loneliness and depression that comes from missing friends and family. The legacy is deep and could be long felt. Our task now is picking up the pieces. To recover and build something better ndash a fair, green and kind country.First, we must prioritise people in physical pain and with poor mental health. That means getting the NHS safely back up and running as quickly as possible.Secondly, we must get to work rebuilding the economy. That means investing in the skills and talents of people through education and training and job guarantee schemes to prevent the economic scarring of the young.It means investing in capital construction projects to stimulate the economy. We canrsquot afford to crush any fledging recovery with an ideologically driven expenditure reduction programme.I also want a U- wide universal basic income to ensure that everyone can afford to keep a roof over their head and food on the table, especially in the case of a disastrous second wave. A universal basic income would mean no-one would be left behind.Thirdly, often those who sacriced most are those who are paid the least ndash the frontline workers. For health and care workers this is the moment to review and boost their pay. Medals, tokens, and awareness days must be matched by concrete progress in their settlements.Finally, the climate challenge has remained, and we must seek to rebuild in a sustainable fashion. Less travel, more working from home, investment in sustainable transport projects, building a new energy generation system.I have no doubt that fresh challenges will emerge as we rebuild. Sectors like theatre, tourism and hospitality will require tailored support and we may need the state to step in to provide extra support to some businesses that are essential to our economy.Willie Rennie is leader of Scottish LibDems.Patrick HarvieThis crisis has had very dferent effects on people. As Parliament has adopted remote working and video conferencing, Irsquove been able to limit my travel.With a secure home and income, Irsquove been able to stay safe. But I know that these things represent a position of privilege. For so many people the last  days have been incredibly dficult.There are those who have lost loved ones and been unable even to hold a normal funeral.There have been thousands of others who have lost their job or their home. And while some people are furloughed, others have never been working so hard, keeping everyone  safe.Isolation can also take a huge toll on mental health. With summer recess each year Irsquom usually looking forward to some time at home now Irsquom getting sick of my own company for a change. But dficult as lockdown has been, the need for it has been clear.The UK has one of the worst death rates from the virus in the world, butwe hadnrsquot acted to prevent its spread, things could have been so much worse.Many people whorsquove never had to interact with the UKrsquos welfare safety net have seen first hand how inadequate it is. The impact of precarious incomes and precarious housing have been exposed like never before. We clearly need to build back a better economy, and ideas like universal basic income are gaining new attention.Wersquove also seen how technology can cut unnecessary travel and leave our air cleaner. When even the president of the AA said that our previous travel patterns were ldquoinefficient, expensive and not good for the environment, maybe therersquos hope.Vitally, wersquove seen that governments can respond to an emergency when the political will is there. Wersquove been facing one rapid-onset emergency, but we also face a far bigger one as the climate warms due to our own actions.Our response to the climate emergency needs urgent and transformational change, on an even deeper level than wersquove seen this year.Patrick Harvie is Scottish Greens Co-Convener."},{"url":null,"title":"flu-virus-pandemic-potential-found-china","story":"Researchers have found the flu in pigs but have warned that it can also infect humans.They are concerned that the strand could mutate further so that it can spread from human to human easier, and trigger another global outbreak.:A tale of two leaders: Nicola Sturgeon and Boris Johnson during the pandemicThe scientists write in the journalProceedings of the National Academy of Sciencesthat measures to control the virus in pigs, and the close monitoring of swine industry workers, should be swtly implemented.A bad new strain of influenza is among the top disease threats that experts are watching for, even as the world attempts to bring to an end the current coronavirus pandemic.The last pandemic flu the world encountered - the swine flu outbreak of  - was less deadly than initially feared, largely because many older people had some immunity to it, probably because of its similarity to other flu viruses that had circulated years before.The new virus, which the researchers call G EA HN, can grow and multiply in the cells that line the human airways.They found evidence of recent infection in people who worked in abattoirs and the swine industry in China when they looked at data from  to .Current flu vaccines do not appear to protect against it, although they could be adapted to do soneeded.:  days of lockdown: Political leaders share their views as Scotland reaches a momentous dayProf Kin-Chow Chang, who works at Nottingham University in the UK, told the BBC: \"Right now we are distracted with coronavirus and rightly so.

Irsquove argued for years that, come independence, the SNP would fracture and many of its supporters would revert to the parties where their political sympathies naturally lie. I write this as someone who was a Labour Party activist, and indeed candidate, but who recognised that the Parliament at Westminster will never deliver the sort of Scotland Irsquod like my grandkids to grow up in.Mr Brown says that Jeremy Corbyn made the Labour Party unelectable. Actually, it started rather earlier: remember Ed Miliband and his Ed Stone  Itrsquos too early to tell whether Sir Keir Starmer will save Labour, but hersquos very much a metropolitan elite archetype, so I donrsquot have much hope of him delivering for Scotland. Mr Brown believes that Sir Keirrsquos rise will be helped by Boris Johnsonrsquos decline. He clearly doesnrsquot recognise the Conservative Partyrsquos ruthlessness when it comes to holding onto power. If they think their leader hinders them, they act fast, as Mrs Thatcher found out.Doug Maughan, Dunblane.AT long last Bill Brown has come out of the long grass and nailed his colours to the mast. It now appears that he had lent his vote in December  to Jo Swinson, hoping to keep the SNP out of East Dunbartonshire. His intemperate reaction in these pages to her defeat tagged SNP voters, myself included, with an incredible list of uncomplimentary adjectives. Now he warns us that an independent Scotland would be a one-party state, that party presumably being the SNP.He must rate the intelligence of Herald readers as no better than that of SNP votershe expects such a ridiculous prediction to be taken seriously. His vision of a Labour landslide in the next UK General Election might well be a credible possibility, but Labours chances of winning in an independent Scotland are just as real,not better. The glue which binds SNP voters would lose its grip after independence and the party would quickly disintegrate or wither away, in stark contrast to Mr Browns one-party state.Willie Maclean, Milngavie.MARK Smithopines on three groups of voters he identies as resistant to voting Yes in the next independence referendum. He is convinced an unholy alliance of Labour unionists, free market Brexiters and the middle classes will combine to thwart Scotland achieving independence.That sounds like an interesting construct for Better Together .. The rump of Scottish Labour knows any repeat of its disastrous association with the Tories in  cannot happen, no matter what Sir Keir Starmer thinks. Similarly, middle class Scottish Tories are overwhelmingly pro-EU and, having lost their leader and more than half their MPrsquos while ldquoGet Brexit Done resonated in Westminster, they will be lukewarm at least to joining any referendum campaign predicated on a pro-Brexit message.I fear Mr Smith has picked up the wrong end of the stick. It would perhaps have been more pertinent to have addressed why there is now a sustained movement to majority support for independence. The six years since the first referendum have been a cumulative series of missteps by unionists ndash from David Cameronrsquos pronouncements in Downing Street the morning after the vote to the folly of Brexit and the deceit of the Johnson Cummings administration.The Covid- pandemic has been devastating throughout the UK. However, it has given Scottish voters a unique opportunity to compare the performance of the Scottish and Westminster governments in dealing with the same existential threat. By any measure, whether leadership, communication, or virus suppression, Nicola Sturgeon and the Scottish Government have convincingly outperformed Boris Johnson and his cohorts.This has not gone unnoticed by Mr Smithrsquos middle-class voters who have drawn their own conclusions about the competence of the two governments. Faced with a choice of a Brexit UK under the direction of Mr Johnson or an independent Scotland within the EU they are increasingly receptive to the latter proposition.Iain Gunn, Elgin.WITH all the talk of closing the border with the rest of the UK, I was wondering: is it just English people that the SNP wants to keep out, or would the extra billions of pounds that it is begging for from the UK Government also be turned back at Berwick Alex Gallagher, Labour Councillor, North Ayrshire Council, Largs.REBECCA McQuillanwrites that the UK Government is ldquoirresponsibly pushing ahead with Brexit.

He also played an important role in the early career of Steve Martin, co-writing and directing several of the comedianrsquos most successful films, including The Man With Two Brains.Reiner made many other films too, but the Dick Van Dyke television shows were probably his greatest achievement. Not only did the show make big stars of Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore, it took sitcom to a new level of sophistication.There was plenty of slapstick in therebut there was slickness, too, in the fast-paced witty script. The word we would use now for the concept would be ldquometa: Reiner was writing a comedy show about a man writing a comedy show.Reiner had tried to sell the idea for the show as a pilot with himself as the star, but the bosses didnrsquot bite. So he tried again with Van Dyke in the leading role of Rob Petrie and it was a hit, running for more than  episodes from  to . Many of the characters were based on real people Reiner had encountered while head writer on Your Show of Shows, a s iety show hosted by Sid Caesar.Reiner had actually started out not as writer but as an actor. Born in the Bronx to Jewish immigrant parents , he served for a time in the Air Force during the Second World War before pursuing a career as an actor and performer, initially in Broadway musicals.He was then cast in Your Show of Shows, often acting in skits alongside Mel Brooks. The two men formed a strong bond and created a routine in which Brooks played a ,-year-old man being interviewed by Reiner, which became a number of best-selling comedy albums.Reinerrsquos work on Your Show of Shows, as a performer and writer, was hectic. ldquoI only was an actor two or three days a week, but three and a half days a week, we were in the writersrsquo room getting it together, he said. ldquoThen wersquod rehearse it on a Thursday, put it on its feet on a Friday, show it to the cameras on Saturday, and Monday start all over again.ldquoI was a writer without a portfolio, but I was in the writersrsquo room. Thatrsquos why I wrote The Dick Van Dyke show and made Rob a writer because I felt like I was a writer most of the week.Making The Dick Van Dyke Show was just as hectic. Reiner was the producer but also head writer, writing  of the first  shows by himself. He also produced  shows a year for five years but he knew from the start he had something special. He later revived the show in a dferent format in  as The New Dick Van Dyke Show, with Van Dyke this time playing the host of a TV talk show.Away from television, Reinerrsquos career writing films began with the  Doris Day comedy The Thrill of It All, and he made four films with Steve Martin in the s and early s: The Jerk, Dead Men Donrsquot Wear Plaid, The Man with Two Brains, and All of Me.He also acted in films, including The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming, a comedy about a Soviet submarine that runs aground in America during the Cold War, and the  comedy caper Itrsquos a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.He also appeared in all the Oceanrsquos Eleven movies, as conman Saul Bloom, starting with Oceanrsquos Eleven, in . As a director, he made a black comedy about senility called Wherersquos Poppa , and Oh God!, which featured George Burns as the Almighty. One of his last films as a director was rsquos Fatal Instinct, a spoof of Basic Instinct.Reiner said he learned his skill for engaging and fast-paced comedy from his father. ldquoIt comes from not wanting to bore, he said. ldquoIf you donrsquot want to bore, you learn how to cut judiciously, and Irsquom pretty good at that. My father was a watch maker, and his idea was that of everything fitting. My father gave me that. All things have to fit and work together.In later years, when he was over  years old, Reiner made an Emmy-nominated documentary about ageing called If Yoursquore Not in the Obit, Eat Breakfast, in which he spoke to other long-lived stars such as Van Dyke and Brooks. He also developed a big following on Twitter.His favourite work, however, was always The Dick Van Dyke show. ldquoThatrsquos who I really am, he said.Van Dyke himself tweeted today: ldquoMy idol, Carl Reiner, wrote about the human comedy. He had a deeper understanding of the human condition, than I think even he was aware of. Kind, gentle, compassionate, empathetic and wise. His scripts were never just funny, they always had something to say about us.Steve Martin tweeted the following tribute: ldquoGoodbye to my greatest mentor in movies and in le. Thank you, dear Carl.Reiner married the actress Estelle Lebost, best known for delivering the line ldquoIrsquoll have what shersquos having in the famous restaurant scene in When Harry Met Sally, which was directed by their son Rob.Estelle died in  and Reiner is survived by Rob and his other children Annie and Lucas.On June  Reiner posted this tweet to his , followers: ldquoNothing pleases me more than knowing that I have lived the best le possible by having met  marrying the gted EstelleLebost---who partnered with me in bringing Rob, Annie  Lucas Reiner into to this needy  evolving world."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"June ,  at : pmNHS Orkney has announced, today, Tuesday, that Iain Stewart will not be taking on the role of chief executive.

As more and more companies continue to get back to work, we look at how the financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here is an example of how one company has been helped, and what support is available. vw, px\"  When the Covid- pandemic arrived the chief executive officer of East Lothian firm Sunamp, knew the company could respond. Andrew Bissellsaid: “A week into lockdown I woke up in the middle of the night and just thought ‘we have to do something that makes the business relevant in this crisis’.” Mr Bissell turned to Sunamp’s innovative technology, developed in partnership with the University of Edinburgh.The applications of the technology span several industries, but the company’s focus has so far been on offering a product that replaces the hot water tank in heating systems with something smaller and more efficient. vw, px\"  Recognising the potential of the technology in the context of Covid-, Sunamp was one of more than , companies to apply for grant funding from Innovate UK, the UK Government’s innovation agency.In April, Innovate UK launched the Fast Start initiative, with £m of funding available to companies responding to the pandemic with some form of innovation. In the end, Sunamp was one of  companies to secure a grant.The £, award is being used to develop mobile handwash units that can be installed in locations where people lack access to hygiene facilities that can help prevent the spread of Covid-. vw, px\"  Mr Bissell said: “You don’t need hot water to wash your hands, but it is much more comfortable.“Right now, we’re dealing with the virus in the summer time, but as we head into winter,you have to wash your hands outside a railway station or supermarket or vaccination centre, it will be much more pleasant to have warm water.”The idea has gained traction with Sunamp’s clients, with inquiries coming in rapidly even though the finished product is still in development. Mr Bissell said: “Covid- is a global problem so there’s widespread interest.“Sunamp has partnerships and licensing arrangements with businesses all around the world through which it sells its heat batteries, so the ambition for the mobile units is international.”For Mr Bissell, the appeal of the project is that in addition to its obvious commercial potential, there’s a real societal benefit.“There is no minimising the negatives of Covid-,” he said.“But there are many people stepping and doing amazing things.”Working with everything from gas boilers to solar and heat pumps, Sunamp says its Heat Batteries deliver hot water with efficiency and proven savings of up to  per cent on utility bills in residential, commercial or industrial settings.Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers. , jobs in Scotand have been furloughed through the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme up to May ., claims amounting to £ million through the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme up to May .%of those eligible for SEISS made a claim.

It reflects the additional constraints faced by farm businesses in these communities and provides much needed financial stability.“In the midst of a pandemic, with the UK’s impending departure from the EU, there is no lack of challenges facing the farming sector at the moment. At a time of such uncertainty, retaining the benefits that LFASS delivers would seem both sensible and desirable.“The group established by the minister to develop proposals for future farm support post-Brexit is due to report shortly. It is right that consideration is given to the way funding is allocated across the board.“However, as Fergus Ewing rightly acknowledged, LFASS has shown itself to be particularly good at targeting support where it is most needed.  Moreover, in helping sustain farming and crofting in some of our most fragile areas, it also plays a pivotal role in building community cohesion.“These are ‘public goods’ we should value and protect and I am pleased that the minister seems up for the fight in ensuring this happens.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This comes as the prevalence of the condition in the county was predicted to double between  and .Anna Buchanan, of the Le Changes Trust – a charity that invests in and supports three groups, including people living with dementia and their unpaid carers # described the strategy document as an “exemplar for where” and has told members they would be contributing up to £, to support an independent the evaluation of the impact of the strategy.The meeting of the Integration Joint Board , last Wednesday, saw board members agree that the strategy document was a “formidable piece of work” and vital at a time when almost all families in Orkney will be touched by dementia in some respect.Presenting the strategy, Gillian Coghill, NHS Orkney Alzheimer Scotland Clinical Nurse Specialist, outlined the work undertaken and their aspirations for the future. She said: “The purpose of the Orkney Dementia Strategy - is to set out a renewed vision for dementia care and support in Orkney. It draws on a wide range of evidence and inter-related policies, including Scotland’s Third National Dementia Strategy. Most importantly of all, it draws on the experiences and views of people living in Orkney whose lives are affected by dementia. Some of these people are living with dementia and others are unpaid carers, often family, supporting people living with dementia.“There is often a lack of awareness and understanding of dementia, resulting in stigmatisation, inequality and barriers to diagnosis and care. The impact of dementia on carers, family and wider society can be physical, psychological, social and economic. We need to adopt a social model of dementia as a disability, recognising the challenges people with dementia face and affording the same priority to reduce impact, as we do for physical disabilities. Dementia is one of the foremost public health challenges worldwide. There is currently no cure for dementia. However, there are treatments, therapies and supports which are effective in maintaining skills and independence and contributing positively to the experiences of people with dementia and unpaid carers.”With an ageing population within Orkney, a projected increase in numbers of people with dementia presents a range of challenges, not only for the people who develop dementia, and their families and carers, but also for the statutory and voluntary services that provide care and support, Gillian Coghill explained.She said: “If the estimated prevalence rates remain similar, the number of people living with dementia in Orkney is set to almost double between  and , increasing from  to  people. We need to develop innovative ways to build capacity, resilience within financial constraints.”The five-year strategy provides a framework for improvement in support and services for people with a diagnosis of dementia and those who provide unpaid support for them throughout communities in Orkney, Ms Coghill added.“This strategy aspires to highlight the importance of risk reduction, early diagnosis and access to high quality post diagnostic support which is dynamic to needs, strengths and identied personal outcomes for people with dementia.“It recognises the positive contribution and need to support carers, volunteers and staff and has been developed from a grass roots perspective. It supports Community Led Support and the need for integrated systems, which promote enablement and uphold rights for people with dementia, the building of dementia friendly communities and increasing community capacity to enable people with dementia to live well, without stigma as a valued part of their community and in their own homes when possible.“This strategy evidences the importance of planning and developing services and supports for and with people living with dementia. It addresses the challenges involved in meeting the needs of the growing number of people who will be diagnosed with dementia, recognising the unique challenges and strengths of the Orkney community. It supports the right care, in the right place at the right time by the right people.“There is recognition of the need to do things dferently, both in relation to people’s experiences and to ensure a sustainable model of support. We need to work together with all relevant people and groups to design and deliver the best care and support we can. This provides us with an opportunity to make changes which support the appropriate level of priority and investment needed for dementia in Orkney. We need to ensure that dementia is prioritised and kept firmly on the agenda in all relevant policies, procedures and plans.”Members of the IJB approved the strategy and consultation will now take place with key stakeholders, results of which will be presented to the board at a future meeting, no later than September .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

SCT was delighted to secure a £, grant from the SSE Sustainable Development Fund last month, and hopes to soon confirm the final funding package.SCT bought the site, near Bun-Sgoil Stafainn, from the Stenscholl Township and Kilmuir Estatefor £,, using a grant from the Scottish Land Fund.It followed the conclusion of the Resumption process, removing the development site from crofting tenure, which was approved by the Scottish Land Court earlier this year.SCT director Calum MacDonald said: “The progress made is a great achievement for the community. I know that the community recognises that affordable housing is long overdue.#Welcoming families in need of such accommodation, and who are very keen to live in Staffin, will be a great boost to our village.”HSCHT chief executive Ronnie MacRae said: “The health, economic and social benefits of this scheme will undoubtedly give Staffin strong foundations to build on.”Lachie MacDonald, LSHA chief executive association, added: “We are delighted that this rural mixed-use development is about to start on site.

We do have movie nights in winter when we watch DVD’s and now Netflix through a data projector onto a large pull-down screen.It is almost a cinematic experience with the sound coming through my old-fashioned stereo and its big speakers on the wall.Very occasionally though I get to hear about a television drama that sparks an interest.Mostly they are forgotten asthey are any good, they are released on DVD or online as a mini-series, like Sherlock, produced by Skye’s own Douglas Mackinnon, and I can enjoy them at my leisure, glass and popcorn in hand while lying on a sofa.Last week however, I heard about the BBC drama The Salisbury Poisonings, an adaptation of the real events following the attempted murder of a former Russian spy in , and the ensuing public health danger.The series was timely.There was talk of tracking and tracing, areas were locked down, and there was a possible spread of an invisible deadly nerve agent.Containment was the key.Viewers now have an understanding and comprehension about much of the unfolding events, that they perhaps wouldn’t have had, were it screened four months earlier.Contamination through contact from surfaces such as light switches and work surfaces and Salisbury business owners complaining at a public meeting of a  per cent drop in trade due to the cordons in their streets.Much of what happened would strike a chord with many, as would the uncertainty of it all.I managed to watch the three episodes, albeit a few days after they were broadcast, and was struck how the story was a human one.It was about ordinary people doing the best they could in an unprecedented situation.It was seemingly very true to le. The screenplay was written after many interviews with the real players, who we meet briefly in a moving vignette at the end.The main protagonist was director of public health for the local authority Tracy Daszkiewicz.She found herself transported from doing the school run on the way to her perhaps ordinary council job, to making decisions in overflowing conference rooms with senior police officers, Porton Down chemical warfare experts and Whitehall representatives, the outcome of which could either prevent or mitigate the deaths of thousands of people.At times Daszkiewicz sits in her car with her head on the steering wheel, fighting back the tears and trying not to be overcome by the gravity of it all.Her agenda, quite simply was to protect the health of the people.As lockdown begins to be eased in Scotland, we know well enough that there is a balance between lives and livelihoods, health and the economy, mental and physical well-being, and consequence for the future.Decisions are being made daily as to how to ease the country back into a new normality in the most appropriate manner.These decisions are beginning to be politicised, and the old adversarial ways are beginning to rear their ugly heads in the chambers of our government.It is correct that decisions are scrutinised, and justication is asked for in public, but knee jerk criticism for political posturing is untimely, and often disingenuous.We are still very much in a public health crisis.The future is unknowable, and whatever path is taken, there will be negative consequences.It is not at all cut and dried or in any way unambiguous.Mark Twain popularised the quote “lies, damned lies and statistics”, but numbers are persuasive.If we are to believe the figures gleaned from the internet, England with  times the population has approximately  times the average daily new cases and hospital admissions, and  times the deaths.In England, the Westminster government is handling the crisis dferently, perhaps with a dferent agenda and a dferent emphasis on the balance between the health of the economy and the health of the population.Perhaps they have dferent priorities, but I have medic friends who are glad they live in Scotland, and worry how things might pan out south of the border.Lockdown couldn’t, and cannot last forever.The new normal must include commerce which must include tourism, but when I hear tourism representatives arguing for a reduction in the distance of social distances in order to protect jobs and businesses, I wonder, how many extra deaths should we allow in order to allow a pub to open.There are always dferent viewpoints and it takes real wisdom to be able to consider all perspectives.When the lobbyists and business sector leaders want relaxations to protect their interests, I hope they realise the bigger picture, and no decision which may preclude their ruin, would be taken lightly or flippantly.The collateral damage of closed down businesses I am sure will weigh heavily on the consciousness of our political leaders.I am reminded of a cartoon I have seen used in conflict resolution courses. Two people are looking at a number drawn on the floor from opposite angles, with the phrase “just because you are right doesn’t mean to say I am wrong”The number is of course a , or is it a  It is clear that the sliding and phasing of the opening of tourism and recreational facilities is to keep a slowly-slowly approach to prevent a flood of movement of people and the virus.They could have said folk with brown eyes are allowed out on Tuesdays and Thursdays, anything to stem a possible tide.An aspect of leadership is to be able to make dficult decisions, taking all criteria on board often in the face of criticism, trying to see the big picture in the face of uncertainty.A change of decision, a backtrack or U turn seems to be regarded as weakness by an opposition, although I have never understood why.Surely it shows strength of character to realise that a chosen path might not be the best, and that a dferent option might be better.There has been some discussion about female leaders acting dferently and perhaps more appropriately in the face of the current pandemic.I wonderSalisbury was lucky having a female director of health,the poisoning drama is to be believed. Tracy Daszkiewicz acted with incredible professionalism and complete integrity, with compassion and humanity.Political allegiances aside I believe that the same could be said of our own leader in Holyrood, a person doing an extraordinary job in an unprecedented situation.I wonderNicola Sturgeon sometimes stops her car puts her head on the steering wheel and weeps at the gravity of it all.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/hope-and-faith-scaled.jpg","title":"skye youngsters clock up more than 10000 miles for zambian school","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe Portree High students were challenged to clock up the miles and between them run or walk the distance between Skye and Lusaka, Zambia – home of the Hope and Faith Community School.Over the last two months pupils and teachers have completed , miles, easily surpassing their original ,-mile target.Now the youngsters have been challenged to add a further , miles before the term ends, and to add to the £ that has been brought in for the project.A donation of £ will pay for school meals for all pupils at the school, which has long established links to Skye.The school began in  with two pupils, but has since grown to help provide education – and a daily meal – for over  children on the outskirts of the Zambian capital..There have been exchange visits between the schools, and Portree teachers Neil Burrows and Tony Breen had been due to head to Africa at Easter, with two Zambian teachers ing to Skye in May.It is now hoped the exchange can go ahead in .Mr Breen, Portree’s deputy head, said the challenge had been a positive one – both for the charity and for the health and well-being of the pupils during lockdown.He added: “We are very pleased with the balance of work and wellbeing for the majority of our pupils.“Looking at our provision of online learning in comparison with the rest of Scotland, most parents have been happy with the dferent ways in which pupils have been learning # from watching teachers pre-made videos, google meets and chats, online quizzes, and even DIY science practicals.”.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Skye-golf-club-sconser.jpg","title":"green for go competitions off and running again at the isle of skye golf","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineSomewhat belatedly the competitions have commenced and it was to the ladies section that the honour of opening the season belonged.On a recent blustery Sunday a quartet of quines graced the fairways at Sconser and Sandi Beatson emerged from the pack to steal the headlines on day one.Playing off her #mark# of  two steady halves of  and  saw her record an opening day handicap-reducing gross score of  and an immediate #cut# from  to  so very well played and what a great start to her golfing season.Proxime accessit was Donalda Johnston with a gross score of  in this the first of five rounds to be played for the Ladies Championship.Incidentally in this same competition last year Sandi also recorded a victorious, handicap-reducing score of three under the Competitions Scratch Score* for the day. This time round she doubled that.A few days later and this time a quintet of girls flew in formation round the course again this time competing for the Lochalsh Ladies Stableford prize.Sandi Beatson, fresh from victory in the first competition of the season, registered her second straight win but on this occasion only by the very narrowest of margins # the dreaded #better inward half# which is a count-back method used to declare a result when scores are tied after  holes.The player with the better score for holes - is then declared to be the winner.Apparently, the weather conditions were favourable so it#s dficult to see why the recorded #numbers# were so comparatively poor against the par of the course.New club member Shona Jackson very nearly started off her campaign with victory but I#m sure that even after one bf she#ll be able to settle in and join our girls in chat, combat and competitions.By my calculations Sandi#s two loops were +pts whereas Shona#s were +pts and that my friends was how the result was decided.With the threat of the coronavirus still hanging over us the committee decided at short notice to add a Skye Community Response fundraising competition to the club fixture list to be played over a period of two days with all the entry fees being donated to that worthy local cause.Players both male and female could submit as many rounds as they liked in the two day period and despite the rather fy weather several took the opportunity to sharpen their respective games and submit more than one ##.Playing on day one Robbie Macaskill and Chris Hanley # the latter proudly brandishing a new set of sticks # ed the day#s best scores of pts in the Stableford format with the former easing the latter courtesy of the better inward half.Despite a rocky , prelude to his round Robert settled well toloop scores of  and .Chris was on fire on the first nine with a fine  but the old fella must have been eating too many chocolate bars during lockdown and faded to  #coming home#.Donnie Macphee took third place one point in arrears.Some of the boys ed next day for another bf and another contribution to the charitable cause of choice but it was Hamish Philp, who had apparently been #shooting the lights out# in the winter league, who ed the best score of the occasion # a blistering pts.Had the competition been an official #counter# for handicap purposes Hamish would have graciously received a reduction of a couple of shots from his current mark but the omens for his season look promising.A distant speck in the rear view mirror was Ryan Macaskill on pts with John Maclean weighing into bronze position courtesy of pts for his honest endeavour on the day.However, pause for drum roll.The award for #the moment# must go to Club Captain Kenny Macleod who bodaciously eagled the par  th hole # all yds of it # and into the prevailing wind too!One wonders how many stones or sprinkler heads the old boy#s ba# must have bounced off to propel him to the distant target in three miserly shots.This is not aggrandisement # it was a truly remarkable effort by the bodach!The most prestigious competition in the gents fixture list # the Club Championship # is coming soon and there should be better than average competition this time round in pursuit of the title won by Ryan Macaskill in .One can#t help noticing that the assimilation of the three young lads into the fold last year caused some of the higher single-figure handicappers to emerge from their possible casual slumber of complacency and do something to improve both their game and their handicaps to ward off the challenge from these youngsters.It worked and not just to the benefit of the players themselves but to the general enhancement of the playing calibre of the gents section of the golf club.Two qualying rounds will be played to determine the four successful candidates eligible to compete in knockout matchplay semi-finals in their quest to be crowned Club Champion and subsequently have their name added to the Roll of Honour in the clubhouse #it#s doors ever swing open again Emerging from this prolonged and enforced period of omphaloskepsis and procrastibaking one can confidently predict a healthy turnout of golfing gladiators irrespective of the weather!CSS or Competition Scratch Score is a reflection of the playing dficulty of the course based on the scores ed with the handicaps represented on any particular day.Stableford format awards points as follows. Eagle, two under parpts: birdie, one under parpts, parpts and bogey, one over parpt.This form of play is very popular as a very high score on one or two holes doesn#t ruin the player#s chances of winning as would be the case in medal or strokeplay competition.Generally speaking the better players prefer the former while the rest of us favour the latter!Par is the score expected to be recorded on the hole by a #scratch# player and is determined by the number of shots the player should take to reach the green then add on two for putts.A par can be three # one shot plus two putts four # two shots plus two putts or five # three shots plus two putts. .

While NIE Networks staff will still not be entering customers’ homes to obtain a meter read at this time, they will call at customers’ doors and ask them to read their meter while they wait. Meter readers will be able to take readings from meters located in outside positions as normal.NIE Networks is urging customers to protect its meter readers and themselves by continuing to observe social distancing protocols. Ben Cupples, Meter Reading Manager at NIE Networks, explained the importance of recording a precise meter reading for the customer.“Providing a precise meter reading will ensure that your electricity bills accurately reflect your consumption,” he said. “Our meter readers will call to your home and will record the reading you provide while we wait.“If you are unable to read your meter for any reason oryou are not at home when we call, we will leave a card with information on how to submit your meter reading online via the NIE Networks website, via email or over the phone.”Mr Cupples explained that while meter reading activity would resume it would only be carried out with the health and safety of the public and meter readers in mind.“The safety of our employees and customers is our utmost priority. “If you see our meter readers out and about, we would ask that you please help them by standing at least two metres away. Likewise, we will stand at least two metres from customers’ doors at all times.“We are continually reviewing how we undertake our meter reading activities in light of COVID- and we are looking forward to being able to resume our normal way of working with customers at some stage, but we will only make that decision when it’s safe to do so.” NIE Networks is reminding customers that you only need to submit your reading to either NIE Networks or your supplier – there is no need to do it twice. Customers unable to submit a meter reading will receive an estimated bill from their supplier based on their usage history.If a member of the NIE Networks team arrives at the door, they will always show identication.

The first localised lockdown in the UK was announced after Health Secretary Matt Hancock said around % of all positive cases in England were detected there over the last week.Non-essential shops have closed and schools will follow for at least two weeks for the city centre and some suburbs, with citizens advised not to make unnecessary journeys.Rev Monteith said he is now uncertain about when he canto Enniskillen to visit his parents, or when Leicester Cathedral can reopen.It#s quite sombre here, people are quite stunned, he told the Belfast .The city is quieter today but clearly not everyone has got the message so it#s not quite back to how it was in March or April.He noted how coronavirus death figures in Leicester during the worst parts of the pandemic were lower than expected, adding: Hospitals were pretty much managing to keep on top of things so this suddenly coming into the public arena has really surprised people.Places of worship in England were allowed to open for private prayer earlier this month, with full worship supposed to follow on July . In a very multicultural city like Leicester, that includes mosques, temples, churches and synagogues, he said. Private prayer has worked for some traditions, but in mosques you#re supposed to pray in public.This weekend many faith communities, including the Christian community, would have been able to have a much more normal sense of worship.The cathedral is now closed until further notice, and funerals will again have to be held outside with limited numbers.It sits at the burial site of Richard III, and just this week a large group of tourists had been welcomed inside. This was the first timethat any of us have been in a room with  or more people and there was a real delight and joy about it evenyou couldn#t shake hands or hug, Rev Monteith said.Initially lockdown was a big shock for us. We#ve been doing online weekly services and sometimes we get very signicant numbers of people, far more than would ever come to church. But there#s something about physical presence which is still important even though online offers new possibilities.Somehow we#re going to have to work with both of these realities moving forward.Offering hope to those dreading the latest restrictions, he said: I think I#ve noticed that this whole process has affected people very dferently. Some have found the space and the clear air to have been a delight, while other people have struggled incredibly.But the human spirit is incredibly resilient and hope has not died at all. If anything in Leicester we#ve learned over the years that hope is a gt that comes from community.That#s been my experience over the years,I find myself locked away in a dark place, often the way to get out of it is to break out and reach out.As Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced plans to spend billions on infrastructure projects, Rev Monteith said those in need must be included.A lot of the people who are being tested positive in Leicester come from BAME backgrounds, and people living in poverty and working in very low paid jobs.We#ve seen a way in which we as a society have revalued care workers who are also not paid very much. I suppose moving forward, in thinking about the type of society we want to try and create, I think church and faith leaders are up for playing their part in creating a much more equitable society.On Tuesday Matt Hancock told BBC Breakfast there was an unusually high incidence of coronavirus in children in Leicester.The Health Secretary said that while work was still being done to understand why Leicester had been so badly affected, extra testing had found under-s testing positive for the virus. He added that the decision to shut the city#s schools was made to try to halt further transmissions.

If they are all table service, that should alleviate any problems. It#s really important that government gives us a date. Regrettably, I do think this virus, and therefore social distancing, will be here for a very long time. We need government to help those businesses which just physically cannot reopen.Speaking on the Ulster Business Podcast, Janice Gault, chief executive of the Northern Ireland Hotels Federation, said while everyone is looking forward to coming back, there is a little bit of nervousness around it.We have discovered that people miss the type of product we provide, she said.But many spots, even those which are technically able to open their doors to serve food, will not open this weekend.The days of the shoulder-to-shoulder pub and back-to-back restaurant will not be with us for a while, Mr Neill says.There will be a responsibility on customers, businesses and staff to do everything to stop the spread of this virus.Mr Rana, whose company owns hotels such as The Crowne Plaza and Ibis in Belfast, said while the core of hotels won#t have changed, customers will start noticing dferences.Hotels are about hospitality ... the fundamentals won#t change. There will be more distance between yourself and fellow diners, but the real work is behind the scenes, he said. In our four star hotels, breakfast will be largely served. The buffet is a touch point we are trying to avoid.In the mid-market and budget hotels there will be a range of #to go# options, just presented in a dferent manner.Ms Gault says while businesses are now keen to bring staff back to work, getting through to March next year is going to be a challenge.Listen to the full podcast at www.ulsterbusinessBelfast Most ReadBobby Storey funeral a #kick in the teeth# for those who respected Covid- restrictions, claims DUP#I wish I had seen Noah when he left his bike outside my front door#Parades body #has no powers# to stop Twelfth marchesTop  speeding hotspots in Northern Ireland revealed as detections rise by % in yearDowned: the Larne tree that grew from seeds brought by the Spanish Armada ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It#s amazing how popular it was. With the Game of Thrones connection nearby, we#ve had people make a detour to go by the church and get a photograph.The tree was a runner-up in the Woodland Trust Tree of the Year awards in .They did look at the history at the time and said it was entirely plausible that the legend could in fact be true.Everyone in the parish has always been very fond of it and we#ve already been inundated with offers from people to make sure the tree lives on in some form. We will certainly be trying to do something like that, but the first priority is to make the area safe.It was in late May  when a fleet of  ships set sail from Spain to invade England, King Phillip II#s aim to overthrow Queen Elizabeth I and halt the rise of Protestantism.The story goes that gales had blown his ship hundreds of miles off course before it was wrecked off the coast of Northern Ireland. The sailor#s body washed up on the shores of Ballygally Bay in , where locals discovered the corpse and buried it in an unmarked grave at St Patrick#s Church.But his grave didn#t remain unmarked for long. A sapling sprouted and went on to stand there for over  years.It#s quite a tale and one which the locals around here love to tell, said Rev Benson.We#d be hopeful of finding out more about the history of it now it#s fallen.We could see on CCTV that the tree fell about half five in the morning. It was very calm so there was no storm damage as such.It#s now resting across some gravestones so we need to be careful about moving it.We had a tree surgeon come up and look at it and apparently the roots had gone. Unfortunately that#s it. It would have happened sooner or later and we#re thankful it happened when it did, with no-one around. It was just the weight of the tree that finally brought it over.But there#s no way we want to turn it into firewood, we#re much too fond of it for that.Once we examine the condition of the wood we#ll be looking into doing something with it. The trunk itself is quite a size and we want to use it to create something substantial for local people to remember it by. It deserves to be preserved.Rev Benson is now hopeful that a study of the site might bring some answers as to whether there#s any truth in the legend.There#s interest from an archaeologist who will be coming down to have a look and seethere#s anything underneath where the tree stood, said Rev Benson.Now that the tree is down we can let experts take a really good look at it, date it properly and seeindeed it did grow from the chestnuts in the pocket of a Spanish Armada sailor who may still lie beneath it.In the meantime, Rev Benson has urged people not to come along to the graveyard to salvage a piece of history. The graveyard is covered by CCTV and numerous people have already ignored the tape around the fallen tree to take wood and cuttings.We cannot stress enough that the tree is not safe, he added.We don#t want to close the graveyard, butpeople continue to ignore the warnings, that is unfortunately the action we will have to take. Anyone ignoring the tape is personally liable for any further damage to yourself or the gravestones, so please be careful.Belfast Most ReadBobby Storey funeral a #kick in the teeth# for those who respected Covid- restrictions, claims DUP#I wish I had seen Noah when he left his bike outside my front door#Parades body #has no powers# to stop Twelfth marchesTop  speeding hotspots in Northern Ireland revealed as detections rise by % in yearDowned: the Larne tree that grew from seeds brought by the Spanish Armada ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I realised it had to be his.Ms Crooks, who attended the north Belfast vigils for Noah on Sunday, immediately called the police at pm. A neighbour#s CCTV would later show Noah walking around the back of the Northwood Road, where there is access to a storm drain, which may or may not have been locked.They realised this must have been where Noah was last seen alive, she said.I#d obviously started a chain of events because then they were then able to find his clothes and helmet.Then the search and rescue teams appeared. They were here most of the night searching the area around my house, trying to work out where he went next.As a child who grew up here, I was asking myself #where would I have gone  What would I have done#  I just couldn#t work it out.She also revealed that she became very emotional when police officers called to collect Noah#s bicycle.When they took the bike away on Tuesday afternoon, I burst into tears, she said.I#ve had to take comfort from the fact that me coming across that bike brought the rescue team here to start the search. If I hadn#t brought them here, to this storm drain and this river, maybe they would never have found him.Ms Crooks, a classroom assistant, said she didn#t need to watch any of the news reports because she watched the search unfold in my front garden, my street and in my community.She also told how she met Noah#s aunt Niamh in her back garden and she said they would always be welcome at her home, should they wish to visit.Niamh and others came down to help in the search at one point and had made their own sandwiches, she said. Pastor Brian Madden, who was comforting the family, said #put those sandwiches away, we have got hot food for you, and tea and coffee#. As Brian later said, they didn#t want to encroach on anyone#s generosity.Ms Crooks said that, as a mother of two young boys, she could only imagine how Noah#s mother must be feeling at the loss of her son.You just believe your children are always going to be there with you, she said.Unfortunately that#s now not the case for Fiona. How she#s going to get over this, I just don#t know. I#m heartbroken for her and her family.It is still not known why Noah entered the drain, but police have said they do not believe there was any foul play.The funeral will take place at St Patrick#s Church in north Belfast at am on Wednesday.On Monday the Lord Mayor of Belfast, Frank McCoubrey, opened an online book of condolence in memory of Noah.He said: People from across the city have been deeply affected by the loss of young Noah, and their thoughts and prayers are with Noah#s mother and wider family circle at this devastating time.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bfa .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cba-ba-a-d-abea_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bfa .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cba-ba-a-d-abea_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bfa .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cba-ba-a-d-abea_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bfa .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cba-ba-a-d-abea_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bfa .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cba-ba-a-d-abea_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"VideoNorthern IrelandPrivate funeral to be held for schoolboy Noah Donohoe A private funeral will be held for tragic schoolboy Noah Donohoe on Wednesday, his family has announced.

He couldn#t have done it without the support from Mencap. The staff at Mencap have been brilliant to us and are always there for support. We have got to meet so many other families who were in a similar situation and could relate to what we were going through, which really helped. The workshops and training courses were a great help to me and my family.She said the latest milestone came after weeks of practice by her son.His feet never left the ground, but he was so determined to do it. Then suddenly his feet lted, and he was so excited, she said. He loves jumping now. We decided we would like to help raise as much as we can for Mencap so they can go on supporting other families like ours, and to also say thank you to Mencap for everything that they have done for us so far.The Covid- pandemic has meant the Children#s Centre has had to pause face to face support for families and provide as many services as possible online.Margaret Kelly, director of Mencap Northern Ireland, said: I just want to say a huge thank you to Lucius and Joanne for fundraising for Mencap. It means so, so much to us that our families so value our services that they are willing to fundraise on top of everything  they do.She added: Our extraordinary teams are working extremely hard in challenging circumstances to help many children and adults with a learning disability and their families in need of support during this dficult time. Lucius#s jumping is a very special #Move it for Mencap# challenge. It is really wonderful that Lucius and Joanne are helping us to transform the lives of other children with a learning disability and their families to help them build independent and fulfilling lives.Approximately , people in Northern Ireland have a learning disability, with Mencap also providing support to their families and carers with a helpline, online support services and lobbying.For further information on how to donate or take part in the fundraising campaign, visit northernirelaned.mencap.org.ukBelfast Most ReadBobby Storey funeral a #kick in the teeth# for those who respected Covid- restrictions, claims DUP#I wish I had seen Noah when he left his bike outside my front door#Parades body #has no powers# to stop Twelfth marchesTop  speeding hotspots in Northern Ireland revealed as detections rise by % in yearDowned: the Larne tree that grew from seeds brought by the Spanish Armada ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This was a % increase on the  figure .The fixed speed camera site on the Upper Newtownards Road in Belfast accounted for more than one-thirdof the , speeding detections by fixed cameras in .Over halfof all speed related detections were on mph roads.The highest speed recorded in  was mph. This was detected on the A Dunman dual carriageway near Cookstown, a mph road.Other bad examples included a driver caught at mph in a mph zone and another doing mph in a mph zone.RSP vans were deployed , times in , an increase of % on deployments in , partly explaining the rise in detections.The data is contained in the NI RSP#s latest annual bulletin. There are four fixed speed cameras, six fixed red light running cameras and one average speed enforcement camera system here. Eight speed camera vehicles also operate at ious locations throughout the region.The number of speed detections in  was more than four times the total recorded in  .The main reason was the reduction in the speed threshold at which a driver can be detected speeding. Additional sites for enforcement were also added in  and .Detections at fixed camera sites totalled , - down by % when compared with .The fixed site on the Upper Newtownards Road, Belfast, accounted for % of detections by fixed cameras, followed by Springfield Road, Belfast , Antrim Road, Belfastand Saintfield Road, Belfast . The Saintfield Road cameras had signicant downtime throughout .The number of detections at mobile camera sitesincreased by % between  and .This followed an increase in deployments of safety camera vans, resulting in more detections.The , other cases were detected by #average speed# cameras.Inspector Leech said everyone had a responsibility to make our roads safer.She added: Removing excess speed from the road safety equation should be the easiest thing that every road user can do. If we all stop speeding, more people live. If we all stop speeding, fewer people have to contend with le-changing injuries.All right-thinking and law-abiding motorists will realise that speed restrictions are not there to inconvenience them but to make our roads safer for everyone. Our aim is to prevent people from being seriously injured or killed. As speeding is considered one of the major causes in road traffic collisions, we make no apology for adopting a tough approach to enforcement.All motorists have a duty to drive in a responsible manner, butthey do not then we have a duty to detect and prosecute them.Infrasturcture Minister Nichola Mallon said: Unfortunately, for many families excessive speeding is persistently one of the main causes of death and serious injury on our roads and this is unacceptable.Speeding isn#t just about doing  or  miles per hour. It is about going too fast for the conditions.As a driver, it is your responsibility to adapt your driving - according to the weather, the type of road, your own ability and enough to expect the unexpected.So far  people have lost their lives on Northern Ireland#s roads this year.

There were definitely lots of botched jobs done during lockdown, she joked.We are high-fiving the women who didn#t do the botched colouring.Mrs Grufferty said the last number of weeks had been hectic as she prepared for reopening, with a range of new safety measures implemented, including screens and personal protective equipment. It#s been very expensive, she continued. It#s crippling for a business when they#ve not been making money but for the safety of my staff and also the customers that come in here, it was a no-brainer, we had to take that hit and just put that in.Realistically you can#t run your business and make sure everyone is protected and make sure your staff are protected without stuff like this so it was really dficult, but it has to be done.She said customers would notice many changes, including an appointment-only system.We also can#t give them a hug now, she added.Mrs Grufferty#s sister-in-law Kathleen was one of the first back into one of the salon#s chairs yesterday morning.I#m very excited to be back and feel normal again, she said.I was in at am this morning, it was great - one of the first.Bryant Jordan was also there early.

Objecting to bail, the officer said on June  McGonagle was warned about his behaviour and not to be intoxicated in a public place. googletag.cmd.push The court heard the -year-old has  previous convictions and two suspended sentences. There is an ‘extremely high risk of reoffending’, the officer added, ‘this man is incapable of not being intoxicated in a public place.’ Defence barrister Stephen Mooney said his client pleaded guilty to the offences before the court on Monday at the first opportunity and it was adjourned for a pre-sentence report. McGonagle was not in a position to be interviewed by the police due to his level of intoxication. Mr Mooney told the court that back in   the -year-old spent a ‘very signicant’ period of time in custody on remand. He was then found ‘unfit for trial’ because of his mental capacity and the prosecution was discontinued. The defence barrister said it is not so much a ‘fool’s pardon but a street drinker’s pardon’ as he is a well-known street drinker. His alcoholism is being criminalised because of his inability to stay sober, he added. Mr Mooney asked for bail to be granted with strict conditions attached. District Judge Peter King said ‘you’re absolutely correct’ and any bail conditions would have to include a prohibition on alcohol which would set him up for ‘spectacular failure’. He added that McGonagle may upset the ‘wrong person or group of people and find himself facing more dficulties’. The defendant was remanded in custody due to a ‘clear risk of reoffending’ to appear by way of video link on July .

Dean O’Neill, from Drumsurn, died suddenly last week and mourners at his funeral yesterday heard how the news had left the community in shock. “The church would be absolutely packed todaythings were normal,” said Fr Seamus Kelly, officiating at the funeral. “The tragic news that spread throughout the area on Thursday morning stunned the whole community. “He was one of the most gted sportsmen to emerge in Drumsurn in recent years and it was lovely to see all the young people with their shirts on as his remains were being carried in.” googletag.cmd.push  Dean, known around the community as ‘Floater’, excelled on the sports field and Fr Kelly described him as ‘one of the most gted sportsmen to emerge from Drumsurn in recent years’. In the colours of St Patrick’s College, Dungiven, he was outstanding and won a Derry vocational schools’ All-Star award in . He represented St Matthew’s GAC and Kevin Lynch Hurling Club and carried his talent with modesty. Fr Kelly recalled how he deflected praise after a notable victory at minor level. “He covered every blade of grass in defence and attack but didn’t want any great glory,” he told the congregation. googletag.cmd.push “When Drumsurn and Drum amalgamated as St Patrick’s at minor level a few years ago, he gave an exhibition of football as he dragged his team back into contention and eventually saw them defeat Glenullin having been nine points down at half time. “He declared humbly, ‘sure Micheacuteal Archibald deserves praise more than me’. He loved sport and played Gaelic, soccer, hurling and basketball with distinction for the school.”  Dean in the colours of Kevin Lynch Hurling Club. Off the pitch, Fr Kelly told mourners how Dean had a great sense of fun and spoke of his great love for his family and friends. “He tortured friends and relations with pranks and jokes. He was very close to all his cousins and friends and kept in touch with them,” he said. “When his brother, Justin, go married, he was best man for him and was godfather to their first child, Taylor. He absolutely doted on her, as indeed he did on all his nephews and nieces. “I know how proud Justin and Jordan were of their brother Dean, but they all have wonderful memories as have Gertie, Rory and wider family and friends. “He met a lovely girl in Amber and it looked like they would settle down for good. Of course, he was not known as Dean, it was just ‘Floater’ to all his friends who loved him so much. “In recent times, he had settled a lot and went to live in Dungiven, although, he always insisted, he was a Drumsurn man.” Fr Kelly spoke of the great sadness within the community following his passing. “I’m well aware that Drumsurn is in a state of mourning, as Dean was so well-known and loved here,” he said. “However, we have a promise that death is not the end, but another step on the journey to eternal le. “Everyone who knew him, or even met him, loved him. He had an amazing personality that endeared him to all and had a relentless sense of fun. “To young and old, he was a legend. It has been the most common remark uttered over the past few days. What a character.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Public services will be held in many local churches today for the first time in months. There will be many restrictions in place to protect worshippers from possible coronavirus infection. Catholic Bishop of Derry, Doanl McKeown, welcomed the resumption of services but urged people to take care. “I hope that we have learned lessons about le since we were locked down in March,” he said. “This is a time to cherish those lessons and not to allow the insights to be lost in a tsunami of going back to the future. googletag.cmd.push “We have seen what has happened in those places where there has been a stampede to forget we escaped from worse consequences through self-discipline. “It will take many people time to overcome the fear of mixing again. “We want our churches to be places where people can share the infectious good news of the Gospel – but avoid being Corona-infected through selfishness and carelessness. “We have to begin cautiously. “In all areas of human le, short term gain can lead to long-term pain.” The Church of Ireland Bishop of Derry and Raphoe, Rt Rev Andrew Forster, has also appealed to parishioners to be patient and understanding as their churches get ready for the resumption of public worship. googletag.cmd.push “Although in Ireland, at the moment, the virus seems very much under control – which we’re so thankful for – we know the virus is still there,” Bishop Andrew said. “We’ve been given the freedom to meet again [from Monday], but we know that with freedom comes responsibility. “At the moment, going back to church places a lot of responsibility on you and on me, on select vestries and on clergy, and on all those who will attend churches because we’ve got to follow all the public health guidelines and we’ve got to follow the guidelines that the Church of Ireland has put together for that. “I really welcome the opportunity to be back at church but I want you to know that there’s no set date by which this may happen, because select vestries – and clergy in particular – have to make sure that in their parishes it’s right and it’s appropriate and it’s safe to open, and that’ll take time.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Despite not yet being built, the futuristic eco-house, which is called The Qube, has gone up for sale in the Prehen area of the Waterside with a price tag of pound,. The five-bedroom property called The Qube will be built on land beside the Everglades Hotel. It has been advertised as one of Northern Irelands only passive houses, which means it will use very little energy and leave a small ecological footprint. The three-story dwelling will also be a smart home and the lights, heating and blinds can all be operated from a tablet or smartphone. googletag.cmd.push  The , sq ft building will be locatedon a triangular piece of landat the junction of Prehen Road andHazelwood Avenue. This heavily-wooded area is home to a number of mature trees which arecovered by a Tree Preservation Order . Although work on the property is yet to begin, it has full planning permission. However, the journey to obtaining this was not a smooth one. In Northeern Ireland, local councils are responsible for most planning decisions. Each council has planning officers who make recommendations about planning applications. However, the Planning Committee, which is made up of councillors, has the option to reject these recommendations. googletag.cmd.push The planning application for The Qube first came before Derry City and Strabane District Councils Planning Committee last September. Council planners provided councillors with a detailed report which recommended that planning permission be refused for the building.  The meeting was also told that  letters of objection had been sent by local residents. Among their concerns werethe destructionof ancient woodland and mature trees and the suggestion that the buildingis out of character and proportion with theexisting neighbouring properties. The report said thatthe building went ahead it would have adversely affected thecharacterandenvironmental quality of theof thesurrounding area through the loss of an important and well establishedurban woodland greenspace. Councillors agreed to defer the decision for a site visit, which took place on September  last year and which was attended by seven councillors. On September , the Planning Committee voted not toaccept the recommendation to refuse the planning application and agreed to reconsider itfurther information on the Tree Protection Order was provided. The council sent out additional notications to all neighbours, objectors and supporters ofthe scheme in January this year and  more letters were received, with six in objection to the application and  in support. The letters in support said the site was an eyesore and the owner of the proposed building would have a vested interest in maintaining it. On March  this year, the Planning Committee met again and was told council planners had not changed their position that planning permission should be refused. The Principal Planning Officer told elected members an Arboriculture Impact Assessment had been carried out which broadly agreed with the initial recommendation that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate the proposed scheme would not have a detrimental impact on the Tree Preservation Ordersite. DUP Alderman Hilary McClintock, who attended the site visit, told the meeting she did not believe the protected trees would be affected by the proposed building. She proposed to overturn the decision of the planning officer and for approval to be granted subject to conditions provided by planners. The proposal was seconded by SDLP councillor Angela Dobbins and was passed after seven votes for, three against and three abstentions. On Friday, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council confirmed that that an application for the Prehen building came before the Planning Committee in September  with a recommendation to refuse as it would result in the loss of a valuable urban woodland green space and the applicant had failed to demonstrate that this dwelling would not have an adverse impact on existing trees. The recommendation was not accepted by elected members and the application came back before the committee on March of this year as a reconsidered application, following a visit to the site by elected members and the submission of further information, said the spokesperson. Whilst the officers presented an unaltered opinion to refuse, elected members voted to approved the application.” The sale of The Qube, which was designed by architect Gerard McPeake, is being handled by McGuinness Fleck Estate Agents   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ciaraacuten McShane died last Monday as a result of a road collision on a stretch of the M motorway in County Louth. On Sunday, mourners at the Church of St John the Baptist heard how the -year-old father-of-two had been working to establish a family home for what he called his ‘wee unit’. Fr Charles Kearney told those gathered for his funeral that the former Crossroads PS and St Paul’s pupil had a great sense of humour. googletag.cmd.push “The fourth and youngest of his family, he turned out to be great craic, very quick-witted,” he said. “He had many, many friends. He was a good son and brother. When he began to go out and about, he ended up in Maghera, in Walsh’s Hotel, where he met the love of his le. “They were together for eleven years, and six, of course, as man and we. They have two beautul children, Conan and Carina.” The congregation heard how Ciaraacuten, a plumber by trade, lived for a Sunday, which he designated as a day to be spent with his young family. googletag.cmd.push “Another important thing for Ciaraacuten was a Sunday,” said Fr Kearney. “Sunday was his family day and he played with the children. They watched movies and had great fun together. He adored them and they adored him. “He had built his own house and was working to establish a good family home for his ‘wee unit’. He was a real family man and he is going to miss so many firsts. “One was coming up very soon, when Conan starts school just across the road in September. In his short le, Ciaraacuten McShane brought so much love, joy and goodness to people. “He most certainly will be rewarded for all of that.” Local Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Councillor, Sean Bateson, described Ciaraacuten as a ‘proper gentleman, one of the good guys in le’. Pearse’s GAC, Kilrea, where Ciaraacuten played football in his younger days, said they were ‘deeply saddened’ by his passing. “Ciaran played underage with the club and then came back to kit out for the reserves on many occasions. “One thing that everyone will tell you about Ciaran was that he always had a big smile on his face and his sense of humour was infectious.” Ciaraacuten will be sadly missed by his we Shauna, their children Conan and Carina, his parents Bertie and Patricia and siblings Siobhaacuten, Damian and Odraacuten and all his wider family and friends. Fr Kearney summed things up by telling mourners to look back on all Ciaraacuten achieved. “Sometimes bad things happen accidentally, and we know that’s part of le, but it’s devastating when it happens. “We should look back at his years among you and see what he achieved, and it was much.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Those behind the ambitious project are confident that the ious stories will appeal to both locals and visitors alike.Other interpretative  will tell of the emigration of families from Saintfield to the United States over the last  years, using the example of the three Maffett brothers who left Leggygowan for America, the first in , followed by a further two brothers in .It is one of their descendants, David Moffett, who has made this precious community asset possible.Saintfield Development Association officials, who played a lead role in securing the new community centre, approached the owners of the Windmill Road field and began protracted negotiations to secure the site, with the all-important funding to acquire the land obtained through Mr Moffettrsquos generous donation.A successful business executive with a well-known company in America, his family had links with the area dating back to the early th century, with Mr Moffettrsquos ancestral, family including James and Isabella Maffett and their children, buried in the graveyard at Saintfield Parish Church.Explaining the background to the heritage park proposal, a spokesman for the Development Association explained that a successful funding bid was submitted to the Heritage Lottery Fund for money to carry out necessary feasibility studies on the field.ldquoThese studies have since been completed to the satisfaction of the funder and have shown that there are no impediments for the field to be developed as a community heritage park, he explained.ldquoThese studies will also provide evidence for the necessary planning application for the change of use of the field from agricultural to community use.The spokesman also confirmed that consultants who carried out the feasibility studies of the field also compiled a list of proposals for the development which include measures to obviate as much as possible any disruption or annoyance to neighbouring residents through noise or anti-social behaviour.Public consultation on the proposals will be undertaken once the current pandemic restrictions are sufficiently eased and, following this process, the Development Association intends to raise the funds needed to implement the agreed proposals by applying for suitable grants.There will also be community fundraising.In addition, Newry, Mourne and Down Council has been asked to approve a new link being created between the community centre and proposed heritage park. The issue was under discussion prior to the coronavirus pandemic.Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess has praised all those involved in the project and hopes that the remaining pieces in the development jigsaw fall into place.ldquoThis is a terric development that not only local people can enjoy, but one which visitors to the town can also enjoy and learn so much about Saintfield and its people, he said.ldquoWe are fortunate to have the new community centre up and running and developing a new heritage park would represent further success for the town. Great credit must go Saintfield Heritage Society and townrsquos hardworking Development Association.Cllr Burgess added Saintfield was ldquovery fortunate to have extremely committed community iniduals who have the town and its people very much at heart.Full details of the proposes heritage park proposal are available at discoversaintfield..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Butler look after royalty and presidents  ","story":"FRANCIS McBriar has been a butler to four generations of the Royal Family, served US and Irish presidents and Northern Ireland Secretaries of State.However, he has only one mantra in his mind every time he dons his smart unorm mdash and that is he treats everyone the same.The farmerrsquos son who lives just outside Saintfield with his we Heather has butlered for  years. For those in the know, hersquos the man to reach out foryou have a special occasion or dinner event coming up.Regularly employed by the Earl of Erne at his Fermanagh residence, Crom Castle, Francis was recently featured doing what he does best in the RTE food series, Lords and Ladles.The  year-old was introduced to Hillsborough Castle, the Royal Familyrsquos official residence when they are in Northern Ireland, by the castlersquos late and highly regarded former house manager, David Anderson.ldquoI wouldnrsquot be where I am today without David Anderson, itrsquos as simple as that, said Francis.ldquoWe met through First Saintfield Church which David joined when he moved into the area. We were part of a group looking after senior people of the congregation and we would have worked together hosting dinners and bus outings and so on.ldquoOne day David turned to me and said, lsquoFrancis you are a very adaptable person, you could be a great help to meyou would like to bersquo.ldquoI was invited up to Hillsborough Castle to work with him and things just took off from there. I enjoy working with people and always went out with the intention of helping others and to make sure that they enjoyed their day, or their dinner. I also always found it easy to chat away to people.At that time, Francis was working as a distribution manager for a group of fashion shops and was the father of three young children with no thoughts of a future career in butlering.Today, he works mostly at Crom Castle and, closer to home, at Montalto House in Ballynahinch, but also looks after an American family when they travel to the British Isles.They take Francis wherever they go, sometimes to the Scottish Highlands and hopefully inSeptember to their Dorset property.ldquoIrsquom hoping that it still happens, admits Francis, whose work, like many others, has been affected by the Covid- pandemic.ldquoI really enjoy it and I love to travel. It doesnrsquot bother me being away from home for maybe several weeks at a time. My family are grown up with families of their own and I think my we is quite content to see me going out and about as she gets her head showered.He and Heather have three children, Robert, Anita and James, and a grandchild, George, who will be one year old soon. A second grandchild is due any day now.Having, in his words, ldquolooked after the late Queen Mother, the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh, their children and Prince Charlesrsquo children, the likes of President Bush, Irish presidents Mary McAleese and Michael D Higgins, Francis admits his disappointment at missing out on meeting Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge.He said: ldquoItrsquos been lovely to look after the Royal Family and a few years ago I was invited up to look after Prince William. I was so looking forward to looking after the couple but unfortunately that was the day the Duchess announced she was pregnant with Prince Louis and couldnrsquot fly over. So I missed that opportunity and would have loved to have met Kate.He believes that having served royalty, he can serve anyone and his nerve has never let him down so far.ldquoI think perhaps once you have attended to the people at Hillsborough Castle, it takes any nerves away, said Francis. ldquoYou think wellI can serve the Queen, then I can serve anyone. No-one is better than anyone  in my eyes. I just go in and do my best for whoever Irsquom looking after.For most people, the role of butler is quite rare today but in the days of stately and larger homes a bulter was the head male servant in a large household and his job was to manage the work of all the other servants.Francis agrees that his role is similar to that of the most famous butler in recent times, Carson, from the hit TV series and movie, Downton Abbey.ldquoThe whole point of being a butler is be unobtrusive but close at hand in the backgroundyou are needed. You need to judge when not to overstay your welcome when you are at the table.ldquoWhat happens there, stays there. I suppose I have developed a reputation for being discreet and I try to be. I would never tell others the conversations I hear around the table. As far as Irsquom concerned, everything is private.ldquoI treat everyone the same, no matter what their position in le, These people are paying my wages. I believe that nobody is better than anyone . If they are there at the table, then Irsquom there to look after them.Unlike Carson, who had to extract Lady Mary out of a number of compromising situations, Francis has never come across anyone who was the worst for wear for drink or found in an embarrassing situation.ldquoI must admit that in the circles I would be in, Irsquove never come across anyone over-indulging. My job is really to be able to turn my hand to anything and to look after people. The butler is really in charge of the household. When I go to work at Crom Castle, the Earl tells me lsquoFrancis, yoursquore in charge, itrsquos over to yoursquo.Working with some of the best chefs around, Francis admits that hersquos been treated to some delicious dining experiences through his work.ldquoI honestly donrsquot see what I do as work. Itrsquos not workyou love what you do, he said..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Developers asked to show interest in Irish Street site  ","story":"DEVELOPERS will shortly be asked to submit expressions of interest in transforming a major site in the heart of Downpatrick to help bolster the townrsquos economic recovery.The Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council are driving ambitious plans to redevelop a near two acre site encompassing the former Irish Street police station, a number of adjacent empty buildings and the local authority-owned car park.While it was feared that the coronavirus pandemic could delay plans to redevelop of the huge site, work has continued on the project with a new brochure produced to provide would-be developers and other interested parties with an overview of the sitersquos potential and secure expressions of interest.The development site stretches as far back as St Patrickrsquos Avenue and is also adjacent to the Irish Street car park, with council officials looking to make the brochure available to the public virtually.Described as a ldquostrategic and prominent location in the heart of Downpatrick, senior council officials, politicians and members of the business community are excited at the Irish Street sitersquos development potential and are working towards drawing up a development brief.While the former police base enjoys protected status, it is hoped that potential developers will be able to come up with an imaginative plan for the historic building and that a preferred bidder will be appointed as early as October and as late as the end of the year.The council and the Department for Communities are keen to revitalise Irish Street and hope its redevelopment will act as a catalyst for the wider economic and social regeneration of the town.Council officials say that the Irish Street project is vital to the recovery of the local economy, improving the wellbeing of the community and a welcome confidence boost for the construction sector.In addition, they insist that theyrsquore committed to working with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the site and want to hear their feedback on the way forward.The steering group set up to oversee the Downpatrick scheme held a recent progress meeting and council chairwoman Laura Devlin said she was delighted with the projectrsquos momentum.She confirmed that councillors and local authority officials have been working with the Department for Communities and local stakeholders to develop an lsquoonline engagement processrsquo.She explained this is designed to inform the preferred end uses for the Irish Street site and allow key stakeholders to have input into the development brief which is critical to the success of the project.ldquoWhile the Downpatrick regeneration scheme is in the early developmental stages, it will also stimulate signicant investment for the local economy, she added.John Armstrong, from the Construction Employers Federation, said the scheme and a number of others the council is planning for the Newry area, will provide a boost for the local construction sector.South Down MP Chris Hazzard and Downpatrick councillors Dermot Curran and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed the progress being made on redeveloping he site.Mr Hazzard described the regeneration project as a ldquounique and exciting opportunity, one which has the potential to unlock much-needed economic and social opportunity for the town centre and wider community.ldquoThis regeneration project must act as a catalyst for the long overdue expansion of the townrsquos evening and weekend economy its new heartbeat in some respects, he continued.ldquoGiven the sitersquos close proximity to nearby homes, the project must also be viewed as more than a commercial development. It must seek to bind together the town centre with the outlying housing developments and consequently look to improve the economic and social wellbeing of the local community.Cllr Curran agreed that the Irish Street site offered a ldquounique opportunity for the development of business, employment and tourism.He thanked council committees and Department for Infrastructure for supporting the project.He said: ldquoThe Irish Street project represents the single biggest change to the town centre in a generation. It has the potential to transform Downpatrick and itrsquos vital everyone works together to make the regeneration proposal a major success.ldquoThe planned redevelopment is one of the most important projects ever proposed for Downpatrick and it is vital to make the most of the opportunities it presents. The proposal has the potential to add a new vibrancy with local people helping shape how this key site will be transformed.Cllr Hanlon said she was pleased that the next stage of the sitersquos redevelopment is ready for launch, allowing potential developers and interested parties an opportunity to view the site online, with feedback from the local community welcomed.ldquoPeople will be able to give their views on the potential for the site and the likely constraints within any proposed project, she explained. ldquoAny feedback would be used to assist both the council and Department for Communities to prepare a development brief for the site.Cllr Hanlon added: ldquoThe project to redevelop the former police base and surrounding area provides an opportunity to reinvigorate the Downpatrick town centre. This is the opportunity of a generation to restore a vibrant town centre and will build on the ongoing regeneration of the Irish Street area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"DNA testing plans to catch owners over dog fouling  ","story":"DOG owners who fail to clean up after their pets could soon find themselves in court after local politicians agreed to investigate the potential of using DNA testing to catch offenders.Newry, Mourne and Down Council officers have been instructed to examine the merits of testing dog dirt in a bid to trace animals whose owners allow them to use public areas as open air toilets.Under the scheme, a sample of dog dirt would be taken for analysis to trace the identity of the animal, with the owner being subsequently prosecuted.Agreement for officers to research the DNA issue was given at last weekrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee following a proposal tabled by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown.Dog dirt poses a major health risk, especially to children, who could potentially lose their sight as a result of coming into contact with it.Cllr Brown said there was a need to consider innovative ways of tackling the issue which has been raised on a regular basis by elected representatives across the local authorityrsquos seven DEAs.He is keen for the local authority to investigate the viability of using DNA testing in a bid to identy offenders and aid enforcement officers to dish out fines, suggesting that council officers draw upon best practice from other organisations who have introduced such a scheme in a bid to crack down on the dog fouling issue.Council officials say they will need to understand the time and resources required to implement such a scheme before compiling a report on its potential implementation.Cllr Billy Walker has welcomed the decision to investigate the DNA issue and says he cannot understand why dog owners to do not clean up after their pets.He said that the problem was district-wide and hoped that offenders will end up being prosecuted.ldquoI am an advocate of naming and shaming people on this particular issue but it is not a road which the council has been keen to go down. However,we use DNA technology to catch dog owners who allow their pets to foul public areas, their identity will be made publicthey end up in court, he continued.ldquoDog fouling problem is a highly contentious issue and, without doubt, one of the single most complained about problems across our district. It is something that we have not yet to got to grips with, but perhaps the new initiative under consideration will change that.Cllr Walker said it was important to remember that the overwhelming majority of dog owners across the district cleaned up after their pets, but there was a hardcore who did not.He added: ldquoWe have talked about this issue for years and the problem has not diminished in any way.

We’ll not be doing congregational singing or communion as we had done previously. “We need to communicate to our flock exactly what they’ll be coming to, so that we can manage expectations. We are trying to provide something to feed the soul and not entirely alienate a church-going population who are used to their own way of doing things. “We will rely on people’s goodwill a lot. People are hungry to go back to church. They realise that it can’t be the same, just as they realise that going to Sainsbury’s isn’t the same as it used to be.”He added: “Churches would have a fair number of older, faithful congregational members. We know that they will come as soon as the doors are opened. Whether they should is an entirely dferent question. So we need to make sure we are doing things as safely as we can for the folks that are going to come.”During lockdown the church harnessed modern technologies to hold Bible study groups, prayer meetings and record an online Sunday service.Rev McConnell said: “I would say a fair percentage of those things will continue even after lockdown really eases. We’ve found it has opened up new channels of communications for us, people have tuned in who haven’t been to church for years.”Presbyterian churches are also putting safety first with the majority targeting a resumption of worship from mid-July to early August.Cregagh Presbyterian Church was among the first to announce it would be holding a service on Sunday, July .Rev Trevor Gribben, general secretary of the PCI said: “We look forward to being able to meet again, with our brothers and sisters in Christ, while ensuring that the required health and safety principles are met.” He said any decision when to resume services would be a local decision taken by the minister and elders together.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Please try again later.Submitting...To argue so is firstly, to place more importance on public safety than public worship. It reveals how little value is placed on public worship secondly, it demonstrates a lack of faith in God. Is He not in control of every situation The fearful, panicked response of many professing Christians — closing churches, depending on hand sanitisers and face masks — exposes their supposed faith in God as shallow and open to the ridicule of unbelievers. This reaction arises from shallow and unbiblical theology. The Biblical doctrine of the absolute sovereignty of God, that He has ordained whatsoever comes to pass and orders all things for His own glory has been rejected by the modern church in favour of the unbiblical Arminian dispensational teaching of the free will of man and his own natural ability. One of the core pillars of this teaching is the rejection of the absolute sovereignty of God in all things. It teaches man to rely upon himself and his ability, hence in the present situation professing Christians look to face masks etc rather than the God Who is in complete control of their lives and the affairs of the whole world thirdly, to acknowledge the ability or authority of the state to direct or govern the affairs of the church is to deny the Kingship of Christ over the church.What a low and miserable state must the church presently be in to be reduced to meekly waiting on the permission of an executive, including a party that is so close to the IRA, in order to resume public worship.

to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh

who have supported our campaign, including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the A to reduce flood risk.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquolsquoFollowing our meeting on May  Sir David Henshaw chairman of NRW wrote to me on May  to say that NRW received

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

These include:Communication of health information, and how effective it isCultural issues relating to the suitability of health and social services for BAME communitiesIncome and employment insecurity, which is experienced disproportionately by BAME communitiesPoor quality of ethnicity data, which is preventing accurate analysisHousing overcrowding and environmentThe financial burden created by migration statusThe role of structural and systemic racism and disadvantage.The report is by the BAME Covid- expert advisory group, set up by First Minister Mark Drakeford to look at the reasons why people from BAME communities were more likely to be adversely affected by coronavirus.:One of its two sub-groups was tasked with examining the socio-economic factors, chaired by Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna, professor of management and organization at Cardf Business School, Cardf University.\"Therersquos an overall theme running through our research for this report. It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females.

across the borough would be reopening.“Gosford generates businesses for Markethill and we want to see that opening up as well as a site in Clare Glen,” said the Alderman.“A lot of people will want to be out and about andit can be done safely at these sites, it should be.”In response to these comments, Council’s strategic director,Mark Parkinson, confirmed caravan sites at both Gosford Forest Park and Clare Glen would open from Friday, June .“Gosford will open on June  and so will Clare Glen,” said Mr Parkinson.“The site at Kinnego will reopen on Friday, July , and at all these sites the caravan, camping, toilet and shower facilities will be available.”SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon askedthose who had made bookings before the outbreak of the COVID- pandemic and subsequently had their bookings cancelled, were being contacted to ensure they could still avail of the service.“Some people had booked their slots at these sites early in January and paid for them,” said Cllr O’Hanlon. “They were quickly refunded during the outbreak and that was good and the right thing to do but have we made contact with those people now “They had been on the ball and made their bookings early, it wouldbe a shamethey were now to miss out, when the sites have reopened, through no real fault of their own.”His question went unanswered on the night and when the Local Democracy Reporting Service asked Council for an answer, a spokesperson said it is working to accommodateall bookings.“As Council begins to reopen its caravanning and camping facilities at Clare Glen, Gosford Forest Park and Kinnego Marina, we are working with the public to accommodateall bookings where possible based on reduced capacity and in compliance with social distancing and PHA guidance,” said a Council spokesperson.“We will continue to keep this under review.”\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\"
