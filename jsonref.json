Here, he tells Sophie Goddard how he’s keeping not only his pub afloat, but is helping out the people – and animals – around him, too ...For thousands of small business owners, the global pandemic has flung their futures – and those of their staff – into uncertainty. That’s certainly true for Graham Blaikie, and his pub the Mercat Grill in Whitecraig, Scotland. “I’d been watching the news about Covid-19 since December and luckily we’d prepared,” he explains. “Even before we closed, we had contactless hand sanitisers and I was always wiping down handles and menus. I’d also removed items from tables, so there weren’t as many touch points.” But when Boris Johnson’s March announcement saw pubs and restaurants close to the public, the business that had taken Blaikie nine years to build was suddenly forced to adapt for survival.The first step was ensuring customers could still enjoy the food they loved. “Prior to the shutdown, we’d been talking about what our strategy would be – I bought containers and had our takeaway menu prepped, so we were ahead of the game”, he says of being ready for business the next day. “We had a lot of fresh food in the pub, so on the Saturday we started the takeaway system.” But it wasn’t without its problems. “It’s not as easy as you think doing takeaway food, especially restaurant-style. When people order with us they’re having haggis cigars, patties, fish and chips, pepper beef with rice and my mum’s desserts ... that’s six different containers at least. We spent about £2,000 on takeaway boxes initially, that’s a lot of money. But it’s hopefully keeping us going.”With the government support package now in place – and extended until October – Blaikie has turned his attention to helping local people. Launching his Soup(er) Hero campaign in April, he is now making soup and sandwiches for those in need. With help from the community council, a community hub – where food is dropped off and distributed by local volunteers – was born. The feedback keeps him going. “There’s an older couple and the wife’s got cancer and every day they get their soup and sandwich,” he says. “They have the soup at 12 o’clock, then the man drives his wife to the hospital for her treatment and when they come back, they enjoy the sandwich. That’s what makes it worthwhile.”It’s not just people benefiting, either – residents of Edinburgh zoo are also tucking into the pub’s surplus wares. “I had a massive box of bananas left over and my mum said: ‘You should take this to the zoo.’ So I got hold of all my leftover fruit and knocked on the zoo door – and that’s been it ever since.” Now Blaikie’s weekly deliveries of fruit, vegetables and fish help to feed the animals at a time when visitors – the zoo’s main form of income – have come to a standstill. “You’d probably choose not to eat some of the bananas, for example, because they don’t look as good, but they’re perfectly fine for the animals. When we’re making sandwiches, not everybody likes the heels of the bread either, so I freeze them and take them along – nothing’s getting wasted. And if I see something for a good price at the wholesalers – apples, cabbages, broccoli - I’ll pick that up, too. We need to keep zoos going, they’re all under a lot of pressure.”While it’s difficult to ascertain when exactly businesses such as Blaikie’s will open again, for now, he is focusing on adapting the way they work to ensure business is possible. “We have an isolated table in the front vestibule area, so people can come in and collect food safely, using contactless on the card machines for takeaways. We have separate areas for drivers to sit in too, so we’re doing everything we can.” And plans are already afoot for when pubs are finally allowed to reopen. “I’m looking at adding an area to the outside, so people can sit there the whole year round and I’m hoping to put in a little microbrewerydistillery, so I could eventually make hand sanitiser further down the line.”Why focus on helping others when keeping his own business afloat requires such effort? “I believe in helping people. I know this virus is a horrible thing, but it’s bringing out a lot of good in people as well. Neighbours are looking after neighbours, people are helping others with shopping or taking dogs for a walk. For so long, I didn’t like the way the world was going ...”What does Blaikie hope will come out of this situation? He pauses, then says: “That people start to work together a bit more, being more thoughtful of what’s going on around them. And of course, that they come to the Mercat for a meal.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

The rats we have in the centre of Sydney are the same species as in New York … They are wholly dependent on us. If they produce babies they can’t support, they kill them. Or one of their relatives comes in and kills them.“They will eat other rats that die, for sure. It’s hard to say whether they will go and kill another rat. They will not let a meal of another rat go by.”Milton said this had driven rats into new areas.“They have moved into the suburbs, closer to residential now,” he said. “We are having a big spike in residential rodent control.“It’s got colder quicker this year as well. It is coming on to winter where they need somewhere warm to sleep. They usually get into roof voids in people’s houses, because they can climb up brick walls or they can leap from overhanging trees above peoples’ houses. They can leap about three or four foot.”However, Banks said that people should not worry about hordes of rats in their homes, as the overall rat population would have dropped under lockdown.“Rats are probably the big losers from Covid-19,” he said. “The rat population would have been knocked down a lot. It will probably be a pretty typical winter. There are not going to be waves of rats running across the suburbs trying to get into people’s houses.“But people will be seeing them in houses now, because that is the only place where there is food. If we leave bins out , they will thrive off that.”Both he and Milton predicted city rat levels would swiftly rebound once offices and restaurants opened again, and people went back to work.“They respond to food within days,” Banks said. “If you give them a burst of food, that can turn into babies in three weeks’ time, no worries. They usually go through a winter lull, so that is not normally their breeding time. But if we are out in springtime or late winter, out there spilling food, they will be there to exploit it.”“There will probably be a new plague of rats take over the city,” he said. “But a lot of the ones that are left unattended in suburbia will stay there. They usually eat dog food and all that, because people leave dog kibble out all night. They’ve got ready made meals really.”Banks said that rats would “be back”.“What they do is, the adults just stop having babies. The mortality rates will go up, but there will be survivors. There will be some who get by. Those will keep the population going, so once the garbage comes back, those survivors will repopulate the urban rats again. Breeding will go up, they will have bigger litters. They’ll be back.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67492d0938f724752526e0032751cb611006b4c2/0_2_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58a29b0dca8b91b6a01f06ae8f148828","title":"boeing coronavirus airline industry travel job losses","story":"Boeing is cutting more than 12,000 jobs through layoffs and buyouts as the coronavirus pandemic seizes the travel industry, and more cuts are coming.One of the nation’s biggest manufacturers will lay off 6,770 US employees this week, and an additional 5,520 workers are taking buyout offers to leave voluntarily in the coming weeks.The layoffs are expected to be concentrated in the Seattle area, home to Boeing’s commercial-airplanes business.

We have a common aim – to support households and businesses through the disruption and minimise any longer-term consequences.\u0026nbspThe Bank’s policy committees have taken a range of actions since the onset of the pandemic in support of this goal.\u0026nbsp• The Covid corporate financing facility, launched with the government, is helping large businesses continue to pay their staff and suppliers by offering them cash for their corporate debt.• The financial policy and prudential regulation committees are supporting the ability of banks and building societies to provide credit by temporarily allowing them to hold lower financial buffers, called capital, for each £1 they lend. Our tests of the major UK banks show they are strong enough to continue lending. Doing so will support the economy and limit their own losses.We are now entering a second phase of the pandemic.\u0026nbspSocial distancing measures have begun to be relaxed.\u0026nbspAs a result, some companies will be able to resume working.\u0026nbspThe Bank is monitoring a wide range of data to give us a timely read on the economy during this phase.\u0026nbspThis includes high-frequency indicators – such as the number of journeys by train, plane and automobile, measures of retail footfall, and internet searches for hotel and restaurant bookings – as well as card payments data and new weekly surveys of businesses and households.We have seen some increase in road travel since social distancing measures were eased earlier this month. Most other indicators remain at subdued levels – most likely because it is too soon to expect to see any meaningful impact. However, it is also possible that the pace at which activity recovers will be limited by continued caution among households and businesses even as official social distancing measures are relaxed.No one can be sure exactly how the pandemic will unfold.\u0026nbspThere are reasons to believe that economic activity will return at a faster pace than in many past recessions, but this depends on how the measures continue to be eased, what degree of natural caution is shown by people, and how much longer-term damage is done to the economy.\u0026nbspThe risks are undoubtedly on the downside for a longer and harder recovery.The Bank has taken unprecedented actions in terms of their scale and speed.\u0026nbspI believe these actions are working.\u0026nbspAt a time when a sharp increase in borrowing, by firms and the government, is needed to support the wellbeing of people, we have been able to keep the effective cost of borrowing down, which is essential to support the economy and meet our target for inflation. It can only be achieved because the Bank is an effective independent central bank, and in no sense has that independence been put on hold.We have signalled that we stand ready to do more within the framework of policies we have used to date.\u0026nbspAnd, in view of the risks we face, it is, of course, right that we consider what further options, such as cutting interest rates into unprecedented territory, might be available in the future. But it is also important that we consider very carefully the issues that such choices would give rise to.\u0026nbspThe Bank stands ready to do whatever we can to support UK households and businesses during this period of economic disruption and get through this together.\u0026nbspThis is our duty.• Andrew Bailey is governor of the Bank of England"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af74fd84474efb455d1e34f028ccaaa86a7a6d80/0_63_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd877ba0a88984237303d11d1146ecfb","title":"uk economy faces longer and slower recovery from covid","story":"Data shows we have passed the worst of the crisis in terms of damage to jobs and growthHow the coronavirus crisis has hit the UK’s economic outlookThe British economy is showing the first signs of emerging from the worst of the economic damage triggered by the coronavirus pandemic but is heading for a longer and slower recovery than previously anticipated, according to a  analysis.As the government gradually begins to lift controls on business and social life, economic developments in the past few weeks suggest the UK has now passed the moment of maximum damage for jobs and growth.However, writing in the , the governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, said Britain was entering the “second phase” of the crisis and warned the risks are “undoubtedly on the downside for a longer and harder recovery”.His intervention comes as the economic fallout from the Covid-19 outbreak is laid bare in a new  project that will track the repercussions of the pandemic.We have chosen eight economic indicators, as well as the level of the FTSE 100, to illustrate the state of the economy. With expectations of a synchronised global recession of the kind unseen since the Great Depression, the Covid crisis watch will also weigh how the UK is faring compared with other countries.Illustrating how Britain has reached a crossroads in the crisis after more than two months of harsh government restrictions, data combed from iPhone users’ searches on Apple Maps now points to the lockdown fraying at the edges.Although still significantly down from the start of the year, daily trips on Britain’s roads are gradually climbing. Economic activity should recover as more people leave their homes.Surveys of business activity suggest the low point for the UK economy probably came in April, during the first full-month of lockdown, with a slight improvement detected in May.Despite warnings that City investors are ignoring the outlook for jobs and risks to growth, global stock markets have rallied.However, the early results suggest companies are bracing for a protracted recovery as lockdown measures are only gradually lifted and consumer confidence takes time to return. Analysts have also warned the lack of a vaccine and continuing health risks will keep a lid on consumer demand, while a second wave of infections could force harsh new lockdown controls.The flash IHS Markit and Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply purchasing managers index – compiled from surveys of business activity – reveals a steeper pace of economic contraction than at the worst point of the global financial crisis has persisted in May. Firms told surveyors they expected customer demand to take a long time to recover.In a reflection of the scale of the damage and only tentative steps to lift controls, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has played down the chances of a swift bounce back. Pouring cold water on hopes of a V-shaped recovery, Sunak said last week that Britain faces a “severe recession, the likes of which we haven’t seen”.Faced with a lengthy recovery and gradual easing of lockdown after Boris Johnson announced non-essential shops could reopen from the middle of June, business groups have called on ministers to maintain the emergency financial support unveiled in March to smooth Britain’s economic reboot.A third of the British workforce is now receiving government wage subsidies, with more than 8m jobs protected on the Treasury furlough scheme and more than 2 million self-employed people claiming grants for lost profits.However, in the coming days Sunak is expected to unveil steps to scale back the support from August given the spiralling price tag attached to the support schemes. Government borrowing surged by £62bn in April, more than was previously anticipated for the whole of 2020-21.Experts have warned that focusing on the deficit and slashing the support too soon could choke off the economic recovery and trigger more job losses."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7716fd94c4bba4816e53829504dedd6ac6f42cde/0_77_1173_704/master/1173.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c792f3e2cfa6be4a6c41e90b3761343","title":"ryanair worst airline for flight cancellation refunds finds which uk customers coronavirus","story":"Ryanair is the worst major airline for refunding British customers whose flights have been cancelled during the coronavirus pandemic, with more than eight out of 10 people still waiting for their money back, according to figures from Which?.Ryanair has been widely accused of confusing customers, with numerous changes to its approach to refunds and vouchers.“Despite initially telling customers it was processing refunds at the beginning of the crisis, customers reported that Ryanair provided refund forms that didn’t work, before attempting to force vouchers on passengers who had specifically requested refunds. It also repeatedly changed the timeframe for receiving a refund, suggesting at one point customers may have to wait up to 12 months for their money back,” Which? said.Correspondence seen by the ’s consumer champions team also reveals how some Ryanair customers are being told that refunds are not possible because of physical distancing and payment systems rules.In one online chat, a Ryanair representative told a customer: “Our claims and refunds team should do the refund procedures but they are working from home from where they are not allowed to process any refunds due to payment security regulations.”In mid-May, the Civil Aviation Authority warned airlines that the law was clear and that they had to offer refunds if requested, rather than offering a voucher or credit note.The CAA said: “Under the law, consumers are entitled to receive a refund for their cancelled flights, despite the challenges the industry is currently facing … it is important that consumers are given a clear option to request a cash refund without unnecessary barriers.”In a statement, Ryanair said it would offer refunds – but customers may have to wait until the coronavirus crisis was over.“The process time for cash refunds is taking longer due to the fact we are having to process 10,000 times the usual volume of cancellations and have fewer staff available due to social distancing measures,” the airline said.Easyjet added: “Customers may request a refund by submitting a claim in writing via a dedicated refund webform, online.

But will he improve the party culture? The appointment of David Evans as Labour’s general secretary represents another win for Keir Starmer. The leader was sticking his neck out when it was briefed to the press that he had a preferred candidate for the post – but the gamble has paid off. Jennie Formby, an ally of Jeremy Corbyn, has been replaced by someone who is heavily praised by activists on the right of the party. The Labour left has been thoroughly defeated, and the end of Corbynism is complete.When it first emerged that the leader’s office had a firm favourite for general secretary and his name was David Evans, most of the members on the left of Labour’s national executive committee – the ruling body that interviews and votes on the applicants – hadn’t heard of him. They were introduced to the former assistant general secretary by journalists who themselves knew him primarily as the author of a 1999 report. This report described local constituency parties as “dysfunctional” and argued for a “radical overhaul” of the party that could “empower modernising forces within the party and marginalise Old Labour”.\u0026nbspAlthough the intention was apparently to weaken the power of MPs and other stakeholders who had a tight grip on local parties but couldn’t be bothered to show up to meetings, the proposals were interpreted at the time by left activists as “elitist”. The context of the leak was that Margaret McDonagh was at the helm as general secretary soon after the report was published, Evans became her assistant. According to the left, she brought in a period during which trade unions were “sidelined” and “often treated with contempt”, as expressed in a briefing that circulated among NEC members last week.Affiliated trade unions on the party’s left were incensed by the news that this man was Starmer’s pick. The\u0026nbspFire Brigades Union general secretary Matt Wrack warned colleagues against Evans, describing him as a “factional figure” and “likely to be extremely isive”. Since his appointment, one local party representative on the NEC has tweeted that Starmer and Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, have “shown their pledge to end factionalism to be a sham”, while other furious reactions have been offered as anonymous comments. “If Evans now takes us back to the toxic culture in HQ, purges of leftwing members and stitch-ups of selections exposed in the leaked report, his appointment will be the worst mistake of Keir’s leadership,” one said.It is worth pointing out that many in the party – across the political spectrum – believe that there is already a toxic culture in HQ, and that parliamentary selections were being stitched up during the Corbyn era too. It is also worth noting that friends of Evans dismiss the portrayal of a Blairite driven by factionalism and anti-union sentiment. They counter that the internal report actually demanded more resources for constituency parties and for members to be empowered. It advocated all-member meetings rather than local committees, for example – a move that would later be championed by the left under Corbyn.Evans is hailed by former colleagues as an excellent organiser who oversaw the campaigns that enabled Labour to beat the BNP in Barking in 2010 and regain control of Croydon council in 2014. They say he was instrumental in efforts that led to Labour’s 2001 general election win. Like Starmer and his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, Evans sees working with local government not as a nice-to-have but as a key way of securing power at a national level. His ability to connect with voters, described by friends such as Barking and Dagenham council leader, Darren Rodwell, will have to manifest itself through party staff and an enthused activist base.Starmer took a risk and did well to get the finely balanced NEC to approve his first preference – the appointment went through by 20 votes to 16, according to well-placed sources. The two GMB representatives provided the votes that swung in Starmer’s favour, making the trade union a key player under the new leadership. The narrow NEC result also offers a stark reminder to the Labour left that it needs to get its house in order, and fast. If Corbynites had put forward a united slate for the recent by-elections, they would have been well placed to win the two members’ representative places, and Evans would probably not be general secretary now.It was a close call, but the new leader now has an ally in control of the party machine as well as a clear personal mandate from members. That means he has no reason not to deliver on his key campaign pledges from the leadership election: unity, professionalism, electability. In a recent Zoom meeting alongside Starmer and Rayner, Evans reportedly expressed his desire to professionalise HQ, and said that the party must get back to winning elections. Was picking Evans over a compromise candidate the right decision? The proof will be in whether party culture improves over the coming years, in its ability to respond well to the findings of the Equality and Human Rights Commission investigation expected shortly, and in electoral tests starting with the 2021 local contests.• Sienna Rodgers is editor of LabourList"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f17756869abda73804540030446bb7e0d662ad6/0_218_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe801bc560aa4b21c74e138ab1be93a3","title":"scientists ministers dominic cummings advisers government coronavirus","story":"The Cummings saga has made it plain that scientific advisers are shielding the government’s collapsing reputation on coronavirus• Richard Horton is a doctor and edits the LancetDominic Cummings predicted the events that have threatened both him and the government he serves. Writing on his blog in 2014, in an essay he called\u0026nbspThe Hollow Men, Cummings said: “The people at the apex of political power (elected and unelected) are far from the best people in the world in terms of goals, intelligence, ethics, or competence … No 10 will continue to hurtle from crisis to crisis with no priorities and no understanding of how to get things done … the media will continue obsessing on the new rather than the important, and the public will continue to fume with rage.”\u0026nbspIndeed, the public’s rage against Cummings, Boris Johnson and the\u0026nbspprime\u0026nbspminister’s lapdog cabinet seems to be growing day by day. The government’s goals, intelligence, ethics and competence are all under scrutiny and have been found wanting. Yet a cordon sanitaire has been placed around Cummings. He must be protected at all costs.As Laura Spinney argues in\u0026nbspPale Rider, her history of the 1918 influenza pandemic and how it changed the world, getting the public to comply with disease-containment strategies means that each of us has to “place the interests of the collective over those of the inidual”. In democracies, this is a hard ask. A central authority must temporarily suspend the cherished rights of iniduals. And this demand carries dangers “if the authority abuses the measures placed at its disposal”.Cummings certainly abused his authority as the\u0026nbspprime\u0026nbspminister’s chief political adviser. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, had given an instruction to “stay at home”. It wasn’t a guideline. It wasn’t advice. It wasn’t a suggestion. Hancock made clear that it was an instruction. Cummings violated that instruction. That violation has demonstrably undermined a carefully crafted public health message.\u0026nbspAs long as Cummings remains in his position, the public can have no confidence that this government is putting their collective interests above those of a few privileged iniduals at the heart of power. Johnson\u0026nbsplooks startlingly unable to understand the sacrifices made by families up and down the country he leads. Those families at the very least\u0026nbspdeserved\u0026nbspan apology from Cummings. To dismiss their anguish reveals a man astonishingly detached from reality.\u0026nbspThis sad episode also shows a regime that has lost its moral compass. And by regime, I don’t only mean politicians and their special advisers. I mean the regime of doctors and scientists shoring up this dysfunctional government.\u0026nbspEvery day, government scientific advisers stand next to increasingly discredited politicians, acting as protective professional shields to prop up the collapsing reputations of ministers. Why did Yvonne Doyle from Public Health England agree to stand next to Johnson when he was defending Cummings on Sunday? Why did John Newton, who leads the UK government’s Covid-19 testing programme, stand next to Matt Hancock as the\u0026nbspsecretary of\u0026nbspstate for\u0026nbsphealth and\u0026nbspsocial\u0026nbspcare again sought to defend the indefensible?\u0026nbspEvery day a cast of experts – led by\u0026nbspthe chief\u0026nbspscientific\u0026nbspadviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, and\u0026nbspthe chief\u0026nbspmedical\u0026nbspofficer, Chris Whitty – lends credibility to this government by annealing their reputations with those of ministers. This fusion of character works when we believe the collective interest is being put first. But when the government places the instincts of an inidual above the tragedies of a people, it is surely time to step away. Tying the reputation of advisers to a government that is now an international laughing stock seems a mistake. It cannot be a coincidence that Vallance and Whitty have not been seen for a few days. But even so, government scientific and medical advisers should now disengage\u0026nbspfrom these daily briefings immediately and completely.\u0026nbspThe failures within the scientific and medical establishment do not end with government experts. The UK is fortunate to have an array of scientific and medical institutions that promote and protect the quality of science and medicine in this country – royal colleges, the Academy of Medical Sciences and the Royal Society. Their presidents have been elected to defend and advance the reputation of medicine and medical science. And yet they have failed to criticise\u0026nbspgovernment policy. Why? Surely their silence amounts to\u0026nbspcomplicity.The relationship between scientists and ministers has become dangerously collusive. Scientists and politicians appear to\u0026nbsphave agreed to act together in order to protect a failing government. When advisers\u0026nbspare asked questions, they speak with one voice in support of government policy. They never deviate\u0026nbspfrom the political scripts.Why\u0026nbspwas PPE not reaching\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspfrontline health workers? Instead of saying honestly that proper planning had not taken place, the adviser said\u0026nbspthe government was doing its best. Why was testing capacity so poor? Instead of saying honestly that the government had ignored the World Health Organization’s recommendation to “test, test, test”, the adviser said\u0026nbspthat testing wasn’t appropriate for the UK. Why did the government stop\u0026nbspreporting mortality figures for the UK and other countries? Instead of saying honestly that the government found those figures embarrassing, the adviser said that such comparisons were spurious. Advisers have become the public relations wing of a government that has betrayed its people.\u0026nbspWhat is at stake here is not the fate of one political adviser or even of a government in crisis. It is the independence and credibility of science and medicine. Whitty and Vallance must now practise their own version of physical distancing – a distancing from a government that cares not one bit for the sacrifices made by its people.In\u0026nbspPale Rider,\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSpinney\u0026nbspwarns us: “At some point … the group identity splinters, and people revert to identifying as iniduals. It may be at this point – once the worst is over, and life is returning to normal – that truly ‘bad’ behaviour is most likely to emerge.” It is indeed at this point that the “hollow men” have appeared. It’s time to cut them loose.• Richard Horton is a doctor and edits the Lancet"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f87a492b0a13f89802278e12f7e45c6d93f1eb6/0_209_6764_4061/master/6764.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3070e86e978c2e02489fd2b0be5dfa8b","title":"students like the flexibility why online universities are here to stay","story":"With the coronavirus pandemic radically reshaping the education system, universities may never be the same againThe coronavirus pandemic has forced UK universities to rapidly shift online, and no date has been confirmed for campuses to reopen. With the second coronavirus peak projected to take place in autumn, many institutions are already planning to move at least their first semester online. Whatever happens, universities are not going to look how their students expect for some time.Katie Barrett, a student at the University of West England, has enjoyed her online experience so far. “I’m still getting all my lectures and seminars, so the learning itself hasn’t been disrupted much,” she says. “My lecturers are doing extra Q\u0026ampAs via Zoom, for example, so some of the material actually feels more accessible.”These positive experiences may permanently transform universities, believes Vijay Govindarajan, a business innovation professor at Dartmouth College in the US. “Universities can create high-quality multimedia experiences online. Lectures can be recorded in HD and reused, so more of professors’ time can be spent on interacting with students. This will improve the overall quality of learning,” he says. “Online learning might have been a long time coming in higher education, but it’s here to stay.”Online learning shouldn’t be seen as a quick-fix solution to the pandemic. Allison Littlejohn, director of the UCL Institute of Education’s knowledge lab, cautions that quality online courses take time and effort to create. “It’s crucial the online learning experience is well-designed and we don’t simply shift existing content from one format to another,” she says.Charles Craig, who studies music business at Leeds College of Music, worries about the lack of networking and entrepreneurship opportunities if the rest of his degree is delivered online. “Engaging with the content and tutors is more difficult online. I hate the distortion you get on video calls and the awkward sound delays make it hard to speak at the right time,” he adds.“Learning remotely isn’t the same as the visceral experience of expressing and debating ideas in a physical space,” agrees Jesper Ryynänen, a student at the London School of Economics (LSE). “I chose LSE for its public events and renowned speakers, yet there’ll be none of that this semester.”Some students may feel that paying the same fees for digital versions of their courses would be poor value. The tuition for Ryynänen’s one-year MSc at the LSE is £29,000 – far more expensive than fully online options from renowned names like Harvard University and Wharton Business School. Craig doesn’t think he would have applied had he known. “Shorter courses and masterclasses run by industry experts might have been a better option than an online degree,” he says.Craig’s view reiterates an international survey in 2019 commissioned by Pearson, which suggested that today’s learners are increasingly interested in vocational and shorter programmes, especially online. If they move online, universities will have to compete with new formats, including coding bootcamps like Le Wagon, Codeworks and Northcoders. These offer quicker, cheaper courses in subjects such as web development and data science with in-built industry connections. But moving university courses online due to the coronavirus pandemic is expected to cost the higher education sector £1bn. UK universities will be keen to ensure their investment in digital transformation is for the long term, especially after years of lagging behind universities in other countries.One barrier could be cultural change. When Times Higher Education surveyed 200 university leaders in 2018, all of them agreed that online learning could never replace the physical university experience. Kendrick Oliver, a professor at the University of Southampton, agrees. “Nothing can replace the classroom experience. Being physically together in a space means rich communication, and more energy and experimentation from everyone involved. But he acknowledges: “Habit and routine are powerful. Months of online working will make digital more of a default.”There are also reputational risks to moving online, says Jovana Karanovic, a researcher in digital platforms at VU Amsterdam in the Netherlands. “Online learning may produce a precarious gig economy to connect students and educators,” she explains. “This competitive, fragmented learning landscape could raise accountability issues, prompt a loss of academic expertise and lower teaching standards.” She adds that universities will also need to invest in proper staff training.This may echo the recent shift in the UK away from the “boarding school” model of higher education and towards more students commuting to campus. Research by the Sutton Trust highlights that the number of students choosing to live at home while they study has increased, largely to save money. Prior to the pandemic, some innovative UK universities already offered blended learning. Among these is the University of East Anglia (UEA), which introduced online modules to reach the most disadvantaged students, and plans to scale them up post-pandemic. Its crime fiction MA, for example, is delivered primarily through virtual learning but includes intensive “residencies” on campus to meet industry professionals and participate in a national crime fiction festival.Henry Sutton, designer of the crime fiction programme, says the university recognised the potential of new course approaches early on. “The MA launched in 2015 using the technology we already had,” he explains. “Students tell us they like the flexibility, they find the residential aspects valuable, and their communication with peers is more considered.”Meanwhile, other universities are following suit. A consortium of 10 universities led by Coventry was recently awarded £3.7m to develop partly online postgraduate conversion courses in artificial intelligence and data science. According to Sarah Barrow, UEA’s pro-vice-chancellor for arts and humanities, the pandemic represents “a revolutionary moment”. She expects the shift online to kickstart a lifelong learning agenda. This has already been discussed as a way to skill up employees whose jobs will become automated in the future, but which universities have been slow to implement.The challenge now is the scale and pace of change. “We’ve adapted and brought forward our plans, but this is disruption on an unprecedented scale,” says Barrow. “It normally takes two years to create a new course or module. Now we’re designing and launching online options in a matter of weeks.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f0235f2b013a2d8095220b890c31ea06afe4ca4/0_121_3748_2248/master/3748.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed00daa9f885fad2f278d7434f24d8e5","title":"hadley climate centre turns 30 the human fingerprint is everywhere","story":"Exclusively compiled data from the Hadley Centre’s supercomputer shows alarming climate trajectory The human fingerprint on the climate is now unmistakable and will become increasingly evident over the coming decades, the UK Met Office has confirmed after 30 years of pioneering study.The data highlights how a young generation has grown up in a climate unprecedented in a millennium. Future projections suggest that by mid-century a 60-year-old Briton is likely to be living in a climate 1.2C warmer than when they were born.Scientists at the Hadley Centre, which has been on the global frontline of climate monitoring, research and modelling since it opened in 1990, said early theories about fossil-fuel disruption have been proven by subsequent facts.“The climate now is completely different from what we had 30 years ago. It is completely outside the bounds of possibility in natural variation,” said Peter Stott, a professor and expert on climate attribution science at the centre.In the Hadley Centre’s early projections, he said, scientists forecast 0.5C of warming in the UK between 1990 and 2020 as a result of emissions from oil, gas and coal: “We got it spot on.” With new heat records being broken with increasing frequency, he said global temperatures were now above any level in the Met Office measurements since 1850, or indirectly calculated through tree rings going back thousands of years. Carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere are also higher than anything seen in million-year-old ice cores. “We are seeing an unprecedented climate,” Stott said. “The human fingerprint is everywhere.”The impact was less obvious in 1990, when the centre opened in conjunction with the publication of the first report by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - both were overseen by the UK scientist John Houghton, who died earlier this year.At the inauguration, the then prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, said the UK needed a world-leading climate centre to assess the “serious consequences” of greenhouse gas emissions. “What it predicts will affect our daily lives. Governments and international organisations in every part of the world are going to have to sit up and take notice and respond,” she said.Thatcher, who studied science at Oxford, needed little convincing, but she had to overcome a sceptical cabinet. Atmospheric physicists had been warning oil companies and policymakers about the dangers of fossil fuels for decades, but the “greenhouse effect” was still a relatively novel concern for the broader public. Nobody felt a change. The world had already warmed by about half a degree from pre-industrial levels, but this was low enough to be within natural variation.Few people knew the difference between short-term “weather” and the “climate”, which is usually measured over a much longer period of 30 years.Back then, there was also considerable scepticism about the ability of meteorologists to forecast change, even on a daily basis. Memories were fresh of the BBC weatherman Michael Fish infamously reassuring viewers that fears of a hurricane were unfounded, just hours before the fiercest storm in generations hit the UK.“It was unglamorous” recalls James Murphy, a science fellow who was posted to the Hadley Centre from the beginning. “But the mood in the first decade was one of great excitement, because it was a chance to do a lot of pioneering research in a growing field.”As acceptance and importance grew, so did scepticism. Critics, often funded by oil firms, pushed back against climate science because they did not like its political and economic implications. Ahead of the climate summits in Kyoto (1997) and Copenhagen (2009), fossil fuel companies funded misinformation campaigns to cast doubt on climate models.The Hadley Centre remained focused on science. Researchers expanded and refined their models by incorporating new knowledge on biological carbon cycles and the likely impact of fossil fuels not only on temperature, but on Arctic ice, sea-level rise, flooding, storms, droughts and other atmospheric phenomena.Supercomputer advances enabled much greater precision. Early models mapped the impact on grid cells of 300km on each side. Today that is down to 2.2km, which allows detailed predictions of which stretches of river basins and coastlines will need the most protection.Researchers are discovering the impacts go far beyond the initial focus on average temperature. Heat records are being set with increasing frequency. Rainfall patterns are noticeably shifting beyond natural variation. Arctic ice is shrinking faster than expected. The rising seas have already left some places, such as Fairbourne in Wales, below spring-tide levels.By 2050 – the year the UK plans to achieve carbon neutrality – the direct impact on Britain will be moderated by the surrounding ocean and there may be opportunities to plant new crops, but these benefits will be dwarfed by trade disruption, migration, humanitarian disasters and shifting ecosystems.“Overall it’s bad. The negatives outweigh the positives,” said Richard Betts, a Met Office scientist who is leading scientific analysis for the next UK climate change risk assessment. “It stands to reason that if the world keeps gets hotter and hotter, sooner or later we’ll reach the point where it is first uncomfortable and then hard to function. This won’t be seen in the UK, but in parts of the world that are already hot and humid it could increasingly get too hot to function.”The Hadley supercomputer calculates myriad possible pathways depending on how much carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases enter the atmosphere. The good news is that the worst-emissions scenario, known as RCP 8.5, is considered less likely than before because the global coal industry has not grown as feared. The bad news is current emissions trends (which lie between the RCP 4.5 and RCP 6 pathways) could take the planet to 2C warmer than pre-industrial levels by mid-century, which will increase storm damage, heatwaves, sea-level rise and the already great risk that the Arctic will be ice-free in summer.The climate trends are based on multiple-year averages rather than year-on-year comparisons, which are more subject to natural variation.Even the current best-case scenario – RCP 2.6, which is roughly in line with the Paris agreement – would leave the world hotter than today.“What stands out is that even in the lowest current scenario, we get warming. We’ll need to prepare and adapt,” says Jason Lowe, the head of climate services at Hadley. He predicts extreme summer heatwaves, such as those seen in 2018, will become the norm rather than an exception.“As a scientist, I want to narrow the uncertainty so the information is as good as possible so we can plan. I think of the generations to come. I have a nine-year-old daughter. I find myself wondering which of these pathways we will be on when she is 80 or 90.”More extreme results are possible at both ends of the spectrum. The next set of climate assessments will introduce a more ambitious best-case scenario (RCP 1.9) that would mean a faster transition to zero-carbon energy and a greater chance of holding temperature rises below 1.5C. But the situation could worsen rapidly if the climate hits tipping points, such as the collapse of the west Antarctic ice sheet.“There are still dangers out there that we don’t fully understand,” said Stott. “Much of the uncertainty lies on the bad side. It could be terrifying. Can we grow enough crops to feed the population? Can we cope if some places are battered by storm after storm?”Such concerns explain why the anniversary cannot be entirely triumphant. Despite growing evidence of climate risks, governments have been slow to act. Apart from downward blips such as the 2008 financial crisis and the coronavirus lockdown, emissions have steadily increased. The Hadley Centre’s work now is not only about predicting impacts, but preparing for them.“Reality has proven that what we were saying 20 to 30 years ago was right. As scientists, that is vindication. But on a personal level, I hoped we would track a different emissions trajectory from where we are now,” Stott said.“The worry is that we are now taking risks globally that we don’t fully understand ... there will be no winners of climate change if we continue.

It is time it was taken seriously.”Observed September Arctic sea ice extent from HadISST.2.2.0.0 (selected as single source from Met Office climate dashboard.)

No out-of-towners coming through on the I-95. No local traffic.” He sighs. “I’m going to tough it out. I can survive with what I’m selling. But that’s all I’m doing. Most shrimpers don’t have 401k retirement plans, you know?”Gale would rather be out on his boat, a 1953 trawler he had for nine years but recently sold to a man in North Carolina. “It made me good money, but I couldn’t find a crew! You just can’t find anyone who wants to work shrimp boats any more. Most of ’em are on drugs. Give ’em a check and they’re gone.” He has a small boat he can run himself now.In the past, shrimping was an admirable vocation. Gale first got out on a shrimp boat when he was 12. “Mama wouldn’t let me go any earlier, but from 12 years on out – every weekend I wasn’t in school or summer vacation I was on a shrimp boat.” He spent the next 20 years learning from his dad, who shrimped for 45 years.“What was an average day like?” I ask.“I’d leave about 4.30 in the morning and get to the dragging grounds about 6.30, maybe 7am. I’d put out in daylight, make three or four drags that day. The latest I’d be out would be 4pm,” he says. “Look,” he tells me. “What I’m doing right here, right now, selling shrimp on this corner – it sucks. It’s way better out there on the water. It’s where I’ve lived all my life. If I wasn’t in the ocean, I was in the river running trout lines and catching catfish, or fishing for shad in winter.”Off the coast of Georgia, fishermen harvested about 2.61m lb of shrimp in 2019, a haul valued more than $11m. Shrimping is deeply ingrained in culture there, but Georgia’s fishermen are facing significant challenges: an ageing workforce, low prices per pound, climate change and black gill disease, leading many to wonder if the industry will survive.These days, depending on the season, Gale can get $3 to $5.50 per lb of shrimp. “Back in the 1980s and 1990s,” he says, “we were selling the same size shrimp for $8 a pound. We have good years – but most of the time we have bad years now.”Bryan Fluech, the associate marine extension director at Marine Extension and Georgia Sea Grant, uses the term “graying of the fleet” when talking about the future of shrimping in Georgia.“Shrimp are the Cheetos of the sea,” Fluech tells me. “Everything eats them. But people need to remember: that shrimp didn’t just show up in a Publix.“The decline of the shrimping industry has been death by a thousand cuts,” Fluech says. “The cost for maintaining a boat is up, and the boats are getting older. Sustainable fishing practices are expensive to implement. The younger generation doesn’t want to work on a shrimping vessel, and captains tell me they can’t find a reliable workforce. The cost of ice and fuel might rise, but the profit on shrimp doesn’t. Plus, our guys are competing with foreign markets.”“A lot has changed,” Gale tells me. “We’re losing our infrastructure. Lost our big block ice plant that had given ice since the 1940s. Can’t hardly find anybody to build nets any more.”“People love to say that they’re all about local food,” Fluech adds. “And you’ll see a shrimping boat on every tourism brochure, but commercial waterfronts have changed. People don’t like the look of a working dock. There’s only one left in Brunswick, which means the fishermen have to take those prices or go out on their own. We say we like authentic experiences, but we’re losing them.”You can see the old reverence for Georgia’s shrimpers in the Blessing of the Fleet ceremonies, which still happen along the coast in towns like Brunswick and Darien at the end of March, as the fleet readies itself for the season.Ships with beautiful names like the Lady Raven, Flying Cloud, Bernice II, Liberty Bell and Sundown arrive at the ceremony decorated with lights and streamers. A crowd gathers, and a minister – often waving a toilet brush spray-painted gold, and flanked by the Knights of Columbus – offers a blessing into the microphone. Shrimping is a dangerous vocation, after all, and every year there are injuries, drownings and boats that don’t return.This year’s ceremony was postponed due to the pandemic. The cancellation feels like the latest knock in a long and difficult fight.Once celebrated, many shrimpers feel vilified as they face mounting regulations aimed at preserving other species, like sea turtles. In the 1980s, before turtle excluder devices (TEDs) were prevalent, shrimp nets were responsible for more than 10,000 sea turtle deaths annually in the south-east. In 1989, when regulations tightened, shrimpers created a 500-boat blockade in the Gulf coast, raising skull and crossbones flags and even ramming Coast Guard ships.In Georgia, tension between scientists and fishermen is amplified by black gill disease, which affects a shrimp’s respiratory system. The shrimp’s immune response causes the visible blackening of the gills, and results in lethargy, potential death and sometimes the collapse of an entire fishery.Black gill is an expensive problem. In 2019, the commerce department distributed over $1m to commercial shrimpers and researchers because of the 2013 white shrimp fishery failure.Black gill is, however, more pervasive than ever. Gale reports that it’s starting earlier in the year, beginning in May instead of August, and continuing throughout fall. Though it has been around since the 1990s, researchers believe the disease is worsening with climate change.Climate change will continue to wreak further havoc on the industry – changing the salinity of the water, shifting the distribution of shrimp – female shrimp need colder water to spawn. Warmer winters appear to predict a smaller annual shrimp harvest, and may not kill the bacteria responsible for black gill.Keeping shrimp fisheries healthy, and livelihoods possible, requires intense collaboration between fishermen and scientists. Otherwise, foreign markets with cheap labor and unsustainable practices will take over the market share entirely.“We have to look for the cooperative path,” Fluech says, emphasizing how helpful it can be when shrimpers help with data collection and reporting. He currently works with five to eight shrimpers each season the fishermen help report black gill using an online tracking app.One of the best historical examples of this cooperative path is fisherman Sinkey Boone, who hailed from a long line of shrimpers in Darien. Boone created the first turtle excluder device in the late 1960s, called the Georgia Jumper, which allowed turtles – an oxygen-breathing species – to escape trawler nets so they wouldn’t drown.Scientists and fishermen may seem at odds, but collaboration is possible, and perhaps imperative.“Me and the shrimpers may not agree on everything, but I respect the hell out of them,” says Fluech.Gale agrees with the saying that shrimpers never retire. “We fish till we fall out and die,” he says. “I’ve seen men fish right on until their 80s and 90s. I know an old man right now who’s got to be 85 and he outworks anybody I know – still climbs up in the rigging. Diabetic and still goes.”I hear stories about poisonous snakes tangled in anchor lines, boats on fire, near-sinkings, and a man in his 70s impaled by his own equipment who hardly survived, but broke out of the hospital to get back on his boat a few days later.“Once fishing’s in your blood, and you get used to it, you just don’t want to do anything else,” Gale says.“I’d still work for my daddy,” Gale tells me. “He just knew where the shrimp would be – it was absolutely amazing. He knew the tide cycles, what the weather meant. You could set your watch to it. Another fisherman could make that same pass and miss them.”In 1979, the government issued 1,471 commercial trawling licenses in Georgia – but only 253 in 2014. If the decline in Georgia’s shrimping continues, the ripple effect will be felt in the local economy, on dinner plates, during seasonal festivals, and on the horizon line, where many are used to seeing early morning trawlers. Frozen foreign shrimp and farmed shrimp – known as aquaculture – are the likely future.“Do I think there will always be shrimpers in Georgia?” Fluech asks me. “I hope so. You have to be an eternal optimist in this business.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a211555eec109dfbc54edf94e8afb86195a4ad42/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=df91f10a055b88e9be2976499ce7e9a0","title":"david atherton recipe vegan blueberry baked oatmeal","story":"This delicious cake-like porridge – baked in muffin cases for easy transportation – is the perfect way to start your day Porridge has long been touted as the most healthy way to start your day.

There’s a curious satisfaction in teasing off every last morsel of meat before reaching those sticky fingers out for more. No cut seems so perfectly designed for this express purpose as ribs.2 racks baby back or loin ribs1 tbsp Marmite1 tbsp English mustard2 tbsp tomato ketchup1½ tsp smoked paprika2½ tbsp dark muscovado sugarTry to get loin ribs for this recipe: sure, meaty spare ribs may be bigger, but this way you can serve whole racks, which look way more impressive. They’re also easier to cook to the requisite tenderness and, in my opinion, at least, have a superior flavour too. Note that they’re also occasionally sold by their American name, baby back ribs.You could ask your butcher to do this for you but, failing that, you’ll need to start by removing the membrane that holds the rack together or you’ll be chewing until doomsday. If you’re not sure whether it’s still there, turn the racks over curved side down, with the wider end facing you. If there’s a pale pink, translucent layer over the bones, that’s it.Fortunately, this layer is pretty simple to remove, if not always easy – use a small, sharp knife to peel a little bit of membrane off the smaller end of the rack, and use this as a tab to grip on to, pulling it sharply towards you and holding the rack steady as you do so – it should come away in one clean piece – and discard.Mix the remaining ingredients in a bowl until you have a smooth paste – I find it easiest to beat together the wet ingredients first, because Marmite can be quite thick – then stir in the paprika and sugar. The Marmite gives the ribs a savoury flavour, but if you’re not a fan, don’t worry you could use Bovril or soy sauce for a similar effect, if you prefer.Lay the ribs in a shallow baking dish, then pour or spoon roughly half the marinade on top (you’ll be using the rest later). Rub the sauce into the meat on both sides – I find it easiest to use my hands – then refrigerate for at least an hour, and ideally a bit longer, turning the ribs occasionally and rubbing the marinade into them as the sauce drips off.An hour or so before you want to cook, heat the oven to 160C (140C fan)325Fgas 3 and take the ribs out of the fridge to come to room temperature. Though this is a barbecue classic, the barbecue in question is the American kind, in which meat is cooked for hours at a low temperature – throw raw ribs on a hot British grill, and they’ll be tough as old boots, so it’s worth slow-roasting them first.Cover the dish of ribs tightly with foil and cook for about two and a half hours, basting the ribs once or twice with any marinade that’s run off into the bottom of the pan, until the meat is very tender. Once they’re done, remove the foil and cook for another 15 minutes the racks should be floppy.At this point, if you’re working ahead, you could refrigerate the ribs for a couple of days just remember to get them out to come to room temperature before finishing them off. Heat a barbecue or greased griddle pan to cooking temperature, brush the ribs with the reserved marinade and cook until hot, caramelised and beginning to char.Two other marinade ideas: coat the ribs in a mixture of four tablespoons each of soy sauce, honey, Shaoxing rice wine (or dry sherry) and four teaspoons of Chinese five-spice. Or dress them in a sauce made with a small handful of finely chopped woody herbs, a tablespoon of lightly crushed fennel seeds, a teaspoon of coarse salt and two teaspoons of chilli flakes mixed with four tablespoons of olive oil: if you go down this latter route, brush the ribs with balsamic vinegar before their final grilling."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f49fac91bba70afef0d9d457e47dc42aebdb0b90/0_106_3605_2164/master/3605.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9215b2a35dc9cbfa2d70dd8dc25d8a15","title":"one punnet of strawberries 17 fantastic ways to use them from cake to ketchup","story":"There is more to strawberry recipes than just cream and sugar. Try pairing them with tomatoes, avocados, basil or harissa – if you dareIf you are not going to get out there and pick strawberries, the least you can do is eat them. Britain, farmers tell us, is facing a huge strawberry glut, thanks to the cancellation of major events such as Wimbledon (where 33 tonnes of strawberries were eaten last year), along with thousands of weddings and summer parties. As civic duties go, eating loads of strawberries isn’t that taxing, but they won’t sit around waiting for you to come up with new ways to serve them. Here are 17 delicious ideas to help you manage your personal stockpile.Maceration is step number one in a lot of the recipes below. At its simplest, macerating consists of hulling and halving a quantity of strawberries, tossing them in a bowl with a couple of tablespoons of sugar, then leaving them to sit in the fridge for half an hour or longer, but not long enough for them to turn into mush (meaning not overnight). Additions to the basic formula may include juice (orange or lemon), balsamic vinegar or alcohol.A basic strawberry tart, however, requires no maceration. You just make – or otherwise obtain – a shortcrust pastry case, fill it with whipped cream or pastry cream (I have had some success with this fail-safe Youtube tutorial by Thomas Joseph) and sink sliced strawberries into the top in an orderly spiral. You can get very fussy about sizing fruit for a neat look or, alternatively, not bother.Felicity Cloake’s strawberry tart is slightly more sophisticated, in that you have to be the sort of person who has rosewater to hand, but it is no more difficult to produce. It also contains a handy recipe-within-a-recipe, for an incredibly useful no-roll shortcrust pastry: you just press the mixture into the tin with the base of a cup.Yotam Ottolenghi’s strawberry and basil tart has an intriguing combination of strawberries, pistachios and basil-infused pastry cream. It also calls, thankfully, for store-bought puff pastry. Life may not be too short to make your own puff pastry, but the British summer definitely is.Strawberry shortcake is the traditional American way to keep on top of a strawberry glut, but Cloake’s reclaimed British version is excellent. As you will see, strawberry shortcakes are not cakes at all, but inidual assemblages of macerated strawberry, whipped cream and large biscuit. However, it is not uncommon in America to make one large one and slice it like a cake. The ingredients are the same, although the amounts might differ since you will probably want three layers for height. This version has the right proportions.In terms of actual cake, a strawberry and olive oil breakfast cake fits the bill, while Cassie Best’s strawberry and almond cheesecake sponge could be more accurately described as a sponge with “cheesecake blobs” in it.If you are like me, it might take you a while to get your head round the idea of using strawberries in salads, especially salads that sound as if they would be just as good without them. But let us not forget why we are here: to level Britain’s massive strawberry mountain before it collapses and buries us all.Here is what I would suggest: before you commit to a whole salad, try a few bites of the relevant flavour combinations first, to see if they work for you. Some will be delightful from the outset others may be tastes longer in the acquiring. I haven’t yet made Ottolenghi’s strawberry and tomato salad, but I did put a tomato and a strawberry in my mouth at the same time, and I can testify that they have a surprising affinity. Now I just need to convince my family.Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall recommends a strawberry and avocado salad, dressed with parmesan and a simple honey and lemon dressing. Mark Bittman’s strawberry and rocket is another rather startling combination to experiment with, as is Erin Clarke’s spinach and strawberry salad.I am always drawn to ice-cream recipes that don’t require an ice-cream maker, because I don’t own one and I don’t want one. This straightforward freezer recipe from Tom Hunt, chef at Poco in Bristol, has just four ingredients: strawberries, sugar, double cream and mascarpone. Mine didn’t turn out quite as rippled as his, but it disappeared very quickly.Jeremy Lee’s strawberry granita is simplicity itself, and should really be kept that way. As he says, cream is not required, “and the addition of a sprig of mint is absolutely forbidden.”A surplus of ripe strawberries can quickly turn into an embarrassment of overripe strawberries: bruised, soft, leaking. Compotes and preserves are the perfect way to rescue them. Strawberry jam is the most obvious route, and, as always, Felicity Cloake supplies the winnowed-down, optimal version. The major issue with strawberries is their lack of pectin, which causes jam to set. You need to add some, either in the from of other, pectin-rich fruit (lemons, say), or by using jam sugar, which already includes pectin.Strawberry compote is even simpler and keeps in the fridge for about two weeks. If you are looking for something more adventurous, try Ottolenghi’s frankly counter-intuitive strawberry and harissa ketchup, which he recommends as an accompaniment to grilled meats. After the thing with the tomato and the strawberry, I am willing to take his word for it.Strawberries are, for many people, just smoothies waiting to happen, either alone or in combination with numberless other fruits. You can begin with the basic format (strawberry, banana, orange juice) and experiment by adding elements –cranberries, chia seeds, oatmeal – until you realise you have gone too far. Then pull back a little.For something a bit stronger, Tom Hunt’s strawberry daiquiri is a respectable way to use up any final stray strawberries, or any leftover vodka. Hunt recommends macerating the berries in grappa beforehand, but if you don’t have grappa, a little more vodka makes a decent substitute. If you don’t have a proper blender, you can use a hand blender in a tall jug, although you might have to break up the ice a little first. If you haven’t got a jug, just wash out a large vase. You can see I really wanted to make this work. And it did, in the end."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c435224a41bbc32a033c66a14ab3079f40bc9bf2/0_90_3945_2367/master/3945.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=364b1d89e86ca037c7f8bba327f1d767","title":"julien faubert to madrid the surreal transfer tale inspiring a tv drama","story":"Yvan Le Mée recalls how his client somehow switched West Ham for the Bernabéu, a move that landed the agent the nickname David CopperfieldThere were only two days of the 2009 January transfer window remaining when Yvan Le Mée answered his phone. At the other end of the line was a representative from Real Madrid inquiring whether it would be possible to take his client Julien Faubert on loan from West Ham for the rest of the season.Le Mée, already a veteran of what is known in Europe as the “mercato” having started as an agent representing Arsenal’s Gaël Clichy, could scarcely believe what he was hearing. Faubert, capped once by France in 2006, was an injury-prone winger who had made only eight appearances for West Ham since joining from Bordeaux in 2007 and was not the type of player who usually attracted the attention of one of Europe’s most famous clubs.“I called a friend in Spain,” says Le Mée, taking up the story of one of the most infamous transfers of all time. “I said: ‘Look, somebody from Real Madrid called me about Faubert. It’s so strange.’ He called the sports director to check and phoned me back. ‘Yvan, it’s true. They want to see you at 7am tomorrow at Heathrow airport.’”Even Faubert could not believe it, having also received a call from a man claiming to represent the Spanish club while on the team bus before a match against Fulham. “I told him I had to prepare for an important game and I had no time for this shit,” he said in an interview with the Athletic in March. “I turned off my phone.”“He thought it was a joke,” adds Le Mée, chuckling at the memory. “But the mercato can be crazy sometimes.”The next morning they arrived at Heathrow to begin negotiations, only to be told the transfer was now in the balance. “Real Madrid wanted to sign Antonio Valencia but Wigan wanted £25m, which is like £80m in today’s market,” Le Mée says. “The second option was Faubert, the manager’s choice. Juande Ramos had been at Tottenham the year before and Julien played two fantastic games against them for West Ham. That was the reason he got this chance – sometimes miracles can happen.”When negotiations with Wigan broke down, Faubert’s dream move was back on. “At that point I started to negotiate with West Ham,” Le Mée says. “At the time it was chief executive Scott Duxbury and sporting director Gianluca Nani who were in charge of transfers and they were very tough negotiators. They wanted a lot of money because it was Real Madrid, even if he wasn’t playing much at the time, but we managed to make the deal. For a few weeks everybody was calling me David Copperfield because they couldn’t believe it had happened.”West Ham eventually received £1.5m for the loan as Madrid also included an option to sign Faubert on a three-year contract, although that never materialised. The Frenchman made only two appearances in Spain, making headlines for missing training after mistakenly thinking he had the day off and being accused of falling asleep on the bench against Villarreal – he later admitted closing his eyes for a split second because he was “bored”.Faubert returned to West Ham and spent three more years there before being released. Le Mée has since represented Mario Lemina and Sofiane Boufal in their moves to Southampton, negotiated Ferland Mendy’s £43m transfer from Lyon to Real Madrid in 2019 and is working on a television series called Mercato inspired by his experiences of transfers such as Faubert’s.With input from the former Marseille president Jean-Michel Roussier, the journalist Messaoud Benterki and Romain Alessandrini – a former teammate of Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s at LA Galaxy – the fictional series focuses on the life of an agent, Vincent Berman, and his efforts to help his client, the Argentina forward Ruben Maltelli, win the Ballon d’Or by getting him a €300m move from Juventus.“The main story is about a young agent who becomes the biggest in the world,” Le Mée says. “The idea was to mix all the operators in the market to give it authenticity. It’s not autobiographical but more or less it’s based on my life.”Starring the Italian actor Salvatore Esposito, who played Genny in the crime series Gomorra, three series comprising 10 episodes have been written and Le Mée is negotiating with several broadcasters over the rights to begin shooting.“Salvatore is a big football fan and I wanted someone who knows how to speak and behave like an agent. It’s a crazy adrenaline-filled industry and I want people to see what the reality is like. We are also planning to have guest stars playing themselves. For example, when the agents go to Juventus to discuss a transfer maybe the president is Andrea Agnelli or the sporting director is Fabio Paratici?“I know a lot of people in football and hopefully it will not be difficult to convince real players, agents and sporting directors to make an appearance. Everyone wants to be in the movies after all.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1879b4454f5210f3eef425c6559f609a6fa3cb4d/623_334_3813_2289/master/3813.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9fcdbbb0784f5e9f3fd1f9f8e538e189","title":"liverpool among clubs argue against paying 330m rebate broadcasters premier league","story":"A group of clubs, led by Liverpool, will argue against paying a £330m rebate to Sky and other broadcasters at a meeting to discuss the matter on Thursday, despite the Premier League’s recommendation that it should be accepted.The finance directors of all 20 clubs were informed on Wednesday of the sum by the Premier League, whose head of broadcasting, Paul Molnar, is leading negotiations. Sky is the prime broadcaster with rights to show 128 live matches a season, followed by BT Sport with 52, and Amazon with 20.Liverpool’s chairman, Tom Werner, questioned the rebate at a previous conference with the Premier League executive and he will do so again when the meeting commences on Thursday at 11am, with growing dismay at the size of sums involved.A rebate is being sought because of contractual obligations going unfulfilled following the suspension of football in England in mid-March. The broadcasters also argue that given the remainder of the season will be behind closed doors should it, as hoped, be played out next month, the value of the product they have paid many millions for will be devalued.Liverpool, along with a number of other clubs – Tottenham and West Ham among them – dispute this idea. They believe fans not being able to attend games will increase the premium on live televised matches, with interest in any game shown heightened by the paucity of other live sports. The temporary lifting of the 3pm blackout on matches in the UK means the broadcasters will be able to show more live and clubs believe the value of their investment will increase.As things stand, Sky and BT have rights to 47 remaining games – the other 45 will be shared, with Sky wanting to broadcast 32, BT Sport wanting to show eight and the remaining five being split between Amazon and the BBC.The desire of broadcasters to leverage dressing-room and technical-area cameras will also receive pushback from the clubs, with the stance being that if agreed now it will be difficult to deny similar access when the next rights sales occur.Despite opposition from some clubs to paying the £330m rebate, David Kogan, who was the Premier League’s chief media rights adviser from 1998 to 2015 and a key architect of its global financial success, insists the full amount will have to be met. He told the : “The clubs are going to have to pay it whatever it is and there will be a formula that will be followed. Sooner or later they’re just going to have to pay the money out. They’ll have insurance, I imagine, to do that.”Clubs will already be more concerned, Kogan believes, over whether or not the next round of TV rights, due to be negotiated this year, will match the £9bn generated for the three-year period up until 2022 given the fallout from the current crisis. “What is the Premier League’s capacity to earn another £9bn-£10bn over a three-year period?” he said.“If the Premier League isn’t going to bring in that money, where is the flexibility to find new cash? Ticket sales? Clubs are already costing their fans a fortune. Hospitality? It’s already been priced to the max. So the only way that clubs can then survive is by looking at costs. And the massive costs are agents’ fees and players, and at that point you’re affecting the product.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3305b6524f9cbb7232423dd361344b478390872/0_0_4240_2545/master/4240.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f51c3e44df093e26fa6cc9117d22aeb","title":"bbc switches emily maitlis in newsnight episode over cummings remarks","story":"Katie Razzall will step in after BBC reprimands host over ‘breach of impartiality rules’Emily Maitlis was replaced as host of Wednesday night’s episode of Newsnight by another member of the programme’s team after BBC bosses reprimanded her over a monologue in which she attacked the government’s handling of Dominic Cummings’ lockdown trip to Durham.News bosses at the corporation said the BBC2 programme’s lead presenter breached impartiality rules with her opening remarks on Tuesday night. She had been due to host the show on Wednesday night, but the Newsnight reporter Katie Razzall presented it instead.Amid growing criticism of the reprimand, Newsnight’s editor, Esme Wren, wrote on Twitter that Maitlis “hasn’t been replaced tonight in response to the BBC statement”.In the monologue Maitlis told viewers: “Dominic Cummings broke the rules – the country can see that and it’s shocked the government cannot.“The longer ministers and the prime minister insist he worked within them, the more likely the angry response to the scandal is likely to be … He made those who struggled to keep to the rules feel like fools, and has allowed many more to assume they can flout them.”Talking of Johnson’s “blind loyalty” in the face of plummeting poll ratings, she expressed bafflement: “The prime minister knows all this and has chosen to ignore it.”Maitlis finished the programme by telling viewers: “I’ll be back tomorrow.” Clips of the sequence went viral on social media, attracting millions of views – many more than tune in to Newsnight on a typical evening. However, it caused fury among both Conservative politicians who have largely parked their longstanding criticism of the BBC during the pandemic, and also some journalists in and outside the public broadcaster who felt it went against the corporation’s approach to journalism.BBC news bosses agreed with the criticism of its own show, swiftly issuing a statement distancing themselves from the monologue. BBC sources said Newsnight’s editor, Esme Wren, worked on Tuesday night’s episode.“The BBC must uphold the highest standards of due impartiality in its news output,” the corporation said in a statement. “We’ve reviewed the entirety of last night’s Newsnight, including the opening section, and while we believe the programme contained fair, reasonable and rigorous journalism, we feel that we should have done more to make clear the introduction was a summary of the questions we would examine, with all the accompanying evidence, in the rest of the programme.“As it was, we believe the introduction we broadcast did not meet our standards of due impartiality. Our staff have been reminded of the guidelines.”Keith Brown, SNP deputy leader, said:\u0026nbsp“This statement is a gutless capitulation by BBC bosses.\u0026nbspNewsnight should be commended - not slapped down - for\u0026nbsptheir serious investigative work on Cummings, that’s not something you could say about\u0026nbspthe BBC News at 10.\u0026nbsp“Pandering to\u0026nbsp10 Downing Street\u0026nbspby curbing journalists from being able to hold the UK government to account is of serious concern.”\u0026nbspAn SNP spokesperson added: “It’s ironic that the only apology over the whole Dominic Cummings lockdown breaches scandal comes from the BBC.”\u0026nbspMaitlis’s profile, already high, has risen further since she was made lead presenter of the nightly current affairs show last year, shortly after publishing her book Airhead on life as a television presenter. She received global acclaim after confronting Prince Andrew about his connections with the deceased paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. In April she had a viral hit with another monologue of hers which dismissing the idea that coronavirus is a “great leveller” given its disproportionate impact on poorer people .The BBC has faced heavy criticism over the issue of maintaining impartiality in its news coverage, particularly over its handling of complaints about comments that BBC Breakfast’s presenter Naga Munchetty made about Donald Trump. It also struggled to deal with the enormous levels of criticism from both Labour and the Conservatives during the 2019 general election."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d999d78c367891690c375cd67573f8726a9916e/33_122_2455_1474/master/2455.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=6d584f0cc9b85851ae568c6b0dd9e69f","title":"what are your experiences of debt during the coronavirus pandemic","story":"We’d like to hear from people about how they are managing existing debts during the coronavirus pandemicSince the lockdown thousands of people have found themselves grappling with significantly reduced finances.

One fan looks back on Madchester’s ultimate messy partyHistory tells me that the Stone Roses at Spike Island was, in musical terms, awful: the band seemed bored, the sound was weak. Here were 27,000 people crammed into a field surrounded by the chemical factories of Widnes to watch one of the most all-advised, badly organised and shambolic gigs ever held. My memory tells me something different. I was 20 in 1990, and had been working for a year as a trainee reporter at the Chorley  in Lancashire. My relationship with the Stone Roses had begun the year before, when I found a loose cassette tape of their self-titled album under the seat of a train from Manchester to Wigan.I hadn’t heard of them: at the time, my tastes ran to the jangling indie-rock of the C86 movement. The Stone Roses fed my hunger for that, but also opened the door to the Madchester scene that saw the exhilarating collision of indie pop and house music. When the Roses announced a massive outdoor gig – after shows in Blackpool and at Alexandra Palace that had become the stuff of legend – there was no way I going to miss it.The weekend of the gig a colleague and I borrowed a van from our place of work, emblazoned with the paper’s masthead. I think we said we were going to cover a flower show, or maybe a non-league football game. We loaded up with mates and booze and set off for Cheshire. I’d been to Reading and Glastonbury so I thought I knew what to expect. I couldn’t have been more wrong. Spike Island was like Glastonbury, had it been organised on the back of a fag packet by half a dozen stoners in a beer garden.High metal fences gave it the feel of a high-security prison (this was 12 years before Glastonbury installed theirs). It seemed impenetrable, even for those with tickets. Nobody seemed to know how you got in. Every entrepreneur in the north was selling hooky T-shirts, posters and hats. Inside was a sea of bucket hats and fake designer labels. Everybody was off their head. There weren’t enough toilets, nor enough drink, nor enough space. There was an aura of menace. At Glastonbury, amid the shiny happy people and middle-class kids dropped off by their parents, there were always knots of shirtless lads who seemed half a pill away from getting violent. That Sunday afternoon, it seemed they constituted the entire population of Spike Island.But then the music started: DJs Dave Haslam, Paul Oakenfold and Frankie Bones MC Tunes, Madchester’s court jester, was there seemingly only to play his lone hit, The Only Rhyme That Bites, over and over. By the time the Stone Roses came on after sunset, people were climbing on the sound towers and dancing anywhere they could find a square of space. For some reason, Ian Brown was holding a huge inflatable globe. The sound was appalling and their performance was messy. And yet nobody cared.Driving home in the Chorley  van, somebody said: “Well, that’s the 80s over.” It felt true. The old regimes across Europe and the Baltic states were collapsing and Germany was reunifying. Thatcher went six months later. That hope wouldn’t last, although Spike Island’s reputation as a terrible gig did, calcifying into history.Thirty years on, that seems to be changing: my 15-year-old daughter has never been more impressed with me than when I told her I was at Spike Island. The gig has achieved Woodstock levels of myth for some of her generation.Perhaps today’s nostalgia for Spike Island also lies in the impossibility of attending any gig now or for the foreseeable future. From where we’re standing, dancing on urine-soaked ground to a band that feel like they’re playing half a mile away sounds pretty good."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a0edf67de989b7897d6758767bf1a4ef43d3527/0_622_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2415d362abdc2c7a18b111a2d0f794e3","title":"wu tang clan where to start in their group and solo back catalogue","story":"In Listener’s digest, our writers help you explore the work of great musicians. Next up: the mighty Staten Island rap collective-cum-Shaolin temple outpostWu-Tang Clan – Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) (Loud, 1993)The obvious choice is the only choice. As Los Angeles was shifting hip-hop’s power base from its historic New York home, nine powerful necromancers emerged from the shadows of Staten Island, “the forgotten borough”, to rebuild the east coast in their own image. Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) was a new blueprint in slimy-grimy NYC street rap. The spirit of regional greats like Kool G Rap loom over their shoulders, but the Clan pull you into their own forbidding image of the city, built from components of gangster rap, Five-Percenter ideology and hours of kung-fu movies.RZA’s beats sound as if they’re forged from melted-down knuckle-dusters. With the chemistry of a group of spiritually connected Shaolin monks, the Clan pass the mic like a hot potato, each outlandish personality already feeling fully formed as they veer from solemn street revelations to goofy wisecracks to send-you-crying-to-your-momma threats. Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) is not just the Clan’s genesis – it remains the purest distillation of their collective expression.GZA raps like a boxer methodically finding holes in an opponent’s tight defence, or Houdini unpicking a lock. No syllable seems arbitrary. Released during the first wave of post-36 Chambers solo albums, Liquid Swords utilises GZA’s icy vocals, cerebral rhyme patterns and bleak worldview to shed the Clan’s aesthetic of all pop leanings. Emboldened by RZA’s rawest back-to-front production job (the hiccupping sample that propels the title track, or the rumble of 4th Chamber), GZA embraces the role of neighbourhood correspondent. On I Gotcha Back, GZA solemnly shakes his head at the struggles he sees in his home borough, Brooklyn: “Could’ve wrote a book with a title Age 12 and Going Through Hell.” Coupled with the wicked beauty of the beats, it adds up to the greatest album to ever be stamped with the Wu symbol.The Clan entered the new millennium with cracks in their armour. The solo records released following second group album Wu-Tang Forever hadn’t resonated. Then came Ghostface Killah’s Supreme Clientele. Recorded after a self-imposed exile in Benin – where he sought relief from diabetes outside of western medicine – Ghost gave a clinic in outlandish rapping that plays like an abstract art piece swaddled in street scripture and comic-book lore. The English language has never felt so limitless – the opening verse of first song Nutmeg alone sees Ghost reference John McEnroe, compare kids caught up in the American legal system to Rapunzel and picture himself opulently “lamping in the throne with King Tut hat” – while the beats evolve the Wu’s grainy style to more bitter noir orchestrals, prominent samples and outlandish experimentation. Being in a legendary group dominates many great artists’ legacies, but Ghostface Killah has forged the broadest and best solo discography of any rapper to emerge from the 36 Chambers.The narratives around 8 Diagrams have to an extent overwhelmed the music. That members of the Clan were unhappy with the direction RZA pulled the album in is part of the unvarnished Wu-Tang history. Building a collection of songs when a group is not united is hardly optimum, so that a classic record emerged feels even more extraordinary. It’s true that RZA was determined to wrench the Clan from the sounds that had defined their legacy, moving towards lusher orchestration. But by retaining the kung-fu mysticism, and with no member slouching in the recording booth, 8 Diagrams always feels like a Wu release. Almost every experiment hits: Campfire is built around what sounds like soldiers humming as they march off to battle, a heavy drumbeat that could have been excavated from an ancient tomb, and a heavy splash of martial-arts movie dialogue. It’s hard to make a case for 8 Diagram’s legacy – it’s currently the only Wu group album not on streaming services – but it’s a key document of how RZA pushed them forwards.The first Only Built 4 Cuban Linx saw Raekwon, heavily supported by Ghostface Killah, write and star in a gripping drama swathed in the myth of the American gangster. Young men at the time, they never sounded all that youthful, their voices rippling with ruin, as if they had already seen too much. Released 14 years later, Only Built 4 Cuban Linx ... Pt II sees the duo cast as grizzled street veterans, older and wiser but no less willing to drop their enemies on their heads.The album follows a similarly cinematic outline to the original – Black Mozart is bold enough to reinterpret the Godfather theme tune. But there’s a bitter dose of reality: on Cold Outside, the pair sullenly contemplate children murdered by their parents or killed by stray bullets. As the 2000s stretched on and Clan members became caught up in other interests, relationships strained and comedy sketches threatened to demystify the music, Raekwon and Ghost continued to make great albums. Only Built 4 Cuban Linx ... Pt II reasserted what everyone paying attention knew: Wu-Tang is for ever.The Wu-Tang Manual, by RZA and Chris NorrisBy breaking down each inidual component of the Wu – from comic books, films and chess to Five-Percenter philosophy, economics and language – RZA deconstructs the Clan’s history and mythology with a brevity that’s welcoming for newcomers.Once Upon a Time in Shaolin, by Cyrus BozorgmehrThe Clan’s Once Upon a Time in Shaolin art project drew headlines when the single-copy album fell into the hands of “pharma bro” and real-life comic-book villain Martin Shkreli. The story is detailed in this book by Cyrus Bozorgmehr, who served as a senior adviser on the enterprise. The prose is wild, yet Bozorgmehr’s mix of New York street slang (at least how an English-born, Morocco-based creative consultant might perceive it) and intense mythologising strikes the right tone for this impossible saga.Supreme Clientele, by Jeff WeissAs part of Pitchfork’s Sunday Review series that delves into old notable albums, Jeff Weiss bestows a perfect 10 on Ghostface Killah’s Supreme Clientele, writing the definitive thesis on the record in the process.• Dean Van Nguyen is the author of Iron Age: The Art of Ghostface Killah This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

There are some inconsistencies in his account of events and the reasons behind it. I am not clear about when he would have been symptomatic and on what dates he should have been in isolation. Or whether it was appropriate he drove home at the time he did.“There is no doubt he took risks – refuelling at a petrol station is a risk to oneself and to others, which presumably he did.“I understand there may have been other issues which would have made other options to care for his child in London impossible. What is clear is that the scenes of the last few days will have undermined key public health messages. I deeply regret this and am very sorry for it.”Mordaunt, a former defence secretary, said people were “reasonable and sympathetic” about the difficult choices facing families and highlighted that the public may not know all he reasons why other courses of action were not open to him.But she added: “In all of this though is also our obligations to others too. It is because of that shared responsibility and the public making those sacrifices that we have reduced the infection rate. The rules and those obligations apply to all of us. We cannot thank people enough for all they have done.“Perhaps my deepest regret in all of this is that it must be a distraction to efforts to combat coronavirus and the many other issues the government is still having to deal with. So much else has happened in the last few days, including a serious incursion by China into India.”Mordaunt does not call for Cummings to resign in her letter, and it is understood she is not calling for him to go. Mordaunt’s letter was sent in her capacity as a constituency MP, rather than as a government minister. But her comments are the most critical to come from a senior member of Johnson’s team.More than 40 Tory MPs have now called on Cummings to resign or be sacked and many more have expressed their anger in private to government. David Simmonds and George Freeman were the latest to express their view that Cummings should go, in messages to their constituents on Wednesday.However, Johnson and his cabinet ministers have stood behind Cummings, saying his actions were legal and reasonable – something that any father would do out of concern for their child’s welfare.Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.Attempting to defuse public anger, Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, said on Tuesday that anyone could do the same as Cummings in similar circumstances, even though his actions have provoked uproar, with polls suggesting that the majority of people believe he should resign.“If there are no other options, if you don’t have ready access to childcare, then you can do as\u0026nbspDominic Cummings\u0026nbspchose to do,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.However, Jenrick said it was not possible for any fines already issued to people for driving to seek childcare to be reviewed, contrary to\u0026nbspsuggestions from Matt Hancock, the health secretary, on Tuesday.“There isn’t going to be a formal review. It’s for the police to decide whether to impose fines under the law,” Jenrick said.The controversy was ignited last week when the  and Mirror\u0026nbsprevealed\u0026nbspthat Cummings had driven across England with his wife and four-year-old son fearing that they may have contracted Covid-19, in order to seek possible childcare.After his 14-day quarantine period, Cummings took his family on a 60-mile round trip to a beauty spot in Barnard Castle, which he says was to test whether his eyesight was good enough for him to drive back to London on 13 April.More Tory MPs went public on Tuesday night and Wednesday with\u0026nbspcalls for Cummings to resign, while three of the party’s new County Durham MPs – Richard Holden, Dehenna Davison and Paul Howell – said none of them would have taken the same decision and acknowledged that the “continuing situation is creating a major distraction”.As Johnson was questioned on Cummings at the liaison committee, Giles Watling, the MP for Clacton, tweeted: “I’ve been listening to the PM in the liaison committee. I applaud him for sticking by his man but I’m afraid Mr Cummings should stand down. His continued presence at the heart of government at this time is an unwanted distraction.”In Cummings’ defence, Danny Kruger, a former No 10 aide and new Conservative MP, raised the stakes by telling colleagues in a note that demands for resignation were tantamount to a vote of no confidence in the prime minister."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9438b21ece85880d9a3b89fe6f47b227008d6684/0_15_2500_1499/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfb6e435abc03ff7cfc978f4c00ac6b6","title":"allosaurus dinosaur suspected to be scavenging cannibal","story":"Dinosaur-on-dinosaur dining habit revealed by scrutiny of fossil bones from Colorado siteAbout nine metres long, with grasping claws and a skull it used like a hatchet, Allosaurus was among the most fearsome dinosaurs of the Jurassic period. Now, it seems, the animal could also have been a cannibal.Fossil researchers have revealed that bite marks found in a cache of dinosaur bones from the Mygatt-Moore quarry, western Colorado, were made by dinosaur-on-dinosaur dining. And the marks on Allosaurus bones had potentially been made by dinosaurs of their own kind.Dr Stephanie Drumheller-Horton, first author of the research, from the University of Tennessee, said the findings shed new light on the predators.“We’re not sure if the Mygatt-Moore preserves an unusually stressed ecosystem, where theropods like\u0026nbspAllosaurus\u0026nbspwere eating any available food – including each other – or if this was actually normal behaviour for them, and our previous fossil collection strategies have led us astray. With either result though, we know that these animals were more willing and able to bite into bones than we previously thought.”Writing in the journal Plos One, Drumheller-Horton and colleagues report how they examined 2,368 fossilised bones previously dug up at the quarry, which dates to about 152m years ago, encompassing the late Jurassic period.While some of the marks could have been due to predation, at least some were down to just scavenging, Drumheller-Horton said. “Predators usually target the meatiest bits first and work their way down through less and less nutritious parts. A big theropod trying to eat another big theropod’s toes was probably very late to the party, when the more choice sections were already eaten.”\u0026nbspWhile Drumheller-Horton said it was not clear what had made the smallest marks, the larger marks were caused by meat-eating dinosaurs, the theropods –something previously found to be rare. “There simply wasn’t anyone else in the site that could have made them,” she said, adding that some of the marks clearly had been left by serrated teeth. “That excludes other possible predators from contention, leaving only theropods to consider,” she said.She said the most common large predator at the site, by some way, was Allosaurus, though the smaller\u0026nbspCeratosaurus was also present each could have left bite marks. One bite mark, she added, was from a very large theropod, but its identity was unclear.Crucially, while many of the bitten bones had belonged to long-necked dinosaurs called sauropods, and some had come from Mymoorapelta maysi, a type of armoured dinosaur, the team found several bite marks on Allosaurus fossils – suggesting the cannibalistic nature of Allosaurus.Dr Stephen Brusatte, a palaeontologist at the University of Edinburgh, who was not involved in the work, said the cache was an unprecedented record of what theropod dinosaurs had been eating.“It’s most intriguing that there are Allosaurus bones with big bite marks that are a good match for the size and shape of Allosaurus teeth,” Brusatte said. “Although it’s not completely conclusive that Allosaurus was the biter, it is one of the most reasonable conclusions – unless there was a completely unknown mega-theropod that was sharing this ecosystem with it and the others.”Andre Rowe, a researcher\u0026nbspat Bristol University, suggested the high prevalence of bite marks seen could be due to fossil hunters collecting particular fossils. But, he added, Allosaurus would not have been the only dinosaur eating its own. “Evidence for cannibalism is noted in a Madagascan dinosaur named\u0026nbspMajungasaurus.\u0026nbspIt also occurs in crocodilians, some of the closest living relatives of dinosaurs.”. Brusatte agreed. “There is evidence that the even bigger Tyrannosaurus rex was a cannibal, and many predators in today’s world are known to eat members of their own species, especially when times get tough, like during droughts or spurts of bad weather.”But at least one dinosaur has had its reputation unfairly tarnished. “We used to think that we had evidence for cannibalism in\u0026nbspCoelophysis\u0026nbsptoo,” said Drumheller-Horton. “But that ended up being a case of mistaken identity.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d193cafe03cb28e7d6b0afb142d84d7e5a1e2ecc/0_20_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da5a25c53e848dd3e8915b1f8ddcedf6","title":"lgbtq community how have you been affected by the lockdown","story":"We would like to hear from LGBTQ+ people about their experiences during the pandemicWhile the pandemic lockdown has raised significant concerns for everyone, we want to know whether it has brought additional difficulties for the LGBTQ+ community.Being able to embrace your sexuality or gender identity has a positive impact on wellbeing and resilience.

He had returned to the practice courts shortly before the tour was suspended because of the Covid-19 outbreak. Details of the event in June, including venue and dates, are still to be confirmed.The Scot will have numerous options as he eases back into competition, because the LTA is also planning to host a series of British Tour events beginning a week later. More events are planned around the country but the LTA has chosen the outdoor hard courts of its National Tennis Centre in Roehampton for the sport’s return.The first of the three-day events will begin on 3 July, behind closed doors, with further tournaments running each week throughout the month. Both the men’s and women’s singles will host draws of 16 players, while eight pairings will convene for the doubles events. One feature that risks putting off top players is the best of three sets format of four rounds over three days, requiring players to compete twice in one day.The LTA’s initiative is one of numerous events cropping up around the world to fill space left by the suspension of tour events. Other national competitions featuring Dominic Thiem (in Austria) and Petra Kvitova (in Czech Republic) are already under way. Novak Djokovic is also hosting a series of competitions across the Balkans from 13 June that will include Thiem and Alexander Zverev. In Charleston, USA, a women’s team event featuring Bianca Andreescu and Sofia Kenin begins on 23 June.Earlier confusion about the possibility of top-level competition with travel restrictions and lockdowns has given way to considerable hope as the final grand slams of the year work towards staging their events in some form. The US Open’s final decision on its status is slated for mid-June but last week the US issued an exemption from travel restrictions for athletes and their support staff.The date of the rescheduled French Open, to be held in late September or early October, is still being finalised but organisers are now preparing for competition and lights have been installed on eight courts, with a new retractable roof now on Court Philippe Chatrier at Roland Garros.As optimism grows, organisers are looking beyond playing behind closed doors. “It’s not even a hypothesis we’re considering any more,” Hughes Cavallin, the general treasurer of the French tennis federation, told the Tennis Majors website. “What we do envisage is letting in 25,000 people instead of 40,000. We still want to put on a good tournament.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40c4def2776c070e101876a4c26dc963f6226a5d/165_44_2902_1740/master/2902.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0225b0ee8268973e7f026138e8eebcc4","title":"eoin morgan scotches talk of imminent england return for alex hales","story":"Alex Hales looks set to remain frozen out of England’s one-day setup for some time yet after Eoin Morgan scotched talk of an imminent comeback and\u0026nbspstressed the opener’s recreational drugs ban could have derailed last year’s World Cup\u0026nbspbid.A training squad of up to 45 England players is expected to be named on Friday and with a packed summer schedule also due – one that is unlikely to permit movement between formats with the biosecure measures in place – Hales may have re-entered the mix.However, despite recent contact\u0026nbspwith Hales\u0026nbsp– and\u0026nbspChris Woakes, a senior\u0026nbspplayer, stating last week that the dressing room would\u0026nbsplikely\u0026nbspaccept\u0026nbsphis return\u0026nbsp– Morgan is not yet ready to sanction a recall\u0026nbspfor the player he cast aside on the eve of his side’s ultimately victorious 50-over campaign.“Alex is in a unique position,”\u0026nbspsaid the England white-ball captain, at an online event to celebrate the 15-year anniversary of the cricket charity Chance to Shine. “On the cusp of a World Cup the huge breakdown in trust between him and the players was extremely dramatic.“I’ve certainly spoken to Alex and see an avenue for him to come back. But, like in life and any sport, when there’s a breakdown of trust the only healer in that is time. It’s only been 13 months since the incident. Given that it could have derailed a World Cup campaign, it will take more time“It’s not about performance with Alex, he’s a fantastic player and it’s never been discussed as to whether he’s good enough to be in the squad. It’s about on and off the field and values we adhere to. Alex showed complete disregard for them and he needs to build that up for as long as he can and, hopefully, an opportunity will present itself along the line.”After a proposed three-match ODI series versus Ireland in late July and three Twenty20s against Pakistan a month later, the schedule for England’s white-ball team looks uncertain. On Wednesday\u0026nbspthe International Cricket Council moved\u0026nbspto play down reports of the T20 World Cup in Australia in October being postponed but such talk remains rife and Morgan said he would be surprised if it went ahead.The\u0026nbsp33-year-old had been targeting that tournament, and the following edition in India in 2021, and remains hopeful he will lead England for both. Energised by the current break and feeling ready to pick up a bat once more, he even hinted at being around for the next 50-over World Cup in 2023, even if this will hinge on his value as a batsman and the longstanding back injury he manages.England are expected to prioritise the intended Test series against West Indies and Pakistan selection-wise, something that could present opportunities for younger white-ball players such as the Somerset opener Tom Banton or Phil Salt, of Sussex, another power player at the top of the order.\u0026nbspMorgan said he will continue to ask members of the setup for their thoughts on Hales returning one day, given his obvious pedigree. “Teams in the past wouldn’t have been strong enough to make decisions like we did pre-World Cup and then continue to stand by them post-World Cup.“And that says a lot about the group. They feel as if they’re completely a part of something that they can take ownership of, because they’ve seen the work that they’ve put in and they’ve seen results. They also have seen instances where a player coming back into a group has the ability to take a lot of energy away and have impact on a lot of other players.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3010d1112f1c1b70ce059ace58c5391b147282dc/0_54_4033_2421/master/4033.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=6efe8d68e17b4574fbe116f1ca57540f","title":"hannah gadsby douglas review netflix","story":"Available on NetflixGadsby follows up her hit show Nanette with a swaggering set that blazes with well-earned confidenceThe last time Hannah Gadsby released a Netflix special, it\u0026nbspchanged her life\u0026nbsp– and arguably, changed comedy. In\u0026nbspNanette, she publicly quit standup, the practice of which – she argued – made her complicit in her own (homophobic, mainly) oppression. It was a fierce provocation, delivered with expert control of increasingly serious tone, and it introduced a new lens through which to consider self-mocking comedy. Far from ending Gadsby’s career, it gave that career a spectacular new lease of life.Douglas begins that new life. As I wrote on\u0026nbspseeing it live last autumn, it’s a more approachable set than its predecessor. Gadsby is obviously having fun – which isn’t something you could say about Nanette –\u0026nbspbut it’s in no way a climbdown. The show (her 1oth – but also her “difficult second album”, she admits) is perfectly judged, a 75-minute set that proves self-deprecation is a thing of the past for Gadsby, that blazes with well-earned confidence, and that hitches her crusading, patriarchy-bashing humour to great jokes, meticulous set-building – and a new cause.Part of its appeal is Gadsby’s newfound swagger – real, but sometimes teasingly sent up. That’s never more in evidence than in her remarkable prelude, in which our host itemises routine by routine what she’ll be saying and doing in the show to follow. It’s a real coup, which lays depth charges that will detonate for her throughout the set, and tees up the subject towards which the show tends: Gadsby’s 2015 diagnosis of autism.I did find that opening set piece more thrilling live than on Netflix, because it was a surprise first time round. Also, being in the room with her made it feel more like a dialogue, tight-roping between smug and playful, than a look-at-me trick. But whether the sequence delights or disconcerts us is all equal to Gadsby: after all, autistic people, she tells us, seldom make a good first impression.There’s great craft in the show that follows, as Gadsby builds from a hack starter on the differences between US and Australian speech, via a dog-walking anecdote (which prises open her anti-sexist theme), towards a takedown of male arrogance in having named, diagnosed and depicted everything, forever, on their own partial terms. The show’s title derives from an intimate body part named after an 18th-century Scottish doctor. Its closing\u0026nbspart history lecture\u0026nbsp– one great visual gag after another – marvels at what the so-called Old Masters chose to depict. And Gadsby’s material on neuroersity smoulders with fury at the doctors who dismissed her as “hormonal” and the perception of autism as the preserve of nerdy boys.It’s a well-constructed set, with a high hit-rate of jokes. Even the weaker, cruder sections – those laying into golfers and anti-vaxxers – are redeemed by neat one-liners, like Gadsby’s claim to be “microdosing” herself on social media abuse from the latter: “Your hate is my vaccine.” Finally, the show emerges as a trenchant defence of Gadsby’s right to be different – and to make shows that won’t fit (as per Nanette) within narrow definitions of comedy. “My brain takes me to places no one else lives,” she claims – but if the success of Douglas is anything to go by, more and more audiences will choose to spend time there.\u0026nbsp• Hannah Gadsby: Douglas is on Netflix"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1abc777a08cf370249a794f682a5782275f979b8/84_0_667_400/master/667.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72ed45b9e8ba5e51f7f439c01a319ff0","title":"scenes for survival review brian cox zoom inspector rebus national theatre of scotland","story":"Available onlineIan Rankin’s stalwart detective struggles with self-isolation in one of six quarantine-themed short films from the National Theatre of ScotlandThere’s a special joy in seeing a familiar character in an unfamiliar place.

Take him out of that world, as Rankin does in John Rebus: The Lockdown Blues, and you have a character in search of definition.\u0026nbspSelf-isolating during the Covid-19 crisis, this Rebus is left with nothing but memories, beer bottles and his record collection to fill the time between socially distanced visits from protege Siobhan. It’s simultaneously funny and sad.\u0026nbspPlayed by\u0026nbspBrian Cox with the haunted look of a man in search of the microphone switch on Zoom, he hovers on the edge of existential despair. His whiskery beard is not a lockdown thing, he says, it’s “a cannae be arsed thing”. Like so many of us, he is someone whose very sense of self has been called into question by an isolation that reminds him all too much of a prison cell.The short film is one of an initial six Scenes for Survival produced by the National Theatre of Scotland as part of the\u0026nbspBBC’s Culture in Quarantine season. There are more than 40 in line to be released in batches three times a week. Like the\u0026nbspAbbey theatre’s Dear Ireland series, they are already showing characteristics of the emerging form of lockdown monologue: the loneliness, the self-absorption, the pressures of living at close quarters with family members, the bittersweet reflections of people removed from the drama of public life.Breaking the mould is\u0026nbspFrances Poet with A Mug’s Game, which, despite being about face masks, takes us into different territory. An extract from her 2019 play\u0026nbspFibres, it is about a shipyard electrician paying the price for having had to work with asbestos at the start of his career.

Cornfields grew between stands of cottonwood trees, and harvesters cruised down the double-yellow line spewing golden dust. Signs advertised gifts from Minnesota’s northland: moccasins, wild rice, dreamcatchers, canoes. The radio station I’d been listening to had played an entire Bruce Springsteen live concert: Rutherford, New Jersey, 1984.I was heading to the Northwest Angle – the northernmost point of the continental US – to research a book about the country’s northern border. The Angle is a blip on the boundary – an isolated pocket in Minnesota set 100 miles north of the line of the main border. It is the northland of the northland – surrounded by Lake of the Woods on three sides and Canada on the other. To get there by road, you have to drive through Manitoba. It wasn’t supposed to be that way. The Angle was a mistake, made at the time of the Treaty of Paris, the accord that ended the American Revolution in 1783. The map that the delegates used, made by a London physician-botanist and amateur mapmaker named John Mitchell, marked the source of the Mississippi, a key landmark on the proposed northern boundary, as 150 miles north of where it actually is.Negotiations continued nonetheless, and the line was drawn. When the Treaty of Paris was signed on 3 September 1783, US sovereignty was acknowledged by Britain all British influence was abolished British protection of American interests around the world was lifted confiscated Loyalist property was to be reinstated and the US’s northern border was set from the north-west corner of Lake of the Woods to … nowhere.Five miles north of Warroad, Minnesota, I pulled up to the Canadian border. A stern, blue-eyed agent asked where I was going, if I’d been there before and how I’d heard about it. I said I was going to Angle Inlet, and he handed me a piece of paper that read, “Phone Reporting from the Northwest Angle”. A map at the top of the page showed the Angle’s north–south boundary. Three bubble quotes with telephone icons on them read Carlson’s, Jim’s Corner, and Young’s Bay.I was to report in from Jim’s Corner, he told me.I followed Route 12 – known as Mom’s Way – through Manitoba to an abandoned gas station where the agent had said to take a right. I did and fishtailed onto a dirt road. Thirty minutes later, the road crossed back into US territory, and I spotted four older men huddled next to a phone booth at an intersection.“Is this Jim’s Corner?” I asked.The men looked at me, then at each other. “We’re wondering the same thing,” one said.The group watched as I picked up the phone and pushed a button with an American-flag sticker on it. After a couple of rings a voice answered, “US Customs and Border Patrol.” The agent ticked off a list of ambiguous and prying questions. “What are you doing? Where are you going? Why are you going there? What kind of fish are you fishing for? Have you ever caught one of those before? How do you cook it? What does it taste like?” Satisfied, the agent said I was checked in, and I left the old men, still huddled by the booth.Paul’s grandfather had pioneered the Angle and built three of the six cabins at the resort. The old man had also built the road I had driven in on and half of the town. Paul’s boys grew up going to Angle Inlet School, the last one-room schoolhouse in Minnesota, until the sixth grade. After that they had to commute 65 miles to Warroad. Paul had spent the past 20 years fighting US and Canadian authorities who cut off access to hospitals and schools, unfairly taxed Angle residents and changed fishing and guiding regulations on Lake of the Woods, where most residents earn a living. The town has tried to secede from the US several times. The last effort was in the 1980s. The hassle of living in the Angle has kept families from moving there, and the community is slowly dying. “You gotta think how much longer we can keep doing this,” Paul said.A deep inlet lined with tall reeds connects the resort to Lake of the Woods. A light breeze rustled the grass and cooled what was becoming an extraordinarily hot day for late September. We’d been talking for 20 minutes before Paul asked if I wanted a room at the resort. I told him I’d be there for a night, and he tossed me a key and nodded to a cabin behind the office. “The AC works,” he said.I spent most of the afternoon reading about the Angle. After British explorer David Thompson discovered the actual headwaters of the Mississippi in 1798, it took nearly a century for US and British Boundary Commissions to survey it. It wouldn’t be marked until 1912.Five years later, in 1917, Jake Colson and early settlers of the Angle arrived. Back then, the drums of the Ojibwe tribe reverberated through the forest. Jake found what he described as a Shangri-la overflowing with fish, game and wild rice, and a wilderness few non-native Americans had ever seen. He settled down with a cow, a few chickens and a garden. The Ojibwe called him Pohzhash, meaning “big Indian”. He met his wife when his sister arrived for a visit with a friend. The couple lived in a tent until they finished their first cabin. They fished, logged and harvested marsh marigolds to survive. Jake worked as a hunting and fishing guide in the summer and saved money until 1945, when he built a few guest cabins.Without a road to the Angle, business at his resort – accessed only by boat – was slow. Jake added an electric generator and running water. He helped build the town’s post office and acted as its first postmaster. Then he got permission to build a connector road to Canada’s Route 308, which runs north from Mom’s Way. When fishermen left in the summer, duck hunters arrived when the hunters left, ice fishermen came.CB radio was the only form of communication. Jake’s black-and-white Zenith television could pick up one channel, from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. To deliver a baby or have a broken bone set, the family would drive 130 miles to Winnipeg. There was often a delay at the border as customs agents tried to figure out which country Angle Inlet was in. The telephone finally arrived in 1991.Paul knocked on my door the next morning to ask if I wanted to go fishing. Lake of the Woods is 1,700 square miles, and fishermen pay Paul $500 a day to make it a bit smaller. I grabbed my jacket and we walked to his boat. Paul’s wife, Karen, came along. Paul, in camo hat and sweatshirt, sat sideways with his legs crossed, one hand on the wheel, the other tucked under his knee. He chatted with Karen about their kids’ homework. Internet could be spotty in the Angle, and one of the boys had had trouble emailing a paper to his teacher. Karen held her phone over her head trying to get service and eventually managed to reach the teacher and get her kid off the hook.We passed Fort Saint Charles, a French Canadian fur-trading post built on an island in 1732. A trader named Pierre La Vérendrye had built the fort with his sons, before going on to explore and claim the western half of Canada for New France. The fort, reconstructed with new logs and asphalt shingles, sits on the US side of the line now, and an American flag flew behind the log palisade.There were no boundary markers on the lake as Paul crossed into Canada. We sailed past some long slabs of granite on the shores of Bukete Island and pulled into a bay whose location he made me swear not to reveal. He handed me a fishing rod, drove a hook through the head of a minnow, and tossed my line overboard. He did the same for Karen and himself, and they cast their lines off opposite sides of the boat. Ten minutes later we had eight fish packed in a cooler.Paul looked at his watch, and said we had to get back to meet the school bus. Back at the dock, Karen hopped off and headed home to meet the kids. Paul asked whether I wanted to join the family for fish tacos but I had a flight to catch in Minneapolis that night.He was already dropping fillets on the grill as I drove out. I headed west, past road signs riddled with bullet holes, while a few commuters drove by on their way home from Warroad. A wall of hardwood lined each side of the dirt road that Jake Colson had cut.The road had been graded recently and ran straight and smooth for 15 miles. I thought about the old man and his neighbours chopping their way through the dense forest. It must have taken thousands of man-hours, hauling brush and removing stumps. I figured Jake would be proud that his grandkids drove the road twice a day now, following the dusty finger from the Angle, through Canada back to the US.Porter Fox is author of Northland: A 4,000-mile Journey Along America’s Forgotten Border (WW Norton)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dda7c95c9afe1d824a93d55af75b2dc3ef4b4440/0_740_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a242e3e0252708ba2c61d8f98ad34462","title":"jeffrey epstein netflix documentary","story":"Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich synthesizes legal information with first-person testimony of the billionaire’s abuse and bought immunity into a shocking watchIt’s difficult to watch Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich, a four-hour Netflix series on the now-deceased convicted sex offender without a choking sense of outrage. How many girls had to suffer to get attention? How perversely twisted is the American justice system that a Gatsby-esque billionaire, friends with such powerful figures as Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew and Donald Trump, a longstanding donor to Harvard and MIT, could buy his way out of an almost certain life sentence for child sex abuse and trafficking?Filthy Rich arrives, of course, less than a year after Epstein, 66, died, officially by suicide, in a New York jail last August. “There’s no justice in this,” Shawna Rivera, speaking publicly for the first time about Epstein’s alleged abuse starting when she was 14, says in the final episode. “There was just so much more to be said that will never be said.”There is, however, much to be learned from the sordid, winding, thwarted path to Epstein’s eventual arrest on sex trafficking charges in July 2019. Filthy Rich doesn’t so much break new ground as synthesize the abundance of information with the visceral impact of first-person testimony on Epstein’s crimes – stories of predation, self-doubt and shame by numerous survivors betrayed by the justice system supposed to protect them. Epstein’s decades-long legal saga is “the biggest example I’ve ever seen of somebody using their money and influence to thwart reporting on the subject and to work out an outrageous deal,” Joe Berlinger, an executive producer, told the .Production on Filthy Rich began before Epstein became a household name – before his death, before his shock arrest, before a 2018 Pulitzer-winning investigation by the Miami Times-Herald into the sweetheart plea deal negotiated by federal prosecutors to keep Epstein out of prison. “The level of incompetence and back-door dealing that allowed him to get off – no one on this production thought he would ever be arrested during the making of the show,” said Berlinger, who first began work on an Epstein project in spring 2018, after he received a copy of mystery novelist James Patterson’s 2016 true crime book on the reclusive billionaire (and neighbor in Palm Beach).The book “infuriated me”, Berlinger said, especially since, in 2018, “people were afraid to tell this story.”Convincing women to speak on the record “was hard”, director Lisa Bryant said. “Some people wouldn’t talk at all, some numbers were wrong, some decided they just weren’t ever going to talk, for various reasons. Some hadn’t even told their parents about it.” The case of Epstein was never a he-said, she-said situation to quote the retired Palm Beach police chief Michael Reiter in the Herald’s original story: “This was 50-something ‘shes’ and one ‘he’ – and the ‘shes’ all basically told the same story.”But Epstein’s intimidation factor was strong, and many of the survivors, their justice thwarted by the plea deal and Epstein’s subsequent immunity, had moved on with their lives. “Yes, there was a pattern that he had, but each person’s experience with that and how they handled it is different,” said Bryant. “This is their story to tell, their narrative. We wanted this to be told through their eyes.”The series revolves around the various experiences of the survivors, dating back to at least 1996, when the painter Maria Farmer and her teenage sister, Annie, contacted the FBI to allege molestation by Epstein and his ex-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell. It went nowhere. Years later, in 2005, Palm Beach police launched an investigation into an alleged sex ring run out of Epstein’s beachside mansion, in which Epstein and Maxwell allegedly coerced high-school girls – most of them around 14, in vulnerable circumstances and needing money – into sex acts under the pretense of a “massage” for $200. Maxwell has denied any involvement. The alleged crimes expanded even further, as favorites were allegedly trafficked to rich and powerful friends for parties at Epstein’s $77m Upper East Side mansion in New York, at a London townhouse, and on Epstein’s private island in the Caribbean.Some survivors featured in the series are speaking on camera for the first time others, such as Virginia Giuffre, have been advocating for justice for years. Giuffre alleges in and out of the documentary that she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew, who has denied the allegations and queried the veracity of a photo that exists of him with his arm around her aged 18, with a smiling Maxwell in the background.Given witness testimony in the series by a former Epstein employee who alleges he saw the prince engaged in poolside “foreplay” with a topless Giuffre on Epstein’s island, Andrew’s defense and lack of cooperation with prosecutors reads even more shabbily here. Andrew says he has “no recollection” of meeting Giuffre.The show stokes justifiable outrage through each survivor’s account, retracing how the Palm Beach police department’s investigation was bumped up to the FBI, and was then derailed by a “non-prosecution agreement” the Herald called “the deal of a lifetime.” Signed in 2008, the deal – brokered by state attorney and later Trump labor secretary Alex Acosta and Epstein’s all-star team of lawyers, including OJ Simpson defender Alan Dershowitz (the only Epstein acolyte to attempt a defense in the series) – was controversially sealed and kept private from the accusers. It offered Epstein and named and unnamed co-conspirators immunity from federal criminal charges instead, he pleaded guilty to two prostitution charges in state court, and served 11 of 13 months in Palm Beach jail, out six days a week on “work release”.“He was still seeing girls, he was still making money, he was still conducting business – I mean, it’s just outrageous,” said Berlinger of Epstein’s “incarceration”. Epstein’s elusion of justice for another decade demonstrated how the American criminal justice system “was built for money and power and political gain”, said Bryant. “And we see that over and over again in this case.”The series also addresses, but does not endorse, conspiracy theories on the cause of Epstein’s death the medical examiner ruled a suicide by hanging, though an outside expert hired by Epstein’s brother raised unsubstantiated doubts, citing an unusual neck fracture. “I think it’s up for debate, and for people to look at the evidence both ways and make their own decisions,” said Bryant.Epstein’s death denied survivors’ their true day in court, though several did speak at a posthumous hearing. There remains the possibility of prosecuting those linked to Epstein: perhaps Maxwell, whose whereabouts remain unknown and who recently sued Epstein’s estate – the fund supposed to compensate victims – for her legal fees. “I firmly believe and hope that the survivors will get that money,” said Bryant, and that statutes of limitations are reconsidered given greater understanding of childhood sexual trauma, the length and difficulty of processing enough to speak publicly.For the survivors, said Berlinger, “the ultimate closure would be for everyone who enabled this sick lifestyle and everyone who enabled a wealthy white person with power and influence to have a different standard of justice to also be held to account.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e09fa7d03791a4f85195905bb2187f3403b59cc2/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0915975e10b62cd903a35eff0a72d94c","title":"honest elections project conservative voting restrictions","story":"Honest Elections Project, part of network that pushed supreme court pick Brett Kavanaugh, is now focusing on voting restrictionsThis story was reported in collaboration with OpenSecrets.A powerful new conservative organization fighting to restrict voting in the 2020 presidential election is really just a rebranded group that is part of a dark money network already helping Donald Trump’s unprecedented effort to remake the US federal judiciary, the  and OpenSecrets reveal.The organization, which calls itself the Honest Elections Project, seemed to emerge out of nowhere a few months ago and started stoking fears about voter fraud. Backed by a dark money group funded by rightwing stalwarts like the Koch brothers and Betsy DeVos’ family, the Honest Elections Project is part of the network that pushed the US supreme court picks Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, and is quickly becoming a juggernaut in the escalating fight over voting rights.The project announced it was spending $250,000 in advertisements in April, warning against voting by mail and accusing Democrats of cheating. It facilitated letters to election officials in Colorado, Florida and Michigan, using misleading data to accuse jurisdictions of having bloated voter rolls and threatening legal action.Calling voter suppression a “myth”, it has also been extremely active in the courts, filing briefs in favor of voting restrictions in Nevada, Virginia, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota, among other places, at times represented by lawyers from the same firm that represents Trump. By having a hand in both voting litigation and the judges on the federal bench, this network could create a system where conservative donors have an avenue to both oppose voting rights and appoint judges to back that effort.Despite appearing to be a free-standing new operation, the Honest Elections Project is just a legal alias for the Judicial Education Project, a well-financed nonprofit connected to a powerful network of dark money conservative groups, according to business records reviewed by the  and OpenSecrets.“These are really well-funded groups that in the context of judicial nominations have been systematically, over the long term but also the short term, kind of pushing an agenda to pack the courts with pretty extreme right wing nominees,” said Vanita Gupta, the president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. “The infrastructure that they’ve built over the years has been a really important vehicle for them to do this.”The Judicial Education Project is also closely linked to Leonard Leo, one of the most powerful people in Washington who has shaped Donald Trump’s unprecedented effort to remake the federal judiciary with conservative judges.The organization has deftly hidden the changes to its name from public view. In December, the Judicial Education Project formally changed its legal name to The 85 Fund, a group Leo backed to funnel “tens of millions” of dollars into conservative causes, according to Axios. The Honest Elections Project is merely a fictitious name – an alias – the fund legally adopted in February. The change was nearly indiscernible because The 85 Fund registered two other legal aliases on the same day, including the Judicial Education Project, its old name. The legal maneuver allows it to operate under four different names with little public disclosure that it is the same group.The Judicial Education Project is closely aligned with the Judicial Crisis Network, a group with unmatched influence in recent years in shaping the federal judiciary. The Judicial Crisis Network spearheaded the campaigns to get Gorsuch and Kavanaugh confirmed to the US supreme court, spending millions of dollars in each instance. It has also spent significantly on critical state supreme court races across the country.There is a lot of overlap between the Honest Elections Project and the Judicial Crisis Network. Both groups share personnel, including Carrie Severino, the influential president of the Judicial Crisis Network. Both groups have been funded by The Wellspring Committee, a group Leo raised money for until it shut down in 2018. Both have also paid money to BH Group, an LLC Leo once disclosed as his employer, that made a $1m mystery donation to Trump’s inauguration.“This is a small community that is really trying to push forward these more suppressive tactics that will be challenged in court and having those judges on the bench, they’re really hoping it’s going to continue to rig the system in their favor,” said Lena Zwarensteyn, who closely follows judicial nominations at the Leadership Conference. “By changing the rules of the game and who the referees are, they’re trying to change the landscape.”Neither the Honest Elections Project nor the Judicial Crisis Network responded to requests for an interview.The Honest Elections Project has become active as Republicans are scaling up their efforts to fight to keep voting restrictions in place ahead of the election. The Republican National Committee will spend at least $20m on litigation over voting rights and wants to recruit up to 50,000 people to help monitor the polls and other election activities.Gupta said seeing a group that has been extremely successful in pushing judicial confirmations turn its attention to voting rights was alarming."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c04ba12e9eb982bcfd25b22727fa425c3212747/0_142_3400_2040/master/3400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06fedc59e0896a5e77f118ddf8019f4f","title":"new york summer coronavirus covid in pictures","story":"Photographer Jordan Gale was curious to see how New Yorkers would adapt to a post Covid-19 summer.

As part of an effort branded “Operation Warp Speed”, Trump has set a goal of a 300m-dose stockpile by January.Vaccine developers have called that time frame “aspirational”. But polling published on Wednesday indicates that the country could run up against another obstacle in its fight against the virus: vaccine refusal.In previous years, Trump has added his voice to the anti-vaccination movement in the United States, falsely linking vaccines with autism. The movement has contributed to outbreaks of measles in the United States and raised fears about the potential return of eradicated diseases such as smallpox.Early clinical trials from multiple vaccine candidates have been promising. But Dr Anthony Fauci, the country’s top infectious diseases expert and a member of the White House coronavirus taskforce, warned in an interview with CNN on Wednesday that the road to a vaccine could have unforeseen detours.Asked whether a vaccine would be widely available in the United States “before the end of the year,” Fauci said “it is possible.“But when you’re dealing with vaccines, you’ve got to remember that you’re dealing with things that have a lot of vicissitudes,” Fauci said. “There are a lot of landmines and hiccups that occur.Fauci said that scientists were accelerating the vaccine development process “which I must emphasize is not at the expense of safety nor at the expense of scientific integrity.“I still think that we have a good chance, if all the things fall in the right place, that we might have a vaccine that would be deployable by the end of the year, by November-December,” he said.Respondents in the poll told the Associated Press said they were concerned about the vaccine development process being rushed. The record time for developing an entirely new vaccine is at least four years.“I am not an anti-vaxxer,” said Melanie Dries, 56, of Colorado Springs, Colorado. But, “to get a Covid-19 vaccine within a year or two ... causes me to fear that it won’t be widely tested as to side-effects.”Dr Francis Collins, who directs the National Institutes of Health, insisted safety was the top priority. The NIH is creating a master plan for testing the leading Covid-19 vaccine candidates in tens of thousands of people, to prove if they really work and also if they’re safe.“I would not want people to think that we’re cutting corners because that would be a big mistake. I think this is an effort to try to achieve efficiencies, but not to sacrifice rigor,” Collins told the AP earlier this month."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/420aaa76fc161fc83e4296baf329b4ce88086c70/0_24_3200_1919/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2903e3d0a10f0922268fd61963dd8b13","title":"argentina cordons off coronavirus slum ghettoes for poor people","story":"Drastic measures are being taken to contain the coronavirus in the Villa Azul area of Buenos Aires which has emerged as a hotspotSecurity forces in\u0026nbspArgentina\u0026nbsphave cordoned off one of the country’s poorest slums, preventing inhabitants from entering or leaving the neighbourhood after a surge of coronavirus cases.Police officers erected barriers at the entrance to Villa Azul on the outskirts of Buenos Aires on Monday after widespread testing was launched in poorer districts.By Wednesday, 174 of 301 tests carried out in Villa Azul had come back positive, and officials expressed concern that if the 4,000 or so inhabitants of the neighbourhood were allowed to move freely, they could spread the virus to other areas nearby.But the move was criticized by local activists and even members of Argentina’s leftwing government. “It looks like we are creating ghettoes for poor people,” said a junior minister for social development, Daniel Menéndez.Daniel Gollán, health minister of Buenos Aires province, dismissed the charge. “We are working with the neighbourhood organisations, first to cut off the chain of contagion, and second to prevent people from leaving or entering because there is a much larger neighbourhood just next door.”So far, no deaths have been reported in Villa Azul, Gollán said.Intensive testing is also being carried out in Villa Itatí, an equally destitute area nearby, which is home to about 15,000 people.Mayra Mendoza, the mayor of Quilmes, the district including Villa Azul, said: “It’s like a family: if one member tests positive, all the other members become close contacts. That is why we isolated the residents of Villa Azul, considering them close contacts of those who have been infected.”“If this had happened in a gated community, we would have isolated it as well,” the mayor said.As in other slum neighbourhoods or villas, most inhabitants of Villa Azul live in makeshift homes without public services, and the enforced isolation has left the population entirely dependent on deliveries of essential items by the army.Teams of sanitary workers in white full-body protective gear have been going door to door in Villa Azul, testing, and carrying food delivered by army units.Argentina’s villas often suffer from cramped living conditions and a lack of proper sewerage or running water, making it difficult for inhabitants to self-isolate or maintain proper hygiene.“The first thing the pandemic has taught us, is that we live in an unfair country – and no one has the excuse of saying they didn’t know because we’ve all seen it,” said the country’s president, Alberto Fernández, in a speech about the situation in the country’s slums.So far, most of Argentina’s 23 provinces have fared relatively well during the pandemic, reporting low numbers of new cases, thanks to a tough government lockdown implemented early in the pandemic.Argentina has 13,228 confirmed coronavirus cases and 490 deaths so far, with 600 new cases and 19 deaths reported on Tuesday – a sharp rise from early May when the number of daily new cases was in the low hundreds.Security minister Berni said that the coronavirus situation in Buenos Aires slums would only get worse. “This is like the Titanic, we’ve got an iceberg ahead and we can chose to hit it head-on or from the side – but the crash is inevitable.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0b7f146029c297a188dd18c2e2f42961c42de9c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b363260ec1bf8174cd2c9c7b09320d97","title":"call for coronavirus uk race equality strategy","story":"Coalition of BAME activists demands strategy to address health and economic consequences of virusA Covid-19 race equality strategy must be launched across Whitehall in the wake of growing evidence of inequalities amid the pandemic, a coalition of BAME campaigners, peers, academics and religious leaders has said.The disproportionate impact of coronavirus on black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people, who are more likely than the white British population to die from the disease, has highlighted longstanding inequalities in health, incomes, housing and employment.Signatories to Wednesday’s call for action, who include the director of Operation Black Vote (OBV), Simon Woolley, and the mayor of Bristol, Marvin Rees, argue that the crisis must be a watershed moment to fix such inequalities.In an open letter seen by the , they and others – including religious leaders and academics – say: “For many of us there has been much heartache and at times anger in watching this crisis unfold and seeing many brave lives cut short. Furthermore, we are acutely aware of perhaps an even greater impact, socially, educationally and economically, BAME communities could face as we confront an unprecedented economic downturn.“Our demand is for a Covid-19 race equality strategy that will not only deal with the immediacy of saving lives, but also fundamentally rebuild many of our institutions that this disease has exposed as having huge racial disparities.”Black people are more than four times more likely to die of Covid-19 than the white British population, according to analysis by the Office for National Statistics. People of Bangladeshi and Pakistani, Indian, and mixed ethnicities were also found to have raised mortality risk relative to white people.A Public Health England (PHE) review into how different factors – including ethnicity, gender and obesity – can affect people’s health outcomes from coronavirus is due to be published this week. But the signatories to the demand for a race equality strategy say that a wider-ranging review is needed in order to “build something positive and long-lasting from this deadly Covid-19 crisis” amid fears of a deep recession.Lord Woolley, who is chair of the government race disparity unit’s advisory group, said he had had conversations with No 10 about such a review being instigated across Whitehall.“It gives us a unique opportunity to tackle those deep-seated inequalities, which existed even before Covid-19, that could get very much worse, without dramatic action, without radical action,” he said.Woolley expects hundreds if not thousands of people to back the demand, which will be posted on the OBV website. Its signatories also include the writer Afua Hirsch, David Weaver, the president of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, Dr Elizabeth Henry, the head of ersity for the Church of England, and Rabbi Danny Rich, the chief executive of Liberal Judaism.The open letter decries what it says are attempts by some to blame genes, culture andor lifestyle for disparities and to accuse BAME people of victimhood for raising social and economic disadvantages, saying: “We will not be blamed.”It adds: “When we follow those key areas in our society that Covid-19 has exposed for having profound inequalities, such as health, employment, housing, criminal justice and education, we strongly feel that these are the areas we need to drastically put right.“If anything good is to come from this awful disease, it is that we track what’s been exposed and amplified as discriminatory and we fundamentally fix it. That starting point is a Covid-19 race equality strategy, and it is something that we believe will form part of a new social and race equality contract.”A government spokesperson said: “This government is committed to levelling up, unleashing potential and increasing opportunity for all.“We have pledged to improve the quality of data and evidence about the types of barriers faced by people from different backgrounds to help drive effective and lasting change.“The\u0026nbspgovernment’s race disparity unit, which is a world first for publishing data by ethnicity, also publishes data by age, gender and geography wherever possible.\u0026nbspIt continues to work across departments and their agencies to identify and address adverse variances in outcomes where they are found.“We’re also aware that the coronavirus sadly appears to have a disproportionate effect on people from BAME backgrounds.“It is critical we find out which groups are most at risk so we can take the right steps to protect them and minimise their risk.“That’s why we have commissioned PHE to better understand the different factors, such as ethnicity, that may influence the effects of the virus and explore the possible reasons for disparities.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c361cf30b5f1066140c1725ba563431a2074d54/0_408_3060_1837/master/3060.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=362571e87fb334f547d2079aa77ab1d7","title":"can you catch coronavirus twice what we know about covid 19 so far","story":"Your questions answered based on current knowledge and the latest research from scientistsThat remains unclear. A key question is whether antibodies produced by the body following an infection with the coronavirus provide some level of immunity, and if so, for how long.But we do have some clues. “We know from ‘normal’ coronavirus studies done in the past you can infect people after about a year following an initial infection,” said Dr Ben Killingley, consultant in acute medicine and infectious diseases at University College London hospital.Dr Joshua Schiffer, an expert in infectious diseases at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in the US, added that any signs of reinfection would require detailed scrutiny.“It is also important to recognise that documentation of one or a handful of reinfections does not prove that this is a common, epidemiologically important event.” This initially caused concerns, as experts feared the results might suggest patients had been reinfected. However, the World Health Organization has since said the results were actually false positives, a result of the test picking up particles of the virus within dead lung cells – but this is not active virus. That’s because the PCR (or “have-you-got-it”) test is based on detecting genetic material from the virus – on its own it does not reveal whether that virus is active, and infectious, or not.Some people with Covid-19 experience complications following an initial infection.“In some persons they begin to feel well again and signs and symptoms including fever decrease, but some then go on to develop respiratory distress and must be provided oxygen in hospital,” said David Heymann, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “It appears to be a delayed immune response that is more serious in some persons and that reacts to remaining virus in various organs.”Even some people who have had a mild experience of Covid-19 have reported experiencing symptoms for several weeks or even months, although experts say only time and testing will tell what the long-term implications are and how common this is.Killingley said it was unclear what was behind such ongoing symptoms, but there are a range of possibilities – including inflammation caused by the virus – although the mechanisms and risks are, as yet, unclear. Immunology professor Daniel Altmann, of Imperial College London, said such cases are important to study.Schiffer agreed such cases are cause for concern. “In the case of Sars CoV-2, my colleagues and I are particularly worried about the possibility of prolonged periods of lung inflammation andor scarring,” he said.A recent study of 60 coronavirus patients in China showed 10 patients tested positive for Covid-19 after discharge from hospital. However, once again, experts say this could be down to the test picking up genetic material from inactive virus, with other studies, including work in South Korea, suggesting those who test positive with Covid-19 after recovering from the disease are not infectious.“It’s not uncommon to find virus in the nose or throat for up to four weeks after initial infection, but tests to establish whether this is live infectious virus – as opposed to just genetic material detection – are not normally positive for much longer than a week,” said Killingley, adding: “I haven’t come across relapse cases whereby the initial infection acquired weeks ago reignites itself into an infectious case.”Schiffer had doubts: “In my view, the presence of Sars CoV-2 RNA many weeks after initial infection may represent ongoing viral replication in cells, which also implies the persistence of small amounts of “active” virus,” he said. “However, quantities are tiny and may represent the dying embers of infection in the body.”Altmann said that, asymptomatic cases aside, infectiousness correlates strongly with acute symptoms, which typically last for up to 12 days, with a tailout to 28 days. “My sense is that in the people who are feeling unwell long after this, it may not be virus, but some kind of immune or inflammatory perturbation,” he said.Due to the unprecedented and ongoing nature of the coronavirus outbreak, this article is being regularly updated to ensure that it reflects the current situation at the date of publication.

She sees things from the “customer experience” and is passionate about getting it right, one source said.She is one of the most high-profile women involved in the coronavirus response, and it is likely the health secretary, Matt Hancock, will look to her to provide the details and direction of the scheme, which has endured a bumpy journey so far.Hancock faced weeks of criticism for the government’s decision to abandon initial contact tracing efforts on 12 March.Harding confidently presented the rules and “new principles”, as Hancock described it, in her first appearance at the Downing Street press conference, drawing a line under past efforts.Such was her confidence in the new strategy – which involves 25,000 contact tracers – she said: “If anything I’m worried that many of my brilliant contact tracers are not going to be very busy as we start to encourage more people to get a test.” She said there were “easily enough to trace down the contacts today when the vast majority of us are in lockdown”. The Isle of Wight contact, track and trace app trial provides a major challenge. Beset by delays, a version of the app has yet to be rolled out nationwide.Harding was made a peer in 2014 by David Cameron. Just a year later she was at the eye of the storm in the TalkTalk hacking scandal in which the details of 156,959 customers – including names, emails and phone numbers – and 15,000 bank account numbers were accessed by hackers with the company receiving a record £400,000 fine from the information commissioner.About 18 months later she resigned saying she wanted to focus on “more activities in public service”.She is married to John Penrose, a Tory MP and former minister, and has previously worked in management for Sainsbury’s and Tesco.

But the development of the NHS tracing system has been characterised by missteps, conflict and frustration behind the scenes.At the heart of the difficulties have been tensions between central government and local public health officials, or as one insider complained: “There has been control freakery from start to finish by the NHS and the Department of Health.”Public health officials say systems and protocols to manage so-called “complex cases” involving central and local cooperation, such as the outbreak in Weston-super-Mare, have not yet been fully worked out days before schools start reopening on 1 June.“I think councils will be told who will need extra help because they are vulnerable in a shielded category, and that’s about it,” the official added, saying there had been difficult meetings between officials from both sides.Contact tracing is one of the most basic planks of public health responses to a pandemic\u0026nbsplike the coronavirus. It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. It was – and always will be – central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 2014-15, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street.It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure – originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So a contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine.Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany. All those countries have had relatively low death rates so far. The\u0026nbspWorld Health Organization\u0026nbspsays it should be the “backbone of the response” in every country.Tensions came to the fore after it became clear that a mobile phone app trumpeted by the health secretary, Matt Hancock, as being ready to launch nationally “mid May” was beset with technical difficulties. There is now no set date for its launch.That switched attention to what was intended to be a supplementary system of national call centres, where 25,000 people, including more than 6,000 clinicians, had been hastily recruited to interview people testing positive for coronavirus and ask who they had been in contact with.Public health experts believed they had the expertise that people who had been trained with the help of a script did not have. But they claim that for weeks during March and April they were sidelined and only became actively involved in May after “a massive campaign behind the scenes” to get them on board.Working within local councils, contact tracers have been employed for decades, tackling infections such as tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases. It is an interview-based process that requires experience and tact to obtain sometimes sensitive information from sick iniduals, and employs dozens of people in large councils scattered across environmental and sexual health teams, although the services have been hit hard by spending cuts.Meanwhile, some of those hired for the national contact tracing centres have had relatively cursory training. One told the  that the guidance on doing the job simply consisted of watching videos and reading scripts. “I have not been given any details of who to call if I have problems. Only an email address has been provided which largely goes unanswered.”Others warned that they had little experience of using computer systems intended to help them talk through cases. Another worker talked of being “thrown in the deep end”. He added: “The online system is really complicated and I want just a couple of days once it goes live to navigate it.”Last week, Rupert Soames, chief executive of Serco and brother of the former Conservative MP Sir Nicholas Soames, posted a video message saying the recruitment process was “an unprecedented achievement”. But he also conceded there had been problems with the training process. “Inevitably, I am afraid, we will have made some mistakes along the way and if it has all felt a bit clunky and rushed, I apologise.”Insiders have been reluctant to go public because they want the tracing system to succeed but some have told the  they would have liked more time and that a three-month joint effort, including local public health experts from the start, could have created a comprehensive system for England.On Tuesday a letter from Public Health England to councils’ directors of public health asked for information on the “current resources” devoted to managing the more serious outbreaks, an audit that could have happened weeks ago.Once it became clear the system would be entirely reliant on patient interviews at launch because the app was not ready, ministers were keen to link up with local authorities.Last Friday it was announced there would be a new £300m fund for local authorities in England to support test-and-trace services, with a promise that data on the spread of the coronavirus would be shared with local authorities.Dido Harding, chair of the NHS Test and Trace service, said that the role of public health officials was hugely important in tackling a game of virus “whackamole”. The Conservative peer added: “Where we see an outbreak, or the signs of an outbreak, the best way that we contain it will be through local, public health professionals, and local authority leaders, going in and understanding what’s really happening.”Sally Brinton, the Liberal Democrats’ health spokeswoman in the Lords, said it was “a relief” to hear that Public Health England was now working with local directors of public health. “However, it is also worrying that this has only happened in the last few days,” she added.With just hours until the launch of the NHS Test and Trace service, on Thursday,\u0026nbspeveryone involved is keen to make the coronavirus tracing system for England work, although the exercise has laid bare long-established tensions between central and local government.“This has been an exercise in people above my position telling me they know better and in almost every circumstance they turned out not to,” said one senior public health official. “That’s what this whole pandemic has been like – and I won’t forget that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b45822fcda061755581db97cecf10f9d9d200675/0_302_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=2234f34841880a2f096b52fedd4559f7","title":"government unveils covid 19 test and trace strategy for england","story":"Government will enforce compliance if advice to stay at home for 14 days fails, says health secretaryMatt Hancock exhorted the public to do their “civic duty” and stay at home when instructed, as he launched a new test and trace system in the face of warnings from council leaders that they lack the data or powers to make local lockdowns work.Employing Churchillian language, the health secretary called on every inidual to do their bit, and warned that if they failed, the government would enforce compliance.“It is your civic duty,” said Hancock. “This will be voluntary at first because we trust everyone to do the right thing, but we can quickly make it mandatory if that’s what it takes.“Do it for the people you love. Do it for the community. Do it for the NHS and do it for all the frontline workers who have done so much and gone out every day to put themselves at risk to keep you and your family safe.”He added: “And in return for following those instructions, you’ll have the knowledge that when the call came you did your bit, at a time when it really mattered.”Starting at 9am on Thursday, the test and trace system for England is intended to allow the nationwide lockdown to be replaced with more limited, local measures, where the disease flares up again.Testing is being extended to everyone with coronavirus symptoms, including under-5s, with primary schools and nurseries set to reopen to some children next week.Those testing positive will be contacted by one of 25,000 call handlers and asked to share names and phone numbers of family, friends and colleagues whom they have been within 2 metres of for more than 15 minutes within the previous two days.They will then call those people and instruct them to self-isolate for 14 days, and keep any children out of school. The instruction will stand even if they have previously self-isolated, or had a positive antibody test.It is launching without a much-anticipated app to automate the process. It is still being trialled on the Isle of Wight.Baroness Dido Harding, chair of the track and trace program, said: “A lot of this really is going to be about local coordinated action, from public health authorities, local government, the NHS, other civic leaders, to hunt out areas where the infection is spreading.”But senior local government figures briefed by ministers about the scheme expressed concerns. The council leader of Newcastle, Nick Forbes, said local authorities do not have the power to close schools or workplaces where a cluster of cases develops.“It’s all very well saying if there’s an outbreak in a school we’ll close it down – but councils don’t have the power to do that at the moment. And if there was an outbreak in a business, we could ask the business, we could ask the employees to be responsible – but we couldn’t tell them to,” he said.The revelation that the prime minister’s chief adviser took a cross-country journey could dent the public’s willingness to comply, Forbes suggested.“Whilst the vast majority of people would be sensible, clearly the issue with Dominic Cummings has fired an anger in people that is going to be hard to manage. Asking people to self-isolate for 14 days is a huge ask.”Brenda Warrington, executive leader of Tameside council, said: “I think there are more questions than anywhere near the answers at the moment.”The mayor of Hackney, Phil Glanville, welcomed the increased involvement of local government in the test and trace scheme, which was initially planned to be centrally-run. But he cited a lack of information on positive test results locally. “We still, as a local authority public health function, don’t get that data on who is and isn’t testing positive,” he said.The shadow communities secretary, Steve Reed, said: “The success of the test, trace and isolate programme will be critical if we are to ease lockdown restrictions safely. That’s why it’s so worrying that government seems not to have learned the lessons of its mishandling of PPE distribution and the roll-out of testing it has been too slow to engage councils with the knowledge and expertise to deliver the programme quickly enough.”Some scientists are concerned about compliance, if people asked to stay at home will lose out financially.Prof Simon Wessely, a psychiatrist with a role in epidemic preparedness, said:\u0026nbsp“Those most likely to get infected and their contacts are more likely to be the delivery drivers, transport workers, care home workers, shop assistants, the self-employed and so on.\u0026nbspSo at the point of notification there needs to be provision to support those in need – financially, medically and even accommodation if necessary.“NHS test and trace is a service designed to enable the vast majority of us to get on with our lives in a much more normal way,” said Harding. “Instead of 60 million in inidual lockdown, a much smaller number of people will be told to stay at home if they are ill or in close contact with someone who is.”Harding said people told by the NHS to self-isolate would be eligible for statutory sick pay and, if they were self-employed, they could get a government grant. An extra £300m had been allocated to higher-tier local authorities to help them assist people.R, or the \u0027effective reproduction number\u0027, is a way of rating a disease’s ability to spread. It’s the average number of people on to whom one infected person will pass the virus. For an R of anything above 1, an epidemic will grow exponentially. Anything below 1 and an outbreak will fizzle out – eventually.At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the estimated R for coronavirus was between 2 and 3 – higher than the value for seasonal flu, but lower than for measles. That means each person would pass it on to between two and three people on average, before either recovering or dying, and each of those people would pass it on to a further two to three others, causing the total number of cases to snowball over time.The reproduction number is not fixed, though. It depends on the biology of the virus people\u0027s behaviour, such as social distancing\u0026nbspand a population’s immunity. A country may see regional variations in its R number, depending on local factors like population density and transport patterns.The time from testing to getting results to speaking to the contacts must come down from five to three days, says the data evaluation and learning for viral epidemics (Delve) group."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aedd521b50594fbc165127074bae799f8d922c54/0_285_4728_2836/master/4728.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd20fb6546b0afd25b9eaf8f77d81203","title":"isle of man accused authoritarian lockdown measures","story":"Residents, including children, locked up in allegedly ‘inhuman’ conditions for rule breachesThe Isle of Man’s approach to enforcing a coronavirus lockdown has been branded “authoritarian” after residents, including children, who breached the rules were locked up in allegedly “inhuman” conditions without showers or exercise.Juveniles are among those who have been jailed for breaches of the prohibition on movement regulations on the island, such as leaving home more than once for exercise, having dinner in another household, and drinking on a beach.The island’s government strenuously denied allegations of breaches of human rights, saying its actions had been proportionate and necessary, aimed at keeping people safe in response to the unprecedented global health crisis. Children are not detained with adults.There have been 24 deaths linked to Covid-19 on the Isle of Man and 336 confirmed cases. The island has a population of about 85,000.More than 700 people have been warned for breaching the regulations, of whom 78 were arrested, including nine children. In total, 26 offenders have been jailed for breaching the emergency powers, although 11 of them also faced other charges. All those arrested had received earlier warnings.The Isle of Man said levels of enforcement were consistent with the rest of the UK. However, a key difference in the approach is that in the first five weeks of the crisis, fixed penalty notices were not available to the police force.Ian Kermode, a criminal barrister on the island, labelled the approach “authoritarian”.“The real trouble started on the 31 March with the prohibition on movement regulations,” he said.“The Isle of Man mirrored the rules in England save for one very important part, which was fixed penalty notices, the mechanism for enforcing those regulations in England, was omitted and replaced with either a fine of £10,000 or three months in jail.”As a consequence, the police were “arresting people right, left and centre”, Kermode said. The typical sentence handed down is about 28 days.Among those held were a 14-year-old boy, an 18-year-old boy and a 15-year-old girl, Kermode said.Other examples include: a 27-year-old man sentenced to 35 days in jail for being absent from home, and a 42-year-old woman sentenced to 35 days in jail for being absent from home a 31-year-old man jailed for five weeks for instigating a gathering and a 35-year-old man, who had received a previous warning, was jailed for 30 days for drinking at a friend’s house.The lawyer said he was shocked when he discovered the conditions some of his clients were facing in prison.The prison introduced a 14-day self-isolation regime for all new arrivals. Due to automatic release at the midway point of the sentence, most of the people jailed for lockdown breaches were spending the whole sentence in isolation.The isolation regime meant some inmates faced 14 days without showers or exercise. The only time the cell door was opened was to deliver 24 hours’ worth of meals.“The prison population averages between 80 and 90 – all of a sudden they were faced with a sudden influx of 20 and 30 prisoners in little over a month,” Kermode said. “The very time when prisons around the world were releasing prisoners to reduce prison crowding, the IoM prison was suddenly faced with 20 to 30 prisoners.”Kermode said there was potential for those imprisoned to bring cases in the higher Manx courts and even the European court of human rights, as he alleges there may have been breaches of article three of the European convention on human rights, which prohibits inhuman or degrading treatment.Since complaints have been raised, procedures at the jail have been altered and the island’s government eventually introduced fixed penalty notices. However, Kermode says they have not been well used.The government said it refuted allegations that prisoners received “inhuman or degrading” treatment, adding prisoners were given in-cell exercise regimes and access to in-cell sanitation facilities.\u0026nbsp“While this regime affected a small cohort of prisoners, the remaining wings in the prison operated on a less rigorous regime, designed to mitigate transmission of coronavirus, but still retained access to exercise, showers and legal advice,” it said.“The government strenuously refutes any allegations of breaches of human rights.”The Isle of Man prison has a capacity of 144. In England and Wales, the government has reduced the headcount in prisons by about 3,000 as it attempts to prevent the spread of Covid-19 behind bars. Other nations have released prisoners early to ease the burden.Phil Matthews, the chair of Amnesty International Isle of Man, said: “These are exceptional circumstances, but we know that emergency powers can sometimes be misused, and this must not give a green light to trample on our basic human rights and liberties.“The reports are incredibly concerning and could suggest a heavy-handed application of the emergency powers. These allegations should be investigated as a matter of urgency.”Allan Hogarth, Amnesty International UK’s head of advocacy and programmes, added: “The unjustified detention of anyone in the midst of a global pandemic is cruel and gravely irresponsible. Alternatives to detention should be considered for anyone who does not pose a threat to themselves or society.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5a11d36f02af2f66a5f1eb9f5bce99320e72f80/0_105_2300_1381/master/2300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc98918ab2a4b498ea6c1d93fa9210ad","title":"venezuela us funded rock bands hugo chavez","story":"Partially redacted grant application shows scheme involved paying 10 groups to write songs promoting ‘freedom of expression’The United States funded rock groups in Venezuela to record songs promoting democracy – and undermine the rule of Hugo Chávez – according to documents released after a Freedom of Information Act request.More than 10 bands were contracted in 2011 to produce new songs promoting freedom of expression in the oil-rich nation. The $22,970 scheme, which was to culminate in a battle-of-the-bands style concert, was approved by the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), a non-governmental agency responsible for promoting democracy abroad.The partially redacted grant application was uncovered by Tim Gill, a sociologist at the University of North Carolina Wilmington, and shows the efforts of US officials “to promote greater reflection among Venezuelan youth about freedom of expression, their connection with democracy, and the state of democracy in the country”.Gill said the revelations were unorthodox but unsurprising. “The NED supported many causes in order to promote democracy, not all of them nefarious,” the academic said. “But the issue is that it has the ability to fund some voices instead of others.”Successive US governments sought to unseat Chávez, whose self-styled Bolivarian revolution was in part built on anti-American sentiment. The populist leader was briefly unseated in 2002 by a military coup. It later emerged that the administration of George W Bush had known about the coup beforehand, although Washington distanced itself publicly from involvement.\u0026nbspBy 2011, US officials were apparently exploring less dramatic measures to undermine his leadership.“I can’t imagine they thought this alone was going to bring down the government,” Gill said. “But is music important and does it shape people’s views? I could draw a straight line from listening to punk rock to reading Noam Chomsky and learning about stuff about revolutions and interventions that they don’t teach in schools.”It is not the only time the US has attempted to spark unrest through music in adversarial Latin American countries. In 2014, it was revealed that USAid, the American development aid organisation, had been\u0026nbspsecretly attempting to infiltrate\u0026nbspCuba’s underground hip-hop scene.\u0026nbspNeither plot appears to have yielded many tangible results. Nor was it clear why the Venezuela plan focused on rock music in a country whose airwaves are dominated by salsa, merengue and reggaeton.Chávez died of cancer in 2013, bequeathing a collapsing economy to Nicolás Maduro, his successor. And attempts to oust Venezuela’s leader have continued apace.A 2019 plot to trigger a military uprising in support of the opposition leader Juan Guaidó fizzled out within hours, and earlier this month, American mercenaries led a botched raid to capture Maduro.The latest plan quickly fell apart with two Americans captured, allowing Maduro to appear triumphant on state TV."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e72838cd60823e44b6d828e4f0410c293cdd42b4/0_135_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fed2d3abfa54b5b5c1e7014620d87794","title":"working mothers interrupted more often than fathers in lockdown study","story":"Mothers more likely to have lost jobs and are doing more childcare and houseworkWorking mothers have been able to do only one hour of uninterrupted paid work for every three hours done by men during lockdown, according to a study that exposes the work imbalance between men and women.\u0026nbspA report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the UCL institute of education also says mothers in England are more likely than fathers to have lost their jobs during lockdown, increasing fears that the coronavirus crisis has exacerbated inequality and could lead to the gender pay gap increasing.The Office for National Statistics said separately that men were doing more than an hour less unpaid labour than women each day, despite increasing their responsibilities during lockdown.The IFS-UCL study interviewed 3,500 families of two opposite-gender parents and found that mothers were doing more childcare and more housework than fathers.The mothers interviewed were looking after children for an average of 10.3 hours a day – 2.3 hours more than fathers – and doing housework for 1.7 more hours than fathers.In families where the father had stopped work while his partner continued, on average they did the same amount of household work – while the woman did an average of five hours of paid work a day.“Mothers are more likely than fathers to have moved out of paid work since the start of lockdown,” she said. “They have reduced their working hours more than fathers even if they are still working, and they experience more interruptions while they work from home than fathers, particularly due to caring for children. A risk is that the lockdown leads to a further increase in the gender wage gap.”Fathers have increased the time they spend on housework and childcare, doing nearly twice as many hours as they did in 2014-15. “This may bring about changes in the attitudes of fathers, mothers, children and employers about the role of fathers in meeting family needs for childcare and domestic work during the working week,” said Sonya Krutikova, a deputy research director at the IFS.Sam Smethers, the chief executive of the Fawcett Society, said the data confirmed fears that the “motherhood penalty” had been multiplied by the effects of the lockdown. “This will reverse decades of progress on women’s participation in the labour market unless the government intervenes to address it,” she said. “What this study shows is that we are going backwards, and that is extremely worrying.”She said there was a “real prospect of two-tier workplaces” as the lockdown was eased with men getting back into work and women left at home caring for children, without nursery places or schools fully open for months.“Government must now prioritise strategic investment to create a childcare infrastructure, reform parental leave to equalise parenting in a child’s first year, and normalise flexible and remote working in the post-Covid economy,” she said. “And they could also relieve the financial pressure on parents by increasing child benefit.”The ONS’s Time Use survey compared data recorded between 28 March and 26 April with figures from the previous study between April 2014 and December 2015.Men increased their unpaid labour – such as caring for children or adults, housework and volunteering – by 22 minutes, to two hours and 25 minutes a day. Women’s burden was reduced by 20 minutes a day, to three hours and 32 minutes, meaning they were still giving an hour and seven minutes more of their time than men. Before the lockdown the gap in unpaid work between men and women was an hour and 50 minutes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46344ca16fab9e20d29c30200d34ac3464a51b91/0_124_1007_604/master/1007.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=1d9549d96cd735143a870a8c8393c95f","title":"coronavirus glance","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:The confirmed number of fatalities from Covid-19 around the world now stands at 354,944, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The number of confirmed cases is 5,682,389.The figures, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to represent a significant underestimate of the true scale of the pandemic due to differing testing and recording regimes, as well as suspected undercounting.According to figures from Johns Hopkins University, the US death toll as a result of Covid-19 was 100,047.Donald Trump, the US president, had said earlier this month that such an outcome would be horrible, but with yet a considerable amount of extra deaths likely to occur the final toll could well in excess of this grim milestone.Boris Johnson, the UK’s prime minister, remained under pressure from his own party to sack Dominic Cummings as more Conservative MPs and senior figures in the party called for the controversial adviser’s head.At least 61 MPs out of 365 have either called for him to resign or be sacked, or have expressed anger at his actions. Penny Mordaunt, a current minister, said in a letter to a constituent that there were “inconsistencies” in Cummings’ account and apologised for how recent days have “undermined key public health messages”.The lead presenter of the BBC’s late-night news show Newsnight, Emily Maitlis, was dropped from fronting the show on Wednesday night having delivered an address to viewers the previous evening that was seen to attack the government’s handling of Dominic Cummings’ lockdown trip to Durham.The show’s editor, Esme Wren, denied that Maitlis had been replaced by Katie Razzall as hundreds of users of Twitter criticised the corporation.Security forces in Buenos Aires cordoned off one of the city’s largest and poorest slums, stopping inhabitants from entering or leaving Villa Azul, on the outskirts of the Argentinian capital, after a surge of Covid-19 cases.Police officers erected barriers on Monday after widespread testing was launched in Villa Azul.

Photograph: PA Photo. At a meeting of the Dáil’s special Covid-19 committee on Tuesday, TDs heard that while the coronavirus pandemic took hold across Irish society, nursing homes were left without a timely plan.Key State organisations left the sector “isolated”, the committee heard. The head of Nursing Homes Ireland (NHI) Tadhg Daly said he was left “exasperated by the lack of engagement”.Documentation running to hundreds of pages now paints a picture of a sector struggling to be heard behind the scenes.A timeline of unfolding events suggests that it took more than a month for a specific plan to be put in place by which stage there were 22 outbreaks in nursing homes.February 28thNHI head Tadhg Daly writes to senior officials in the Department of Health seeking “urgent” guidance for the sector after the first confirmed case of coronavirus on the island of Ireland.On February 27th, a HSE briefing heard that there is an “adequate stock” of personal protective equipment. In his letter to officials, Mr Daly says he notes the statement from the HSE but he says “this is not the case for our member homes”.March 4thDaly again writes to senior officials in the Department of Health and asks for an “express commitment” that the needs of the private and voluntary nursing home sector are addressed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). The department says the sector will be “encompassed” within the scope of the work of a team assessing the needs of vulnerable people. A Dáil debate on the Covid-19 crisis is held the next day, there are only two specific references to nursing homes.March 6thDaly tells the HSE about “increasing queries from members” about “safe and appropriate discharges from acute hospitals to nursing homes”. He says there is an “immediate requirement on the HSE to outline the procedures for discharge”. He says that communication is important or “this may get out of control”. That day, visiting restrictions are introduced in more than 400 private and voluntary nursing homes across the country. A meeting of NPHET is held the next day. Nursing homes are not discussed.March 9thDaly writes to the secretary general of the Department of Health Jim Breslin and Minister for Health Simon Harris raising concerns that workers from the nursing homes sector are being recruited to tackle Covid-19 elsewhere in the health service. This would be at the “severe detriment” of people in the nursing home sector and could “endanger older people”. On the same day, Daly again asks the department for guidance on admissions from hospitals.March 10thGuidance on the transfer of patients between healthcare facilities is issued but by March 12th, NHI calls for more stringent measures, clarity around PPE and raises concerns about contingency arrangements should staff become ill. Daly says that there is “no specific practical guidance” for nursing homes on places such as the HSPC website. Publicly, chief medical officer Tony Holohan says restrictions on nursing home visits are not yet necessary. This is reiterated at a meeting of the NPHET on March 10th where “it was agreed that the current practice of restricting visitors to nursing homes was not required and this would be kept under review”.March 12thAfter an announcement that schools and colleges will close, Daly seeks clarity from the department about how nursing homes will maintain staffing levels. The NPHET meets again but there is no mention of nursing homes, staffing or visiting restrictions.March 13thIn a letter to Kathleen McLellan, the chair of the vulnerable person’s sub-group on NPHET, Daly says the recently issued HSE guidance contains “no practical guidance to nursing homes on how to reduce the risk of transmission” and says “no information” has been provided in relation to personal protective equipment.“We are receiving constant queries from nursing homes with regard to how they can access such equipment and no assurance is coming from our health services in this regard.” He requests “immediate engagement”. He is told by McLellan that “work is going” on guidance. Pharmacists are told on this day that they will be given PPE but that stock is “limited”.March 15thNHI reports to health officials that its members still cannot get access to PPE. Pubs are closed on this day. At a meeting the next day, the NPHET talks about the need for social distancing in playgrounds and hairdressers. Concerns about nursing homes and personal protective equipment are not discussed.March 17thDaly writes to Harris with a plea for the Minister to desist from “targeting the recruitment of staff from the private and voluntary nursing home sector”.March 18thWhile Daly praises the “round the clock” engagement, he says there are “pressing issues”. He says there are now confirmed cases of Covid-19 among nursing home residents and yet the provision of PPE is “challenging to say the least”.Delays in testing also have “cataclysmic consequences”. He requests a urgent meeting with the department and the next day also requests an urgent meeting in a email to the Minister for Health. On this day, Harris tells the public that while some countries choose not to prioritise testing, Ireland will “test, test, test”. He says “older people should not be worried – it is an uncertain time, but we are going to mind you”.March 24thNHI makes a submission on funding needed for the sector and again requests a meeting with Harris. Two days later in the Dáil, Labour’s Duncan Smith says he has heard of frontline nursing staff having to wash PPE in sinks and baths for reuse. The NPHET meets on March 24th and agrees sweeping new restrictions across society. Nursing homes are not discussed.March 30thA meeting is held between the nursing home representatives and Harris on March 30th. The next day the NPHET meets and agrees “that the growing number of clusters of Covid-19 infections in nursing homes and residential healthcare settings... requires an immediate and targeted focus”. On this day, it emerges that a total of 22 outbreaks of coronavirus have been reported in nursing homes across the State.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Research Lives: Prof Molly Byrne, director of the Health Behaviour Change Research Group NUIG School of PsychologyAt beef and dairy farm level there is growing emphasis on practicalities over carbon efficiencySeveral lifetimes\u0026rsquo work at threat as Circus Gerbola faces insurance hikes and reduced capacityTimeline suggests it took over a month before there were measures in place for sectorPublic urged to \u0026lsquohold firm\u0026rsquo until June 8th when second phase of reopening kicks inOf the 10 settings which saw the highest number of deaths, only one is a HSE-run facilityPeople arriving must say where they will stay or face a \u0026euro2,500 fine and six months in prisonRevenue responds amid claims those in receipt of subsidy may face surprise billHSE statistics offer insight into 1,030 deaths across 167 residential facilitiesGreen Party set to agree budget deficit reduction in second half of next government termDepartment of Health study shows over 70s in care more prone to getting disease than peers in general populationMary Lou relishes the \u0026lsquobenefit of great ventilation for all the hot air\u0026rsquo in the chamberCraft was to be the first private enterprise vehicle in history to take humans into spaceCancelled fundraising events and economic downturn is affecting public contributionsCabinet has \u0026lsquocasually delegated too much responsibility\u0026rsquo to public health, D\u0026aacuteil hearsTaoiseach suggests the Covid-19 committee could examine the 2-metre issueMinister tells D\u0026aacuteil councils are expected to be repaid early in JuneHollywood actor and his family have spent lockdown in Dalkey in south DublinRate at which Covid-19 is transmitted is now stable at between 0.4 and 0.5 - MinisterStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4264069.1590598034!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"bake off matt damon bids farewell to bakery as he prepares to leave ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDalkey’s Country Bake store  posted a photo of Matt Damon on Facebook with the message “Our last visit from Matt and his family for a while.

Dalkey’s Country Bake store, where Damon had become a regular customer, posted on Wednesday that the American actor and his family had stopped by for their final visit before leaving Ireland. The Dublin bakery posted a photo of Damon on Facebook with the message “Our last visit from Matt and his family for a while. Safe travels!

Damon was in Ireland shooting scenes for an upcoming movie´, The Last Duel, directed by Ridley Scott, when the country went into lockdown in mid-March. Instead of catching a flight back to the US, Damon chose to settle into the Dalkey community – where he and his family are reportedly renting the Formula 1 driver Eddie Irvine’s former bachelor pad – and wait out the pandemic on Irish soil. The actor’s stay in Dublin, and subsequent photo which showed Damon wearing a baseball hat and holding a SuperValu bag, prompted an article by the New Times about the local reaction to the A-lister’s presence in the affluent Dublin seaside suburb.

It is likely to be his only one because the following day’s schedule has been cleared for a six hour mega-romp with Paschal Donohoe through the revised Social Protection estimates.After the usual formalities, the Ceann Comhairle, who has a nice sense of humour, will commence proceedings.In an ideal world, here’s the way it should happen:“I call the Taoiseach. Taoiseach?”And Leo will rise to his feet.A perplexed looking Seán Ó Fearghaíl will raise his voice.“I call the Taoiseach?”Leo will cough discretely into his elbow to announce his presence and the Ceann Comhairle will respond.“If it isn’t yourself, Taoiseach, sure I didn’t recognise you with your clothes on. Get it all off your chest now.”But this is no laughing matter.The switchboard in Government Buildings must have been jammed with people ringing up to complain about those photographs of Leo Varadkar and his partner brazenly showing off their Phoenix Park pecs at the weekend.When The  contacted the Taoiseach’s office on Tuesday afternoon a spokesman stated the incident “hasn’t been an issue” as far as complaints are concerned, which is a matter for concern. It seems people are so shocked and livid they haven’t even been unable to ring Joe Duffy.The snaps surfaced on social media on Monday and since then we have been doing all we can to link the Taoiseach’s relatively harmless interpretation of Ireland’s lockdown rules to the seriously shabby case of Dominic (Drive Back and Lie for England) Cummings and his boss Boris (Lockdown and Lie for England) and their blithe disregard for them.The two episodes are not remotely the same.For starters, the Taoiseach may be\u0026nbsp bare-chested but he’s in charge whereas the British prime minister is a titular head. Leo likes to remove his shirt. Boris is a martyr to his trousers.Cummings, the PM’s Special Advisor who transgressed the stringent lockdown rules he promoted, is the one in charge and he keeps his clothes on.One man flaunted.The other flouted.Leo had a picnic in the park with his partner and two friends on a hot summer’s afternoon on his day off. He took off his top and had a lie down on the grass. This was not in keeping with the stern advice issued days earlier by a Government spokeswoman recommending that people could take the air and meet in groups of four if observing social distance rules , but not linger together for picnics or that sort of thing.The Taoiseach followed the rules, almost to the letter. The picnic was questionable. It was a very public display. There was a blanket on the ground and a wicker basket. One newspaper reported that the Taoiseach held a cup in his hand. Others said he was holding a can. Perhaps there was a bag of cans in the wicker basket.He will have been well aware of curious eyes all around, watching him. Many people were similarly sunbathing, camera phones in reach. He knew somebody would take a photo of him and knew there was every chance that some of them would end up on the web.But Leo also knew that, apart from that wicker basket, he was not breaking the restrictions. He enjoying himself within the distancing requirements and showing off too. Taoiseach Leo - Little Lord Flauntleroy. Because he can.Dominic Cummings did not have a picnic in the park but he had a walk in the park, although not in the true sense of a walk because while he was putting one foot in front of the other, he wasn’t technically walking because that would have been breaking the rules.He did scarper 260 miles from his home in London with his wife and young child - both adults possibly infected with Covid-19 - driving to his parent’s farm in a lovely picturesque part of England as colleagues in Downing Street were keeling over with the virus.But he has argued that was allowed legitimately because he was acting in the interests of his child, even though that clause was expressly brought in by his government to help parents escape with their children from domestic violence situations.Cummings was spotted making little excursions in his coach and four while in Durham, including tootling like Mr Magoo to a distant beauty spot because he says he needed to gauge if his dodgy eyesight would allow him to convey his family back to London. (His wife can also drive a car which would have obviated the need for her hubby, and on her birthday as well, to possibly blunder dangerously along the public road to a popular tourist destination in the midst of a pandemic.)He flouted the rules.Then the titular PM flaunted his flouting of the rules. Crazy stuff.Nothing like that here. We’re only in the ha’penny place compared to what’s happening across the water and that’s a relief.In the meantime, the official Cabinet Handbook is being urgently reprinted to emphasise that ministers may only be shirtless for New Year, Christmas and Think-In swims.A topless Taoiseach and a provocative picnic.Will the Dáil let him away with it or will they want to discuss Leo’s al fresco fiasco when the House reconvenes?Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4260132.1590148862!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"encouraging health behaviours to tackle the pandemic","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tProf Molly Byrne: ‘People need three things to make any behaviour change – capability, opportunity and motivation’Your research is on changing health behaviour – a particularly a hot topic due to Covid-19. What is your work about?All of my research is about developing behavioural science and applying that to improve health outcomes. We want to encourage behaviours that can help to prevent disease or manage it.How do you motivate people to change their health behaviours?We know people need three things to make any behaviour change – capability, opportunity and motivation. So to take self-isolation in the pandemic as an example, you have to think about whether and how people can do that. Do they have the knowledge to identify symptoms and know when they should self-isolate? Can they stay home from work, and can they practically stay away from other people in their house? You also need to think about how to motivate them, in this case with the message that by staying socially distanced and also isolating if they have symptoms, they are protecting themselves and others and supporting frontline healthcare workers.What was keeping you busy before the pandemic?I am working on a number of projects focusing on prevention and managing chronic disease. For example, one ongoing project I’m working on with my colleague Prof Sean Dinneen in Galway is the D1 Now study. It looks at how we can keep young people with diabetes engaged with their care and clinics as they transition from child to adult health services. We have a wonderful panel of young people with diabetes who are part of the research team. They help us to design interventions suited to their age group, like sending information over social media rather than letters through the post. That kind of insight is critical, otherwise what we do won’t reach the people who need it.How has Covid-19 affected your research?Because health services and healthcare delivery has been turned upside down by this pandemic, we are adapting and moving a lot of our interventions and research online. We are also working directly on health behaviours relating to Covid-19. One project is iCARE, a survey gathering information from around the world about people’s attitudes and behaviours during the pandemic. I’m also working with my colleague Dr Gerry Molloy in Galway on the challenges and beliefs around social distancing, and how we can communicate messages to the public to ensure that everyone adheres to social distancing recommendations.But how can you ensure the research evidence informs behaviours in the pandemic?I am part of the behaviour change sub-group that advises the National Public Health Emergency Team. We look at evidence from behavioural science and advise on how NPHET should communicate its guidelines for Covid-19, so this is a way that findings from research can quickly have an impact on public health. This is obviously a developing situation, so we meet weekly to discuss our research priorities, and we take into account the different phases and the nuances of more complicated messages about behaviour as the restrictions ease.What keeps you going as a researcher?I really love research. I learn new things every day, and I do it in the hope that it will improve health outcomes.And finally, how do you take a break?I’ve always been disciplined about taking breaks. I don’t work in the evenings or over weekends, and I encourage others in my research group to do the same. It makes me more efficient in work, and then in my “time off” I am busy with family, choir and enjoying the magnificence of sea and culture that Galway has to offer.”More about the iCARE study and how to take part in its surveys can be found here."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Thousands take to streets to oppose Beijing-backed laws curtailing city\u0026rsquos freedomsMove to impose security law illustrates Beijing\u0026rsquos increasing tendency to flex its muscleProtesters get ready for more demonstrations against proposed Beijing lawsCommissioner in territory says contentious new security law aimed at \u0026lsquotroublemakers\u0026rsquoPM has made most of her communication skills and the country\u0026rsquos political cultureCian English (19), from Carlow, died following fall from Gold Coast apartmentChina proposes path to imposing rules used against dissidents on the mainlandPolice fire tear gas in popular shopping district as protesters take to the streets\u0026lsquoThere is a political virus spreading in United States,\u0026rsquo says China\u0026rsquos foreign ministerWinds gusting up to 210kmh expected near iron ore producing heartland of the PilbaraInvestigation begins into cause of Pakistan International Airlines crash that killed 97Officials confirm two survivors after PIA aircraft crashes in residential area of KarachiOutrage among pro-democracy legislators at security law put forward at National People\u0026rsquos CongressRescue teams hampered by torn-down power lines and flooding over large tracts of landPro-Beijing politicians are pushing contentious laws in the face of intense oppositionCyclone Amphan moving inland with gusts of up to 185kmh, says India met serviceSuper cyclone Amphan, with winds up to 160kmh, expected to hit India\u0026rsquos coast on WednesdayRules to be relaxed in areas with low numbers of infection, according to governmentIf Travis McCready\u0026rsquos US event goes ahead, it will look very different from typical rock gigsCity looks asymptomatic carriers after confirming first Covid cluster last weekend since release from lockdownStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Former cabinet minister Saad al-Jabri was strategic architect of Saudi counter-terrorism effortsPrime minister claims allegations are a \u0026lsquodeep-state\u0026rsquo, left-wing political witch-huntLong-serving politician will become first sitting prime minister in Israel\u0026rsquos history to stand trialPA president cites imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West BankFirebomb attack on home claimed the lives of a couple and their 18-month-old sonWHO forecasts coronavirus will kill 42,000 and infect most of 28 million populationRival Gantz to take over as prime minister of Israeli unity government after 18 monthsAshraf Ghani to lead country as rival Abdullah Abdullah oversees Taliban peace process, sources sayCeremony will end political deadlock that has dragged on for more than 500 daysArab and foreign jihadis ambush military convoys and assassinate officials as Baghdad and Damascus try to contain coronavirusThree men captured west of Caracas are the latest \u0026lsquoterrorists\u0026rsquo arrestedAt least 24 killed by suicide bomber in separate attack in Afghanistan on TuesdayAccident in which 15 wounded takes place during training exercise in Gulf of OmanFormation of coalition to proceed after supreme court clears way for PM to remain in officePolitics and ision facilitate virus in country with just 208 ventilators and scant testingPresident fears country\u0026rsquos 44 cases and three deaths could \u0026lsquosuddenly spike in few days or weeks\u0026rsquoResidents in Mosul, still traumatised by violence, fear a resurgence of the terror groupRuling against Likud chief would likely trigger snap election, the fourth since April 2019Accelerating economic meltdown has left country\u0026rsquos poorest without work and incomeStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4264223.1590610983!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"emily maitlis replaced as newsnight episode host following cummings monologue","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIn her monologue BBC presenter Emily Maitlis told viewers: ‘Dominic Cummings broke the rules – the country can see that and it’s shocked the government cannot.’ Photograph: David LevensonGetty ImagesEmily Maitlis has been replaced as host of Wednesday night’s episode of Newsnight after BBC bosses reprimanded her over a monologue in which she attacked the government’s handling of Dominic Cummings’ lockdown trip to Durham.News bosses at the corporation said the BBC2 programme’s lead presenter breached impartiality rules with her opening remarks on Tuesday night. She will be replaced on Wednesday by the Newsnight reporter Katie Razzall.In the monologue Ms Maitlis told viewers: “Dominic Cummings broke the rules – the country can see that and it’s shocked the government cannot.“The longer ministers and the prime minister insist he worked within them, the more likely the angry response to the scandal is likely to be . . . He made those who struggled to keep to the rules feel like fools, and has allowed many more to assume they can flout them.”Talking of UK prime minister Boris Johnson’s “blind loyalty” in the face of plummeting poll ratings, she expressed bafflement: “The prime minister knows all this and has chosen to ignore it.’FuryClips of the sequence went viral on social media, attracting millions of views – many more than tune in to Newsnight on a typical evening. However, it caused fury among both Conservative politicians who have largely parked their longstanding criticism of the BBC during the pandemic, and also some journalists in and outside the public broadcaster who felt it went against the corporation’s approach to journalism.BBC news bosses agreed with the criticism of its own show, swiftly issuing a statement distancing themselves from the monologue. BBC sources said Newsnight’s editor, Esme Wren, worked on Tuesday night’s episode.“The BBC must uphold the highest standards of due impartiality in its news output,” the corporation said in a statement. “We’ve reviewed the entirety of last night’s Newsnight, including the opening section, and while we believe the programme contained fair, reasonable and rigorous journalism, we feel that we should have done more to make clear the introduction was a summary of the questions we would examine, with all the accompanying evidence, in the rest of the programme.“As it was, we believe the introduction we broadcast did not meet our standards of due impartiality. Our staff have been reminded of the guidelines.”‘Ironic’Keith Brown, SNP deputy leader, said: “This statement is a gutless capitulation by BBC bosses. Newsnight should be commended - not slapped down - for their serious investigative work on Cummings, that’s not something you could say about the BBC News at 10. “Pandering to 10 Downing Street by curbing journalists from being able to hold the UK government to account is of serious concern.” An SNP spokesperson added: “It’s ironic that the only apology over the whole Dominic Cummings lockdown breaches scandal comes from the BBC.” AcclaimMs Maitlis’s profile, already high, has skyrocketed since she was made lead presenter of the nightly current affairs show last year, shortly after publishing her book Airhead on life as a television presenter. She received global acclaim after confronting prince Andrew about his connections with the deceased paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, becoming possibly the only journalist who can claim to have conducted an interview with a member of the royal family that turned out to be career-ending for the royal.However, her increasing willingness to deliver opinionated monologues – including one in April dismissing the idea that coronavirus is a “great leveller” given its disproportionate impact on poorer people – has raised concerns among some on the show that the approach is not suited to a BBC political programme. There are suggestions of wider editorial tensions within the programme on the approach, even as it attracts enormous online interest.The BBC has increasingly struggled to hold the line on issues of impartiality in its news coverage, having tied itself in knots over comments about Donald Trump by BBC Breakfast’s presenter Naga Munchetty. It also struggled to deal with the enormous levels of criticism from both Labour and the Conservatives during the 2019 general election. - Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus.

A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates.

It was blasted by Rio Tinto, along with a second sacred site, on Sunday, and the destruction was made public late on Tuesday. The mining giant received Ministerial consent to destroy the site in 2013 from the previous State government, under Western Australia’s Aboriginal Heritage Act, which was drafted in 1972 and heavily biased towards mining companies.After the green light was given to the miners, an archaeological mission attempting to save it could from the site found evidence that humans had used the site for more than twice as long as previously thought. The dig also discovered artefacts including sacred objects and the ancient plait of hair.Mr Hawkins said Aboriginal heritage does not get the same protection as “colonial heritage” under the current law.“If an act can deliver an economic outcome, then development activity appears to override any other interests every time,” he said.Mr Hawkins said Aboriginal people had been working for several years to change the Aboriginal Heritage Act so it provided adequate protection for important sites.“The current legislation allows proponents (of developments that threaten Aboriginal sites) to appeal decisions they are dissatisfied with. There is no such right for Aboriginal people or the broader community,” he said.Mr Hawkins said the new draft Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act presents “a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to address the fundamental imbalance of power” inherent in the current law.Rock art that is tens of thousands of years old on the Burrup Peninsula in north Western Australia is under threat from a gas project. The site contains more than one million rock carvings across more than 36,000 hectares.A light rail project in Sydney, completed in 2019, destroyed a site at which more than 2,400 stone artefacts were unearthed, including evidence Aboriginal people had used the area between 1788 and 1830 to manufacture tools and implements from flint brought to Australia on British ships.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"british public asked do civic duty get country lockdown","story":"The British public will be asked to do its “civic duty” to get the country out of lockdown as the government confirms its new “test and trace” scheme will rely on iniduals to “do the right thing”.From Thursday, anyone with symptoms of coronavirus tested and, if they are found to be positive, told to hand over details of anyone with whom they have had close contact. These people will then receive a text (below), email or phone call telling them to enter self-isolation for up to 14 days - and to book their own test if symptoms develop. Even if the test returns negative they will be asked to continue isolating. Announcing the new scheme on Wednesday night, Boris Johnson, admitted that it was a huge imposition on the British public. He said that it would be voluntary at first,  but warned that it could become mandatory with fines for those who did not comply with the quarantine or failed to hand over details of their friends and family.Mr Johnson made the announcement in front of an MPs\u0027 committee during which he was again questioned on the conduct of Dominic Cummings, his special adviser, who drove to Durham from London during lockdown in an apparent breach of the guidelines. The Prime Minister said that it was time to move on from that debate and denied the episode could lead to Britons being less likely to make the sacrifices now being asked of them. However, it emerged that Penny Mordaunt, the paymaster general, told a constituent in an email that she believed Mr Cummings had  undermined key public health messages.Mr Johnson denied that the Cummings episode would make the public far less energetic about adhering to the new system.Today the Prime Minister will formally review the lockdown rules which were imposed on Britain nine weeks ago. Mr Johnson also suggested that he could drop the coronavirus alert level from four to three, allowing for some lockdown relaxations.In his announcement, Mr Johnson said the new test and trace system would  place a burden on a tiny minority of people, but would ultimately free up to 66 million people from lockdown.He said: It is a huge imposition, but it will be on a very small minority of the population.And I would just say to everybody that it\u0027s worth it, because that is the tool that other countries have used to unlock the prison, to make sure that we can go forward.And so, that captivity for a tiny minority for a short time will allow us gradually to release 66 million people from the current situation so I do think it\u0027s the right way forward.  The system could see up to 10,000 people a day receive text messages or phone calls warning they have been near a person who has tested positive. It was supposed to be backed by an app, which would mean those who have been in close proximity to those who test positive would be automatically contacted, and urged to self-isolate.  But its rollout has been repeatedly delayed, with officials last night refusing to commit to any date for its launch.  On Wednesday the Health Secretary said testing and tracing must become “a new way of life” in order to protect households across the country.Matt Hancock said people had a “civic duty” to follow instructions to self isolate. He said: “This will be voluntary at first, because we trust everyone to do the right thing. But we can quickly make it mandatory if that’s what it takes.”Mr Johnson said fines could be introduced for people who fail to comply. He told the Liaison Committee: We will be asking people to stay at home. If they don\u0027t follow that advice, what we will be saying is we will consider what sanctions may be necessary.The system will see people with symptoms tested and then provided with a result within days. Yesterday,  Dame Dido Harding, head of NHS Test and Trace, said that currently 84 per cent of tests return results in 24 hours while 95 per cent provide results within 48 hours.If the results are positive the person will be put in touch with one of an army of 25,000 contact tracers who will ask for details of \u0027close contacts\u0027.Close contacts will be defined as anyone who has been within two metres of an infected person for at least 15 minutes. It comes amid concerns that some people may be reluctant to hand over contact details of friends, family or colleagues, fearing repercussions by those who face financial losses from two weeks off work. There are also fears that iniduals could be falsely named maliciously, in a bid to settle old scores. Baroness Harding said the system of manual tracking would “enable the vast majority of us to be able to get on with our lives in a much more normal way.”“It requires all of us to do our civic duty … trading national lockdown for inidual isolation”, she said - suggesting that compliance by those who get the call would allow 60 million people to be released from mass restrictions.Dame Dido said she had “great faith and confidence in the British public\u0027s desire to play their part” in getting the country back on its feet.“We all want to get back to a life, which is much more like normal, and this is one of the key elements that will enable us to start to release lockdown. So I actually have great faith that people will … want to know whether they\u0027ve got the disease and they will want to play their part in protecting their family, their friends and their local community,” she said.“We’re not launching this with fines and penalties for people who don\u0027t self-isolate or who don\u0027t give us their contacts. What we\u0027re doing is asking everyone to play their part.”Modelling for the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) has warned that unless testing is speeded up, the system could cut new infections by as little as five per cent.The study by Data Evaluation and Learning for Viral Epidemics (Delve) group, which has been handed to Sage, suggests improvements in testing turnaround times could increase this to 15 per cent.Prof John Newton, national co-ordinator of Test and Trace said it would be “very difficult” to achieve a fast turnaround for home tests, and said those contacted by the scheme would be sent to drive through sites and testing centres wherever possible.He also suggested officials expect mistakes to be made as the scheme is rolled out, saying “clearly, when you launch something of this size, something will go wrong somewhere along the line”.Prof Newton urged the public “to bear with us as there may be some glitches” saying he was confident that the “basic programme is very solid”.The Prime Minister denied that Mr Cummings’ decision to bring his family to Durham while they were supposed to be self-isolating could mean the public are less likely to comply with the demands.It came after Conservative MP Simon Hoare suggested the nation will be far less energetic about obeying future restrictions as a direct result of the activities of your senior adviser.Mr Johnson said: If, just suppose for a second that you were right, which I don\u0027t accept, all the more reason now for us to be consistent and clear in our message driving those key messages.One senior Tory MP said the actions of Mr Johnson’s advisor had badly undermined the scheme. He told The : They are rolling this out now when we\u0027ve lost the good will of the nation because of Cummings.The government\u0027s street cred has gone out of the window. People are losing sight at the gravity of the challenge we face and I fear it won\u0027t be until we have a second wave that people start to take this seriously again.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"cruise ship study shows 80 per cent covid 19 cases board asymptomatic","story":"Coronavirus infection without symptoms might be more common than previously thought, according to a study of people isolated on a cruise ship during the pandemic.More than 80 per cent of the passengers and crew on the unnamed cruise ship who tested positive for Covid-19 were asymptomatic.The prevalence of the virus on affected cruise ships is therefore likely to be significantly underestimated, the study published in the journal Thorax concludes.Strategies are needed to assess and monitor all passengers to prevent community transmission after disembarkation, the Australia-based researchers said.Professor Alan Smyth, joint editor-in-chief of the journal, said the study\u0027s results could have implications for the easing of lockdown restrictions if more people than previously thought have already had the virus.Of the 217 passengers and crew on board, 128 tested positive for the virus and of those, 104 patients - 81 per cent - did not have symptoms.The ship left in mid-March from Argentina for a planned 21-day cruise of the Antarctic, along a similar route taken by explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton in the early 1900s.It set sail after the global pandemic was declared by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and two of the study authors happened to be passengers, while a third was the expedition physician.Passengers and crew were screened for Covid-19 symptoms, body temperatures were taken before boarding, and no-one who had recently travelled through countries with high infection rates at the time such as China and South Korea was allowed on.The first recorded fever on board the ship was on day eight and the study authors said from that point all passengers were confined to their cabins and surgical masks were issued, while full personal protective equipment was used for any contact with any patients with a fever.Eight people had to be medically evacuated from the ship and the authors said there had been one death to date.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"introducing planet normal new telegraph podcast talks normal","story":"Sick of gotcha political coverage?

Somehow it feels provident rather than downright terrifying that I don’t have much work, freeing me up to spend time with my children.For three decades I’ve lived with the constant pressure of chores piling up and tasks undone. The horizon’s always littered with obligations, both professional and social. If the year had continued as usual I’d be speed-reading dozens of books for talks at literary festivals, giving over weekends to a succession of birthday parties, preparing for a week-long walk with schoolfriends, while working like a lunatic to keep my household going.Instead, my life has been cancelled and I’m profoundly grateful. There’s the strangest sensation of your slate being wiped clean. As if the great games mistress in the sky says you can sit this one out.I’ve no doubt this carefree disregard for practical and economic reality is indelibly linked to the glorious weather. The moment the sun comes out a collective mania descends upon the British psyche. We can never quite shake off the feeling it’s a stroke of temporary, outrageous good fortune, like finding a fifty-quid note wafting down the street something that should be squandered joyfully here and now.I feel like I’m enjoying my own back-garden music festival, complete with Spotify playlists sent by similarly Awol middle-aged friends. One temporarily holed-up independent publisher, known for his verve with turntables, sent me a long note alongside his latest compilation of dance music. There wasn’t one mention of the woes of the book trade, with most high-street book stores closed and Amazon prioritising essential items over novels.If my hometown of Cambridge is anything to go by, the illusion of being sunnily en fête is widespread. For two months the city was eerily empty, but when I cycled through two days ago the Mill pub was doing a roaring trade in takeaway pints, with drinkers carrying their booty down to the river. Jesus Green was carpeted with picnickers (as it has been for 10 days now) and a gang of young men in their twenties had a car backed against one of the entrances blasting out rap music, ramping up the Party in the Park vibe.But if there’s one summer pleasure that makes us feel almost Mediterranean, it’s the weather being balmy enough for an outdoor swim. Yes, I know some deranged souls brave winter water, but for most of us it’s sufficient proof of British grit to enjoy a bracing plunge in an early summer heatwave. Vast queues to the coast tell of the pressing need to take a briny dip. In Cambridge I found my way to the celebrated Riverbank Club, where the town’s diehard naturists go skinny‑dipping.My joy was complete when, turning my bike into my street, I heard a melody like panpipes from a lost world: the ice-cream van was back. True, the vendor was wearing a protective face shield and only selling pre-packaged lollies – but he turned my road into a seaside promenade. Children in shorts emerged from back gardens, with a couple in swimming costumes from their paddling pools.This is a very British triumph of the spirit.

There is something very important happening at the end of the year which is that we get back control of our own waters,” he said“Any agreements have simply got to accommodate that reality,” Boris Johnson’s top Brexit official said, as he described the isions over the issue between the two sides. “The EU is still coming to terms with the fact that there is a large country in Europe that doesn\u0027t want to be part of the EU\u0027s structure,” he added.The joint Political Declaration, which sets out the aspiration for the negotiations over a zero tariff zero quota trade deal, was finalised at the same time as the Withdrawal Agreement. It calls for a fisheries agreement to be struck by July 1. Mr Frost said the deadline was just an aspiration and not “an absolute requirement”. However, failure to reach a deal could harden EU attitudes at a time when the bloc’s leaders are consumed by the coronavirus pandemic.  The UK wants a Norway-style fishing arrangement with annual negotiations over access and catch shares for EU boats. It also wants the shares to be judged on the basis of zonal attachment, which the UK says more closely represents the numbers of fish in UK waters than the system of historic catch patterns that are the foundation of the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy. The EU wants reciprocal access to UK waters “under existing conditions” and for the fisheries agreement to be part of the free trade agreement and rules out yearly negotiations. The next round of Brexit negotiations will be held next week on video conference because of the coronavirus pandemic. The previous round ended in mutual recrimination. Mr Frost and Mr Barnier exchanged bad-tempered public letters as talks appeared on the point of collapse. The pressure is on both sides to deliver a breakthrough after repeated rounds ending in bad-tempered stalemate because next week is the final set of talks before a planned June summit to evaluate progress. Boris Johnson was expected to attend that “high-level meeting” Mr Frost told MPs. The meeting is the last chance for the UK to request an extension of up to two years to the Brexit transition period, which finishes at the end of this year. If the UK and EU fail to finalise the free trade deal by that deadline, and no extension is requested, both sides will be forced to trade on less lucrative WTO terms from January 1. Downing Street has repeatedly ruled out any extension to the transition period. Despite that, Michel Barnier wrote to Remain-supporting opposition MPs, telling them the EU was still ready to negotiate a delay. “I take note of your views on a possible extension of the transition period,” he said, “Such an extension of up to one or two years can be agreed.”Any extension would involve Britain paying the EU to remain part of the Single Market and Customs Union. Mr Frost told MPs he did not take orders from Boris Johnson\u0027s under fire adviser Dominic Cummings but admitted he spoke to Mr Cummings frequently and the prime minister only once a fortnight. He said he was confident that the Government\u0027s Brexit negotiating strategy would survive even if Mr Cummings was sacked. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/05/26/08/coronavirus-shopping.jpg","title":"coronavirus lockdown britain high street shops reopen social distance","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Face masks, hand sanitiser and a lot more queueing:\u0026nbspretailers across the UK are set to\u0026nbspopen up to a different world, and shoppers may find it a difficult experience to get to grips withBritain’s high streets will begin to get back to something like normality next month when non-essential retailers are allowed to open their doors again after almost three months in lockdown.That will come as some relief for businesses, many of which were already struggling before the coronavirus pandemic hit.But what will the socially distanced shopping experience be like?Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWe have a rough idea of what to expect from supermarkets’ approach: limited numbers of people in stores means there will be queues outside shoppers will be greeted by employees wearing face masks and maybe other PPE perspex screens will shield checkouts. There will be hand sanitiser readily available and arrows on the floor directing us which way round to go. Ikea and John Lewis are among retailers to have said they will introduce “social distance wardens” to ensure people are kept apart and obeying the rules. High streets are also likely to be a lot quieter than we’re used to. Only a relatively small percentage of shops are likely to open their doors on 15 June as most retailers have said they will take a gradual approach, testing out the new way of doing things on their most spacious and easily adapted stores.Johnson urges Britons to return to the shops and spend next monthNext, for example, says it will open just 25 of its 500 UK stores on the first day. John Lewis has also said it will take a cautious approach to reopening. Richard Lim, chief executive of consultancy Retail Economics, forecasts that shopping centres will be even slower to reopen than high streets because people will prefer to shop in local, familiar, open-air environments, rather than travel to large complexes.He points out that shopping centres often attract consumers looking for a day out by offering an array of food options and other leisure experiences, nearly all of which will remain closed.Some chains have simply stopped paying rent on stores that are closed and will be reluctant to reopen shopping centre locations (which tend to be the most expensive) when they don’t know how many shoppers will come through the door.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some people, particularly those most vulnerable to Covid-19, will still not feel comfortable heading to the shops to be exposed to large numbers of people.Others will have grown used to the ease of online shopping while many more may have lost their jobs or be concerned about their financial position.“There is potentially a big gap between what people expect the experience of shopping will be like and the reality of that experience when retailers reopen,” says Lim.“Shopping is all about having a social experience, it’s supposed to be enjoyable. It might be a shock to some people, being met with a shop-floor worker wearing a mask, being asked to sanitise your hands, and have a social distancing warden walking around telling people to stay in certain areas. “It could really undermine that experience and just push people even more towards online shopping.”Which non-essential shops are reopening and when will it happen?Millions of garment workers facing destitution as demand dries upShoppers return to UK high streets after dire 2019 tradingLim believes the impacts of the guidance will be felt very unevenly across the retail sector depending on a number of factors.Value clothing retailers like Primark are likely to find things tough because their stores need a lot of people coming through to make a profit. People also pick up and put down items often and the stock is normally densely packed, something that will have to be reconsidered in a socially distanced era.Footwear retailers will find things even tougher as the way we buy shoes is forced to change. The new guidelines require a shoe shop to take any shoe that has been tried on by a customer and store it for 72 hours before putting back out on the shop floor. That will make storage impractical and could leave stores unprofitable.“We are likely to see a step change in retailers’ efforts to merge online and offline shopping experiences,” says Lim. That will be through more click-and-collect services, and more inventive ways to get people in stores and excited by what they see. If they then buy online after that it doesn’t matter.Lim points to the example of Zara in Shanghai which is “like an art exhibition”. “You then go to a changing room and the items are waiting there for you in your size or you just press a button and get it delivered to your home.”Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?This model of the shop as more of a showcase is one that many retailers have been moving towards, but it requires significant investment at a time when many will be tightening their belts.Whatever happens, retailers need a significant turnaround in their fortunes or there will almost certainly be large-scale store closures, job losses and collapses into administration.Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, sums it up: “Lockdown has cost non-food stores £1.8bn a week in lost revenues and with sales expected to remain weak, even as shops begin to reopen, many retailers will still be in a fight for survival. “Government must act to ensure that retail rents take account of the ongoing crisis in the industry. Swift action would protect jobs and businesses – helping retail to play its part in restarting the UK economy.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The rocket and capsule that will carry the astronauts has been built by Elon Musk\u0027s SpaceX, and the mission represents the final test of both.Nasa and SpaceX launch could be delayed by weatherIt will also be the first time a private company has attempted to send astronauts into space.Here\u0027s everything you need to know about this mission, which will launch at 9.30pm UK time.The mission, known as Demo-2, will allow the US to once again send humans into space.According to Nasa, this is a demonstration mission to show SpaceX\u0027s ability to ferry astronauts to the space station and back safely.It is the final major step required by SpaceX\u0027s astronaut carrier, the Crew Dragon, to get certified by Nasa\u0027s Commercial Crew Programme for more long-term manned missions to space.Mr Behnken, 48, and Mr Hurley, 53, are experienced Nasa astronauts who have been involved in testing of the Crew Dragon capsule.Mr Hurley, who was a fighter pilot in the US Marine Corps, was on the final flight of the space shuttle Atlantis in 2011 before it was discontinued.Mr Behnken was a flight test engineer with the US Air Force before joining Nasa, and has spent just over 29 days in space, which includes 37 hours of spacewalking time.He will serve as the mission\u0027s joint operations commander and take responsibility for the rendezvous, docking and undocking of the Dragon capsule, while Mr Hurley will be in charge of the launch, landing and recovery of the vehicle in his role as the Crew Dragon spacecraft commander.The two men will be wearing spacesuits designed by SpaceX with help from Hollywood costume designer Jose Fernandez.The Falcon 9 rocket will take off from launchpad 39A at the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida, carrying the Crew Dragon spacecraft with Mr Behnken and Mr Hurley strapped inside.Shortly after lift-off, the rocket will separate into what is called a first stage and a second stage.The first stage will return to a SpaceX landing ship which will be stationed in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Florida, while the second part of the rocket continue the journey with the Crew Dragon.Once in orbit, the Crew Dragon will then separate from the second stage and travel at around 17,000mph before being in a position to rendezvous, and dock, with the space station 24 hours later.Mr Behnken and Mr Hurley will test the Crew Dragon\u0027s environmental control system, the displays and controls, and the manoeuvring thrusters.They will also monitor the autonomous docking system during the approach to the space station, according to Nasa.The duo will become members of the Expedition 63 crew and perform further tests on the Crew Dragon along with other tasks related to the space station.But the pair\u0027s main mission is to conclude the validation process that is required by Nasa to ensure the spacecraft designed to carry astronauts can operate safely.The Demo-2 mission is expected to last anything between one and four months. But Nasa said the duration of this mission would be determined by when the next commercial crew will be able to travel to the space station.The spacecraft will be capable of staying in orbit for at least 210 days.When it is time to return, the Crew Dragon will autonomously undock with Mr Behnken and Mr Hurley on board and depart the space station.Shortly after firing up its engines to re-enter the Earth\u0027s atmosphere, the spacecraft will deploy four parachutes to slow its descent and splash down in the Atlantic Ocean, just off the coast of Florida.SpaceX\u0027s recovery ship, called Go Navigator, will be waiting nearby to retrieve the duo and ferry them to Cape Canaveral.In 2010, the US started to wind down its space shuttle programme which had carried astronauts into orbit for three decades with the aim of focusing on building technology for Moon and Mars missions.Nasa asked private companies such as Space X and Boeing to design the technologies which would allow passengers to travel to space, while opting to pay Russia to send American astronauts to the space station as an interim arrangement.If Demo-2 is successful, SpaceX will be allowed to go ahead with more manned missions to the space stations as part of their 2.6 billion US dollar (£2.1 billion) contract with Nasa.Boeing also has a similar deal with the space agency, worth 4.2 billion US dollars (£3.4 billion), to send astronauts to the space station in its CST-100 Starliner crew capsule, although its vehicle is not expected to be ready until next year.Both Nasa and SpaceX will be hosting live streams of the events, which will begin a few hours before launch. Tune in earlier to get a look at the astronauts as they are driven to the spacecraft before they set off, as well as for discussions about the mission with experts.Nasa\u0027s live coverage will be hosted on Nasa TV, which can be watched here, via YouTube, as well as on the space agency\u0027s official site:SpaceX\u0027s coverage will be hosted on its own website too, on a launch page that currently gives a full rundown of how the day will play out.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I will stop it in a heartbeat if you want me to.\u0027 They both came back and they said, \u0027We\u0027re go for launch.\u0027 Hans Koenigsmann, a SpaceX vice president, said Monday evening that he and other company workers have imagined themselves in the astronauts\u0027 shoes on launch day — or their helmets.That changes the equation pretty dramatically, he said.\u0026nbspSpaceX to become first ever private company to put people in space – beating almost every countryIf SpaceX is successful today, it will be the first private company ever to put humans into space. Such a feat has only been achieved by three countries: the US, Russia and China.The company has been sending cargo to the International Space Station since 2012. But it has said that sending humans is an entirely different proposition.It\u0027s a huge step, obviously, going from cargo ... to launching two people that are dads as we call them and have families, kids, wives., said\u0026nbspHans Koenigsmann, a\u0026nbspSpaceX\u0026nbspvice president.SpaceX raises $350 million of funding a day before launchElon Musk\u0027s\u0026nbspSpaceX\u0026nbspsaid on Tuesday that it raised $346.2 million in a new round of funding, a day before it launches two American astronauts to the International Space Station.The private rocket company\u0027s launch of its first crewed mission on Wednesday from NASA\u0027s Kennedy Space Center in Florida will put an end to the U.S. space agency\u0027s nine-year hiatus in human spaceflight.The launch, which will be attended by President Donald Trump, is crucial for Musk,\u0026nbspSpaceX\u0026nbspand NASA.A successful flight will mark a milestone in the quest to produce reusable spacecraft that can make space travel more affordable. Musk is the founder and chief executive officer of\u0026nbspSpaceX\u0026nbspand CEO of Tesla Inc.Including the latest round, the company has raised more than $567 million and is valued at about $36 billion, according to a CNBC report.Here\u0027s what Nasa has to say about\u0026nbspRobert Behnken and Douglas Hurley, the two experiences astronauts at the centre of today\u0027s launch:Behnken will be the joint operations commander for the mission, responsible for activities such as rendezvous, docking and undocking, as well as Demo-2 activities while the spacecraft is docked to the space station. He was selected as a NASA astronaut in 2000 and has completed two space shuttle flights. Behnken flew STS-123 in March 2008 and STS-130 in February 2010, and he performed three spacewalks during each mission. Born in St. Anne, Missouri, he has bachelor’s degrees in physics and mechanical engineering from Washington University and earned a master’s and doctorate in mechanical engineering from California Institute of Technology. Before joining NASA, Behnken was a flight test engineer with the U.S. Air Force.Hurley will be the spacecraft commander for Demo-2, responsible for activities such as launch, landing and recovery. He was selected as an astronaut in 2000 and has completed two spaceflights. Hurley served as pilot and lead robotics operator for both STS‐127 in July 2009 and STS‐135, the final space shuttle mission, in July 2011. The New York native was born in Endicott but considers Apalachin his hometown. He holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Civil Engineering from Tulane University in Louisiana and graduated from the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School in Maryland. Before joining NASA, he was a fighter pilot and test pilot in the U.S. Marine Corps.Weather permitting – both in Florida and over the Atlantic, which will decide whether the launch happens, as well as here – you might be able to see the rocket as it sails over the UK tonight.

It is possible to track it in real-time using a tool developed by the European Space Agency.Everything you need to know about the Nasa SpaceX launchA 2019 survey by YouGov found that only 32 per cent of British people thought private companies should take astronauts to the ISS. The same poll found that half of Britons would not take a trip to the moon, even if their safe return was guaranteed. SpaceX eventually hopes to take tourists into space, with CEO Elon Musk hoping the first flights will take place as early as 2021. Tickets cost $55 million for a 10-day trip to the ISS and back, which if successful could herald a new era of space tourism.Created with Sketch.SpaceX Dragon heads back to earth after ISS mission Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Space X Dragon departs from the International Space Station and heads for earthSpace X Dragon undocks from the International Space StationSpaceX Crew Dragon is pictured about 20 meters (66 feet) away from the International Space StationA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, carrying the Crew Dragon spacecraft, lifts off on March 2 2019Astronauts aboard the Space Station preparing to open hatchet to the SpaceX Dragon capsule carrying a instrumented dummy after it successfully docked with Space StationA dummy(L) named Ripley onboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket with the company\u0027s Crew Dragon spacecraft onboard after the opening of the hatch during the Demo-1 missioNThe SpaceX team watches as the SpaceX Crew Dragon docks with the International Space StationSpaceX Falcon 9 rocket docked with the International Space Station during the Demo-1 missionA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, carrying the Crew Dragon spacecraftAstronaut David Saint-Jacques taking a look inside the SpaceX Dragon capsule carrying a instrumented dummyA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, carrying the Crew Dragon spacecraft lifts off on an uncrewed test flightA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, carrying the Crew Dragon spacecraft, lifts off on an uncrewed test flight A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket with a demo Crew Dragon spacecraft on an uncrewed test flightSpaceX\u0027s new crew capsule approaches just before dockingAstronaut Eric Boe, assistant to the chief of the astronaut office for commercial crew, left, and Norm Knight, deputy director of flight operations at Nasa\u0027s Johnson Space Center watch the launch of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying the company\u0027s Crew Dragon spacecraftSpace X Dragon departs from the International Space Station and heads for earthSpace X Dragon undocks from the International Space StationSpaceX Crew Dragon is pictured about 20 meters (66 feet) away from the International Space StationA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, carrying the Crew Dragon spacecraft, lifts off on March 2 2019Astronauts aboard the Space Station preparing to open hatchet to the SpaceX Dragon capsule carrying a instrumented dummy after it successfully docked with Space StationA dummy(L) named Ripley onboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket with the company\u0027s Crew Dragon spacecraft onboard after the opening of the hatch during the Demo-1 missioNThe SpaceX team watches as the SpaceX Crew Dragon docks with the International Space StationSpaceX Falcon 9 rocket docked with the International Space Station during the Demo-1 missionA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, carrying the Crew Dragon spacecraftAstronaut David Saint-Jacques taking a look inside the SpaceX Dragon capsule carrying a instrumented dummyA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, carrying the Crew Dragon spacecraft lifts off on an uncrewed test flightA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, carrying the Crew Dragon spacecraft, lifts off on an uncrewed test flight A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket with a demo Crew Dragon spacecraft on an uncrewed test flightSpaceX\u0027s new crew capsule approaches just before dockingAstronaut Eric Boe, assistant to the chief of the astronaut office for commercial crew, left, and Norm Knight, deputy director of flight operations at Nasa\u0027s Johnson Space Center watch the launch of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying the company\u0027s Crew Dragon spacecraftWednesday\u0027s launch might be in doubt, due to poor weather at the launch site.

Sales shot up particularly sharply in the four weeks to mid-May, rising 17 per cent.Ice cream and alcohol sales surged 40 per cent and 50 per cent respectively on the Thursday before Britain enjoyed a long weekend to celebrate VE Day from 8 May.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWith the sun shining on large parts of the country for much of the last four weeks, shoppers have bought more chilled dips, crisps and fizzy drinks, Kantar said.Separate data from Nielsen showed that online grocery sales more than doubled in the four weeks to 16 May compared to last year as some shoppers chose to avoid stores, many of which have seen queues as chains introduce social distancing measures.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?The research showed that a new demographic of older shoppers has bought food online for the first time.Supermarkets have benefited from the closure of restaurants, bars and catering businesses which normally serve up a third of the country’s meals.Takeaway restaurants have also been able to capitalise on changing habits as diners are forced to stay indoors, with Kantar registering a big per cent spike in sales.“It’s not just groceries experiencing a boom – people missing their favourite restaurants and wanting to treat themselves have pushed takeaway deliveries up by 250 per cent year on year,” said Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar.However, the surge is not enough to make up for lost sales on the premises which in normal times make up the bulk of restaurant revenues.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Researchers found 70 per cent of parents do not have any type of external support in providing care and education for their children.The study, which polled 3,055 working parents in the UK, America, France, Germany, and Italy, found similar gendered patterns in other countries too.Researchers found women with children across these countries now spend an average of 65 hours a week on unpaid labour around the house — with this figure having almost doubled since the Covid-19 crisis. This is almost a third more than fathers, who are doing an average of 50 hours a week.It comes after a study by the London School of Economics recently found coronavirus is exacerbating the gender gap as women bear the brunt of childcare responsibilities and homeschooling during lockdown — whether they’re working or not.I founded the Wages for Housework campaign – little has changed sinceThe report found women are more likely to deal with homeschooling, childcare and chores around the house even if they are juggling this with working at the same time.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Together with the way we are adapting our working lives to cope during the lockdown, this gives me hope that in the long term, a more equal society will emerge.”The report found women are more likely than men to lose their jobs in the forthcoming recession because a larger number work in sectors — such as hospitality, leisure, tourism and the arts — that are forecast to be hardest hit.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Should people touch them?“If people have washed their hands properly, you might argue that there shouldn’t be a transmission risk onto the fabrics.UK announces plan for ‘local lockdowns’ for future outbreaks – live“But people are now suggesting if you try on a garment and you don’t want it, that garment should be put into quarantine for several days before it’s then being put back onto the shelves.”The Independent has approached Public Health England for comment.In April, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) released guidance asking businesses to consider closing or limiting access to changing rooms in shops under strict social distancing measures.Helen Dickinson, the BRC’s chief executive, said at the time: “Retailers are closely following developments from government on when restrictions might be eased and are starting to plan accordingly. “The safety and wellbeing of colleagues and customers remains the highest priority and these guidelines aim to support everyone in the industry.”Coronavirus: Should you be wearing a face mask?Prof Keevil, principal investigator at Southampton’s microbiology unit, also warned that thorough hand-washing regimes would need to become part of every day life on the high street to help stop the spread of the virus.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This trend, combined with people\u0027s own changing attitudes toward social events and large gatherings, resulted in travel dropping by more than 50 per cent before the lockdown began, according to requests made on Apple Maps for car and public transport directions.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRequests on Apple Maps for car directions began to fall on 11 March, while requests for public transport directions began to fall even earlier on 9 March.Many activities and behaviours that were considered normal before coronavirus also remain taboo regardless of the government\u0027s guidelines.The recently relaxed rules mean that cleaners and nannies are now permitted to visit people\u0027s homes, but a recent survey found that the majority of people found this very unacceptable.The poll by Ipsos MORI, which was carried out between 8 and 11 May, also found that having non co-habiting friends, family members or loved ones visit was also considered socially unacceptable.​Public opinion about exercise and driving is more greatly ided, ​though the poll demonstrated that government rules may not be a defining influence on people\u0027s behaviours.Companies\u0027 decisions to keep work from home policies in place show that lockdown measures are not necessarily enforced by government policy decision.The figures also suggest that the impact of coronavirus on travel habits, socialising and other pre-lockdown habits could continue long after lockdown officially ends.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Each box is packed with goods such as ready meals, fresh fruit, vegetables, tinned goods, nappies, tampons and soap.On the involvement of the young estate volunteers, he said: “They just want to be involved and have been engaged from the start. I did one call for help at the beginning but they keep coming back.“They have been incredible and are true stars. Some people are desperate and get aggressive.

The cabinet office minister told a parliamentary committee on Wednesday that the government might want to “enhance” legislation on human rights “in all sorts of ways”.Britain, along with every country in Europe other than Belarus, is a signatory of the European Convention on Human Rights. Brussels wants the UK to commit to seeing the status quo on the issue as part of the terms of a Brexit trade agreement.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut UK negotiators have refused, claiming that the issue is a matter of “sovereignty”.Asked why he was reluctant to agree to the EU’s demands, Michael Gove told the future relationship with the EU select committee: “It’s a question of sovereignty and the EU determining whether or not our own legislation is sufficient to give effect to the rights of citizens to ensure that their position under the ECHR is safeguarded.No 10 defends coronavirus test for Michael Gove’s daughter“It is a question of sovereignty: to say that one particular legislative mechanism is pristine perfect and cannot be changed unless you secure the permission of another sovereign entity is I think an infringement of sovereignty. Some people might argue that it was justified but it is nevertheless an infringement.”Asked whether that meant the government might change the Human Rights Act, he said: “We might enhance it, in all sorts of ways.”In 2018 Dominic Cummings said a referendum on membership of the European Convention on Human Rights, which is entirely separate from the EU, would be “high on the agenda” if he ever got involved in politics again.The government’s official position is that it has no intention of leaving the convention.Created with Sketch.Brexit celebrations in Parliament Square Show all 37Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pro-Brexit supporters celebrating in Parliament Square, after the UK left the European Union on 31 January.

The new laws would allow it to retroactively extend prison sentences after they had been served, among other new powers. Downing Street would not confirm or deny whether the approach would be followed.The Brexit trade talks taking place with the EU are set to end in December, barring a further extension. Human rights are one of the main stumbling blocks that has so far prevented significant progress, with others including fishing, EU regulations, and the governance of the deal.European Convention on Human Rights\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She did not want to risk a nearly 300-mile drive with our child given how ill I had been.“We agreed that we should go for a short drive to see if I could drive safely, we drove for roughly half an hour and ended up on the outskirts of Barnard Castle town. We did not visit the castle, we did not walk around the town.”Mr Cummings said he had felt a “bit sick” so they had walked about 10 to 15 metres to the riverbank where they sat for about 15 minutes until he felt better.Claimed he had previously warned of coronavirus pandemicMr Cummings used the briefing to insist he, contrary to some reports, had not resisted the introduction of lockdown measures and had in fact previously warned of the dangers of a coronavirus pandemic.“For years, I have warned of the dangers of pandemics. Last year I wrote about the possible threat of coronaviruses and the urgent need for planning,” he said.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

accidentally released from a laboratory during scientific experiments. However, there have been suggestions that the reference to coronavirus was actually added to the blog in April 2020.Scientists currently believe Sars-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19, jumped from animals to humans as the product of natural evolution.Described his family’s farm as ‘sort of concrete blocks’The PM’s senior adviser insisted that his trip to Durham to isolate was not because the property on his family’s farm was a “nice place to be”.“The point about it was not that it was some nice place to be. If you have been there, you would see that it\u0027s sort of concrete blocks,” he said.“The point about it was not that it was a nice place to be, but that it was the safest place to be in the circumstances – and it meant that I didn\u0027t have to expose other people to risk unless I absolutely had to in a critical emergency.”Didn’t make inquiries about childcare in London before making tripMr Cummings used the briefing to insist the journey had been necessary because he and his wife had no reasonable childcare options in London if they both fell ill with coronavirus.“I suddenly got a call from my wife who was at home looking after our four-year-old child,” he explained in a prepared statement.“She told me she suddenly felt badly ill, she vomited and felt like she might pass out, and there would be nobody to look after our child. None of our usual childcare options were available.”However, in subsequent questioning from journalists, Mr Cummings later admitted he did not make inquiries about potential childcare in London.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Mr Kernen suggested that Mr Sorkin was overreacting to the coronavirus, while Mr Sorkin accused Mr Kernen of minimising the dangers of the virus for the benefit of Mr Trump. You panicked about the market, panicked about Covid, panicked about the ventilators, panicked about the PPE, panicked about ever going out again, panicked that we\u0027d never get back to normal, Mr Kernen said during the exchange. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Sorkin defended himself, pointing to the death toll as evidence the virus should not be shrugged off. You didn\u0027t panic about anything? Joseph, 100,000 people died. One hundred thousand people died, Joe, and all you did was try to help your friend the president, Mr Sorkin said. Those are what you did, every single morning on this show, every single morning on this show. You have used and abused your position, Joe. You have used and abused your position. How to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsMr Kernen defended himself, claiming he was just trying to help investors keep their cool, keep their heads and as it turned out that\u0027s what they should have done. He went on to claim that the country\u0027s markets would have tanked if Mr Sorkin had had his way, and contended that the US\u0027s death rate was on the lower end when compared to numerous other countries. Mr Sorkin fired back that his concerns about the virus had nothing to do with the market, that they were rooted in concerns for people\u0027s lives. Trump adviser criticised for calling US workers ‘human capital stock’I wasn\u0027t arguing for you to go sell your stocks, Joseph, I was arguing about people\u0027s lives, Mr Sorkin said. Mr Kernen said he agreed that it was terrible that 100,000 have already died from the virus, but maintained that a return to normal was inevitable. ...Giving credence to all that panic didn\u0027t help any investors at all, or people with their anxiety, Mr Kernen said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

One son, aged around 15, was allegedly discovered living in the basement after Mr Gray admitted this to authorities. “The house was filled with urine smell, faeces throughout the house, partially flooded basement,” said the Roane County court on Monday. Investigators searched the address over the weekend after someone told police that the youngest child was walking alone near the family home. Whilst his parents were unaware, Roane County authorities located the child who allegedly told them about the basement and the other child buried in the backyard, reported WVLT News. Detectives then arrived at the house to investigate.The couple also admitted that the children had not received medical or dental attention for at least six years prior to the investigation. At the same time, authorities said the children had “stunted growth” and that the parents had withheld food from them as punishment. The couple could face further charges.

He arrived at the Church Bird Banding Station in Mongolia at 3.22pm local time on Wednesday, bird conservation organisation Birding Beijing said.Scientists from the Mongolia Cuckoo project – a joint initiative involving Birding Beijing, the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) and the Wildlife Science and Conservation Center of Mongolia – fitted five cuckoos with satellite tags in June 2019 to monitor long-distance migration.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOnon is the only one that has since completed a round trip from Mongolia to his winter home in Zambia and back again, covering a total of 26,000km.UK’s largest bird of prey returns to England for first time in 240 yeaHS2 workers ‘destroying bird nests and failing to social-distance’America is grounded, and the birds have returnedBird dies after getting tangled in coronavirus face maskWorld’s smallest bird dinosaur found in 99-million-year-old amber“Remarkable navigation and endurance. And now he has no time to waste as he needs to set up his territory, defending it from competing males and mate with as many females as possible!”Chris Hewson, senior research ecologist at the BTO, told the BBC the project has revealed much about the knowledge birds that migrate long distances have in order to make the journey.“I think the big takeaway is that the birds are able to travel so far and often so fast that they must be able to find suitable conditions for fattening and also know exactly where to go to get favourable wind conditions to help them, for instance, to cross the Indian Ocean.“So the costs of migration clearly aren’t as great as we thought in the past,” he said.But the birds still face danger from predators, storms and starvation. There are concerns that one of the tagged birds, named Bayan, may have died as the project has not received signals from its tag since 12 May.Bayan and Onon were both on similar routes until Bayan reached China’s Yunnan Province.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

These birds are shared by all of us in the countries along the route – from Mongolia to Mozambique – and, with that, comes a shared responsibility to do what we can to protect them.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

For this reason, together with the superintendent and those in charge of agricultural funds, we will find a way to make this treasure enjoyable.”Ancient ‘lost’ civilisation uncovered by archaeologists in TurkeyItaly’s cultural sites are beginning to reopen following weeks of shutdown as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.Pompeii – the Roman city buried after the eruption of Mount Vesuvius – officially reopened to the public on Tuesday.Meanwhile, the Colosseum will reopen on 1 June, with visitors obliged to buy tickets online, wear face masks and have their temperature checked before entering.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Workers facing money troubles after being furloughed or axed from jobs have also sparked concerns pets could be abandoned as households struggle to pay the bills. With routine operations like neutering on hold, theres likely to be an influx in unwanted litters and the number of animals in rescue care is expected to increase after lockdown.Here, Sun Online speaks to the key workers responsible for rescuing distressed and neglected animals, and takes a closer look at the abuse happening during lockdown.Sickeningly, in one of the worst cases since shutdown, last month a tortured cat was found skewered, burned and lying dead on a disposable barbecue in Doncaster.The animal was so badly burned it was impossible to tell what colour its fur was.The woman who found the remains and reported the incident to the RSPCA said: At first, I thought it was some sort of stuffed toy, but when I got closer, I realised it wasn’t.“It was absolutely horric. The look on its poor little face suggested it must have been tortured and died in agony.In another violent attack, a nesting swan was shot in the face with an air rle - one of five shocking attacks in a ten day period leaving four swans injured and one dead.The bird was targeted in Thatcham, Berkshire, while tending to her unhatched eggs, and needed an operation to remove the mm pellet.With less park workers and members of the public around to witness such horrors, these creatures are left defenceless against vile attackers.Even more worryingly, the public was recently warned to be wary about animal abuse after a spike in domestic violence during lockdown.The Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals highlighted the “strong link” between violence against humans and the abuse of animals in households, and urged people to get in touchthey become aware of animals in danger.RSPCA chief inspectorate officer Dermot Murphy tells Sun Online: There’s a recognised link between domestic violence and violence against animals... and they can be used as a tool to control vulnerable people, for example threats to hurt the dogthe [victim] says anything. We haven’t seen an increase in [abuse] reports so far - but this could be because it is going on behind closed doors.We also normally get reports when people are taking animals out on the street, or when a neighbour sees someone beating a dog in a garden. Reports have tailed away but I suspect it hasn’t gone away. I think people might [turn a blind eye], and especially being home all the time, they may be more reticent about reporting a neighbour, whereas usually they wouldthey werent home as much.There may be a feeling that they might be suspected for reporting it, and as theyre stuck at home they arent going to do it now.Animal collection officer Cara Gibbon is responsible for rescuing sick and injured animals, currently dealing with up to  emergency rescues a day during lockdown.“We’re dealing with a lot of cats being abandoned in lockdown - I’ve definitely seen an increase, she says.Every week Im seeing kittens being abandoned in boxes, and older cats too.Last week for example I rescued five kittens that had been abandoned in a box down an alleyway in Birmingham. A woman called in to say she’d found them and they were only three weeks old, which is way too young to be on their own. They were covered in fleas, and were so poorly, with really pale gums, they had flea anaemia.The -year-old, from Birmingham, has worked for the RSPCA for ten years and insists the kittens would have died had they not been picked up.It’s distressing, especially when you know a human is responsible, she says. It’s not just their mum has left them - someone has put them in a box and just dumped them knowing they might not be found and that’s heartbreaking.“There are a lot of rumours going round about animals carrying Covid on their fur. It could be down to selling issues, or people can’t afford them.Despite her decade of experience, Cara admits some parts of the job, like seeing an animal abandoned, never get easier. When dogs have been tied up at the side of the road with a note to say they’ve come from a loving home - it really gets to me, she says.Logistically, its been hard for animal rescuers to continue their roles while adhering to the social distancing laws too.“I’m not going into homes unless I absolutely have to - I had to when rescuing a pigeon stuck in a chimney so I made sure I wore a mask, overalls, shoe covers and gloves, Cara says.“My colleagues have had people going into hospital with Covid symptoms and their animals have been left behind.In this instance they’ve had to suit up completely, with a breathing mask, with proper PPE, and take the animals to a rescue centre and look after them until the owner is out of hospital.For Dermot, one of the main worries is what happens when lockdown ends, and the RSPCA has a clearer picture of the levels of neglect and abuse, as well as a potential influx of unwanted pets being abandoned. Since lockdown began there has been a huge demand for pets, with pet insurance providers seeing a % increase in people registering new animals as they look for company at home.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.“We’re trying to focus on the most serious incidents currently, but I’m more worried about what will happen when we come out of [lockdown] - about what the impact will be on animal welfare issues that we aren’t yet aware of, he explains.My concern is also that people take on an animal during lockdown, such as a dog, and then once it’s back to normal it could be an inconvenience and they will look to abandon them as they haven’t thought through the lelong commitment“We’ve also seen it in the past when we’ve had periods of recession when people can’t afford food or veterinary treatment.The first thing they can do is find a new home for the animal,they’re responsible, or turn them out. Its not the best time to introduce a dog to the house either.Lets hope at the very least, most new pet owners realise a dog is for le - not just for lockdown.To help the RSPCA keep rescuing animals and keep animal hospitals and centres running through these unprecedented times, please donate whatever you can spare at www.rspca.org.uk covid.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They want Dom’s head on a skewer.In the last  weeks, nothing exemplies The Blob better than its handling of Coronavirus, the non-epidemic which has been allowed to drag this country into destitution.A public inquiry will examine precisely how this country stumbled unprepared into a predictable - and predicted - health emergency.The blame game is already under way.But it is already clear the NHS bureaucracy was caught flat-footed.Along with its blundering sidekick, Public Health England, it failed to provide frontline health staff - and likely Covid victims with the protection they deserved.Under pressure, the NHS panicked and made the decision to clear all beds for incoming coronavirus victims - while disastrously shunting elderly infected patients into care homes.PHE, the vast qango whose mission goal is to protect the nation from pandemics, failed abysmally to provide the testing needed as a first line of defence.Neither of these two bodies thought fit to build the necessary stockpile of Personal Protection Equipment, leaving frontline medical staff exposed to the virus.Meanwhile, along came Bonking Boffin Neil Ferguson who created Lockdown panic with fantasy claims of half a million likely dead - a figure no other scientist has supported.Indeed, highly qualied professionals including a Nobel prize-winning Stanford Professor of Chemistry, Michael Levitt, insist NO lives were saved by lockdown.Sunetra Gupta, Oxford Professor of Theoretical Epidemiology, says the UK death rate from Coronavirus is -in-a-, with Lockdown an unnecessary “luxury”.“I think there’s a chance we might have done better by doing nothing at all,” she says.Prof Gupta echoes a growing view that Britain couldto normal tomorrow, opening pubs, nightclubs and festivals, without putting lives needlessly at risk.“It is very dangerous to talk about lockdown without recognising the enormous costs that it has on other vulnerable sectors in the population.“The truth is that lockdown is a luxury, and it’s a luxury that the middle classes are enjoying and higher income countries are enjoying at the expense of the poor, the vulnerable and less developed countries.“It’s a very serious crisis.”Prof Gupta is describing those Sun readers who will bear the brunt of the looming economic crash.It is fair to say that but for “experts” like Ferguson - who has a long and costly history of disastrous predictions - Lockdown would have been lted sooner and with less economic pain.It is also true that while most people - including me - stuck rigidly to Downing Street rules, countless thousands have broken them by leaving home and visiting relatives.Yes, Cummings and his we - both hit by Coronavirus - broke the letter of the Lockdown law by driving their -year-old son  miles north to self-isolation in Durham.In the same circumstances I would have done the same and so, I suspect, would many readers whatever their political views.Some will rightly insist our leaders should do as they preach.Others will be appalled by the curtain twitching informers who raced to spill the beans.To his credit - and now his cost - Dominic Cummings has never worried about upsetting his critics.He has given his many enemies, some inside the Tory Party, the perfect stick to beat him with.We should be careful before joining in this vendetta against a man who in his own unique way has spoken so effectively for the British people.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But Cummings is also a father. Parenting is a great leveller.No matter who you are, or how much power you yield, your child comes first.Haven’t we all felt that desperate panic at trying to juggle work and childcare That and being the right hand man to the Prime Minister in the middle of a pandemic, the most challenging situation this nation has faced since World War Two.As a mum-of-two author of What’s My Child Thinking , I also know that finding childcare for four-year-olds is not easy.They have strong opinions about who they will be left with and find it hard to be separated from their parents.By doing this Cummings had peace of mind that were he and his we to be both hospitalised with the disease, then their four-year-old would be taken care of.He looked tense, scared and panicked by the force of hatred against him.A firing squad looked like it would have been only a mildly easier option.But I wonderthe polarisation of this country is now so great that hatred has now blinded us to the fact that public figures are often parents too.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’m not.Eventhe enforcement is far from being perfect, it will still have a tremendous effect.According to the British Pub Association, four out of ten pubs are likely to cease to exist at the end of the crisis.Unlike many restaurants that can stay afloat selling takeaway food, pubs cannot generate income in lockdown.Anyone who says that short-term rationing of alcohol in pubs is not a price worth paying to get them to open up fast must have had one pint too many.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No, he hadn’t.“The country can see that and it’s shocked the Government cannot,” she added, before accusing the Prime Minister of “blind loyalty” to Cummings.Then she added, for good measure, that the country had reacted with “fury, contempt and anguish”.I suppose she thought she was speaking for the country with this tendentious, pompous bilge.She was not. She was speaking for herself and those in her North London liberal bubble.The BBC demands that its presenters remain neutral on political matters.Obviously, they don’t. But at least they usually pretend to. Maitlis can’t even manage that. Anyway, the complaints flooded in to Auntie.If this was the first time she’d crossed the line then maybe we might be a little lenient. But it’s not. Far from it.Last September, for example, she managed to force the BBC into that very rarest of things — a public apology, for her appalling behaviour and bias.In an interview she conducted on the programme she was, the BBC concluded, “sneering and bullying”, she was “too persistent and bullying” and “failed to be even-handed”.That was a landmark judgment. I have it framed on the wall of my downstairs khazi. Because the person she had been interviewing was ME.I had turned up to do a debate about Brexit. I was met with a wall of vituperation and abuse that even embarrassed the bloke I was supposed to be debating with, an affable Remainer chap called Tom Baldwin.The BBC warned Newsnight, its hopeless editor and Maitlis that such a breach of neutrality must not happen in the future.It has happened again. So what are they going to do about it  The BBC has admitted Newsnight got it terribly wrong.And will do nothing. Again.Here’s the other thing. I was sacked by the BBC for breaching its code of neutrality. Rightly.I had written an article about how much I hated fox hunting and fox hunters, right at the time the Government was planning to ban the cruel, obnoxious sport.The BBC was right then. But at least I hadn’t broadcast those views on the BBC itself, or allowed them to influence the programme I edited, the Today programme. It was just stuff I wrote in a leftie newspaper.Maitlis broadcasts her idiotic views on her programme!The BBC has to be consistent about this or drop the pretence of neutrality altogether.And for Emily — have some guts, woman.You want a  for your views  Go work for a radio station in the private sector, or get a newspaper column,you can.The BBC has, in the main, behaved well over Covid. But always with the exception of Newsnight.Always with the exception of Maitlis.IF you remember, just before lockdown, it was rumoured that the Spice Girls might get back together.There were gigs planned for next month.“Christ help us,” we all thought. And then we all got down on our knees and thanked Covid for scuppering that idea.Now, however, lockdown looks like it will be eased. Which means they might well fix some new dates. Yikes, etc.I suppose we could tell them the latest scientic news. Singing, apparently, is really bad for spreading the virus everywhere.Choirs and stuff have been banned in some countries. So we could try that line.But then I suppose Sporty and Co might well reply: “You could hardly call what we do singing.”DID you see those hacks questioning the Prime Minister’s adviser, Dominic Cummings on Monday One after another they all stepped up, wreathed in self-importance.And all asked exactly the same question. Over and over again. And therefore got exactly the same response.What the hell is the point of that Did they all think that they would be the only person to ask: “Why is it one law for you and one law for everyone , Mr Cummings ”Did they think they were dead clever coming up with that line Incredible. Thick as a plate of mince, some of us journos.GLORY, glory. Denmark is to open its borders once again.You can travel to the countryyou can prove that you’re dating someone Danish.In my case I think I’d choose one of the models Maja Krag or Terese Pagh Teglgaard – crazy names, crazy girls. I don’t know how I’d prove it to the Danish customs people.Maybe just show them a photoshopped picture of me and Maja out on the town.Anyway, that’syou WANT to visit Denmark.I went there once and was pretty underwhelmed. It was like a middle-class version of Lincolnshire.SO what exactly have YOU accomplished during lockdown A few jigsaw puzzles and watched the entirety of Netflix Listen to this. In  the Bubonic Plague struck London once again. Cambridge University was closed down.And so the young Isaac Newton was forced to leave his studies andhome to Grantham, Lincs, under lockdown.And during this spare time he invented the branch of mathematics known as calculus. And then he discovered the laws of gravity.Oh, and formulated a theory of light which dominated science for the next century and beyond. All done under lockdown.And what have I done  Put out the patio furniture and completed a giant jigsaw puzzle of my own face.Depressing, innit FUNNY, isn’t it, how most of the people screaming blue murder about Dominic Cummings were fervent anti-Brexiteers Cummings was the key architect of the Vote Leave campaign – and the Remoaners utterly loathe the bloke.Among the Remoaners screaming their little heads off are a bunch of Church of England bishops.These include Leeds Bishop “Nick” Baines, who has referred to the Prime Minister as a “liar” and a “bully”.No wonder the Church of England’s attendances have collapsed over the past  years.The Cof E is another institution that has lost its moral compass and is utterly out of step with the rest of the country.THE Chinese government is bullying Hong Kong once again.Thousands of armed police are on the streets, battling protesters.The row is over a new law which makes it a criminal offence to take the p*** out of the Chinese national anthem.Only a deeply insecure totalitarian state would create such a law.Meanwhile, the Chinese President, Xi Jinping, has told his people to “prepare for war”.I don’t know who against.I think Xi has finally understood that the rest of the world is sick to the back teeth of his foul, bullying, communist dictatorship.And once this Chinese pandemic is over we might be more inclined to stand up for ourselves.THE Home ­Secretary Priti Patel is determined to stop economic migrants flooding here from across the Channel.She wants new powers to send boats back to France.

More than a third said they would bring the majority of their furloughed workers back part-time from August.Mr Sunak has already announced that employers will be able to furlough staff part-time, but has yet to announce details of how this will work.Jonathan Geldart, boss of the IoD, said: The furlough scheme is protecting millions of jobs. Business leaders know that the Governments support cant be infinite, but the ugly truth is thattheres no money coming in the door, many firms will be forced to make dficult decisions come August.Directors will be fighting tooth and nail to avoid this scenario. There is hope that as more areas of the economyto work, more companies can keep people on board.However, despite best efforts, many firms simply wont be able to work at full capacity for the foreseeable future and theres no magic wand to lt demand back up again.The Government must soften the blow by introducing as much flexibility as possible into the furlough system. The more flexible the scheme is, the better firms can recover, and the fewer jobs will rely on state subsidy.With the prospect of job losses and businesses struggling to create new roles in the months ahead, the spotlight will be on our training system.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He also attempted to master Japanese during two seasons at League club Nagoya Grampus Eight.Gary explains why sticking to your mother tongue could be an own goal, both on and off the pitch . . .MASTERING a language is one of the most important things you can do.That became apparent to me when, on arriving in Spain, I decided to buy some furniture.Keen that my bedside cabinets had drawers, I asked the shop assistantthey had two tables “con cojones”.The poor woman burst out laughing and explained that in Spanish, drawers are “cajones” not “cojones” — I’d accidentally asked for two tables with testicles.I couldn’t speak a word of Spanish when I signed for Barcelona but I knew I needed to learn the lingo.I had realised that players at foreign clubs who immerse themselves in the culture do better on the pitch than those who don’t.I looked to greats such as Kevin Keegan, who learned German when he joined Hamburg, and Ray Wilkins, who mastered Italian at AC Milan.Then there were others — who I won’t name — who were lured abroad just for the bigger pay packet back in the day and barely lasted a season.I’d studied a small amount of French and German at school but I was so focused on becoming a footballer I didn’t put the effort in.I had a bit of a wake-up call over my lack of language skills on my first day of training.It’s a shock to the system being in a changing room full of blokes bantering and you have no idea what they are saying.Luckily, the team took me under their wing. On the bus to the training grounds Barcelona keeper Andoni Zubizarreta drew a stick man and woman and taught me all the body parts.To get a firmer grip on the language I avoided the ex-pat nightclubs out there and enrolled in a Spanish language class with my then we Michelle and my team-mate Mark Hughes.Poor Mark was only  and struggled with the classes. I think he dropped out after two or three but Michelle and I stuck with it.For two years, three times a week after training, we’d go to school to learn Spanish.It was tough at first as no English was allowed in the classroom, but looking back it did me a world of good.I started playing football when I was small and the skills came naturally. Learning a language was the opposite. It was really hard work and not something that came easily to me.So I made sure I read Spanish newspapers every day and watched the local TV stations. In two months I could get by. After six months I was getting pretty good and in a year I was speaking pretty much fluently.By the time I left in  I was thinking and dreaming in Spanish.From the get go, I made sure I did my post-match interviews in the local language.EvenI didn’t always make sense, it sent out a strong message to the club that I was there for the long haul.Being able to talk to fans gained me a lot of respect and appreciation when I was over there.And when a match goes badly, the pitch can be a really lonely place. But because I was able to speak to my team-mates, it helped me through some tough times.When I went to play for Nagoya Grampus Eight in  it was a whole other story.I took eight months of Japanese lessons before I went out there, and did classes there too. But it is a very dficult language, with a completely dferent alphabet.I learned enough to get by but I was nowhere near as good at Japanese as I was with Spanish.It’s been more than  years since I lived in Barcelona and I’ll admit my Spanish is a bit rusty.Nowadays when I go there I’ll try to speak the language but Spaniards always want to speak to me in English.So many foreigners speak English that it can seem a pointless exercise trying to pick up another tongue.As a nation, we are not great at learning a second language, we can rest on our laurels slightly.But I would argue that it’s more important now than ever to learn, and at the moment we’ve all got the time to spare.Having a second language opens up so many opportun­ities to you and your kids, whether that’s working abroad or in hospitality in the UK.Travel might be shut at the moment, but that won’t be the case for ever and you’ll be giving your family a leg-up during this downtime.Children’s brains are like sponges, they pick up languages so much faster and better when they are younger.And there are so many online tools and courses that I wish I’d had at my disposal when I was first learning.Although I’d always warn against online translation tools — they give a very literal translation which doesn’t always make sense.For example,you type “it’s raining cats and dogs” into Google Translate it won’t mean anything to a foreigner in their own language.Getting kids to do anything can be tricky, as I’m sure mums and dads who are homeschooling have realised by now.In my Celebrity Supply Teacher episode I teach counting to ten in Spanish by doing keepy-ups.Soyou make it fun, it opens up an exciting new world for youngsters which doesn’t involve sitting at a desk.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

with some truly dreadful results.During the pandemic, some stylists have even been flouting lockdown rules by secretly working from home.The Sun revealed earlier this month that hairdressers have been posting adverts on classied websites - like Gumtree and community app Nextdoor.But many stylists insisted they arent doing anything wrong as they are wearing masks and gloves.Some have been advertising their skills at discount prices in a bid to get business, even boasting of their training at award winning salons in Central London.A post on NextDoor advertised a Brazilian blow dry at half the cost in a salon.One hairdresser - who did not want to be named - told The Sun: “I have a home salon, and I don’t qualy to be furloughed so I have to make money somehow.“A few of my clients messaged me to askI was still open so I thought ‘why not ’.It comes as other shops are set to reopen on June  with strict social distancing regulations.These will include a ban on trying new clothes, make-up and testing products.Tough new social distancing measures also include hand sanitiser for staff and customers, quarantining of ed items and staggering times for click and collect orders."},{"url":null,"title":"primary school pupils return september minister","story":"A MINISTER has warned that most primary school pupils might notto class before September.Nick Gibb, minister for schools, admitted that it was dficult to say whether all children between  and  could head back to school before the summer holidays.Speaking at the education select committee yesterday, Mr Gibb claimed he could not say for certain when schools would reopen until the latest data on the transmission of the virus had been properly scrutinised.He warned that a full reopening of schools was based on a consistent reduction in the R rate - the reproduction number of the virus.He said: We don’t know until we see more evidence of the R effect continuing to reduce.Mr Gibb also said that remote education is likely to continue for the majority of pupils and young people probably until the end of the summer term.We do want young children to come back into schoolthe science indicates that its safe to do so, he added.Echoing education secretary Gavin Williamsons call for a cautious approach in reopening, Mr Gibb said the key was assuring that ing children to school does not result in an increase in the R factor.But many have been left confused as the government have yet failed to definitively confirm whether the phasedof the first three year groups will even go ahead on June .Asked by committee chair Robert Halfon MP why the reopening had been presented as a fait accompli, Mr Gibb responded that the reopening would be confirmed later today following a review of the R rate by the Scientic Advisory Group .The Prime Ministers announcement earlier this month that it was the governments ambition to reopen schools was initially met with a furious backlash from teaching unions and local councils.More than  councils claimed they would refuse to reopen on June , citing safety concerns, and would either advise against opening or leave the decision in the hands of headteachers.But Mr Gibb appeared optimistic when asked about a potential stand-off between Westminster and councils.He told the committee: I am confident the vast majority of local authorities are planning to open for Reception, Year  and Year  on June , and for young people in Year  and Year  to come back for part of the time for face-to-face teaching.Last night the Prime Minister said while he “would like to reopen schools before the summer holidays, the decision was dependent upon the R rate.It comes as education secretary Gavin Williamson admitted at Tuesdays press conference that only “small numbers” of children will head back to class when England reopens its schools.Official government guidance requires schools to reorganise buildings to allow a maximum of  children in class.Mr Williamson also said “nervous” parents will not be punishedthey keep their kids home.But he added that the Covid- crisis could last another year and schools must start gradually reopening to stop kids falling “tragically” behind.Primaries will be allowed to stay shut past June  onlythey have “practical problems” sorting out the new class size cap, he said.Mr Williamson went on: “When you see other countries around the world who are quite a number of weeks ahead of us in terms of bringing schools back, you see small numbers of pupils in school for the first few weeks.“And then that rapidly starts to increase when people realise how much their children are missing out by not being in school.”To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.But the government have insisted they are taking a cautious approach by only sending a few year groups back into schools from next week.Equally, Mr Williamson claims that -

I’m good at what I do.”Do  DO  I wasn’t aware, until this series started, that Joey DID anything, but it turns out he’s spent half a letime ­prepping for SAS: Who Dares Wins.For as well as being surprisingly likeable, the guy’s also insanely fit — to an extent that clearly tormented professional athlete Lauren Steadman and suggested Joey could’ve had an amazing military careerhe wasn’t, in the words of one SAS interrogator, “poncing about on TV telling everyone what he f***ing had for breakfast”.Apart from “the naughtiest blisters ever”, Joey had breezed through every section of the C show, until the finale when “escape and evasion” gave way to the interrogation phase that’s designed to “prepare the recruits for enemy capture”.Who the hell was going to want to capture Joey Essex, outside of the Celebrity First Dates booking office, wasn’t explained, and it doesn’t even do to ask such questions of SAS: WDW as the whole thing will unravelyou start pulling at those threads.It’s always best just to enjoy the entertainment, which involved giving Joey and the other five finalists the cover story that they were working for the Scottish Highland Mountain Rescue Board.The trouble with giving Joey a cover story, it emerged, was that it dislodged every other piece of information he’d ever learned from his brain.Key to surviving this task, as they’d all been instructed, was to drip-feed the truth back to “Dilksy”, the monstrous great slaphead who always appears at this point, and his fellow interrogators.Whether they locked him in a cage, dunked him in water or threatened to kiss him, though, Joey just kept denying everything and repeating the story.With the clock ticking, something had to give and eventually it did, after the entire SAS: WDW team had concluded, more in sorrow than anything : “He’s not even playing the village idiot, he’s trying hard not to be.”The end, when it finally came, was a bit of an anti-climax.Joey just sloped off, in a bit of a huff.Helen Skelton and Nikki Sanderson quickly followed and the winners were declared to be DJ Locksmith and Lauren Steadman.A worthy choice, even though some of us were still probably trying to work out how she made it through the drown-proofing task“no allowances are made”.If you take this show too seriously, though, you’ll miss the joy and point of SAS: WDW.It’s not offering contestants a fast-track into the SAS any more than Harry’s Heroes will form the spine of the next England squad.The reasons the show deserves to be put on a pedestal are its extraordinary entertainment value and the fact it’s proved, to my complete satisfaction, that Joey Essex isn’t putting anything on. He really is a total dingwad.Progress, people.GREAT TV lies and delusions of the month. The One Show, Alex Scott: “Here’s a good reason to stay inside – Joe Lycett’s all over our TV screens.”All Star Happy Hour, Jason Manford to Mo ­Gilligan: “I think you’re doing incredibly well.”This Morning, Phillip Schofield to Louise Gates: “We should say, this isn’t just some nonsense you’ve made up.”Though I’ll leave you to judge that one for ­yourself, by Louise’s caption: “Laughter yoga guru”.ACCORDING to the Gold channel, on Sunday night, “Some bright spark had the idea of asking Britain ‘who is Britain’s Greatest Comedy Character ’ ”You responded to the question by “voting in your thousands”.But Gold clearly disapproved of your choices, so Britain was overruled by a ten-strong “jury of comedy superbrains”, that included Marcus Brigstocke, Shappi Khorsandi and head judge Sally Phillips, who “couldn’t help noticing” the public’s shortlist was “predominantly white men”.I also couldn’t help noticing Gold’s  featured not one person who was Welsh, Northern Irish, Scottish or funny, but these omissions were lost on the ten who were too busy fretting about sexism and racism and denouncing Compo, from Last Of The Summer Wine, as “a pervert”.Three hours of chin-stroking later, I’m Alan Partridge star Sally announced their winner was . . . Alan Partridge.As a way of deciding Britain’s Greatest Comedy Character, it wasn’t ideal.As a way of demonstrating exactly why British television comedy has gone down the toilet, though, it was damn near perfect.TV GOLD: The Celebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins finale.Every incredible twist of BBC’s Arena: The Changin’ Times Of Ike White documentary.BBC’s Citizens Of Boomtown tribute to The Boomtown Rats.Britain’s Got Talent mentalist Lioz Shem Tov and the mad old walloper, Sandra-May Flowers, who performed Loving You more in the style of The Yorkshire Ripperton than Minnie Riperton.And Climbing Blind, on BBC, because eventhe point of clambering up the ft Old Man of Hoy is lost on you, the love story that made it possible won’t be.ON ITV’s hit-and-miss three-part series Harry’s Heroes, a group of overweight former football internationals – some recovering alcoholics and others ex-gambling addicts – toured Europe trying to work out why they’d never won a major football tournament for England.A total mystery to me as well, guys – and the anecdote about nearly severing Alan Shearer’s toe in a late-night drinking prank certainly shed no further light on the failure.The likes of Neil “Razor” Ruddock, Paul Merson, Matt Le Tissier and manager Harry Redknapp, though, seemed particularly aggrieved and confused about losing to Germany in , which was odd given hardly any of this squad were actually involved in the tournament.So, in an attempt to heal these old wounds, they weaved and bantered their merry way round Europe, playing random games of pub football, in a manner that made The Beatles’ Magical Mystery Tour look like the : bullet train from Tokyo to Nagoya.Along the way, Razor had to leave, at the start of the second instalment, to have a pacemaker fitted, former Welsh international Vinnie Jones played in goal for one game, Michael Owen vanished completely from episode three, like he was still playing for Newcastle United, and David Seaman wisely opted out of the match against some French nudists whose goal celebration pile-up was the very stuff of nightmares.There was also a confrontation between Merson and Razor about the latter’s drinking, and some clumsily staged discussions about addiction and mental health issues, which were robbed of their proper impact through TV’s endless, deadening, virtue-signalling obsession with these subjects.Far more moving was the sight of Paul Merson, clean and sober for the first time in years, gazing with fresh-eyed wonder at the majesty of the Efel Tower while gasping: “What’s the dference between this and the one in Blackpool, then ”Apart from the Efel Tower never hosting Aladdin, with Mooky and Mr Boo the clowns  Very little, Merse.Mike: “Noah.”Ben Shephard: “By what abbreviation is the magazine New Musical Express more commonly known ”Doreen: “NMS.”And Ben Shephard: “In what organ of the human body is the hippocampus located ”Mark: “Bum.”“Brain.” Though, in Mark’s case . . .ITV’s Martin Lewis broadcasting to the nation with two very provocative volumes of tossers’ bible Hip Hotelsin the background.Fleabag finishing above Fletcher from Porridge, on Britain’s Greatest Comedy ­Character.Labour Party PR show Have I Got News For You giving up all pretence of satire with the serious question: “Why have the Press got it in for Keir Starmer ”And Matthew Wright “casually” trying to impress This Morning viewers with the confession he’d broken lockdown, “to go fishing with one of my friends . . . Feargal Sharkey of The Undertones”.Matthew Wright, ladies and gentlemen.

So I read it out. Looking over those ten points today, what is terrying is that the government scores zero out of ten. Zero. Let me set them out here, and seeyou agree. . Devise, execute but also narrate clear strategy. . Show strong, clear, consistent leadership. . Have a strong centre. . Throw everything at it. . Use experts well. . Deploy strong team. . Make the big moments count. . Take the public with you. . Show genuine empathy for people affected by the crisis. . Give hope, but not  hope. Zero out of ten. I don’t think that is an exaggeration. Let’s go through them.On strategy , I don’t really even know what it is. For a while ‘stay home, protect the NHS, save lives’ seemed to be it, and to be fair, that was strongly communicated. But it is falling apart, not least because the man who helped devise the message didn’t think it applied to him. Leadership – OK, Boris Johnson was ill for a whilebut both before and since his illness, he has been ridiculously low profile for a national leader in a global crisis. He only showed himself on Monday to try to get the focus off Dominic Cummings. Strong centre – the centre has been weakened by austerity, and by the constant undermining of the civil service, led by Cummings. But also focus on a strong centre would have meant involving the devolved Administrations and regional Mayors from the word go. Number  felt they were beneath them, pushed them away, and it is one of the reasons we no longer have a UK wide strategy at all.  Throw Everything At It –they had done that, they would not still be talking day after day about ramping up, ramp up this, ramp up that. The only occasion on which they have thrown everything at anything has been the campaign to save Cummings since the weekend. Use experts well – they have used experts as political cover. The scientists were far too slow to realise the whole ‘led by the science’ mantra was part of that cover, and also a way of trying to sht blame when things went wrong. And have you noticed how two parts of the messaging have gone in recent days  - Stay at home. Led by the science. That is because the lockdown easing announced by Johnson was not led by the science at all but led by spin, trying to get Cummings off the front pages, and stop people focusing on the fact he didn’t stay home.  Deploy strong team – Rishi Sunak has had a good press, but mainly by not being quite as spectacularly second rate as the rest. And he shot a massive hole in his credibility by joining the nodding dog cut and paste operation in which minister after minister put out tweets saying, effectively, ‘Dom’s a good Dad, did the right thing, move on.’ But the quality of ministers has been exposed as awful. Raab. Hancock. Sharma. Patel. Williamson. Gove. Jenrick. Eustice. Has there ever been a lower quality Cabinet in our history  Make the big moments count – Well, Cummings gave us a big moment. Johnson gave us a couple too, in his big TV addresses to the nation. Both created confusion because of amateurish mixed messaging.

It could see healthy Brits forced to self-isolate at homethey have been in contact with a confirmed case. Call handlers will interview those in England who have tested positive and ask for details of anyone they have recently been near. Recent contacts who do not have symptoms will be called and asked to self-isolate at home for  days. Close contact is defined as being closer than metres to someone with symptoms for more than  minutes. Data will be analysed to decide whether workplaces, schools, housing estates or blocks of flats need to be locked down to quell local outbreaks. As the NHS test and trace app is not ready yet, all tracing will be performed manually. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: “As we move to the next stage of our fight against coronavirus, we will be able to replace national lockdowns with inidual isolation and,necessary, local action where there are outbreaks. “NHS Test and Trace will be vital to stopping the spread of the virus. It is how we will be able to protect our friends and family from infection, and protect our NHS. “This new system will help us keep this virus under control while carefully and safely lting the lockdown nationally.” The NHS has set up a new website nhs.uk coronavirus and launched a new dedicated phone number  for people to report symptoms and get tested. It comes after a series of hastily-arranged online briefings with journalists. It is understood the Government brought forward the launch amid the growing scandal surrounding Dominic Cummings breach of lockdown rules.  England has gone it alone before similar contact tracing networks are launched in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The NHS contact tracing app is thought to be weeks away from being ready for national roll-out. The original plan had been to launch the app alongside the , human contact tracers who will go live tomorrow It will use Bluetooth to detect mobile phones belonging to other app-users and noty the owner that they have been close to someone who has tested positive.

Baroness Dido Harding, the chair of the NHS Test and Trace Service, refused to give a date when the app would be ready. “This is a huge new public service that we are standing up,” she told a press briefing on Wednesday. “I’m sure there are stuff that we’re going to learn when we go live tomorrow. We will continue to test and learn over the next few days and weeks. “I fully expect there are things that we can do better as we aim to build an NHS Test and Trace Service that is world class. It’s not going to be world class on day one.” She added: “I see the app as the cherry on the cake, not the cake itself.” From Thursday anyone with symptoms in England will be able to access a testthey need one. Wales will follow from Saturday. The Government says it has the capacity to trace the contacts of , people who test positive each day.  Experts believe there are also around , new coronavirus infections daily. However there are thought to be around , people currently suffering with symptoms similar to Covid- but who do not have it. Rapid testing capacity will be crucial according to modelling by the Royal Society. Its Data Evaluation and Learning for Viral Epidemicscommittee found test track and trace would need to be carried out in three days to be effective. South Korea has averaged a two-to-three day turnaround. This includes a suspected case being tested, getting their results, being interviewed and having their contacts traced and also advised to self-isolate. Government testing tsar Prof John Newton confirmed the UK was aiming for this three-day turn around.  Prof Newton, Public Health England’s health improvement director, said: “Each inidual will have their risk assessed, which is why it’s quite a labour intensive process. “We are not doing for workplaces, for example, saying thatyou’re a teacher then anyone in that school is a ‘contact’. It’s going to be on inidual risk.” He said this should prevent “overreaction” and the “taking out of businesses” unncessarily. Someone will generally be deemed a “contact”they have been closer than one metre to a positive case, or between one and two metres away for at least  minutes. A new Joint Biosecurity Centre has been launched to work with local authorities to identy localised outbreaks. Mobile testing facilities could then be set up. Public Health England suggested in March regional lockdowns could be applied to towns and cities although this was not mentioned in the announcement. Hospital bosses have warned that local health officials have not been told how they fit in to the Government’s plan. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts, said: “We need to build local test and trace capacity and that is simply not going to be in place.” It is unclear how GPs, district nurses and other health professionals can access testing data about local outbreaks. It comes amid plans to reopen schools and more sectors of the economy from Monday. Worrying findings from a contact tracing study in Sheffield found two thirds of Covid- patients did not fully cooperate. Many involved were care professionals amid suspicions people not entitled to sick pay were less likely to self-isolate.

It is as simple as that. His actions were an insult to the millions of people across Britain who have sacriced so much during this pandemic. In recent months, families have been forced to make the most agonising of decisions. People have been unable to see loved ones. Grandparents have been denied the chance to hold newborn grandchildren. Some of the most vulnerable in society have had to isolate alone. In the most tragic circumstances, people haven’t been able to say goodbye at the funerals of friends or loved ones.  The lockdown has been dficult for us all. There is no denying that. We miss each other. But, people have obeyed the rules because they understand the importance of our shared common goal our national purpose. Stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. That’s why, when the revelations about Dominic Cummings’ behaviour broke over the weekend, people were angry. And during the endless hours of press conferences over the Bank Holiday weekend, people were looking for an apology, a resignation or a plausible explanation from Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings about what happened. None was forthcoming.  Instead, we got a very simple message: it is one rule for them, another rule for everybody . I share people’s frustrations, not just because of the actions of one adviser, but because this has become a national distraction at a moment of national crisis. This was the week when we should have been talking about how we ease the lockdown safely. How we restart our economy, support businesses, get more children back to school.  Instead, the Prime Minister’s unwillingness or inability to do the right thing has left the Government looking untrustworthy, unprincipled. And worst of all they have undermined the very public health advice that is necessary to keep us all safe, just to keep one powerful aide in his job. In times like this, we need good government. A government that we can trust. A government that is entirely focused on saving lives. So, I say to the Prime Minister: we cannot go on like this. We cannot lose another week to this farce. We need to get back on track. When I was elected leader of the Labour Party, I made a promise to the British people. That I would work constructively with the Government. Challenging them when I thought mistakes were being made, offering my support when that was the right thing to do. I stand by that promise.  That is why I will work constructively with the Government to help us through the next phase of this pandemic. The Prime Minister has promised a ‘world-beating’ test, track and trace system, when in fact what most people are looking for is a system that will work and will keep them safe. For Labour, that means rapidly increasing the amount of testing to at least a quarter of a million a day. It means recruiting an army of over , so-called ‘contract tracers’.And it means a nationwide phone app up and running by the  June, as we were previously promised.For the British people, it also means providing reassurance at time of huge anxiety. If you or a family member have symptoms, or you have been told to go into isolation, you want to know as soon as possible whether you have got this awful virus.No one should have to wait longer than is necessary for a test result. That’s why I am calling on the Prime Minister to introduce a ‘COVID Test Guarantee.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"mirror politics newsletter e mail","story":"NewsMirror Politics newsletter - the e-mail you need to navigate a crisis-hit UKWritten by the Mirrors Jason Beattie, our newsletter on politics helps guide you through the most turbulent times weve known in decadesShareCommentsByMirror :,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsSee through the spin with the Mirror Politics newsletter.

At least  Tory MPs have called for Mr Cummings to quit - including one minister who has resigned. As many as six cabinet ministers are thought to have privately told colleagues Mr Cummings should go. And eight members of Boris Johnsonaposs cabinet have yet to publicly defend or express support for Mr Cummings. The PMaposs top aide is under pressure to resign after the Mirror revealed he, his we and child had travelled  miles from his London home - while his we had coronavirus symptoms - to stay in a house owned by his parents in Durham. The government claimed Mr Cummings and his family isolated for  days while relatives brought him supplies. But he admitted he had left that house to go on a trip to Barnard Castle  miles away around the end of his -day isolation. At the time, Brits were advised not to drive long distances and to only take a walk, bike ride or cycleleaving the house for exercise. Boris Johnson defended Mr Cummingsapos breach of the advice to stay at home and not travel, especiallysuffering from the virus. He claimed the aide followed the instincts of every father and every parent… and I do not mark him down for that”. But a string of Tory backbenchers are now turning on the strategy chief, urging him to quit. Here are all the Tory MPs who are calling for Dominic Cummings to resign so far - and the ministers who have yet to back him in public. What are your thoughts on the controversy  Email webnews@mirror Cabinet ministers who have publicly backed Dominic CummingsBoris Johnson - Prime Minister Rishi Sunak - Chancellor Dominic Raab - Foreign Secretary Priti Patel - Home Secretary Michael Gove - Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Matt Hancock - Health Secretary Alok Sharma - Business Secretary Brandon Lewis - Northern Ireland Secretary Oliver Dowden - Culture Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan - International Development Secretary Amanda Milling - Minister without PortfolioAlso attends cabinet:Steve Barclay - Chief Secretary to the Treasury Jacob Rees Mogg - Leader of the House of Commons Mark Spencer - Chief Whip Suella Braverman - Attorney GeneralCabinet Ministers who do not appear to have publicly backed Dominic CummingsRobert Buckland - Justice Secretary Ben Wallace - Defence Secretary Liz Truss - Trade Secretary Therese Coffey - Work and Pensions Secretary George Eustice - Environment Secretary Alister Jack - Scotland Secretary Simon Hart - Wales Secretary Barones Evans of Bowes Park - Leader of the House of LordsMPs who have called for Dominic Cummings to resign Peter Aldous At a time when the Country must move on to the next stage of defeating Covid-, of getting back to work whilst ensuring that there is not a second peak, there must be no distraction from this challenge. The Government should recognise what families have gone through and what people are thinking and saying. It is thus important that Dominic Cummings should now stand down. Steve Baker Enough is enough. I and others saved him once before when he was driving Vote Leave to implosion. Not today. Dominic Cummings must go before he does any more harm to the UK, the Government, the Prime Minister, our institutions or the Conservative Party. Time is up. It is time for Dom to resign so Boris can govern within the conventions and norms which will see us through. It is time to get competing expert advice, decent software and better decisions, end the lockdown and start a long, hard recovery.  Harriet Baldwin     Former minister Harriett Baldwin said: While I have every human sympathy with Dominic Cummings, I think there is a higher bar for members of the Government. If the Government wants people to follow the public health advice in order to protect our NHS and save lives, then members of the Government giving that advice, including the Prime Ministeraposs adviser, need to follow it too. The Government relies on moral authority to receive the consent of the people to such draconian reductions in their freedoms. Therefore, for the sake of future adherence to public health guidelines, I believe he should resign. Peter Bone The Tory Brexiteer said Mr Cummings has to go because he broke the rules and has not apologised. Speaking on Nigel Farageaposs show on LBC, he said: When an adviser becomes the story, the adviser has to go. Boris Johnson can carry on without Dominic Cummingshe goes but it will be hardhe stays. Elliot Colburn The Conservative MP for Carshalton and Wallington, said he had written to the Prime Minister calling for Dominic Cummings to resign. In his letter to Boris Johnson, Mr Colburn wrote: I have received more emails on this than on any other issue since being elected - many hundreds of messages from concerned constituents - and I join them in that view. I feel it necessary to stress the importance of continued public trust and engagement with the measures being taken to overcome this crisis.At this critical time, as we start to relax some of the measures we have asked people to live with for many weeks now, we must ensure the public feel willing and able to continue social distancing and engage positively with those that continue to be in place to avoid a second spike. I fear this could undermine that effort. Damian Collins Dominic Cummings has a track record of believing that the rules don’t apply to him and treating the scrutiny that should come to anyone in a position of authority with contempt. The government would be better without him.  Philip Davies It is admirable of the Prime Minister to be loyal to his staff and to seek to defend and support those who work for him. Dominic Cummings should now repay that loyalty to the Prime Minister by resigning his position for the good of the Prime Minister, the government and the country. Jackie Doyle-Price     The Tory MP for Thurrock posted on her Facebook page. She said: I have received a number of representation regarding the behaviour of Dominic Cummings and thought I should state my position. The Government has been very clear in its message that we have had to Stay Home and Save lives. For some of us that instruction has come at great personal cost. Some people have lost their livelihoods. Some people have lost loved ones and been unable to say goodbye. In making real sacrices in order to obey the Government’ instructions it is quite understandable that there is anger that Government figures have not done the same. When a Government is tainted with a ‘do as I say, not as I do’ attitude to the public, it loses its moral authority. Sir Roger Gale While as a father and as a grandfather I fully appreciate Mr Cummings’ desire to protect his child. There cannot be one law for the Prime Minister’s staff and another for everyone . He has sent out completely the wrong message and his position is no longer tenable. Mark Garnier It is clear to me that despite his story, despite an element of politics in this, and despite his value to the government, his remaining in Number  now causes too many problems at multiple levels. For him to stay would be to reject the valiant efforts of millions of us all who have done what we can to squash this infection. His resignation is now the only way forward. ... The guidancesick is to stay at home – not any home, or someone ’s home, or even a second home. You must stay at you own home. He admitted to, firstly, going to Downing Street when he should have been self-isolating. He then, literally, packed his car with coronavirus and drove it to an area where there was relatively little infection. When he had recovered, he embarked on a bizarre road test of his ability to drive. This is in clear breach of the Highway Code rule and rule  . Aside from that, it was just plain dumb. James Gray Unless and until he can justy what he did, he should face the consequences of it and give up his role as a government adviser. Having him continuing at the heart of government undermines our credibility and the strength of our message.” Robert Goodwill Iaposve been contacted by over  constituents who, with one or two exceptions, have been critical of Mr Cummings and his statement yesterday has done nothing to convince them otherwise.I think that the best way for the Prime Minister, who Iaposm a massive fan of, to show heaposs in charge of the situation is to relieve himself of Mr Cummingsapos services. Stephen Hammond An e-mail he apparently wrote to a constituent states: It is clear that Mr Cummings has broken the guidelines which we all were instructed to follow. I find his explanation unconvincing. I am angry that so many have sacriced so much for public safety and yet this man has decided his interpretation of doing the right thing overrode the clear instruction of Stay at Home. His selfish act has undermined our, and my, efforts to keep Wimbledon safe. Mr Cummings should of course have resigned as any honourable person would have done and not put everyone  in this wholly invidious position. I cannot defend the indefensible and I have no intention of doing so. I have always tried to do the best thing for Wimbledon and it is now served by Mr Cummings leaving his role. Mark Harper In these circumstances, as an absolute minimum, an apology should have been made and level of regret expressed. I am disappointed Mr Cummings did neither. ... I would expect an adviser who had damaged the credibility of the Governmentaposs central message so badly and had become the story to consider their position. Mr Cummings should have offered to resign, and the Prime Minister should have accepted his resignation. Simon Hoare With the damage Mr Cummings is doing to the Government’s reputation he must consider his position. Lockdown has had its challenges for everyone. It’s his cavalier “I don’t care I’m cleverer than you” tone that infuriates people. He is now wounding the PM Govt  I don’t like that Andrew Jones The Harrogate Advertiser reported he wrote to constituents saying: “It seems clear to me that Mr Cummings has broken the guidelines which we were and are all expected to follow. For that reason I think that he should resign andhe does not do so then he should be dismissed.” Simon Jupp Although I believe his actions were motivated by a father’s desire to do what he felt was necessary to protect his family in exceptional circumstances,placed in the same situation I wouldn’t have made the same decisions and would have since considered my position. Tim Loughton Told the BBC the defence of Mr Cummings is deeply damaging and is seriously compromising the governmentaposs public health advice. Saying heaposs been swamped by e-mails he condemned Boris Johnson, telling the BBC: What I wanted to hear was a proper justication of why what Dominic Cummings did was fine. “I fear I didn’t get that and what’s more worrying is my constituents didn’t get that.” Paul Maynard He said he shared peopleaposs dismay at the response, adding: It is a classic case of aposdo as I say, not as I doapos - and it is not ashe was unfamiliar with guidance he himself helped draw up. It seems to me to be utterly indefensible and his position wholly untenable. Jason McCartney He said while it was important for people to show compassion during the crisis, Mr Cummings had to go because the perceived hypocrisy of the rule makers potentially threatens the success of any future measures under a second wave of the coronavirus. We must have confidence that we are doing the right things for the right reasons and that we are all truly in it together. For that reason I believe Mr Cummingsapos position is now untenable, Mr McCartney said in a Facebook post. Stephen Metcalfe Sir Bob Neill I am in the process of responding to everyone who has emailed me concerning Dominic Cummings. I have also posted a statement on my website setting out my views on why he should now step down from his post, a message I have passed on to colleagues in Govt. Caroline Nokes I made my views clear to my whip yesterday. There cannot be one rule for most of us and wriggle room for others. My inbox is rammed with very angry constituents and I do not blame them. They have made dficult sacrices over the course of the last  weeks. Mark Pawsey On the basis of what I heard, it is clear that while he believed he was acting within the letter of the law, he did the wrong thing and acted very much against the spirit of the lockdown rules. ... As such, I believe that it is wrong that Mr Cummings remains in an important post in Government. I had hoped he that would tender his resignation of his own accord. As he has failed to do so, I now believe it is right for the Prime Minister to ask for his resignation. This is a position that I have communicated to my colleagues within the Conservative Party and the Government. His letter to constituents Andrew Percy Laurence Robertson Indeed, like many others, I have found the rules to be personally heart-wrenching. On th May, my father died of Coronavirus and the pain and guilt of my being unable to visit him as he fought for his le will haunt me for the rest of my days. I wouldnapost wish this situation on anyone, but I know that many of my constituents have suffered in the same or similar ways. However we are fighting against a world-wide pandemic and really do need to be all in this together. I have, therefore, spent yesterday and today urging the Prime Minister and all those closely connected to him, to recognise the strength of feeling which exists on this issue and to dismiss Mr Cummings without further delay. For now, I will not be playing this matter out in public, but am working on the issue through the effective channels which exist. Douglas Ross I have constituents who didnapost get to say goodbye to loved ones, families who could not mourn together, people who didnapost visit sick relatives because they followed the guidance of the government. I cannot in good faith tell them they were all wrong and one senior advisor to the government was right. Alec Shelbrooke David Simmonds Whilst the facts of Mr Cummingsapos situation are disputed and there are ongoing investigations, it is important in my view not to engage in trial by media. However, I have conveyed the strength of feeling locally to relevant colleagues, and my own view, through the appropriate channels, that Mr Cummings should step down. I would of course welcome an independent investigation to establish the facts, something which any constituent finding themselves in dficulty would be entitled to ask for. John Stevenson Carlisle and the country have sacriced a lot over the last few weeks. People in positions of power have added responsibility-Mr Cummings holds such a position. Therefore in my view in the interests of the country Mr Cummings should resign. Bob Stewart On the face of it Mr Cummings seems to have been out of line to break lockdown instructions. Personally, I felt rather ashamed as the rest of us are all bidden to obey the rules and those directives appear to have been broken by him. Clearly there is some dispute... The truth is that, whether Mr Cummings broke or didnapost do the right thing, he certainly destroyed the spirit of the rules by what he did. It will make it very dficult for us, the rest of the population, to accept the largely voluntary restraints we have lived under for  weeks. I apologise for that because those rules remain in place and we should all still abide by them. I am afraid I believe his position is thus untenable. Julian Sturdy I donapost think this can go on much longer. It is damaging the Governmentaposs reputation. You canapost have one rule for Government advisers and one for everyone . His future does seem to look more and more untenable moving forward. The Prime Minister needs to clary Mr Cummingsapos position in a statement as soon as possible. Robert Syms The Poole MP tweeted: The Government has to explain test, track and trace and the next phase of lting lockdown next week. Whatever the merits of a Government adviser, they should never be the story or it detracts from the central message which is to get us out of this crisis. The adviser should go. Martin Vickers David Warburton Tory MP David Warburton said his own father died alone as a result of the coronavirus lockdown, and the Dominic Cummings story gives an impression of “double standards”. He told BBC Breakfast: “People have made sacrices... Instinct hasn’t really been part of it. He added: “Ideally,he broke the rules then he obviously should be subject to the same kind of consequences as anybody  who broke the rules... To me, enough is really enough, I think he’s damaging the Government and the country that he’s supposed to be serving.” Craig Whittaker I totally agree that Dominic Cummings position is untenable. Iaposm sure he took the decision in the best interests of his family but like every decision we take we also have to take responsibility for those decisions. You cannot advise the nation one thing then do the opposite. William Wragg We cannot throw away valuable public  political good will any longer. It’s humiliating  degrading to their office to see ministers put out agreed lines in defence of an advisor. This is a time of national emergency and our focus must be unrelenting. We owe it to the nation. Jeremy Wright Conservative former attorney general Jeremy Wright wrote on his website that it could be argued that Mr Cummings did not technically breach the lockdown laws, although he did call for further explanation. However, in determining what should happen now, technical compliance cannot be the only consideration, he continued. Our continued success in combating the virus may well rely on more of that and Mr Cummingsapos actions and his justication of them will, in my judgment, make it less likely that others will continue to interpret those exceptional circumstances clauses restrictively. This is more important than the position of any inidual in Downing Street and therefore, fairly or unfairly, I have concluded that it would be better for Mr Cummings to leave his position at Downing Street. Other senior figures calling for him to go Scottish Tory leader Jackson Carlaw MPs whoaposve voiced criticism but not explicitly called for him to go yet: David Amess The present controversy is a complete distraction from those efforts, and I am totally dissatisfied with the way in which the issue is being handled.There needs to be immediate action, and without going into the arguments for and against the Chief Adviser’s position, he should be suspended from his office whilst a full and thorough independent investigation is held. Lee Anderson I will not accept trial by media when a persons whole future is at stake.... I suspect there will be a few more twists to this story over the next few days and I reserve judgement until I have all the facts. We cannot have one rule for one and another rule for the rest of us. Cummings should have a chance to come back on this as it is clear that he travelled to another house to live with his family but it is not clearhe came into contact with other members of his family or been out and about as suggested. If its the latter then he should go. Tracey Crouch The ex-minister Tracey Crouch posted on Facebook: “I am not sure I have felt, in my ten years as an MP, so frustrated, cross, confused or impotent as I do now.” She added: “I have had to tell people they can’t go to funerals, say goodbye to the ones they love, see the family newborns that they will grow to love, visit the graves of parents, siblings or worse, children, and visit friends who are dying. “Should Dominic resign or be sacked  This is not for me to say and I don’t recall calling for anyone in any party to go over mistakes.” Ms Crouch continued: “I am pretty peed off though... [it] leaves a bitter taste in my mouth.” George Freeman Demanded a public apology, adding: I fear this Cummings lockdown truancy saga will mark the end of public trust in and respect for the calls for unity in sacrice from Downing Street. Which in turn will undermine virus control. Meaning an extended lockdown  more sacrice  suffering.

An existing light-up digital sign bearing the government slogan stay alert, control the virus, save lives was already in place in Bridport, Dorset. But a second sign was apparently attached to the same stand, allowing a carve-out for Boris Johnsonaposs embattled aide sometime on Tuesday afternoon - reading ...except Dominic Cummings. According to Bridport News, Highways England was alerted to the errant signage this morning - but had no idea who put it there, or indeed who owned the land it was on. They said the sign is not their asset, nor is it located on the A. A spokesman for Dorset Council said: We are using temporary road signs at the request of the Department for Transport to help remind people of their responsibilities during the Covid- pandemic. It seems that a local anonymous prankster has added their opinion to one of our signs in west Dorset. The additional homemade sign is unauthorised so it will be removed. West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner David Jamieson says officers are reporting people breaking lockdown rules and using special adviser Dominic Cummingsapos actions as an excuse. Meanwhile, the head of NHS Providers urged Boris Johnson to acknowledge that public trust and confidence in the social distancing measures have been dented in the last few days.And West Midlands Police Commissioner David Jamieson said lockdown breakers are using Dominic Cummings as an excuse to flout the rules, making it aposalmost impossibleapos for officers to do their job Mr Jamieson told BBC Radio aposs The World At One programme that people are telling officers thatit is okay for Cummings, it is okay for us and it looks like there is one rule for us and another rule for the people in No  Downing Street. He said: Now you canapost...the rules are flexible, and people seem to have interpreted them who are at the heart of Government, then it is almost impossible then for police officers to be able to carry out their job effectively.

Both are living alone.Born five decades apart, before the coronavirus crisis Sue Shelmerdine and Joelle’s paths might have been unlikely to cross.Conservative Leave voter Sue lives alone in Surrey, close to her two daughters and three grandchildren. Although she is , the former NHS worker has no plans to retire yet and works part-time in the haberdashery department at a fashion and home store. Joelle lives alone in London and works in the technology industry. She has two brothers who live nearby but most of her family is now abroad. The -year-old lived a busy, cosmopolitan le before lockdown but is now working from home.  Meanwhile, Sue has been furloughed but is desperate toto work. Introducing herself, Joelle says, “I have been so excited to meet someone new, someone dferent. “I like to connect with people I wouldn’t usually talk to, away from my own circle of friends. “I live alone and it has been dficult since lockdown. “I usually work in Central London and see so many people during my commute but the last few months have seen so many changes – especially not seeing family and friends.” Sue can relate to this. “I miss seeing my two children a lot,” she says. “But this pandemic has made my neighbours and I connect with each other. Nobody really knew one another before but we’ve started to get to know each other, especially when we’ve been coming out for the pm clap every Thursday.”  The pair have something  in common which is keeping them going – exercise. Sue says: “I moved into this house about two years ago and the garden has needed a lot of attention. So these last few weeks have been perfect for me to do some work in it. But I do go on my daily walks, which I love. I am very fond of walking but I miss my pilates classes, which I attend twice a week.” Joelle, who also enjoys going for walks, proudly tells Sue about joining online pilates classes, which she has signed up to during lockdown. The pair talk about the new skills they are learning, with Sue growing her own vegetables and continuing with her knitting while Joelle is keen to learn some new languages. Joelle laughs as she tells Sue about her disasters in her textile classes at school. She says: “I did break the sewing machine a few times in textiles, I even used to hide in the materials cupboard, so I didn’t have to take part.

Parents of asthmatic children who are shielding are being advised to call their GPthey are concerned about them ing to the classroom. Health charity Asthma UK says the reopening of schools is a worrying time for parents of an estimated , children with asthma and also staff with the condition. Dr Andy Whittamore, Asthma UK’s clinical lead and a practising GP, said: “If your child is shielding, then you should not send them back to school. People who are shielding are classed as “clinically extremely vulnerable” and will have been told to shield by their GP. If your child is not shielding but someone in your household is, then your child should notto school unless they are able to maintain a aposstringentapos social distance from the person that is shielding, according to government advice. It is worth remembering that parents in England will not be finedthey do not send their children back to school at this time.He added: Asthma doesn’t make you more likely to get coronavirus, but unfortunatelypeople with long-term lung conditions like asthma get coronavirus, it can be more severe. The news come after Boris Johnson announced that some primary schools will reopen on June  for reception, Years  and  and nurseries.They are currently only open to children of key workers and vulnerable youngsters.  Some schools and colleges may also be able to offer some face to face contact and support for year  and year  pupils. The charity is urging parents to ensure their childaposs school has an up-to-date copy of their asthma action plan and a named, in-date reliever inhaler and spacer. Children who will be taught by a dferent teacher should be made aware of their condition and what they should dothey experience symptoms. Asthma UK also says bosses should ensure social distancing is practised at all times.  Several councils have said they will not be reopening their schools on June  including Liverpool, Hartlepool, Birmingham, and even Tory-run Solihull and Essex. Some are looking at later dates, some are still waiting to see what will happen, and some are suggesting s may be part-time - despite the government saying this isnapost an option. Plans to open schools with new measures such as class sizes halved, no toys, staggered breaks and one-way corridors have ided many in the teaching profession.

We used treated timber for the structure at standard .m s which covered the desired area perfectly. This was sourced from BQ and Wickes hardware stores. We were very lucky to get what we needed before lockdown. The roof is a really simple but strong and safe structure.  My husband started by measuring out where the support posts would go, completed the frame attaching it securely to the brick wall and then proceeded with the roof. Again, carefully measuring where each beam would fit on the frame to ensure it matched the roof sheet measurements. The complete roof was sourced from roofingsuperstore they were extremely helpful over the telephone and provided us with everything we needed.

Schools Standards minister Nick Gibb told MPs that the cost of the scheme would be met by the Government over the break - which for many schools is this week - rather than just in term-time. Addressing a virtual Education Select Committee on Wednesday, Mr Gibb acknowledged the scheme had had a bumpy start with software issues, but he said it had delivered millions of pounds worth of food. Families eligible for free school mealsin England will continue to receive supermarket vouchers worth £ a week per child to buy food over the half-term while schools remain shut to most children. The decision comes after more than , people signed a petition urging the Government not to abandon children by taking away free lunches during half-term and the six-week summer holidays.The  Change.org petition was started by -year-old Christina Adane, from London, who is one of around . million pupils in England entitled to FSMs. She wrote: All kids have the right to get a decent lunch.On the news that the programme will be extended during the May half-term, Ms Adane said: Our voice has been heard. This really shows what we can achieve when we all campaign together. She added: Itaposs just a shame that this has only been properly confirmed today. The lack of clarity will almost certainly have meant that some children didnapost get the decent meal that was their right and some schools may not ultimately get the funding they need. Tulip Siddiq, Labouraposs shadow minister for children and early years, said announcing the plans in the middle of half-term was far too late. She said: Families have been extremely worried that they would not be able to feed their children properly this week as a result of the Governmentaposs initial reluctance. The fact that a petition of over , signatures was needed shows how much worry and confusion this has caused. Food poverty is sadly on the rise in this crisis. Free school meals are the only proper meal that some children get, so it is vital that they continue to be funded. James Bowen, director of policy at school leadersapos union NAHT, said: Whilst it is of course welcome news that the Government has now agreed to fund FSM over May half-term, it is not fair on school leaders, parents or pupils to make the announcement half-way through half-term itself. By leaving it so late to make arrangements the Government risks help not getting to those children that most need it.

Care home manager Dawn Esslemont said: You could see the emotion, and it was lovely to see that.The home is carrying out routine coronavirus testing of staff and residents, and so far none of the  people who live there have come down with the virus.Mrs Esslemont explained that visitors were asked to make sure they felt fully well and they were temperature-tested upon arrival, and that visits were by appointment only. They then go through a side gate into the garden of the home where they could see their relative while they maintain a two-metre gap, with the strict rule of no physical contact. Mrs Esslemont said: Because we have been so lucky not to have any coronavirus in the home - none of the residents have any symptoms - we have taken the small steps forward to make sure residents can have access to their relatives. Itaposs lovely for the residents to see them face-to-face, we have been working very hard trying to keep them in touch via phone, FaceTime and Zoom, but they are not the same. Thereaposs no hugs, kisses or touching as we have to be careful, we need to take little steps forward.

To ensure there is enough space, schools will generally allocate Monday Tuesday or Thursday Friday slots for half the pupils to attend - with a deep clean carried out on the Wednesday. One school, Greatfield Park, has ensured siblings attending will be given the same slot to aid parents, and pupils will have a ‘special friend’ who they will be grouped with. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, click here Children of key workers will continue to attend school each day and home learning will continue to be provided for pupils who will not be attending. Parents have been given a choice as to whether their child attends school so fines against parentsapos non-attendance have been waived by the government. Drop off and collection times will be staggered with queues and marked walkways for parents and pupils to follow. Greatfield Park has announced five minute increments for ious year groups to arrive.  Another local school, Kingsholm, is using timeslots based on surnames, with parents being asked to drop children off alone, without siblings or other children. At Kingsholm, pupils will be dropped off by parents in to pens that will be sectioned with barriers as they arrive. Later, a member of staff will take each group to their classroom. There is also a set route parents must follow through the school site, arriving and leaving by dferent entrances. According to headteacher Jan Buckland, the pens will be “roughly a quarter of the size of a netball court” and the barriers will consist of “bollards with a bit of ceiling tape around to designate the area, some cones and things”. Another school, Lydbrook, have banned pupils bringing bags as the cloakroom areas will not be used.  Break times Again, schools will be staggering times to ensure less cross-contamination. At Lydbrook, pupils will be allotted in to select ‘bubbles’ during school time to avoid cross-contamination between the pupils. These “groups will not be able to mingle” during break times. The school kitchen will also be closed, with pupils expected to bring their own meals. Pupils who are provided free school meals will be provided with supermarket vouchers on a weekly basis.  At Kingsholm, markings have been placed on the ground on the way towards the toilets so that pupils know how far away to stand from one another as they queue. They’ve added that toilets will regularly be cleaned throughout the day. Supply to their water fountains have been cut off with pupils expected to bring their own water to school, plus select sinks and toilet will not be ing. At Greatfield Park, breakfast and after school clubs have been cancelled, as is the case at Kingsholm. It has also not been decided yet whether hot or cold food will be provided during lunch time.  In the classroom Across the board, classrooms will be more spaced apart with one pupil per table. Kingsholm say pupils will be expected to use their own equipment. The amount of books shared will be reduced. Plus certain toys will be removed from the school to avoid cross-contamination. Greatfield Park and Lydrook have explicitly banned toys from being brought to school. Greatfield Park will also provide stationery. The Cheltenham school will be making moves to re-build social development that may have been reduced during lockdown. They will be doing this by introducing outdoor team building activities , in-class sessions where pupils discuss their experiences during quarantine and activities specically designed to rebuild relationships.  Otherwise, core subjects Maths and English will be focused on to ensure smooth transition as pupils progress to the next year of education. How will social distancing be enforced between the children  Schools have cautioned they cannot guarantee social distancing, however informative posters outlining the importance of social distancing will be plastered across the school walls. All schools across have said they will stress the importance of social distancing measures, although this may be more challenging to instill in younger children. Mrs Buckland, head of Kingsholm, said: “Talking about nursery children, we cannot guarantee at all social distancing but we will encourage. We will have adults who sit in places to steer children away from each other.”  She went on to say that pupils who do not follow socially distancing instructions on purpose will be sent home after a three strike rule has been deployed. “We will talk to the parents,a child is being [non-compliant] then what we will do is phone the parents and the parents will then have to come and collect them,” she said. What have parents been asked to do  Greatfield Park have requested parents strip children of all their clothes as soon as they get home and to make sure they wash. The action plan states: “I would strongly suggest that once your child arrives back home, they change their clothes immediately and the clothes they’ve worn at school are washed. Their shoes are removed at the door.” Simon Lusted, Head of Lybrook, has written to parents: “There is a requirement that clothes are washed and not worn the following day.” "},{"url":null,"title":"local lockdowns tackle flare ups","story":"NewsLocal lockdowns to tackle flare-ups will be a recipe for chaos, warns mayorAndy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, today blasted plans announced by Health Secretary Matt Hancock to introduce local lockdownscoronavirus infection rates rise in an areaShareCommentsByPat Hurst:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video matt-hancock-told-vicar-penalty-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news local-lockdowns-tackle-flare-ups-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Today Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, poured cold water on the idea, which was outlined yesterday by Health Secretary Matt Hancock.Labouraposs Mr Burnham branded it a recipe for chaos and said Boris Johnson and co need to regain a grip on the crisis.Strengthening a tracking and tracing system - set to expand from next Monday - is the key to doing it safely, he said. Local lockdowns would mean schools, businesses and workplaces would be shut in areas with high levels of infection. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, click here Mr Burnham, speaking at a weekly briefing to reporters, said: Again there has been minimal consultation with mayors, combined authorities, local authorities, about this policy. We are in the dark as to this policy even though it will have major impact on us and Iaposm afraid it follows a pattern on PPE, testing and now this. And it raises very real challenges with regard to the enforceability of any local lockdown and indeed the fairness of having one community locked down or even partially locked down, next door to another which is not and the tensions that may arise from a situation like that.  We hear talk today from ministers about parts of towns locked down. That seems to me to be a very challenging concept. This is a policy that causes me real concern and I struggle to understand how it can be effectively enforced. For me it feels fraught with dficulties. I would much have preferred there to be strong, testing, tracking, isolating arrangement in place before these policies were even put out there. If we rush into a localised lockdown policy then I think itaposs a recipe for chaos to be honest.  Mr Burnham said local lockdowns would represent a failure to properly track and trace people with the virus and the Government should focus instead in building public confidence in tracking and tracing.He also said the row over Dominic Cummings had undermined and weakened the governmentaposs public health message and focus.He added: If we carry on in a world of Westminster politicking then I think we are going to get ourselves into the wrong position.  Action needs to be taken to restore public trust and a line needs to be drawn.Latest figures for Greater Manchester showed a generally improving picture with  new cases of coronavirus with the regional R number remaining at . for the North West.A total of  deaths were reported in the last week, bringing the total to , overall in Greater Manchester.

Stores are expected to slash clothes and accessories by up to % in a bid to sht stock and get the tills ringing again. Analysts say there is up to £billion worth of stock in warehouses and shops. Thousands of shops, department stores and shopping centres can open from June , while outdoor markets and car showrooms will be allowed to open from next Monday as lockdown is eased. But the shopping world will look very dferent with many stores adopting checkouts behind screens, one-way systems and a limit on customer numbers. Changing rooms, seating areas and loos will all be off limits. Items will have to be tried on at home and then put in “quarantine” before they can be put back out for sale. Shoppers are also likely to have to use hand-sanitiser stations before entry. Businesses will only be able to open once they have completed a risk assessment, with regular spot checks. Clive Black, head analyst at Shore Capital said: “There will be the mother of all sales for the next few months.  It will be a real boom for bargain hunters.” But he added: “The shopping landscape will be completely dferent to the sales frenzy we have got used to.” The bonanza could last up to  months, Mr Black predicted.  Industry body the British Retail Consortium welcomed Prime Minister Boris Johnson ’s boost for the high street but said the shutdown was costing non-food stores £.bn a week. BRC boss Helen Dickinson said: “Even as shops begin to reopen, many retailers will still be in a fight for survival.” Open now Supermarkets, takeaway delivery food outlets, pharmacies, garden centres. June  Outdoor markets, car showrooms. June  Indoor markets, clothing and shoe shops, toy stores, bookshops, furniture shops, electronics stores, photography studios, tailors, auction houses, betting shops and charity shops.

All non-essential stores, from book shops to boutiques, given the all-clear to re-open are now working behind the scenes to get ready for customers for the first time in almost three months.  Marks  Spencer will launch its half-price Rainbow Sale, which has already started online. It is bringing in measures to ensure safe shopping when it fully opens  stores and  outlets. “It will be a dferent experience and more likely to one where shoppers have come to buy specic items rather than for a leisurely browse,” a spokesman said.  Next said it plans to reopen  of its  stores from June . Out-of-town stores with larger car parks will be first. Tills will have Perspex screens and there will be two-metre markers on floors to ensure social distancing.  Shoe shops like Clarks and Kurt Geiger will store footwear that has been tried on for  hours before it is back on display. Beauty stores will ban testers from make-up counters, while bed and sofa stores will keep furniture under plastic.

Virginia Giuffre, also known as Virginia Roberts, makes the damning allegations in a Netflix documentary which was released today.The series - called Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich - is to thrust the Duke of Yorkaposs friendship with the disgraced paedophile into the spotlight once more. It features serious allegations about the Queenaposs son, who has repeatedly denied he had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Ms Roberts. She has in the past alleged she had sex with the Duke in  after being trafficked to the UK by financier Epstein.  She alleges the Duke, father to Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, had sex with her on three separate occasions, including when she was  - a minor under US law. He denies this. Ms Roberts also alleges in the documentary she met the Duke in the London home of Epsteinaposs associate Ghislaine Maxwell. She told interviewers for the series: Ghislaine has this favourite guessing game that she does, she goes to Prince Andrew aposhow old do you think Virginia is apos And he said .  Sheaposs like, aposOh youaposre right!apos They made a little joke about it. He was like, aposmy daughters arenapost far from your age. My daughters are a little bit younger than you.apos A former employee of Epstein has also accused the Duke of frolicking in a pool with a topless Ms Roberts on a dferent occasion.Steve Scully alleges that Andrew and Ms Roberts were engaged in foreplay in the pool on Epsteinaposs private island in the Caribbean. Scully said: Jeffrey hung out with a lot of powerful and well known figures, both politically and financially and British royalty.  It was probably around  I saw Prince Andrew, he was at the pool, he was with, at that time, an unknown girl to me, she was young, she didnapost have any top on, they were engaged in foreplay, he was grabbing her and grinding against her. Mr Scully, who said he maintained Epsteinaposs telecommunications and data equipment on Little Saint James Island in the US Virgin Islands, added: You tell yourself that you didnapost know for sure and you never really saw anything but thataposs just all rationalisation. Jeffrey Epstein, he was a guy that concealed his deviance very well, but he didnapost conceal it that well.  Meanwhile, Ms Roberts has urged Andrew to come forward and be interviewed by FBI and US prosecutors about his friendship with Epstein, a convicted sex offender who committed suicide in jail while facing sex trafficking charges. US lawyer Geoffrey Berman, who is leading the Epstein inquiry, said in March: Contrary to Prince Andrewaposs very public offer to co-operate with our investigation into Epsteinaposs co-conspirators, an offer that was conveyed via press release, Prince Andrew has now completely shut the door on voluntary co-operation and our office is considering its options. The duke stepped down from royal duties last November following a disastrous Newsnight interview about his friendship with Epstein.  In the programme, Andrew responded to claims made by Ms Roberts that the night they allegedly had sex he was sweating heavily as they danced in Londonaposs Tramp nightclub. The duke said he did not recall meeting her and had a medical condition at the time, after suffering an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands War when he was shot at, that meant he did not sweat. Interviewed for the documentary, Ms Giuffre said about Andrew: This guy didnapost have any remorse at all. His arrogance about it, I mean the whole I donapost sweat thing, this guy was profusely sweating all over me. A spokeswoman for the lawyers representing the Duke of York said: As we have said many times before, the duke has absolutely no recollection of ever having met Virginia Roberts. In a statement released in November, the Duke said: It has become clear to me over the last few days that the circumstances relating to my former association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a major disruption to my family’s work and the valuable work going on in the many organisations and charities that I am proud to support.

It was deeply insulting. There was no apology for the behaviour of Dominic Cummings. There was no acknowledgement of the anger it caused and no acceptance that it had undermined the Government’s message at a crucial moment in the battle against coronavirus. Calls for an inquiry were swatted away with the arrogance of an oligarch bored of counting his money. The Prime Minister repeatedly claimed the allegations against Cummings were . When asked to substantiate this allegation he declined. Yet as this paper has accurately reported, Cummings did flout the lockdown restrictions, the police did speak to his family and he did make a trip, against the clear instructions, to Barnard Castle. When this defence failed, Mr Johnson resorted to the cheapest trick in the book by accusing anyone asking perfectly legitimate questions of playing party politics. Nobody is playing a game here. There is genuine concern that the public will lose faith in the lockdown measures which could result in a second spike and yet more deaths. On Thursday the Government will roll out its test and trace programme that will require hundreds of thousands of people to self-isolate for  days, whether they are infected or not. Mr Johnson was hesitant to say whether this was compulsory or not – it will, in fact, be voluntary – because he knows he can no longer tell the public what to do when his chief adviser is making the rules up as he goes along.

And despite their -year age gap, the coupleaposs romance has grown to true love, and they are now engaged after photographer Rachael got down on one knee with a very indecent proposal. She says they have a phenomenal sex le, and that their family and friends have accepted their relationship despite John being older than her grandmother. To pop the question, Rachael took John to a nightclub and ordered him an exotic dance, before joining the three naked performers on stage and asking him to marry her. Recalling her indecent proposal, Rachael, of Belle Vernon, Pennsylvania, USA, who met John three years ago when he employed her as a guard at the security firm he runs, said: “It’s quite a vulgar story. “It was not a traditional proposal by any stretch of the imagination. “We were with a bunch of friends at a strip club and I had ordered a ring online, which I had with me. I’m terrible at keeping secrets and was worried about ruining the surprise, so it was a bit spontaneous. “I arranged for him to have an exotic dance with three beautul dancers. He was sitting on the stage in front of a room full of people when, fully clothed, I joined the three naked dancers and proposed to him there and then. “I told him to get this out of his system because he would never have a naked woman dance for him again except me! “It’s definitely not the traditional way to do it. He had no choice and said yes straight away!”  Instantly attracted to John, despite him being  years older than her -year-old mother, and almost  years older than her -year-old dad, Rachael, who has a son, Levi, five, from a previous relationship, says they are soulmates. She insisted: “To us, age is just a number. He’s my soulmate and the love of my le. “I have no intention of being with anyone  even after he has gone. I know nobody could compare to him. It does put a dread on thingsyou think too far ahead, but I try not to. I have him now and I’m thankful for him. “We have an incredibly close relationship. It’s scarily close, we can both read even a slight change in mood in the other. “And we have a phenomenal sex le, too. Age has nothing to do with that, we are spontaneous and can’t keep our hands off each other.  “We rarely make it to the bedroom. Sometimes it will just happen outside, in the parking lots or in woods. When John interviewed Rachael for a job in December , the magnetism between them was immediate - although she did fear that getting involved with him might endanger her position. “I was like, ‘I want him’. It was his mannerisms, the way he carried himself. It was an instant attraction for the both of us,” she recalled. “I think we both knew how we felt straight away, but he was going through a orce at the time, so I didn’t want to rush things, or be the one to make the first move. “My son’s father is  years old, so age gaps have never been a problem for me, but I definitely had no clue that John was as old as he is.  “I thought he was in his late forties or early fties, because he does not look or act his age. And John was clearly unfazed by the fact his admirer was younger than his own son. “He made the first move and kissed me, said Rachael. It was a month after I was hired. He had been teaching me how to input a code into a digital box and as I went to walk out he grabbed me and pulled me in for a kiss. It felt like fireworks. It was amazing and I wanted him so much, but because of what he was going through at the time, I didn’t think it would happen. “It was like my dreams had come true. It was like that movie moment when the guy grabs the girl and leans her over for a kiss. “But I did then freak out because I was worried about getting fired.” Overcoming her fears, a week later the pair went on their first date to a local bar, where they realised how much they had in common.  “We have the same taste in music. We both like classic rock. He was into motorcycles and I absolutely love them. And we both have the same fashion style, she said. “We just kept talking and haven’t stopped since.” A month later, the pair officially became boyfriend and girlfriend, but kept the relationship quiet for two years until Johnaposs orce was finalised. Then they broke the news to John’s -year-old son and -year-old daughter,  who were simply pleased to see their dad happy. It was never an issue, I did not think it was weird at all. When I do see his children, we get along well, Rachael added. Being attracted to older men is nothing new for Rachael, who dated a man of  when she was just , while she started seeing Leviaposs dad when she was in her early s. She said: “Older men are more mature. Men at the age of  are still boys and I’ve never found them appealing. “They just don’t have it together. I’ve always been an old soul. I have myself together and know what I want from le, so I find it easier to connect to older guys. It drives me crazy when people say, aposDo you have daddy issues apos No I donapost, nor have I ever and I certainly wouldnapost look at my fiancé as a father figure for myself.  “At first, my family were not happy about me dating older men, but when I was , I told them I wasn’t going to date guys my own age as there was no attraction, so they accepted it. “When they met John, they were surprised because he doesn’t look his age. They were worried because he was much older than any other guy I’d dated, but once they got to know him, they really liked him and now we do things together as a family.” And, a week after her indecent proposal, Vietnam war veteran John showed he was an officer and a gentleman when - having already bought a ring with the same intention - he got down on one knee at Rachaelaposs favourite childhood haunt, Roundhill Park in Elizabeth, Pennsylvania,  and asked for her hand. “It was a ring I’d been looking at online and I’d showed him how pretty it was, even before we were dating and he had remembered, she said. It was a complete surprise and was the best thing. “We want to get married at Roundhill Park, too, hopefully on top of the hill. We’re not sure when it will happen now though, because of Covid-, so we’re enjoying the engagement. At the moment, Rachael is living in an apartment with her son, while John does up a home in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, for them to move into as a family. “My son is close to John and really looks up to him, she said. Levi has Attention Deficit Disorderand is mildly autistic, and John is great with him, really patient. He’s a really good role model.” Although the couple have been accepted by friends and family, they do get the odd comment from strangers, who assume Rachael is out with her father and that John is her son’s grandfather. “We don’t even listen to it, we just shrug it off,” Rachael said. Anyway, more often than not people tell us how good we look together.”  And the age gap has not hindered things in the bedroom either. Rachael laughed: I think he was quite old fashioned until he met me, but I’ve taught him a lot. “I’m learning from him every day in other ways, he’s learning from me and we’ll never stop. “We do have our dferences. He is stuck in his ways and I know he’s not going to change now. “We do have disagreements about some things – mostly old movies! He will be explaining them to me and I won’t know what he’s talking about. Rachaelaposs only fear about their age gap is that she will lose John too soon. She said: “I know he’s not going to live forever, which is something I worry about every day. “But all that aside, it’s so nice to be with someone older because they have their head together. He’s mature and has opened my eyes to new experiences. “It’s never got boring with us. He is considerate and tells me every day that he loves me.” Meanwhile, John, who as well as serving in the US army worked as a prison officer, before running his security firm, is devoted to Rachael. He said: “I was attracted by her demeanour, the way she carried herself. She was a fast learner and so easy to talk to.

Itaposs yet to catch on in the UK, but one man in the US persuaded his local branch to create one for him and he filmed his reaction to trying it.  Sam E. Goldberg has been using his spare time during lockdown to start a new YouTube series called Respect The Chain. Itaposs a comedic food show, in which the -year-old is currently trying aposspecial pandemic menu itemsapos from ious chain restaurants. The latest episode sees Sam, who is originally from New York, but is spending the pandemic with family in Florida, trying the unique Whopper. Sitting in a Burger King restaurant, he explains in the video: Did you know that the Burger King in Italy is currently offering whataposs called a Social Distancing Whopper   What theyaposre doing in Italy is they are giving you three times the amount of onions that they would normally put on a regular Whopper. He continued: What weaposre doing today is weaposre recreating this Social Distancing Whopper that they have in Italy. We asked them specically for three times the amount of onions on the Whopper.  Before tucking in, Sam admitted that he wasnapost really looking forward to tasting the burger. I have a very bad feeling. Itaposs probably going to taste very bad. Biting into it, he pulls a face, before saying that it has the most pungent taste heaposs ever experienced in his le.Speaking to , the Respect The Chain host spoke more about his decision to try the burger and gave us his official verdict on whether it could actually keep people away. He said: Currently [on the show] we are featuring the post pandemic reopening phase and were intrigued to try the Social Distancing Whopper from Burger King. We thought that it was a fun and innovative idea that hasn’t hit the states yet. We figured that we would aposguinea pigapos it for America.  There is no doubt in my mind that after eating the Social Distancing Whopper that others will stay at least six feet away maybe even  feet.

Having that sort of identity going forward.”Appere particularly impressed Connolly, with the -year-old ing from a loan spell at Broughty Athletic in the juniors like a new man.The young attacker has a terric first campaign with the Tangerines, scoring six goals in  appearances and capping it off with a call up in the Scotland U  squad.Connolly continued: “I don’t know what Louis did last summer.“He wasn’t at that level before that but in pre-season he came back, we did a run and he was flying.“In training he was holding people off, using his body.

That pushed me on to get back as fit as I could, as quick as I could.“The confidence was just sky high, the boys were flying and it was brilliant for me to get some fitness up and back into the team.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53251887-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53251887-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53251887-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53251887-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"dundee united ilmari niskanen transfer","story":"Dundee United are one of a number of clubs looking at Finnish winger Ilmari Niskanen, his club have confirmed.KuPS sporting director Jonne Lindblom believes the -year-old is on United’s radar but, as yet, there have been no talks between the parties.Tele Sport understands the Finnish champions want up to £, for U  international Niskanen, who played a huge role in leading his side to the title last season.Niskanen has a £, buyout clause in his contract but it is likely KuPS will trigger an extension before his current deal expires in December.The Tangerines may balk at the price amid a dficult coronavirus climate but Lindblom believes Niskanen is a player going places.He said: “I believe Ilmari is a player Dundee United have highlighted.“They have an interest in him but there is nothing more than that at this stage.“There has been no offers or discussions between the clubs as it stands.

Is there a story we can tell  We are an educational charity so we need to find what we can teach then look at locations and see what would work best, not just for us but the people who live there.#Talks on the project have been ongoing for almost a year and the feasibility study is to be launched early next month.But Sir Tim Smit, co-founder of the Eden Project and executive chairman of Eden Project International, was clear a future project in Dundee will be entirely its own and not a replica of the Cornwall site.“We don’t like copying ourselves,” he said.“What you’re not going to get is Eden Cornwall in Dundee.

Our strong advice to the Scottish public, who are not local to a beach, is to exercise locally and not to travel to the coast.#Scotland’s air temperature may be warming up but the sea temperature remains consistently chilly all year, jumping or falling into cold water or spending longer periods than normal submerged in the water can lead to, potentially fatal, cold water shock.”Coxswain Davie Orr from Aberdeen Leboat Station also said that despite people missing the coast, their volunteers are limited in what they are able to achieve without the help of the public.He said: #We understand that many people will have been missing trips to the coast and will be eager for a change of scene or activity. However, we are really asking the public for their help.#Our team of dedicated volunteers is always there to help but, in order to attend a shout, we must break physical distancing instructions, putting ourselves and our families at risk.#We also cannot be everywhere at once,we see a sudden increase in people visiting Aberdeen and other local beaches our volunteer run service could struggle to meet demand.#Therefore, we are asking people to still stay local, don’t drive to visit the coast,you’re a local then please stay aware of the inherent risks.#Michael Avril, Scotland’s water safety lead for the RNLI and chair of Water Safety Scotland added: #The Scottish public need to remember the following safety advice: Stay in familiar surroundings, follow Scottish Government advice of remaining within five miles of your home, don’t put yourself, your family and emergency services at risk by taking risks or assuming it ‘won’t happen to you’.#If you do see someone at risk call  and

They were keen to learn and kept me on my toes with a range of questions.#I am a qualied outdoor and first aid instructor and have been working with community and sports groups throughout Argyll and Bute and their enthusiasm and desire to develop skills to look after members of their community in the event of something going wrong never ceases to impress me.

Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

By adding night-scented plants and soft lighting, along with pale-coloured flowers and foliage that appear to glow in the fading light, your garden will become an enticing ‘room’ to sit in at the end of the day.White flowering plants # like big blooms of hydrangeas # have a lovely glow in the evening garden reflecting the last of the light which makes them appear brighter than other plants.  Pale blues and lilacs also look their best in fading light, so sea holly with its tiny blue flowers that sit in rosettes of silvery-grey bracts is a great addition.Bright foliage also creates an evening glow in the garden. Light-coloured, iegated and silver leaf plants reflect any available light. Lambs Earis a popular ground cover plant that has the most wonderful soft, furry, silver-grey leaves.  It’s fairly drought resistant so a good choice for a dry, sunny border.Many beautul flowers only produce scent at night and often have a stronger aroma than their daytime counterparts.  Fragrance is released from night-scented flowers as the heat of the day lingers into the evening.  Petunias may seem be a strange choice for a night garden, but they are night scented. Some smell during the day, but not to the same intensity of the night scent. Night Scented Stocks do just that and have a pastel colour flower palate.It’s best to plant scented night garden flowers where you’ll brush against them or come close to them. Try planting them around doors and paths.  If you are planting in pots make sure you arrange them round seating areas to provide a heady aroma or position them near doors and windows so that the fragrance drts inside.Even though planting the right night-flowering plants in the right place will give you stunning effects,you want to really enjoy your garden after dark, some form of garden lighting is essential.  Try not to floodlight your entire garden. Instead, pick out specic plants and trees to showcase. Up lighting, either set on spikes or recessed into the ground, showcases plants beautully at night.But it’s not just at night time you want your garden to look good so here are some tips for this month from the Royal Horticultural Society."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A big thank you to whoever has tidied up Ardrishaig Community Garden, mown the grass and repaired and painted the fences.Such a peaceful place to call into while out exercising.

Why was this not nipped in the bud  Is there an ongoing lack of management training and support Whatever the reasons, it has to stop now.Minard folk were surprised to find themselves in the papers, on television and on the radio this week. They deserve the attention, but communities across Argyll equally merit praise for their kindness and community spirit.Again, it comes as little surprise.That#s the way we do it in Argyll."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert spruced up and ready for tee off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMembers will come back # in good time # to a spruced up and tidy Glenralloch.Maintenance and improvement work has carried on at Tarbert Golf Club in line with current guidelines.The committee reports the course is in immaculate condition with  greenkeeper Graham Prentice on top of things.The greens were hollow-cored earlier in the year and are gradually filling in and some welcome heat and rainwill enhance the greens.Other #rainy day# jobs have been carried out by volunteer members, which has helped the overall appearance of the course.Club secretary John MacNab successfully applied for the small business grant.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves are a favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, thread-like leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general well-being is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.For fortnightly tips on getting the most out of your garden, whatever your age or ability, and information on how gardening can keep you healthy and feeling good visit www.thrive.org.uk get-involved keep-in-touch subscribe-to-gardening-clubThrive is the UK’s leading provider of social and therapeutic horticulture programmes using gardening to bring about positive changes in the lives of people living with disabilities, ill health or mental health issues, or who are isolated, disadvantaged or vulnerable."},{"url":null,"title":"argyll adventure saddles up for public support","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe owner of an Inveraray equine and outdoor activity centre is looking for customers# help as lockdown bites.It#s fair to say Andy Cameron could have had an easier start to running Argyll Adventure.The business has operated at Dalchenna Farm for two decades in its current format and -year-old Andy took over the reins at the end of .Argyll Adventure#s bread and butter is horse riding # trekking through the hills above Loch Fyne.

People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

inAugust.The First Minister revealed this will be a \"blended\" approach, far from normality for our nations youngsters, as part of a four-phase plan to ease the lockdown.But even this is reliant on two key factors -the scientic andmedical advice confirms it can be done in a way that will not disrupt efforts to control the virus andthere is sufficient PPE and other hygiene measures in place.Following Ms Sturgeons announcement in parliament, the Scottish Government published its strategic framework for the re-opening of schools.Here, well detailwhat parents need to know ahead of their childsto the classroom.When will schools re-open Schools in Scotland are set to re-open on August .This is earlier than planned for some schools - but the universal approach is being advised by the Scottish Government.Teachers are set toto the classroom by June to plan and prepare for the new blended model of learning.Some pupils set to start P or S may also receive some in-school experience in late June, to help ensure they are supported to make the next steps in their education.Critical childcare will continue until August to ensure the ongoing provision for key worker and vulnerable children.How will the blended model work Under this approach, children will have a mixture of in-school and in-home learning.According to the framework, this is reliant on consistent and easy-to-use in-home materials which are \"intended to support and complement, but not replicate\" in-school learning.To help disadvantaged pupils, a further poundm was announced to provide laptops and other technology for the home learning.However the document notes: \"No matter how well planned in-home learning is, it is not the same as having effective learning and teaching within the school environment, led by teachers.\"The blended model will be kept under constant review.How will pupils social distance For the first phase of re-opening, schools are being asked to assess the maximum numbers they can accommodate, with guidance including:Pupils being taught in smaller groupsThese groups will not be mixed, where practicableSeating positions will be re-organised to allow for m gaps between pupilsOutdoor space will be used moreThere will be staggered arrival and departure times, so parents will avoid congregating in playground areasBreaks will be staggered by class to avoid contact from dferent classesTeachers, rather than pupils, will move around classrooms where possibleThere will be enhanced hygiene practices across all schools, including additional cleaning,params: .pushExpanding the learning estateLocal authorities are being advised to look for ways they can maximise the capacity for pupils to benefit from in-school learning as much as possible.One such way they are doing this is through expanding the learning estate.This would mean seeingclassrooms could be made fromoutdoor space,libraries, community halls, leisure centres and conference centres.It might also include taking short-term leases of vacant business accommodation.Who will be prioritised for in-school learning As set out above, there is likely going to be a finite number of daily places for in-school learning.As a result, to support NHS capacity and other essential work, a priority will be given to the children of keyworkers - but this is only in circumstances where absolutely necessary with no other option for childcare within that household.The remaining allocation is to be distributed across all year groups to ensure every pupils benefits from in-school learning where possible, according to the framework.Local authorities are being advices to use their knowledge of local circumstances to prioritise any groups where need is greatest.Speaking in the Scottish Parliament on Thursday, the First Minister said: ldquoThese arrangements will not represent a completeto normality by August.ldquoBut we judge them to be the most sensible approach we can plan for at this stage.Later in the session, the First Minister said the Scottish Government wants to ensure pupils will be back at school ldquoin a way that allows them to be children.She added: ldquoNone of us relish the prospect of seeing kids, particularly young kids, socially distancing or be as aware of these risks as we will undoubtedly have to require them to be.ldquoTrying to get, for children in

Governments across the UK moved quickly to introduce business support schemes.I know, however, that many Scottish businesses, especially SMEs, have been frustrated with the level and speed of help provided, with some even seeking a judicial review of the Scottish Governmentrsquos policy.The frustration grew from the decision to initially block retailers with multiple outlets from applying for more than one grant ndash putting small chain businesses in Scotland at a competitive disadvantage.Following a backlash, Ministers relented, but businesses with multiple properties here are still only allowed to claim  per cent of the maximum support grant for subsequent properties.But with almost half a billion pounds of business support grant finance still not having been allocated, and the allocation of funds slowing down, Scottish Labour is demanding Ministers urgently reconsider this policy and offer businesses with more than one premises their additional grants in full.Given the widely predicted long-term economic damage likely to be caused by the pandemic, it will be vital that once the public health crisis is under control we dedicate the same urgency and intervention to repairing our economy.I want this to include a jobs guarantee scheme to help tackle the looming threat of unemployment, especially for young people.Further information about the advice and support available for businesses during the pandemic can be found at findbusinesssupport.gov.scot coronavirus-advice, while the governmentrsquos Covid- business helpline number is   ."},{"url":null,"title":"day-centre-receives-holyrood-recognition","story":"Harlawhill Day Centrersquos efforts during the coronavirus pandemic were highlighted by the countyrsquos MSP, Iain Gray.The facility had to close its doors on March  due to the global pandemic but Mr Gray felt it was important to recognise the efforts being made by staff and volunteers.The centre, on the townrsquos East Loan, has continued to offer a range of support to members during the pandemic, including organising socially distanced street celebrations outside membersrsquo homes to help mark VE Day and delivering special afternoon tea packages and other food and treats to help keep their spirits up during lockdown.Mr Gray, who lodged a motion at Holyrood highlighting the facility, told the Courier: ldquoHarlawhill Day Centre has always been a special place, very much at the heart of the community in Prestonpans.ldquoIt was a very sad day when it had to close its doors to members back in March.

Here are her words:In the past many couldnrsquot read or write and so our history was rolled into the mind and later unravelled when the wheels stopped rolling and the horses were roped for grazing.Cars and lorries may have replaced the old methods of transport, but the importance of our cultural tales remained the same.Stories for children were about joys and adventures of the fairy folk, goblins and broonies.As they grew older, moral messages were concealed in the stories to teach the young person about moral issues.Respecting the earth and all that lived on her made for some wonderful tales about animals and birds why the snakes see all, who painted the eaglesrsquo feather tips, does a blackbird feel a storm coming at the base of his beak Is it not wise to heed the warning of a dog who does not rise to happily welcome the arrival of its master Our lives revolved around such tales, and their inner meanings. The boy who cried wolf was forever with us do not lie!You see, forests hold more than trees and rocks will whisperyou have an ear to listen.Our entire lives were, and are, stories. In my culture we had a teller in every family.In her books about the lives of traditional travellers, and her personal experience of it, she does not overly romanticise it.It could be a hard le, and one often misunderstood or discriminated against, as indeed it still is.But the legacy of stories, told and re-told over campfires, in caravans and kitchens, passed down from generation to generation is a rich and priceless inheritance.I was honoured that she shared a tale with me, albeit online rather than face to face, as these times demand.I believe it is a tradition we should all honour and can learn from.And so here is the story she shared.It has a Tinkerrsquos Leap in it and, who knows, it could refer to the place so named in Woodhall Dean.I have tried as best I can to keep the resonance of Jessrsquos voice in the telling.So sit round your campfire, real or imagined, for Jessrsquos tale:The story I am going to tell is of the Earl of Hell. Aye well that is how folk called him. Irsquom told he was a relative of the famous Jeannie Gordon.Well, he was a handsome lad, and had a roving eye. He also had a knack of walking into trouble.Well one day he was accused of stealing something. He knew he would get no fair hearing in court, and sure enough he didnrsquot.Soon he found himself before a dour judge, who donned his black cap and pronounced that he will be hanged at the light of dawn.Now the Earl had already escaped death three times. Some say he had the blood of Red Ruth in his veins.This time it seemed, he had met his fate. But this young lad was not ready to meet his maker.The hangman did his deadly job but as the Earl fell through the trap door he began a dance at the end of the rope, in which he dislocated his shoulders, threw his legs up in a circle and managed to free himself.The jailers were aghast, and disbelief momentarily paralysed their responses.This gave the Earl time to scuffle to his feet and flee up the steps. No door was locked, for nobody had expected the need of it.The lad jumped onto a horse and rode at speed. His horsemanship was, of course, a skill honed from childhood and he rode to freedom.However, a guard was likewise a skilled rider and took chase after him.Perhaps the Earl eased up on his horse for a moment, believing he was well away, but soon the sound of galloping told him dferent. The guard was closing in.The Earl made his horse fly like the wind. He headed into the trees, hoping to lose his pursuer, but to no avail.The steep sided burn lay ahead. So he rode like the devil towards the precipice.But at the last moment his horse took understandable fright, and stalled, throwing him to the ground.As the Earl stood, his horse would have no more of it and fled.His pursuer now drew a sword that glinted in the morning sun as he charged perhaps after all the Earl of Hell would die in this dawn light.But his title was well earned.He turned towards the precipice and threw caution to the wind and leapt over the edge.The pursuing guard pulled up his horse and watched as the Earl flew over the ravine and landed like a cat on the other side.The guard fumbled for his pistol, but the Earl vanished into the thicket of the wood in moments.The location became known ever after as Tinkerrsquos Leap.And as for the Earl of Hell himself, he was seen again only through the misty visions of drunk men, and the eyes of his sweetheart who did not tell his story till long after he was dead."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-parents-need-know-school-reopen-date-confirmed","story":"The First Minister revealed this will be a \"blended\" approach, far from normality for our nations youngsters, as part of a four-phase plan to ease the lockdown.But even this is reliant on two key factors -the scientic andmedical advice confirms it can be done so in a way that will not distrupt efforts to controlthe virus andthere is sufficient PPE and other hygiene measures in place.Following her announcement in parliament, the Scottish Goevrnment published their strategic framework for the reopening of schools.Here, well detail out what parents need to know ahead of their childsto the classroom.Schools in Scotland are set to reopen on August .This is earlier than planned for some schools -

but this is only in circumstances where absolutely necessary with no other option for childcare within that household.The remaining allocation is to be distributed across all year groups to ensure every pupils benefits from in-school learning where possible, according to the framework.Local authorities are being advices to use their knowledge of local circumstances to prioritise any groups where need is greatest.Speaking in the Scottish Parliament on Thursday, the First Minister said: ldquoThese arrangements will not represent a completeto normality by August.ldquoBut we judge them to be the most sensible approach we can plan for at this stage.Later in the session, the First Minister said the Scottish Government wants to ensure pupils will be back at school ldquoin a way that allows them to be children.She added: ldquoNone of us relish the prospect of seeing kids, particularly young kids, socially distancing or be as aware of these risks as we will undoubtedly have to require them to be.ldquoTrying to get, for children in particular, as much normality as possible in the school environment is really important.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot underestimate the challenges of that but it is absolutely central to all of this careful planning that is underway."},{"url":null,"title":"can-pubs-reopen-glasgow-plan-ease-lockdown-revealed","story":"The four-phase plan will begin as of next week, with a number of measures being relaxed on May .More outdoor activity including sportsmeeting other households and the re-opening of recycling centres are among those being re-introduced at what is being described as Phase .But these areentirely dependent on dramatically reducing coronavirusin the country and successfully implementing a ldquoTest and Protect strategy.For those of us hankering for a leisurely drink in our local, the subject of ing to Scotlands pubs has been addressed in the route map.Current lockdown restrictions mean pubs and restaurants have been forced to close.The measures introduced yesterday also reveal that pubs will be forced to remain closed during Phase  -

IBM no more, as The Proclaimers might have put it.From cradle of manufacturing le to an industrial graveyard: between those two staging posts lies the story of Scotlandrsquos recent economic history. It is a tale well worth telling, not least because many a lesson lies within, and Margaret Shanklandrsquos slick, entertaining documentary was more than up to the job.With narration from Michelle Gomez , Silicon Glen: From Ships to Microchips cantered through the early history of IBM and how it came to arrive in Greenock. Basically, an American exec became pals with a former Glasgow Uni engineer turned MP the American told the Scotsman he was looking for a UK site for a new plant, and the rest was history. All very Local Hero.The Americans had landed and soon made their mark. Any documentary stands or falls on the quality of its contributors and use of archive. Shankland lucked out with the writer Andrew OrsquoHagan and the journalist Alf Young, formerly of this parish.Young did the economic analysis, OrsquoHagan supplied the lyricismMore impressive still were the former workers, or IBM-ers as they were called. They had been brought together in small groups, Nae Pasaran-style, to look back at their time at the plant.Together, they brought the old place roaring back to le. We heard in fascinating detail what it was like to work for ldquoBig Blue. The new, trendy, American ways of working, including calling managers by their first names and wearing ID badges. All the training you wanted, foreign travel, a chance to swap jobs and stay with the firm your entire working le.ldquoIBM transformed whole family lives, said Young. ldquoIt embraced the fact its workforce were important and were to be valued.The workers, or the ones shown here anyway, loved it. ldquoGod, says one, ldquoI sound like Irsquove been brainwashed.The only time the film threw shade on IBM was when it picked up on its refusal to negotiate with unions.There might have been more criticism,only to balance things out, and there was undue haste at the end when it came to wrapping up the story. Could nothing more have been done to keep the plant going  What part did the politicians of the day play, or fail to play Delving into the politics of the story might have led to a drier film, though. Given the other material to hand you could hardly fault Shanklandrsquos choices. I had not known about the connections between Stanley Kubrick and IBM, for instance. Kubrick, as we heard from a former assistant, was an early adopter of IBM computers. He bought one to do the accounts for The Shining. It cost pound, ndash a huge sum for the time.People thought the director was mad, but the computer did such an impressive job Kubrick hired it out to other productions and the thing paid for itself.The film also picked up on the connection between the power-crazed computer in : A Space Odyssey and IBM letters that precede IBM.Other pop culture references included the use of an early IBM machine in an episode of Mad Men. Sure enough, there was the exact clip of Peggy the young advertising executive, with the machine in the background. Details like that, which can take an age to root out and are only on screen for seconds, make such a dference in pepping up a film.Ditto the interview with the secretary of Len Deighton, another early adopter. His novel, Bomber, was the first composed on a ldquoword processor.The film closed as it began, on a rousing note. ldquoItrsquos sad to see the shipyards go as well, said one IBMer, ldquobut yoursquove got to move on.

The European Union has always said that we remain open on this matter.\"Any extension decision has to be taken by the Joint Committee before July  and must be accompanied by an agreement on a financial contribution by the United Kingdom.\"Responding to the letter, Mr Blackford said: \"Boris Johnson must finally put his responsibilities to jobs, living standards and the economy first and urgently agree the two-year extension on offer to the transition period.\"It would be madness to pile a Brexit crisis on top of the coronavirus crisis we already face with unemployment soaring, businesses shedding jobs, and many struggling to survive.\"Time is running out. There is just a month left to agree an extension to prevent the UK crashing out with a devastating bad deal or a catastrophic no-deal.The Highland MP added: \"If the Prime Minister fails to agree an extension, he will be responsible for every job lost, every income slashed, and every business that goes under as a result of his bad Brexit deal.:Why Ian Blackford isolated himself after -mile trip to Skye home during lockdown\"The SNP will continue to press for a long extension to protect Scotlands economy - but the only way to guarantee Scotlands interests and protect our place at the heart of Europe is to become an independent country.\"Layla Moran, the Lib Dem leadership candidate, urged Mr Johnson to \"put his pride aside\" and agree to an extension of the transition period.She said: \"The transition period was designed to give us time to secure a trade deal and make preparations for it to come into effect.\"That time has already, and understandably, been decimated by the Coronavirus response. This makes a dangerous No-Deal Brexit more likely at the end of the year, unless we extend the transition period.\"I am urging the Prime Minister to put his pride aside, tackle the crisis in front of him and take the extension hes being offered,\" added the Oxford MP.At the committee, Mr Frost confirmed Mr Johnson would take part in top-level talks next month on the UKs future trade relationship with the EU.\"The expectation on both sides is that these are done at leader level and, therefore, yes, the Prime Minister would attend.\"Mr Frost was speaking after the third round of talks with the EU on future trade relationships.Asked about the role of Dominic Cummings, the PMrsquos chief adviser, in the Brexit negotiations, Mr Frost said he had never been given any instruction by him.Conservative MP Peter Bone asked: \"Whats your relationship with Dominic Cummings, do you have to report to him  Because he seemed to say this weekend that he was the gatekeeper to the Prime Minister and he decided who spoke to the Prime Minister about what. I mean, are you more senior to him or do you have to go through him \"Mr Frost stressed he reported to Mr Johnson on the conduct of the negotiations and to the committee.:Fears over lsquotest and tracersquo with more than , missing tests over two weeks\"What I can say is Ive never had an instruction on these negotiations from Mr Cummings and I dont think he would expect to give me one. He regards me as responsible for the negotiations because the Prime Minister gave me that task.\"Britainrsquos chief negotiator dismissed a suggestion that the UK Governments Brexit policy could \"collapse\" without Mr Cummings involvement.\"The Brexit policy is set by the Prime Minister and by the committee, so Im quite confident that, whatever the arrangement for special advisers, can continue,\" he insisted.Mr Frost said the UK believed the EUs approach \"in key areas is not a mandate that is likely to produce an agreement that can be agreed with us\".He told MPs: \"If youre asking: do we think the EU needs to evolve its position to reach an agreement, yes, we do.\"Mr Gove, asked to estimate the number of additional customs declarations UK firms would have to make from January  , said work was continuing with the business sector to determine the exact number and the staff required to process them.Labours Hilary Benn, the committee Chairman, said he had asked Mr Gove how many of the additional , customs agents had been recruited with the minister replying by letter that it was ldquonot possible to put a number on it\".Pressed on this, Mr Gove said the Government \"stands behind the need to ensure we increase capacity\" before adding: \"We have seen more than , training courses being undertaken.\"On the fraught issue of fishing rights, Mr Frost said Mr Barnier had to work within the mandate given to him by member states with their \"unusual\" desire for the Common Fisheries Policy to continue.ldquoTo be fair, Mr Barnier has given a few public signals that he thinks this may not be a completely realistic position and well have to seethey can move forward on that. Clearly its not a runner for us.\"Later, the chief negotiator said it was the job of a \"good negotiator\", which he said Mr Barnier was, to \"assess reality and the genuine positions of the other side and a genuine ability to move\".Mr Frost added: \"If you dont assess reality in a cold way then you dont get agreements, and I would expect that hed be doing that, in fact Im sure he is.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11415639.jpg?type=article-full","title":"nasa-spacex-rocket-launch-visible-glasgow-tonight--","story":"UPDATE: THE LAUNCH HAS BEEN POSTPONED UNTIL SATURDAYThe launch will be the first manned flight to take off from American soil since  ndash with the world watching eagerly to see how astronauts Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley fair on their journey to the International Space Station .And the fortunate weather forecasts means we should hopefully be able to view it above us.:Anger from Glasgow residents as military plane performs figure of eights above city in early hoursThe SpaceX Falcon  rocket will lt off from the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida at around .pm EDT ndash around .pm UK time.The rocket should be visible over Scotland around  minutes later at around .-.pm. and Douglas Hurley\" alt\"HeraldScotland: Astronauts Robert Behnkenand Douglas Hurley\" class\"editor-image\"Astronauts Robert Behnkenand Douglas HurleyProvided there is not much cloud, some places in Scotland will be able to get some great views of the craft with the sky very light.MeteorWatch say the rocket will pass over the country from a westerly direction, heading east.:Coronavirus: Why Ian Blackford isolated himself after -mile trip to Skye home during lockdownThey say it should be visible for three to four minutes, adding:\"As the Spacecraft passes over the UK, we may see just the one or a collection of objects looking like bright stars moving across the sky.ldquoThe sky will be fairly light for some especially for observers in places in the north such as Scotland.ldquoThe craft should be bright enough to follow once you catch a glimpse of it.\"#Nasa is streaming the launch live on Nasa TV, which is available to watch on YouTube at: https:www.youtube watch vAymrnzianf"},{"url":null,"title":"scotland-bask-sunshine-hottest-days-year","story":"However, lockdown rules are still in force meaning we wont be able to freely frolic in the sunshine.In a prediction for Glasgow, The Met Office said Friday, Saturday and Sunday would see \"adry spell of weather with long bright or sunny spells\" with temperatures\"becoming very warm during the afternoons\".:State-owned ferry firm lsquothreatened Holyrood inquiry witness with legal actionrsquoLast week, PoliceScotlandsent officers to parks and beaches to move on sunbathers who were breaking social distancing regulations as temperatures soaredto C in parts of the country.Officers were seen at Glasgows Botanic Gardens and Portobello Beach in Edinburgh.Police Scotland told us it received several reports during the afternoon of Wednesday,  May, relating to crowds in the Botanic Gardens and Portobello beach.Officers \"engaged with members of the public\" and did not issue any fines.A spokeswoman for Police Scotland said: ldquoThe Scottish Governmentrsquos guidance is clear:people should only leave the house for very limited purposes, for example for basic necessities, such as food and medicine, for exercise, for medical needs or travelling for work which cannot be done at home.ldquoOur officers will continue to engage with the public, explain the legislation, encourage compliance and will use enforcement only when necessary."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11416522.jpg?type=article-full","title":"hero-renfrew-ferry-skipper-saved-womans-life-home-uist","story":"DonMacPhee wasted little timewhen he jumped in and pulled herto safety when her car crashed into the river at around pm today.The trained er, whohas worked on the ferry for around a year,managed to free the -year-old driverfrom the car and drag her out before it sank.:Rangers confirm permanent signing of Ianis Hagi on long term deal from Genk \" alt\"HeraldScotland: The car was pulled from the water this evening\" class\"editor-image\"The car was pulled from the water this eveningSpeaking to The Glasgow Times this evening, Don said: \"It was any normalday and we were headingto the Yoker slipwhen someone said there was a car coming down.\"I looked round and it was like something out of a TV commercial and there was a huge splash.

When so many people across the country have made such great sacrices in the prosecution of that war it is unacceptable that Dominic Cummings should be behave like this and not suffer any consequences.“Dominic Cummings’ behaviour – and the decision of the Prime Minister to support him – risks undermining public confidence in the messaging of government.  It is also clearly consuming time and energy in government that could be better spent on tackling the disease.“In all the circumstancesDominic Cummings will not resign then the Prime Minister should dismiss him.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

A Coronavirus Business Hardship Support Grant Scheme was launched earlier this month.The grant and loans schemes were created following engagement with local business representatives.During discussions with a broad range of business sectors, requests were made for the council to establish ways to ease the immediate pressure created by poor cash flow, with the curtailing of all trade in some sectors and severely limited trade in others.The council fund is intended to supplement rather than replace national support measures # and business applicants should first explore whether they are eligible for assistance from the schemes put in place by the Scottish and UK Governments.Before seeking a loan from OIC, businesses will need to have first applied for funding from the national Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme or the Coronavirus Bounce Back Loan Schemes.Councillor Graham Sinclair, chairman of the council’s Development and Infrastructure Committee, said: “We are very aware of the hardship many businesses are facing in these uncertain and challenging times.“I am pleased that the emergency loan scheme, as well as the hardship grant scheme, are now in place and open for applications.“Many local businesses are receiving assistance from the government support schemes – and these should be the first port of call for those affected by the economic effects of the crisis“But we know from our engagement with Orkney’s business sectors that the national schemes won’t help all businesses.“The new loan scheme offers a further option for those that have been unable to secure support where.“If your business is facing this situation I would encourage you to check online to seeit is eligible # and to get in touch with our economic development team or Business Gateway Orkneyyou are unsure or feel it doesn’t quite meet the criteria.”Standard loan terms are for a duration of up to six years, with an initial repayment holiday period of up to a year, followed by up to five years to repay the loan balance in full. Exceptionally, requests for a loan period of up to  years may be considered.Businesses can find guidance and check the criteria for funding here www.orkney.gov.uk CV-Loan-Guide and,eligible, apply online here www.orkney.gov.uk CV-LoanThose that are unsure about their eligibility should contact the Council’s economic development team for advice at economic.development@orkney.gov.ukcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

National media reports have suggested that Home Office staff cannot access paperwork held in offices due to inefficient home working procedures.Mr Carmichael said: “EU citizens make a massive positive impact in the Northern Isles and the coronavirus crisis has only made that impact clearer. The pandemic has demonstrated the vital contributions that workers from all over the world make in supporting our economy and keeping the NHS running under severe pressure.“The ongoing legal limbo for over two hundred EU citizens in the isles is unacceptable. Continued confusion and delay caused by administrative problems must be put right. Failing to do so puts people’s futures and lives clouded in uncertainty. They deserve better from a government that promised their right to remain.“This news comes in a week in which the government has seemed blind to the importance of immigrant workers in our health and social care sectors. I am glad that the Prime Minister backed down on plans to charge immigrants working in the NHS but it should never have come that far.

In Orkney, this currently stands at two and seven respectively.However, the Scottish Government and NHS Orkney have refused so far to confirm the number of people in each area that have been tested, partly on the basis of concerns around patient confidentiality.Mr McArthur said: “In the absence of a vaccine, any move away from lockdown needs to be backed up by a reliable regime of testing and tracing. We need to keep the virus in sight, so we can properly manage the risk.“If there are any issues in getting this set up, local areas need to know so that those problems can be raised and then fixed.“That is why it is essential that Ministers are as transparent as possible.  Being up front about the amount of testing taking place at a local health board level is a key part of achieving that transparency, keeping people informed and building public confidence.“Without knowing the extent of testing in Orkney, it is dficult to know what to make of the relatively low numbers of confirmed cases of COVID. That is a point I have been reinforcing with Scottish Ministers and NHS Orkney over recent weeks.“The First Minister has called for a ‘grown up’ conversation about how we take the dficult decisions in easing lockdown restrictions.  Grown up conversations, however, are founded on transparency and honesty. That is why we need to see detailed figures on a localised basis.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

One person usually does two or three days in a row at one site, then switches with another operator. “I’m quite confident operating on site alone as I’ve been in the role for a number of years now, but we are well supported and there is always someone at the end of a phonewe need any help. As occasional lone workers, we also have safeguards in place to ensure our safety.“As well as allowing me more time to keep on top of college work, which I’m finding harder now there is no face to face teaching, the single person policy also means we can be more flexible right across the dferent teams on the islands.   “For example,a number of colleagues need to self-isolate, there is now extra flexibility that can be called upon to cover these roles, so it’s good there is that resilience in place.   “I feel very grateful that I’m working for Scottish Water just now. I think we’ve been very well cared for and supported throughout the coronavirus pandemic.”    Sweyn, who joined Scottish Water eight months ago, said: “It’s been a really useful learning experience being on site by myself. This summer I will begin standby duties responding to alarms at our two water treatment sites on the mainland, so I think this time spent working the sites alone will help prepare me for those additional duties.  “I’m getting on with the routine stuff as usual andanything comes up that I need help with, I know there’s always someone at the end of the phone so I’ve got no hesitation calling them in that instance.    “It’s a really good team here, really supportive, which is great. If there have to be two people on site, then we make sure that social distancing is in place. With the implementation of these measures, we’ve been successful in producing the high-quality drinking water our customers expect while maintaining the safety of our team and others.”  Ross, who spends a lot of his time out at jobs requiring more than one person in attendance, has found the new measures harder to implement in some aspects of his role. He said: “It is things like ensuring you are keeping two metres apart when you are both digging a hole # you are so conscious of it but you’re also trying to get on and do your job so it has been a challenge.   “It hasn’t been an issue at all in terms of dealing with customers because we wear our gloves and our masks and make sure that we are well away from themwe need to speak to them, but it does make the physical aspects of our job more challenging.“I’ve been with Scottish Water for around nine months and my days can look completely dferent week to week. I can be heading out in the van to fix a burst or fit a connection, or it can be dealing with a choke on the sewer response side of things. That iety is one of the things that I was looking for: you are never bored, never stuck doing nothing. There’s always something to get on with.”  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

His house was so large that he could let the legislature use four rooms. He was one of the wealthiest men in the town but he was not the only successful Orcadian businessman there. About a quarter of the men who formed the first Winnipeg Board of Trade, in March , were Orcadians or the sons of Orcadians: John Inkster and his son Colin, William Drever, Robert Tait, James Clouston, William Flett and George Kennedy.Three of the Board of Trade members have had roads named after them: Bannatyne Avenue, Inkster Bouled and Tait Avenue. There are two more named after Orcadian settlers: Mowat Road after Edward Mowat from Orphir and Setter Street after Andrew Setter, or Seatter. It is no surprise that Orcadians played such a prominent part in the early le of Winnipeg because they were there right from the start: in the Red River Valley.All through the th Century Orkney men went to work for the Hudson’s Bay Company. At its peak, in ,  of the  employees were Orcadian. Most of them came home but a good number settled in the Red River Valley: the colony south of Lake Winnipeg founded by the Earl of Selkirk for Highlanders displaced by the Clearances. The HBC had granted the land on condition that their men could retire there.The colony struggled through its early years but things settled down after the union of the HBC with the North-West Company in . Shetland pioneer Issac Cowie wrote:And it was these Orkneymen, with other veterans of the fur trade…, coming in sufficient numbers to defend it, who made permanent the settlement of Red River.”…Douglas Hill, in The Opening of the Canadian West , described the birth of Winnipeg, within the Red River Settlement, when warehouses and stores were built near the HBC#s Upper Fort Garry.#The collection of ramshackle log or frame buildings, with one or two solid houses, was at first called McDermotville after its leading citizen, an Irish settler-turned-trader named Andrew McDermot, who with his son-in-law, A G B Bannatyne, erected Winnipeg#s first buildings. Soon the town#s shops were thriving, and challenging the Fort as the settlement#s focal point#In  the prairie path that had been graced with the name #Main Street# was properly surveyed, graded and furnished with one or two culverts . It was a symptom of the magnicent optimism that prevailed. Yet the optimists were justied: Winnipeg and Manitoba were on the threshold of great things.  vw, px\"  The full version of this article can be found on page  of this week’s edition of The Orcadian. Patricia Long is a local tour guide based in Stenness, with a particular interest in social and family history.

The guidance stresses the need for personal responsibility when travelling and this co-operation is vital as we work to provide a safe transport system that supports the people of Scotland.“The route map offers a path away from the current restrictions, but the virus is still with us,we move too quickly or without appropriate diligence, it could rapidly run out of control again. “The level of physical distancing required as we navigate the phases of the route map will affect the available capacity of public transport. Operators estimate capacity will be between  per cent and  per cent of normal availability even with full services resumed. “A system that previously had . million journeys per day will be signicantly constrained. So today, I am urging employers, operators and the public to embrace these changes and help us all adapt to a new environment which has flexible and remote working at its core, for the immediate future at least, flattens peak travel demand and has a strong focus on active travel.“We are looking to increase the frequency of public transport. But reducing the demand for transport is vitally important. We are urging employers to show leadership and be as flexible as possible to allow earlier or later starting and finishing times for those that have to travel to work.  “Over the coming weeks and working with our local authority partners, the transport transition plan will look to manage demand and increase availability of road space and priority for walking, cycling, wheeling and bus. “We have a real opportunity to secure a positive and lasting change, one which supports sustainable travel habits. I am therefore delighted to confirm that the ‘Spaces for People’ fund for local authorities has proven so popular that it is being increased to £ million.“We all have a personal responsibility to take steps to protect ourselves and others. It is vital that we continue to keep two metres physical distance wherever possible, wash hands regularly and maintain good cough hygiene.  “Even with the measures being put in place by transport operators, it may be dficult for people to maintain physical distancing throughout their journey in some forms of public transport. I know these are real concerns of the travelling public, operators and transport staff. For that reason, people should, and are expected to, wear face coverings as an additional measure when using public transport and as a consideration to staff and fellow passengers.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

a new and continuous cough or a high temperature # are being reminded to isolate themselves for seven days.Anyone  in a household where someone has symptoms should still isolate for  days.England says thank you, Boris. #You can now sunbath!#. Now, why does not Nicola change the dictate for Shetland  We would love to sunbath also, between the snow showers!!!!!😂😂😂😂How fortunate that the Scottish, Welsh and Irish leaders are maintaining their more sensible , balanced and wary approaches .Enlighten us Haydn, why is the infection rate lowerin England than in Wales and Scotland  I for one am not the least confused by the messages, just what is confusing you She niver agrees wIth what the rest off the UK IS DOINGBruce, you make it look asNicola, is acting like a Tory##..The Tory policy being##..me, me, me and melolSince you appear to not know, there has been confusion in Britain today about the actual meaning of BoJo’s statement yesterdayand , as I write, he is trying to explain himself away on TV. THAT shouldn’t be necessary should it  But, in true B J fashion he is resorting to make do and mend bluster. I am mindful of the blind leading the blind.Let decisions be made by scientists not ill equipped dabbling politicians.That little pat on the head should appeal to you !!But never mind Nicola is letting us out exercise twice a day. It is a shame we are all being channelled into the same crowded places, through the same gates and chokepoints whilst the wide-open spaces and beaches of Shetland are closed down to the majority!!In the present serious crisis she is in full agreement with Wales and Ireland but not with England. How fortunate that is.Britain is no longer ruled by England now that devolution has taken place. Boris Johnson claimed to be PM of 🇬🇧 Britain.He surely meant🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 not 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Scotland or 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿Wales.Westminster is reluctant to let goIt is extraordinary sad news from Care Homes and Care Workers, but not unexpected. It takes months of training and years of experience to Barrier nurse to prevent cross-infection. Even the use of PPE requires extensive training. Our most vulnerable people conjugated into crowded homes was an accident just waiting to happen. Hopefully, next time, our care workers will have extensive professional training cross infection control with qualications and wages to match. Our most vulnerable, not all be herded into care homes but perhaps into a chalet system where separation and quarantine would be so much more effective..What is the R rate for Shetland  Looks like zero The politicians # all of them can #go away# .Do your gardening, go fishing, go for a walk whenever and where ever you want. Get the kids back into school. Get our economy open and people back to work.This is my opinion.Dive, e , e # incoming!!!What do you want  A Country with a minimised death toll but teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, or a country that#s suffered a higher death toll, and while perhaps shaken somewhat financially, is still resilient enough to continue without any great undue hardship for the survivors.England at present seems to be trying to steer an admittedly somewhat shaky course towards the latter, the rest of the UK, unfortunately seem hell bent on taking the direct route straight to the former.You cannot sustain increased Governmental expenditure and decreased Governmental income for any longer than the very short term, it called burning the candle from both ends#. We#ve been doing it now for  weeks### Very soon the time will come when Governmental leaders will have to make decisions on how many deaths are acceptable collateral damage to allow them to provide the services the majority need and keep their country afloat. The longer they leave it to make that decision, the more rushed, and by consequence, less appropriate, it is likely to be.There is no vaccine, there is no #cure#. Unfortunately some are going to have to take a hit for the team.It’s unfortunate that three centuries of free-market capitalism hasn’t generated enough wealth to feed the country for more than three months without going bankrupt but don’t worry Michael. Many people share your concerns about the economy and the government is onto it:A confidential Treasury assessment of the coronavirus crisis leaked to Theargues that it will require measures including a two-year public sector pay freeze in order to “boost investor confidence# in the British economy. So, a round of grateful applause for the NHS Staff, Care Workers, Police and everyone at London Transport.I hope the nurses are enjoying all the clapping and rattling of pots and pans every Thursday because that is all they are going to get.It is reassuring to know that things really are ing to normal.At least a public sector pay freeze will not discriminate. It will apply equally across the board and affect everyone from care home cleaners on minimum wage to the head of health and social care at Labour controlled North Lanarkshire council, salary £,“Some are going to have to take a hit for the team.”Yes Michael, in more ways than one.Well put, Malcolm.Incidentally, there is no freeze on public sector wages. Typical nonsense and  information being leaked, another left-wingPR leak from socialist civil servant perhaps I think it was the the Argntine president when speaking about Covid  said, #you can recover from a drop in GDP, you cannot recover from death#Fernández makes a good point. The Argentine economy is taking a battering and so is our own but we need to see things in perspective:Last month, Morningstar ran an article about the likely effect of the Coronavirus lockdown on share idends to be paid out by U.K. companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.It set out four possible scenarios, best-case, worst-case, and two “realistic” estimates within that range. In the best-case scenario, overall idends fall % to £. billion, and in the worst they more than halve to £. billion.More recent comments in The Financial Times suggest that we are heading towards a midway point between the best-case and worst-case scenarios while Reuterswarned of a possible % drop in idends “ the situation continues to worsen.”If the economy can afford idend payments of £ billion during the lockdown, I suspect that it is strong enough to recover. Of course, the FT and Reuters are known to be simmering cesspits of socialist subversion, so possibly more fake news.p.s.For the avoidance of any unnecessary tantrums:“The Morning Star” is three words with two spaces whereas “Morningstar” is just one word with no spaces.The simple fact is unavoidable this virus is here to stay. One day we will all meet it. The single most important thing is to keep the numbers down, so ICUs are not swamped, learn the best therapies to reduce the death toll as much as is practical and research for treatments and a vaccine. Try and avoid peak outbreaks, especially in winter, when the flu   covid combination will be nasty. Isolate our most vulnerable, maybe for a very long time and leave people to chose. I am approaching  years old and have no intention of isolating forever. In due course, I will get this virus and take my chances. I would instead rather enjoy my time than clamber fearfully into a sterile hole forever!!! As for Sturgeons exercise twice a day, she can stick that where the sun does not shine. The simple fact is being fit is perhaps my and everyone best chance for survival, twice a day exercising and the rest of my time on my sweet derriere is stupid, just as Nicola#s latest dictates!!!Ian#s reply to Malcolm#s well reasoned contribution oddly fails to address it.Why I’m reminded of the proud mother watching her son taking part in the passing out parade at Sandhurst.She noticed that everyone was out of step apart from her son!Oh dear, did I just read #BO JO#s policy actually worked# Thats plainly pants, pure and simple.Briefly, to Michael#s point, it is only recently that we paid off our war debt to the USA, so some financial mechanisms will be found.But I think I heard Portugal went into lockdown straight after their first COVID  death, whereas the UK waited for over a hundred. Plainly things could have been very dferent, very much better, and acting quicker would have been far cheaper, with far less loss of le, and a quickerto a ing economy.But it would have also required people being put before profit right from the start.So it really had been business as usual from the bottom feeding disaster capitalists that run the UK.#BO JO#s policy actually worked# indeed.That would be laughableit wasn#t so tragic.Sadly without vaccines and anti-virals, it is that simple. The fact is it has only just started and will be with us until we are all immune or dead. Let us pray for the former and immunity by vaccination. To coin a cliche, it will be total isolation for the most vulnerable until herd immunity develops, as with every infectious viral disease in human history! Development of immunity and resistance is what will stopCovid  eventually, nothing , as withPolio, Smallpox, Measles, Herpes et alNo. We need to keep as many people alive as possible until vaccine is developed.People are not simply expendable.Effective PPE supplies and speed of sufficient testing is critical to this.The Tory led, Tory delayed UK response has been woeful on these.No scope for argument there.Thousands have died that need not have.No scope for argument there either.It has been an ideologically misled catastrophe. genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #But now that you point out about all those genetic iations, we probably ought to phone them and tell them to call of the hunt since they#ve probably not thought of that. Best just let nature take its course and get the economy on track with hundreds of thousands of deaths, a swamped NHS and a profoundly sick and worried population.Bo Jo#s policy was actually endorsed and followed to the letter by all the devolved Governments of the Uk until we got our knickers in a twist about a slogan. I never realised Nicola was a # bottom feeding disaster capitalists # for endorsing Bo Jo#s policy for so long. She only on Sunday became confused and what a fuss out that she made. On the bright side, we may legally exercise twice daily now, what outstanding leadership!Ian your unwavering faith in BoJo the clown, in the absence of any logical rationale or evidence for doing so, is truly astonishing.Robbie, I have no faith in any politician, but I do find Bo-Jo so much better than the other clowns in the circus. I love the way he routed the remoners, destroyed the Socialist horror of Corbyn and so antagonised, confounded and confused his opponents. Most are left with nothing by puerile and infantile comments to make, such as Bo-Jo the Clown. Is that Robbie the level of your wit and argument Again, Tory apologist spin from Tinkler. From mid-Jan through Feb Boris missed  COBRA meetings on COVID  to which Sturgeon was not invited.Yes the UK#s other parliaments fell into line once the Bullingdon Club realised there was to be no Britains Open for Business, herd-immunity-now approach. Elements of that thinking lingered on and are resurfacing now, not the least within the twisted outpouring of local eugenicists.Best information as of   .On that basis I think we need Nicola Sturgeon down here in England as well!Act in haste, repent at leisure seems to sum up such weakness.I am trying very hard toto see things from your perspective, but I cannot ignore the indicators and commentary that indicates that the UK economy will officially be in recession by the end of  Q.GDP has fallen by % in the first quarter of this year and predicted to be possibly as high as % in the second quarter.The Bank of England has tried to put a brave face on things by saying #the impact is likely to be temporary with activity rebounding strongly once social distancing measures are lted#. The question is when will social distancing be lted.Are you advocating that we just wait and see how things pan out, maybe the idea of a V shaped recovery will happen in the rd and th quarters, a vaccine will be developed in time and the world can go back to the #old normal#A simple warning from history # Recession , Depression, War.Recession, depression, war. Exactly. We know that the mortality rate is roughly .%. UK population is approx  million. Let#s say we just let the virus take its course, albeit slowed due to some adjustments to how we work and % of the population catch it. An effective treatment or vaccine is by no means guaranteed. % of  million is . million. .% of that is about , deaths. Then there are the hundreds of millions of working days lost to people off sick with the virus. Then there are the people suffering long term consequences of the virus and the cost of caring for them. How is this a recipe for a healthy economy  How will this level of death and suffering motivate investment or spending  Where does this assumption that we can just get going again like things were before come from  The world has changed. I know it feels good to bury our heads in the sand and think we can just go back to how things were and let a few old folks die. But that is profoundly naive. There is no simple answer. Except Mr. Tinkler#s. Make of that what you will.Ali asks: # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #I don#t know Ali.I#m not a dentist.To my understanding there does not need to be an exact genetic match for vaccines to be sufficiently helpful, but as I can#t trace my male line back over countless generations maybe Ali should consult a bard or a sage instead.There is, and has been, something of a medical research race on for understanding of transmission, for patient management treatment and for vaccines.Prompter action would have kept more folk alive longer whilst progress was made. The usual suspects are welcome to argue that and which way they may like, but it won#t change matters.There has been medical research and hard work for years into a reliable vaccine for corona viruses. How are they doing on that front  You don#t need to be a dentist to find that outYes Ali, but you do need to know the dference between a Virus and Venus, RNA and DNA, a vaccine and socialist vacillation, that is where humanists and left-wing ideologues come up a little short!!As I#m not a puller of teeth its a challenge to tell Ali how this virus dfers from the common cold, or why the research may be getting more funding and focus than the industry and government gave previously.You stated that you don’t need to be a dentist to find that out but, to be fair and reasonable about this , someone with medical training is likely to be better equipped than someone without to come up with insights which could be useful. In all probability Ian will not strike gold but how thankful we would behe did !!Fake news  Trump tried to buy Moussa and replace the old stone buildingswith a shiny new tower and Miss Sturgeon will use the proceeds to building a border wall.The deal came unstuck when China claimed Shetland as part of its North Sea and Atlantic territorial waters. It is understood that Miss Sturgeon has been learning Madrin while Scotlandis locked upOwen Jones has denied that he supports Identity politics, woke culture and he is not a social justice warrior.CNNhires Greta Thunberg to appear on a  as an expert on Covid .Best not to bother with why UK has biggest obesity problem in Europe. Such inquiry requires social science, some sociological imagination and a grain of empathy.Much easier to blame those poor plebs who haven#t got a grip.No need to invest on ending intergenerational deprivation and increasing opportunity too.Playgrounds for schools in poorer parts of our cities Why bother.Simples Peter, integrate #Care# for young and old into the NHS. That would include a voucher towards joining a gym or active participation sports club for every citizen irrespective of wealth. Those who chose not to use it, be it on their heads, it is their own health and wellbeing which will suffer. Covid  is ruthless with the obese and unfit,blame and empathy are not part le and death struggle of potentially fatal illness.Ian#s suggestion does nothing to end intergenerational deprivation, aka poverty. Poverty, and other social ills, can result in obesity in ious ways.Obesity simply is not automatically a #lestyle choice#.To suggest so is to indulge in inflammatory victim blaming and victim shaming.Not all single parents on benefits, depending also on whatever the Foodbank might provide, can easily promote healthy lestyles for all of their children.Many are struggling with issues beyond Ian#s limited appreciation.Seven year olds don#t generally make lestyle choices. Fat cells, once over produced in response to whatever unwelcome stimulus, don#t simply disappear. They hang around calling to be filled.Not all parents have time or money to afford Shetland Recreational Trust#s offerings.They dont all have the ability to get their children to the leisure facilities.It is only #simples#you take an uncaring and simplistic approach. Ian knows this intellectually as it has been pointed out more than once. Yet he persists. Odd. A little more fellow feeling might stem his approach.All I am suggesting Peter is an attempt to control excessive eating of Junk foodswith integrating our NHH with free access to all to a gym or active participation sports club for every citizen irrespective of wealth. Just how can that be #to indulge in inflammatory victim blaming and victim shaming. #Where are you getting your figures on childhood obesity in Shetland from Ian  Surely not from the newspaper article you’ve linked below, which is from  and quotes figures for adults from  If Ian imagines free education and access to the NHS has equalled le chances this is going to be a walk in the park.If Ian imagines the Welfare State to be thriving why so many Foodbanks  On another planet does not just describe Boris and Dodgy Dom today.There are also undernourished children in Shetland and across the UK, and parents going without in order that their children can eat. Ian might be interested to research the number of food banks before the era of Conservstive austerity and see how well the number has grown since. Quite an achievement for his #thriving welfare state#. Soon unemployment numbers will be thriving too thanks to the ghastly response to Covid  fromBoris and chumsThirty thousand deaths a year is a pre-covid figure we now have obesity as a % factor in covid  deaths!!If we were talking drug deaths running a food bank would be an offence. Perhaps that is a little tongue-in-cheek but this year obesity will be a factor in about , people dying prematurely. Surely about time for gyms, fitness and participant sports organisationsto be granted by integrated into the NHS with a free or subsidised entry for all.Sorry Peter, Boris and his chums were working with Nicola and her chums on Covid  . All in harmony which must be a first!Covid  was away with the fairies, another socialist ideal.!It is mildly reassuring that Ian Tinkler has #no faith in politicians# presumably including BoJo the Clown. This Government has bungled it#s handling of the Covid- crisis on an industrial scale. Exercise Cygnus in October  highlighted serious shortcomings in the UK#s Emergency Preparedness Resilience and Response Plan to a pandemic. Since then PPE stock levels were run down by %. Being made aware of the virus in December  no preparation was started until March when the herd immunity strategy was quickly jettisoned. Britain refused to participate in the EU procurement scheme for PPE leading to farcical attempts to obtain PPE from some guy in Turkey who made T shirts. Unsurprisingly the PPE was unusable. Rather than get ventilators from established manufacturers The Government ignored their offers of help and went to Tory donors like James Dyson who managed to produce  of the  needed. Flights bringing  people a day into the Uk without test or quarantine only stopped  months after lockdown. People being placed in care homes without being tested. Unbelievably lockdown is being eased in England without test track and trace being implemented. We have the second highest death total in the world.England does not have the highest number of deaths in Europe, and England has a far higher recovery rate than many in European nations.The Care homes in England have about half the death rate of their Scotish counterparts and the Death Rate per capita in England is considerably less than in Scotland. Just to keep you up to date, Nicola has just today,reversed her political decision on lockdown. The statistics are available online however, ferreting the Scotish records is problematic. For some reason, the SG is far less transparent with the Data than the English. Figures below are slightly out of date but show the comparison.The population of England. ,, No of deaths. , Death ratio. .So in summary, the gospel according to Ian Tinkler is that BoJo the clown hasn#t put his size  feet in it at all as the death rate is higher in Scotland than in England.Ian, I think your calculations are the wrong way round and show what you might call a #survival ratio# rather than a death ratio. There#s also a decimal place error but for the purposes of comparison that doesn#t really matter.If you work it out in deaths per million of population you can see that Scotland has a lower death rate.England:  from      per mPlease do not put words in my mouth Robbie. What is happening in Scotland is down to The SG and Nicola, as theFM and former Health Secretary. Trying to make political capital out of people dying is morally reprehensible, obnoxious and malign. Bo-Jo and Nicola have equal responsibility for any mistakes, they both shared and followed the best science they could. For once they were in harmony and agreement. The NHS was not overwhelmed, lives were saved, be thankful for that. Fortunately, the injection of disinfectant, we will leave to a real clown who is now mainlining hydroxychloroquine!!! Perhaps Darwinism will step in soon! God save America.Oh this is too funny to pass by! Mr Tinkler creates his own, entirely , Coronavirusfigures to make a political point and is immediately shot down. He then states that only an idiot would try to use coronavirus figures to make political points. Well, on that we totally agree # only an idiot would.Ray try and understand the dference between political comment and malicious point-scoring.ian seems to be using dferent measurement criteria between scotland and england and even dferent data within scottish figures. on  may he has scottish figure  but on  may it has gone up to .the lower figure is the one for deaths from positive test cases, the higher one is all deaths where covid is mentioned on death certicate.in his original calculation for england he uses positive test figuresthus for accurate comparison he should use the lower scottish figure also. this is what alan leask has done and produced an accurate comparison.The vaccine is focusing on a very small sequence in the S viral protein which enables it to bind to the ACE receptor on human cells in mucosal linings and infect them. There isn’t much room for mutation there without the virus losing its ability to bind to that receptor. Other mutations mentioned, in other parts of the virus, enable “strains” of virus to be tracked. Reproduction is subject to errorand billions upon billions of virus are being produced, so mutations will take place. However the critical site for immunity is probably conserved.I did read it Ian # that’s how I know it’s completely irrelevant. Now you’ve produced aarticle from ! So, just to be straight, your reasoning for easing the Coronavirus lockdown in  is a  year old newspaper article about obesity  I don’t think that’s the real reason is it now  Could it be that you’re putting your political prejudices first again  Not that it matters of course. Now even the FMs most recent slight adjustments to lockdown only allow five-mile car run to a place to exercise. That does not get a Glaswegian far from the centre of Glasgow. It just does exactly the worst thing, concentrates people together in highly populated areas. The counterargument regards spreading the virus into new areas is fallacious. Just in case our FM had not noticed, the virus has already disseminated widely and in the great outdoors of Scotland Social Distancing is a lot easier than in Glasgow or any other city.So, the death ratio in Scotland from Covid , according to the self-proclaimed STE expert is .. That, I believe, is patently incorrect, not to mention entirely absurd, and would mean that . people from  person had died from the disease. As an analogy, based on a notional teeth count,someone had, let’s say, ten teeth and subsequently had one removed then the ratio of teeth removed to those not having been removed would be  , or %. The “survival ratio”, as someone referred to, ie the teeth remaining, is the remainder as a proportion of the whole, in other words  out of , or %, assuming that the dentist extracts within remit. The two equations are not inter-changeable. This, however, from the statistical and other real experts acknowledged in their fields is very interesting: A good point and as always I appreciate a good dental analogy to illustrate the dference between death and survival rates. I know here we like to fight tooth and nail about such things, but it is good to see someone #filling in# the gaps here. And as for Mr. Tinkler, he certainly puts the effort in and even though we may disagree, it keeps things on here lively. He deserves a plaque.Michael Inkster, Try .Decimal point one, not  to  . Actually maths was wrong recalculation above. Simples absurdly so, evenmental arithmetic was a little rusty first time round!!Since it appears to be much more virulent and deadly than flu the future would seem to be less than rosy.In fact, depressingly gloomy and all the statistical information so diligently presented will be consignedto no more than being purely academic and capable of making not a scrap of dference.I am more intrigued into the sources of  major viruses having a global impact from China, and what is the Chinese Government doing about the health and safety of food products and the, apparent, lack of any proper procedures in which to prevent further outbreaks  What is the WHO doing in regards to monitoring potential infections from China and or limiting the movements of live animals in poorly developed hygiene conditions, allegedly We hear the origins of such viruses, but no information regarding preventative measures taking place to restrict and confine such health hazards within an area and to stop this from spreading further afield  Why has there been no ban on the sale and transport of certain foods from China Is the whole process of live animal meat production having to be totally reviewed by the Chinese government or is it a case of waiting until something even greater forces them to act Should we enforce our own standards of Health and Safety onto other countries in terms of a trade agreement or should market forces have a free for all without any restrictions, including Health and Safety  Should this be reviewed JOSEPH NIVEN has hit the nail squarely on the head. The statistics are not clearly put and blaming one UK politician, BoJo or Sturgeon is wrong. The SNP and Torie parties pretty much followed identical policies until last week.If Ian imagines free education has eliminated inequalities of opportunity he is mistaken.inequalities of opportunity frequently come down to ambition. The opportunities are there for all, not everybody wishes to take them.Sure good sound parentage and background help promote ambition, but the old adage you can take a horse to water but!!! If you wish to destroy ambition, try extreme socialism. The good old USSR and present-day Venezuela give good examples.I don#t know where to start with this statement Ian, and I#m not sure it will make any dference to youI do.There are multiple stories on just this very subject, but since you are not a big fan of the arts, you might not have read them, seen them or heard them.You can have ambition, and even a great education, but still be knocked back by the old boy network, or because you are not white or not male. These inequalities still exist.There are statistics to show that Eton boys get the top jobs still, and the only way to get a better leader for this country will be to do away with privilege and try to level the playing field. New Zealand for example have a great leader and it is refreshing to see someone lead who has her role on merit.I know nothing of the countries you mention but I am sure they still have ambitious and educated people despite your partisan viewpoint.Ian might as well say the poor are frequently to blame for their lot. Oil rich Norway does not tolerate UK levels of inequality.Neither do many other poprer countries.Quite what the USSR and Venesuala have got to do with it is likely apparent to Ian.Others will see their inclusion within what passes for his argument as a clear attempt at distraction. The possible impacts of being brought up in poverty by others who have had the same dficulties are many.The opportunities for such children are not easily compared to, say, those enjoyed by the young Boris Johnson.Ian is again indulging himself in victim blaming.UK policy has not set out to create level playing fields for socio-econmic participation. It should, but won#t for as long as #One Nation# English Conservatives like Boris Johnson continue to serve the interests of those of Ian Tinkler#s outlook over those of all. On th of May Ian described intergenerational deprivation as #relevant to Victorian times#.NY pretending ambition alone can help all children born into poverty to escape it Ian is demonstrating Victorian attitudes of his own. Seven year olds brought up in bedsits should choose better parental lestyles.I was unaware Thatcher, Blair, Cummings, Callahan, Wilson et all went to Eton. Mind you, Tony Ben, Sir Antony no less went to Westminster college!!!! Quite what that has to do #With the price of tea in China # rather like your former comments, escapes me!Johan, Ian#s not just a contrarian, compelled to rile others, but does so to share his quite unpleasant world-view. He talks of intergenerational deprivation as being a #very trendy left-wing academic hypothesis, relevant to Victorian times# but it#s a known fact that many a bairn raised in poverty, enjoying few opportinities will go on to live in poverty and have few opportunities. If they become parents, the likelihood of their bairns being able to do better lessens generation by generation without purposeful government action designed to level the playing field.The concept used here is social mobility and many governments globally take pains to increase it. Where those with disadvantageous starts in le go on, on average, to do better than their parents,social mobility is high. Where their lot is likely to be fixed at birth social mobility is low. Scotland has a long running research project to monitor it. In addition to the factors you cite, cards can also firmly stacked against children raised by semi-literate, or drug dependent parents, or in situations of domestic violence or sexual violence as well as other non-lestyle factors. Ian knows obesity can have complex causes, but doesn#t care.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"more vessels but aprils gross tonnage is well down on last year ","story":"Lerwick Harbour saw a big reduction in shipping tonnage during April compared with the same month last year – although the number of arrivals was actually up slightly.A total of  vessels called, compared with  in April , but the overall tonnage dropped from , to ,grt.The deficit was partly due to no cruise ships callinglast year, although ferries, live fish carriers and oil traffic were all also down considerably.The April arrivals this year included  fishing boats,  workboats tenders,  ro ro ferries,  live fish carriers, eight oil boats, eight tugs, five tankers, five ferries and three pilot boats.The fishing vessels comprised  Shetland,  British, three Danish, two French and one Norwegian boat.For the first four months of the year the overall number of arrivals at Lerwick holds up reasonably well with  – , as compared to , in .

The move is vital to secure a stronger future for the business which is urging politicians to support its drive to produce , hydrogen buses in the next four years.The  staff that remain would be more than a ten-fold increase in the number of employees inherited by the management team when it bought Wrightbus out of administration in October , with hopes to grow the workforce to , by the end of .“When we saved Wrightbus from administration last year, there were only about  employees, and since then we have grown the workforce to ,” said Mr Atwal.“The decision has been taken to trim the workforce to the size we believe we will need to see us through to the end of the year.”The redundancies are a necessary measure given the economic slowdown as a result of the current Coronavirus crisis. However, it has not altered the long-term vision of prosperity for the company.“Throughout the COVID- pandemic, while we furloughed a large section of the workforce, we also kept about  engineers, designers and sales staff working to make sure we can take future orders of buses and work on long-term projects, which will provide security and stability for Wrightbus in the coming years,” said Mr Atwal.The Wrightbus factory has created the world’s first hydrogen-electric double-decker bus, which emits only water and there is a great belief that in the coming years this will see a large number of orders come in.There are already strong sales for the delivery of buses in London and Aberdeen this year, with more cities due to follow suit.Mr Atwal said: “We see the future in zero-emission hydrogen and battery-electric transport and have positioned the business accordingly. Our vision is to have , people working for us by the end of  and we hope to be in a position to re-hire some of those who have been made redundant.“We believe green fuel is the future and will bring a brighter future to Northern Ireland over the coming years.”A consultation will begin with staff on Monday, May , and Wrightbus will be supporting staff throughout the process, eventhis has to be done virtually due to current Government guidelines.

The announcement by management is therefore profoundly regrettable.“Management plans to make redundant  employees and to bring forward a phased-process of reducing agency staffing affecting up to  workers.

Having grown up in the era when the river was dominated by the huge red brick edice of the Braidwater Mill, Rodney points out that its path is more exposed to public view than ever. “When you look back, it was pretty much enclosed space from McNinch Footbridge to Harryville Bridge.  “People had no reason to be in that area unless they were mill workers.“Nowadays we have great views right along this section and I personally feel that there has to be a joined up approach to making full use of this fantastic potential.“With the opening of the retail park it has now opened the area up to everyone and the nature and beauty around the river with wildle such as swans, ducks, otters, kingfishers and other wildle regularly seen on the stretch from Sainsbury’s down to Harryville bridge,” he said. But he acknowledges that not not everyone will see the beauty associated with the area. “There will always be some who will still treat it as a dumping ground and continue to put the wildle and the environment at risk by dumping their refuse into the river. “These people need to be told in no uncertain terms that this will not be lolerated by the local community - we have the ability to impose fines on those who continually flaunt regulations and I would call for such monetary penalties to be used more frequently.”But Rodney beleives the real driving force behind the naural rejuvenation of the area must comes as a united push.“ I feel that the authorities responsible for this area and the retail park owner have to take seriously the issues associated with this stretch of water and listen to the concerns of the community groups and members of the public who regularly use the pathways around the river for daily exercise.“My opinion is that things weren’t thought through properly at the outset and the environmental issues weren’t taken into account when the retail park was being planned. “The aim now should be to preserve the beauty of this stretch of the river Braid and that means taking steps to make sure this happens.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3138061.jpg--.jpg?1590480464000\n","title":"opinion moral necessity to support local business in post virus world","story":"By the Very Rev Dr Norman Hamilton OBEThese last weeks have seen contrasting trends as we battle with coronavirus.

This cemented his position as the worlds richest man with a fortune of well over pound billion. As they say – it is an ill wind that blows no one any good. PATTERNSThese changed patterns of le – evident community spirit and massively increased internet shopping – will bring big moral dilemmas when the pandemic is under control and some degree of normality s. Will community spirit be relegated to the back benches by the need for so many of us to rebuild the patterns of our own everyday lives  And crucially, will we have become so content with buying on-line and having the parcel delivered to our front door, that we will be less committed to buying locally, and supporting local business  I must confess to having real fears on both questions. When the focus moves away from carers and the NHS, what community need will fill the gap  It is very dficult to think of an example which affects every one of us, and to which we can bring such loyalty. And will the obvious convenience of having that parcel delivered to our front door be set aside to go shopping locally on a cold November morning or a wet February afternoon Personally I feel that it is a moral necessity to support our local businesses and shops as best we can – evenit costs a little more to do so. They of course will be well aware of the threat from the big international companies, and must play their part in quality of service and show the ‘personal touch’ that will make it attractive to do business with them in its own right. And there would be a great added bonus that such support on an ongoing basis would be a quite new and important expression of community spirit.I have absolutely no dficulty with the owner of Amazon seeing new opportunities to expand his business. But I have real dficultyordinary citizens like myself in our local area see it as acceptable to give his company so much of our limited income that many of the businesses in our neighbourhood go into serious decline. The Biblical command to ‘love your neighbour as yourself’ has a new and crucially important relevance.

Paul StaffordThere#s no doubt the salon is going to look and feel dferent. It will be a completely new experience, said Mr Stafford.What people probably don#t fully appreciate until now is the fact that hairdressing is not a service, it#s an experience and there#s a social connection there, a bond and friendships, and some of that might be lost when we reopen. He believes masks, gloves, a reduced menu and longer opening hours will all be part of our new normal.According to the National Hair and Beauty Federation, there are some , hairdressing salons here employing around , staff and generating around £m annually. This does not include self-employed mobile stylists.Our industry in Northern Ireland is up there with the best in world. I#m very proud with the levels of artistry here and what we need now is the whole industry to come together and make sure that we follow the right procedures and aren#t left threatened by people who challenge our businesses by doing things illegally, added Mr Stafford.We are quite efficient and work on a tight schedule but under new guidelines there will be literally no waiting time. It will be a case of making sure clients come in on time and are taken straight through, using an efficient system.At the outset we, personally, will be expanding hours, swapping our normal eight-hour day to  or  hours with staff working shts. That could see us opening from .am and closing at pm.We have a -seater salon and we will be reducing that to four compartments with visors and enough space between.Read More Belfast#s Crossen Engineering sees demand surge for new PPE visorPreparing for such scenarios at beauty-based salons here is manufacturer Crossen Engineering, which is already making visors for the NHS.It is starting to increase its lines to accommodate hair and beauty businesses in the run-up to reopening.We are beginning to see other industries order visors for when they reopen. Places like hospitality establishments, hairdressers and beauty salons, said managing director Paul Crossen.This is all hypothetical and all we can do is plan for every scenario, Mr Stafford is quick to point out.It#s not as simple as ticking all the boxes, this has to be put into practice and it could be a case that it#s just not working, it#s not efficient and that will be problematic.I have spoken to friends in Italy and Germany where there are restrictions and guidelines, but no one is monitoring them. The worst thing that could happen is another spike in October, so I would advise clients now to sit tight. Hair is very important but there is a bigger issue out there. Paul StaffordYes, your hair might look bad and I#ll tell youit looks bad, but stick a hat on, put your hair up, go for a walk and wait until it#s ready. To keep his clients# spirits up during lockdown, Mr Stafford has created a series of #The Virtual Chair# chats with local personalities on his Instagram page.It#s me having conversations with people like Colin Davidson, author Oliver Jeffers, musician Mickey Bradley from The Undertones and broadcaster Pamela Ballantine, he explained. They#re typical of the conversations we would haveI was cutting their hair, and that has brought a great community back together. We#ve had a bit of fun and it shows people that this is what they#re missing. It keeps the brand out there and lets our customers know we are there for them and we#re getting more and more people tuning in.We understand that hair is very important but there is a bigger issue out there this virus is killing people and there have been around  needless deaths here.

It may just be as good as two metres.If you then look at putting in additional guards such as face masks or a face shield, or even Perspex between workers, all these things could really help out and allow us to use the one-metre rule.We should talk about it and have things in place but I think until we have the evidence that one way is better than the other, we don#t want to go back to what it was like beforehand because we know that that was bad.

Minister Edwin Poots has suggested the Brexit deal could bring advantages to Northern Ireland, giving it access to both the UK market and the EU single market.But the DUP MLA said any potential advantages would be dependent on minimising new checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.“It has the potential to get right down to around % of commercial vehicles that are entering NI, and in that case that wouldn’t be particularly damaging to the economy,” he told the BBC.“We would have the advantage of actually having access to the single market and to the UK market, and make Northern Ireland an attractive place for inward investment.“So we need to be very sure that we can actually maximise that advantage, whilst at the other side minimising the disadvantage.”Ulster Unionist peer, Lord Empey responded by warning the DUP against making mistakes.The negotiations are not yet over and I would not be surprisedthe terms get worseLord Empey“The DUP led the local

Outside thinking is required!Another added: That is a disaster. No way I would cycle next to heavy traffic doing well over mph with no safety barrier. In any case, it doesn#t go anywhere. So much for the much vaunted new cycling strategy.Wesley Johnston, a commentator on Northern Ireland#s roads and motorways, said the cycle lane has remained unchanged for  years but understood many of the comments as the lane was laughably inadequate.The cycle lane is the bit on the left and the bit on the right is the strip that ides it from the main road, Mr Johnston explained.There#s a lot of people who seem to think it#s a two-way cycle lane which it#s not. There#s another one of these on the other side of the carriageway.It#s not new. It#s been there in that form for about  years and in some form since  when the Sydenham Bypass first opened. All they have done is resurfaced it and put the cycle lane down exactly the way it was before. In that sense the reaction to it is a bit of an overreaction.Having said that, people#s expectations of what a cycle lane should be are a good bit higher than that cycle lane. It#s not a good cycle lane to use and it#s not a good piece of cycling infrastructure.Mr Johnston added the resurfacing works would have been a good time to install a crash barrier, but said it would have been a much more expensive project.I think what DfI have done here is put a picture up which contains a laughably inadequate cycle lane and now everybody is ridiculing them for it, he continued. I think that#s fair because it#s not a good piece of cycling infrastructure, it#s not safe and you wouldn#t send your kid along there.A DfI spokesperson said: The resurfacing scheme was carried out for safety reasons, to ensure the integrity of the strategic road network. The resurfacing of the cycle lane is not yet completed - there#s still green surfacing to be applied at the accesses and further cycle mots are to be marked out. In cycling terms, this does not change the provision that was previously in place this does not mean, however, that this will remain unchanged in the longer term as Minster Mallon has clearly stated her intention to take further action to improve the attractiveness of our cycling infrastructure, including through designs and approaches that give more of us the confidence to cycle more often.

The former Ballinderry Chairman is Ulster GAAs Head of Operations, but has been called onto the GAAs Covid- Advisory Group, chaired by Chairman of Health and Safety group Shay Bannon. “Our work is less than two weeks old,” McGeehan told the County Derry Post, of the group that reports directly to President John Horan and Director General Tom Ryan. “We are there to provide advice and make recommendations. In terms of the decisions, they will be made by the GAAs management committee. googletag.cmd.push “Our remit is a short and sharp piece of work to develop protocols of how and on what basis,it is possible, will it be possible toto training, playing and eventually watching games again.” Professor Mary Horgan, a professor in infectious diseases, has been added to the group. She has previously been advising other world governing bodies of sport. “Her role is crucial in helping voluntary bodies like the GAA,” McGeehan feels. “All of this needs to be medically driven, whether is it is public health advice from the governments or the research around the vaccines and all that might be required in the future.” googletag.cmd.push The committee have, as McGeehan terms it, the easy job, with GAA management having the final call. An initial plan of inter-county action in October and club pencilled in for mid-July, was based on a cut back version. Footballs Tier  championship, the Super s and the qualiers were likely to be shelved, as were the group stages in the hurling championship. In terms of Derry, the senior hurlers had qualied for the NHL promotion play-off. It was initially hoped that games involving relegation and promotion couldve been pencilled into the overall plan, in a bid to provide a clean slate for . “There is no play-book to this and I dont think anyone knowsany of the league games could be played,” was McGeehans opinion on the situation. “At the minute, the focus is on whether activity willat all and what it would require to bring that activity back. No formal decision has been made on the league or the championship.” He also has sympathy for Antrim and Armagh footballers who worked themselves into promising league positions. “That decision will be taken very carefully and on the basis of what space there is. As the weeks go on, I think it becomes less likely that there will be room for them, but I wouldnt rule them out completely.” In terms of club activity, counties have been working away to come up with plans that could be activated once there is a green light. It is likely that club leagues will be scrapped with,there is any action, a series of warm-up games ahead of a knock-out championship. “It would be very important for a lead-in period,” McGeehan feels. “You would want to give club players time to get collective training under their belt, to get them out. Given the timescale, there mightnt be room for many league games. “The window is a moving piste, in that the GAA talked about October and November . In theory, the inter-county programme,bumped into December and into January would allow the clubs a bit more time.” For McGeehan, getting clubs – who he heaped praise onto for their efforts in communities- up and running first is a must. IDEAL “An ideal situation for me would be to get guidance and clarity, to get started back with club football and hurling getting a sizeable window before the inter-county starts back. “Everybody is mad to get out, but only when it is safe to do so. From a safety point of view, it is not about risk elimination, it is about risk reduction.” If the pandemic continues, it could force long term change. In McGeehans opinion, any measures put in place by the GAA may continue into  and beyond. “I think club activity ing is hugely important,” he feels, not just for sporting reasons, There is a a growing epidemic of mental health issues. There are issues over social isolation. I think the first resumption of activity needs to happen at a local level,that is possible.” McGeehan points out the change of language by the government. “Terms such as permanent pandemic surveillance, that type of vocabulary. We are going to have to adjust our lives for Covid- or other strains of a disease like this for the foreseeable. “While it is important to keep peoples thoughts positive, that there might be Gaelic games in , the measure you put in place might carry on into next year and the year after.” The second issue, he feels is becoming clear relates to youths, tied in with theirto school.

From that perspective, the GAA have to look at things dferently. “We have an inter-county game that, like the professional leagues, in theory could work,it was peoples full-time job to be Gaelic footballers or hurlers, but it is not their full-time job.

The former Ballinderry Chairman is Ulster GAAs Head of Operations, but has been called onto the GAAs Covid- Advisory Group, chaired by Chairman of Health and Safety group Shay Bannon. “Our work is less than two weeks old,” McGeehan told the County Derry Post, of the group that reports directly to President John Horan and Director General Tom Ryan. “We are there to provide advice and make recommendations. In terms of the decisions, they will be made by the GAAs management committee. googletag.cmd.push “Our remit is a short and sharp piece of work to develop protocols of how and on what basis,it is possible, will it be possible toto training, playing and eventually watching games again.” Professor Mary Horgan, a professor in infectious diseases, has been added to the group. She has previously been advising other world governing bodies of sport. “Her role is crucial in helping voluntary bodies like the GAA,” McGeehan feels. “All of this needs to be medically driven, whether is it is public health advice from the governments or the research around the vaccines and all that might be required in the future.” googletag.cmd.push The committee have, as McGeehan terms it, the easy job, with GAA management having the final call. An initial plan of inter-county action in October and club pencilled in for mid-July, was based on a cut back version. Footballs Tier  championship, the Super s and the qualiers were likely to be shelved, as were the group stages in the hurling championship. In terms of Derry, the senior hurlers had qualied for the NHL promotion play-off. It was initially hoped that games involving relegation and promotion couldve been pencilled into the overall plan, in a bid to provide a clean slate for . “There is no play-book to this and I dont think anyone knowsany of the league games could be played,” was McGeehans opinion on the situation. “At the minute, the focus is on whether activity willat all and what it would require to bring that activity back. No formal decision has been made on the league or the championship.” He also has sympathy for Antrim and Armagh footballers who worked themselves into promising league positions. “That decision will be taken very carefully and on the basis of what space there is. As the weeks go on, I think it becomes less likely that there will be room for them, but I wouldnt rule them out completely.” In terms of club activity, counties have been working away to come up with plans that could be activated once there is a green light. It is likely that club leagues will be scrapped with,there is any action, a series of warm-up games ahead of a knock-out championship. “It would be very important for a lead-in period,” McGeehan feels. “You would want to give club players time to get collective training under their belt, to get them out. Given the timescale, there mightnt be room for many league games. “The window is a moving piste, in that the GAA talked about October and November . In theory, the inter-county programme,bumped into December and into January would allow the clubs a bit more time.” For McGeehan, getting clubs – who he heaped praise onto for their efforts in communities- up and running first is a must. IDEAL “An ideal situation for me would be to get guidance and clarity, to get started back with club football and hurling getting a sizeable window before the inter-county starts back. “Everybody is mad to get out, but only when it is safe to do so. From a safety point of view, it is not about risk elimination, it is about risk reduction.” If the pandemic continues, it could force long term change. In McGeehans opinion, any measures put in place by the GAA may continue into  and beyond. “I think club activity ing is hugely important,” he feels, not just for sporting reasons, There is a a growing epidemic of mental health issues. There are issues over social isolation. I think the first resumption of activity needs to happen at a local level,that is possible.” McGeehan points out the change of language by the government. “Terms such as permanent pandemic surveillance, that type of vocabulary. We are going to have to adjust our lives for Covid- or other strains of a disease like this for the foreseeable. “While it is important to keep peoples thoughts positive, that there might be Gaelic games in , the measure you put in place might carry on into next year and the year after.” The second issue, he feels is becoming clear relates to youths, tied in with theirto school. He asks: “Is there a way, after risk assessments, that you are able to get juvenile activity moving and you are able to get kids out on the pitch again ” “If that is an area of less-risk for the spread of the disease and children have been less affected by it, that presents an opportunity to get them out whenever there is the science to be able to do that.” From the point of view of testing, McGeehan – while pointing out that inter-county players are deemed elite – the GAA is dferent to the Premier League, or indeed the Bundesliga that has two rounds complete since their resumption. “We are dferent,” he begins. “We are neither professional nor semi-professional. From that perspective, the GAA have to look at things dferently. “We have an inter-county game that, like the professional leagues, in theory could work,it was peoples full-time job to be Gaelic footballers or hurlers, but it is not their full-time job.

Last week Deputy First Minister Michelle ONeill announced that the Magee Medical School had been agreed and that students would start next September. Days later Economy Minister Diane Dodds said signicant work is required and questioned Ulster Universitys financial stability. She added that further reports would be submitted to the Executive. Seeking clarity on the matter, Sinead McLaughlin said: “I have today submitted a written question asking health minister Robin Swannhe will publish his department’s own internal business case for the Magee Medical School. We need greater transparency. googletag.cmd.push “While I very strongly welcome the progress made recently with regard to the Magee Medical School, we also have to impose sunlight on the process to learn where the blockages are. It is very important that we keep the pressure on to ensure the Magee Medical School opens in September . “I emphasised this in my speech in the Northern Ireland Assembly this evening, in which I complained about the lack of transparency over the progress on the Medical School and compared this to the confusion over the plans for Northern Ireland after the end of the Brexit transition period.” In part of that speech, she said: “I met – virtually of course – yesterday with senior representatives of Ulster University. I left the meeting with the sense that they were as in the dark about what happens now regarding progressing the business case for the Medical School as we in Northern Ireland are about the new customs arrangements after Brexit. googletag.cmd.push “We need to know what is going on. We need greater transparency. That applies to the British government’s plans for Brexit, and also to the plans of our own government – the Executive and its senior officials – when it comes to the Magee Medical School.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He has selected a team of players he would go to war with in the white heat of championship... What God has put together, let no man put asunder’. There is a reason for not having any of the dogs of war in this team, those who fought with me in the trenches to conquer All-Ireland club glory in  - I can’t or won’t pull that team apart. The one thing from my days of football and hurling at all levels that stands out, is that I really enjoyed the thrill of competing and playing. The players here were all part of the enjoyment factor at ious stages of my career. googletag.cmd.push I count myself very lucky to be a part of some special teams at school, university, club, county and province. There are many lads unfortunate not be in this team. Particularly those who reached the summits of  with me. All of the boys who started that day and made a contribution throughout that year deserve massive recognition. On beer rating and craic alone Fergal ‘Rooster’would walk onto any team. McGilligan, Barton, Burns, Quinn, Coleman, Heaney and Cassidy would walk onto any county team. Gary Doyle, who wasn’t part of the  team, was a superb player for Lavey for many years. googletag.cmd.push You don’t win anything without great players and particularly great characters as well.Management will always be a massive factor in your development and success. Paddy Chivers, Adrian McGuckin, John Brennan, Brendan Convery and weeColeman were all vital in my progress as a footballer. I owe everything to the players and management who made all my successes possible.  - Damien McCusker  Easy solution here. This man was way ahead of his time in the number one spot. He played outfield for his club and it showed in his distribution and confidence with the ball. His kicking out was superb and would have found you with a ‘short’on. A big quiet leader and gentleman as well.Beer rating - ..  - Kieran McKeever  In his era, would have been the first man selected in any Derry side. He was the greatest corner back when you had to play corner back, giving me the freedom to go forward without having a worry behind me. Had many a spat with him in Dungiven colours and we always came out the other side as friends. Class personied.Beer rating –    - Kevin McCloy  Was too young to be about in Lavey’s really successful years but matured into a brilliant full-back. I coached him at U and never saw anyone who could read the game like him at that age. He deservedly got an all-star in  and gave Lavey and Derry many years of great service. Beer rating – .  - Tony Scullion  He would walk onto any team in the land. He didn’t like stretching and once smoked a cigarette while warming up. He didn’t fancy training one bit, yet he was imperious as a defender. This four all-stars tells the tale. He was unlucky not to win a county championship with a very good Ballinascreen team in those years. Beer rating – .   - Paul McFlynn  He played number five after I left the Derry team for many years and was a superb footballer. Paul was a very underrated tackler and always grabbed you a point at the other end. He was unbelievably instrumental in Loups two championship wins and their Ulster triumph. He was quiet but so influential on the pitch.Beer rating – .   - Anthony McGurk  Although, at , he made fleeting and telling impacts for our  team from the bench, I’m going to allow him in here. He is reason why the rest of us played football in the house. We grew up travelling everywhereto watch him. His Derry side wasnt far off the  side in terms of talent. A pure talent, legend, leader and a great influence our family.Beer rating . .  - Joe Irwin  When I came into the Derry team, Joe Irwin was the best player in our county bar none. There was a defiance, strength and ruggedness that yielded him unplayable. Unlucky not to be around in  but was a great player for Derry and a decent Drumsurn team of the ’s. Great lad too. Beer rating – . .  - Anthony Tohill  Anthony was simply the best as an all round player of my time. There was just no one to touch him. He was tall, strong, athletic, skillful, brainy, dedicated and had possessed two good feet. The big man was such a big gentleman as well – there is nothing more to say.Beer rating –  .  - Gregory McCartan . The single most reason why the Down of  regained their levels of . A midfielder who covered serious ground on the pitch and also could kick long range frees. He would always chip in with an odd point from play as well. He was a massive player for Down throughout the s and he could sing nearly as well as he played too! Beer rating –    - Dermot McNicholl  The greatest underage player of all time. I grew up at St Pat’s admiring and living in awe of Spoofer. A great leader in school for me as well as Derry minors. Superbly dedicated footballer who was unlucky not to start in , but made many telling contributions. You couldn’t talk about Derry football without mentioning him.Beer rating –  .  - Brian Conlon  I was a lucky man to play in the same Queen’s team and share a lecture theatre as well. He would have won two All-Ireland’s with Downnot for his serious injury. He had everything as a footballer, with two great feet and saw everything happening around him. He would have been a success at anything, shown by the companyhe grew. RIP Brian.  - Peter Canavan  One of the finest players to grace the pitch. He was unbelievably tricky in finding space and had two super feet. A massive influence for Tyrone in terms of scoring and leadership. The reason that Errigal Ciaran became so successful and why the song ‘oh you’ll never bring the Sam Maguire home’ was but to bed. Beer rating – . .  - Joseph Brolly  Joe was a real corner forward who always got you a handful of points in any game. He flourished in  for Derry and for many years after. One of the best club players I’ve ever played against in a really talented ‘sirs’ team of that era. A joy to play with and socialise with. Always full of the craic in training and games and still is! Beer rating –    - Mickey Linden  I played with him for Ulster in the Railway Cup and was delighted as it was a nightmare to play against him! He was possibly the best forward I have ever marked . A superb speedy corner forward who scored at will. A real gent as well.Beer rating –  .  - Enda Gormley  ‘Edna’ as he was known, was one of the most dedicated footballers I have ever played with. He trained like a professional and got what he deserved. I’ll never forget his days in Maghera Rec on the running machines. A great scorer from play and frees. He was part of a decent Watties side at the turn of the s. He had a fantastic All-Ireland final in , after getting a slap.Beer rating – . . RELATED - The club hurling team of the decade More...

There is a reason for not having any of the dogs of war in this team, those who fought with me in the trenches to conquer All-Ireland club glory in  - I can’t or won’t pull that team apart.

There are many lads unfortunate not be in this team. Particularly those who reached the summits of  with me. All of the boys who started that day and made a contribution throughout that year deserve massive recognition. On beer rating and craic alone Fergal ‘Rooster’would walk onto any team.

Paddy Chivers, Adrian McGuckin, John Brennan, Brendan Convery and weeColeman were all vital in my progress as a footballer.

He played outfield for his club and it showed in his distribution and confidence with the ball. His kicking out was superb and would have found you with a ‘short’on.

On Monday, five of Derry City  Strabane District Council’s  household recycling centres reopened after being closed for a period as a result of the COVID- emergency legislation. Long queues formed outside the centres before they opened as people who were in lockdown attempted to dump and recycle materials that had accumulated. Derry’s centres do not charge people to get rid of their waste. In Donegal people must pay for some items at recycling centres while others are free.  googletag.cmd.push At the most recent meeting of the council, DUP Alderman Maurice Devenney said the use of the dumps by people from Donegal was a quite serious problem which needed to be examined. Alderman Devenney said that given the costs being faced by the local council as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, they should not be footing the bill for people from a dferent jurisdiction to get rid of their rubbish. He suggested that when the dumps are re-opened the council should look at new measures to prevent people from outside the council area using the facilities. Alderman Devenney asked for a report to be prepared in a bid to try and establish how many vehicles with southern registrations are using the local dumps. googletag.cmd.push Addressing the issue of cross border waste, a council spokesperson this week said that it is aware of ‘some cross border waste’ being brought to its recycling centres by members of the public and that its centres are designed to handle the volume of waste which passes through daily. She said: “This issue is reviewed on an ongoing basis with elected members recently requesting a full report on usage that will come before them for review and discussion at the next Environment and Regeneration Committee. “Council acknowledges the fact that there are many instances where users of the amenity sites live outside of the Council area, for example they may own a property within the Council area. “Council continues to remind people from outside of the council area that where possible they should limit travel and should use services and facilities in their own areas.” The Council spokesperson added that they experienced a high volume of users at the sites when they reopened on Monday and encouraged the public to hold off and avail of the services later in the week. Five centres at Pennyburn, Glendermott Road, Strathfoyle, Claudy and Strahan Road in Strabane are all open from am to pm Monday to Friday, am to pm on Saturday, and Sunday opening from  to pm for Pennyburn, Glendermott Road and Strahan Road sites only. The public are reminded that the council’s regular refuse collection service is fully operational throughout this emergency period and that additional support to deal with excess waste has been provided through a bespoke COVID Waste Helpline –    - and a free Bulky Waste Collection Service that can be booked online on the councils website.

Patricia McCallion, who owns her own hair and beauty salon in Waterloo Street, agreed to be stripped of her make-up and lashes to take part in Pretty Single which airs on Monday. The series sees siximage-concious singeltons embrace the natural lookto try and finda love connection that is more than skin deep. Patricia kicks off the showbygoing on five dates with five dferent guys, while her co-starswatch the dates unfold from the comfort of their sofa – providing supportive and humorous commentary throughout. googletag.cmd.push Mum-of-one and self-confessed romantic, Patricia admits she hides her true self behind make-up to boost her confidence. “It’s putting on a mask in the morning, it’s covering the flaws that you don’t like about yourself, she said. People often say to me you look like you workin the beauty industry and I do like to look the part. I have to look at myself in the mirror all day at work so I want to look mybest. Each of the five suitors have been specially matched to Patricia but she could only take one to dinner. The dates were one after the other and then you had to whittle it down to two and decide which one to take on a proper date, explained Patricia. googletag.cmd.push If I was going on a normal dateId have my make-up done because you want to impress, but the funny thing was the fellas didnt even notice we werent wearing make-up. I felt like I was putting myself out there and it was scary, but at the same time I felt like they were getting to know the real me because I was more vulnerable. Patricia remains tight lipped about who she chose for her date, but revealed she was given the option of going bare faced or wearing make-up. I kind of went for a bit of both, she laughed. She is now looking forward to seeing the show for the first time when it airs on Monday. The trailer came on the other night after Eastenders and I was jumping around the room, she admitted. I kept rewinding it to watch again. Narrated by Derry Girls star Saoirse-Monica Jackson, Pretty Single is a Stelly Media production for BBC One Northern Ireland and BBC Scotland. It begins on BBC One Northern Ireland on Monday  May at .pm. All six episodes in the series will be available on BBC iPlayer after the first episode is broadcast.

Terence McDowell, principal of St Eithnes Primary School, has also supported calls from church leaders for the  plus transfer test to be scrapped this year because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Education Minister last week said it was his aim to see a phased reopening of schools across the North, starting with limited provisionfor GCSE, A-Level and P pupils this summer. Mr McDowell said he first learnt of the Education Ministersplans from the news and had not been consulted about them. googletag.cmd.push It was the first we heard of it and a lot of questions would need to be answered first, said Mr McDowell. The Minister wasnt very definite about the plans. Mr McDowell said he feels very sorry for his P pupils who face the possible prospect of moving on to post-primary school without the chance to say goodbye. My heart goes out to them, said Mr McDowell.For the other primaries we will eventually get them back and we can make up for the missed time, but for the Ps you can never replace that time. There are so many rites of passage like their school trip that they will never get to do and they will go into post primary without preparation that we would normally give them for what is a such a big change. googletag.cmd.push If the plans go ahead, it will give us some formof contact and offer some closure to both pupils and staff. The P teachers were told they might not see these pupils again with just two days notice. Staff at St Eithnes PS had already created a DVD for P pupils and a certicate to mark the end of their time at the school. Its always sad to see pupils go, but it will beall themore poignant this year, said Mr McDowell. Under Minister Weirs plans, primary schools and post primary schools would reopen with limited provision for key cohort years in August, followed by a phased provision for all pupils at the beginning of September. However, teachers would traditionally be on annual leave during the school summer break in July and August. Teachers have been working really hard preparing online resources and work packs to keep pupils going, said Mr McDowell. We dontknow what the requirementswill be, but I believeit will be  pupils to a classroom. We have almost  in our two P classes so they will need to be split into two rooms and that will require more staff. The physical layout of desks and chairs will need to be considered and the resources they are using. We have already discussed requisitioning inidual resource packs for each child but that will come at an extra expense to the school and Im sure we wontget any extra resources. Mr McDowell said the movement of pupils outside the classrooms would also be a concern. We need to consider how the children will move around the school as the corridors arent very wide. We also need to think about meal times in the canteen, where normally we would have one or two slots to feed the whole school. Toilet breaks will need to be consideredtoo and time given for children to properly wash their hands. This will all be time taken out of teaching time. Keeping the childrentwo metres apart staff and each other would be particularlydficult for younger pupils. Children in P naturally gravitate towards one another, said Mr McDowell. You cant police that, it is going to be impossible. Things happen at school where children fall and hurt themselves and they will need comforted. Do we have to tell a child with a bleeding to chin to wait while we ring their parents  Some children will find the transition to primary school dficult and they might be crying or upset. To not be able to comfort that child goes against the grain of the very reasons that teachers came into this profession. Last week,Bishop of Derry, Donal McKeown sent a letter to Catholic post-primary schools asking for the transfer test to be scrapped this year, a call echoed by Mr McDowell. The transfer test causes much anxiety anyway and our teachers have been unable to prepare children in the normal way this year and working from home just doesnt compare. It is causing much anxiety and we need to consider something to stop that. There isnt a levelplaying field in what parents can provide. They might be working from home, they might have multiple children, they might be looking after an elderly relative. Every household is unique. I am very mindful that parents have been thrust into the role of teachers, they are not professional teachers. Parents shouldnt compare themselves to others. We always tell the children just do your best and thats the same message I would have for parents. They are doing the best they can. Meanwhile, Derry Sinn Fein MLA Karen Mullan, has called for an`education forum comprising of teachers, school leaders, parents, trade unions and public health experts to be convened before schools are allowed to . The deputy chair of the assembly education committee, said the forum, would address huge concern and anxiety at the prospect of an eventualto school. Its my view that anyto school must be done in complete partnership and in conversation with all those involved in education when the time comes, said Ms Mullan. Parents, young people and our teaching staff must have confidence that health and safety is paramount in anyto school. There will be no one size fits all approach for schools in preparing to re-open. There should be an intense period of discussion that will be crucial to understand the flexibilities and the bespoke needs that dferent schools and dferent settings will require.

Council Animal Welfare Officers have been tasked with looking into the alleged incident after a report was made to the PSNI in January of this year. A PSNI spokesperson said: “Police in Mid Ulster received a report regarding cruelty to horses in the Magherafelt area in January . “Under the Welfare of Animals Act, District Councils are responsible for the enforcement of the legislation as it applies to non-farmed animals. “This would therefore include horses. The report was subsequently passed to Council Animal Welfare officers who are currently investigating the matter, the spokesperson added. googletag.cmd.push Mid Ulster District Council confirmed it was aware of the animal welfare complaint and a spokesperson said ‘an investigation is being undertaken into the case’. Images of the alleged incident were published online along with videos that appeared to show a horse with a bloodied mouth and missing front tooth. A further video appeared to show a horse with a rope tied from the fetlock strap over its neck to keep its head in a downward position. Mid Ulster MLA Patsy McGlone called for those responsible to be held to account. He said: “A lot of concern has been expressed to me personally and my party colleagues locally about footage which has appeared on social media. googletag.cmd.push “These allegations of abuse must be rigorously investigated and I have contacted Mid-Ulster Council, Animal Welfare, PSNI and the Minister at DAERA. “Abuse of harmless animals is despicable and those responsible must face heavy sentences for their hateful actions.” Mid Ulster councillor Malachy Quinn, who has been campaigning for an Animal Cruelty Register for Northern Ireland, also condemned alleged footage of the incident. “The pictures and videos that have been shared a quite sickening and disturbing,” he said. “This morning I sent an email to Mid-Ulster Council Chief Executive to seek assurances that it will be dealt with as a matter of urgency. “This time last year I started a campaign to introduce an Animal Cruelty Register, where those convicted of animal abuses would have their name placed on it and it could be accessed by animal charities and police to prevent those people having access to animals again. “Under present law they can easily get animals across the border or over in the UK. The events that have come to light over the weekend only strengthen the call for this register. “The videos and pictures show disgusting abuse of horses and the people who are subjecting them to this should never be allowed to own another animal. “The SDLP will be pushing the DERA Minster Edwin Poots to bring forward legislation to create a register and also the Justice Minister Naomi Long to bring in tougher sentences for Animal Abuse.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mid Ulster District Council has the second-worst broadband provision of all Northern Ireland’s council areas, with some households unable to reach  Mbps. MLA for the area, Emma Sheerin, said that broadband was an essential utility for households. “It is a poor reflection on the state that basic utilities like broadband are still out of reach for some rural dwellers,” she said. “The fact that many of us are still in lockdown has meant that internet, which is already a necessary utility in most households, is even more essential. googletag.cmd.push “For those asked to work from home, for students attempting to complete school or university work, even for the most basic contact with friends and family, internet has been needed. This has exacerbated the frustrations of those for whom broadband is intermittent or non-existent, and anyone who has ever watched that wee wheel of buffering when trying to stream a video will know just how disheartening it is!” poundm of funding has been made available for the enhancement of rural broadband through Project Stratum, with just under , currently eligible for help. Ms Sheerin said it was vital the support was targeted at the premises that are most in need. googletag.cmd.push “Myself and my Sinn Feacutein colleagues reminded the department that there is another reality, namely the disparity that exists within the Up to  Mbps category,” she said. “I asked that homes on the smaller spectrum of speed be prioritised, so we would not see a situation where a house receiving broadband of  Mbps is improved to  Mbps, whilst another home  miles up the road, with a speed of  Mbps, wouldnt receive any help. “It was our fear thatcost efficiency was prioritised over need, those far off, hard to reach homes, would see no intervention, just because it was going to cost more to get to them. A delay to the roll out of the project has seen the number of eligible premises drop as broadband providers continue to improve their provision. “Due to upgrades by broadband providers, the number of homes with less than  Mbps broadband speed has decreasedby ,, from , to ,,” said Ms Sheerin. “I welcome this, but onlyit means that all , homes are helped, particularly those with the worst service to begin with. I have asked the minister that this be prioritised, and that work begins as soon as is possible.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In an extensive interview this weeks County Derry Post, the former Kingdom and Hogan Cup winning boss gives a Kerry slant to a feature on the minor clashes with Derry from  to . Derry have lost the services of Conor Glass and Callum Brown since minor level, with former U player Anton Tohill also lost to the AFL. Current Derry captain Chrissy McKaigue had a stint with Sydney Swans, and more recently Conleth McShane attended a AFL combine in Dublin before Christmas. googletag.cmd.push It was the same one Tohill and Oisin McWilliams attended two years ago. McWilliams later spent time in Australia with North Melbourne, in , but wasnt snapped up. Kerrys  goalkeeper Deividas Uosis and  winning captain Mark OConnor, both past pupils of Fitzmaurice have travelled down under, but their prize asset – David Clford – has stayed put. “It wasnt on his radar,” reveals Fitzmaurice of a meeting they had when he was senior manager. “He had no interest in going to Australia, or anywhere . Id say there were definitely approaches made but he wanted to play for Kerry and win All-Irelands with Kerry.” googletag.cmd.push On the flip side, Kerry lost OConnor to the AFL. He won two Hogan Cup medals under Fitzmaurice in Pobalscoil Chorca Dhuibhne. “He is a great guy and a big loss to Kerry,” Eacuteamonn states. “He got made an offer and decided to avail of it. From a Kerry perspective, it is up to us to make sure the players want to stay for the right reason. “If they do stay, they get a good education. There is a good job for them and they are well looked after to allow them to pursue an amateur sport. “Rather than giving out about it, it is always important to look in the mirror...is there anything we can do that would make a players le a bit easierthey do stay at home. David wanted to stay at home and we are delighted that he did.” Playing inter-county doesnt pay the bills, but Fitzmaurice sees a bigger picture. “When you are the manager of Kerry, thats what you want – for the players - to ensure the were happy in their personal and professional lives every bit as much as they are in their football lives. “If they are happy in their personal and professional lives, iniably they are going to be better footballers for it. Its not jobs for the boys, what you are trying to do is to encourage players to get a good education, to go down a route that they are interested in, so they can build a good career as well as being a successful footballer.” RELATED - Tohill waiting to make his mark.

Lavey, once a force in both codes, beat the Lynchs to grab a title at the start of the decade – under current Slaughtneil boss Michael McShane. Before the maroon and white dominance, Swatragh nipped in to take the  title. It was an era when the CCC produced the master-stroke of a graded championship structure to give more Derry teams a better crack at an Ulster title.  – Daryl McDermott Big ball or wee ball, it didnt matter – Sticks, in his laid-back manner was Mr Consistency between the posts. He had razor sharp reflexes and ied puck-out. He had a great eye and safe hand between the posts. He was Derrys keeper for longer than I can remember. Unlucky to have played in the era of Slaughtneil and Kevin Lynchs dominance. googletag.cmd.push  – Paddy Kelly A constant in the Kevin Lynchs defence and even had the versatility to pick up a spot in attack for the  hurling team of the year. He has put in place a legacy that his younger brothers are now following. In last years final with Slaughtneil, he was immense, led by example and wouldve deserved to lt the cup. Quiet and does his talking on the pitch.  – Sean Cassidy Has been a tower of strength in the heart of the Slaughtneil defence since coming out of the minor grade. Has played a wing back and full back. He is strong, commanding and has a extremely long clearance that takes the pressure off his defence - all done with a smile on his face. Tad took his club for to the county scene where John McEvoy appointed him as captain. googletag.cmd.push  – Karl McKaigue Karl is the player that corner forwards just had to see coming. An very skilful hurler coming up through the underage ranks and as he filled out, he combined his hurling with an athleticism that just sets him apart. Like Paddy Kelly in the other corners, he says very little but when he is given a job to do in a game, there are few better. He can also dodge forward to pick off a score.  – Mark Craig Mark captained Derry to U glory in  and he has been a mainstay in the Kevin Lynchs story at senior level since. He has played in the defence and had spells in the attack during the decade as the Lynchs tried a reshuffle to give them a focal point. Histo the county  under John McEvoy has given the young guns an experienced head to led them into inter-county hurling.  – Brian Oacuteg McGilligan Brian Oacuteg has played at full-forward and midfield for Banagher as they tried began to exert an influence over the Lynchs and try to knock Slaughtneil off their perch. He has played at full-back for Derry this season, but he is perhaps at his most influential at centre-back with his presence and positional sense. He has many more years of hurling left.  – Liam Oacuteg Hinphey One of the terric characters of the club scene and has played both codes for Derry over an accomplished career. He is very combative under the dropping ball and has played anywhere across the half-back line and on the end of the square. And this was all during a career that brought a troublesome injury, but he was never found wanting. One of the greats.  - Chrissy McKaigue The most decorated club hurler of a decade. Apart from his spell with the Sydney Swans, he has been named in the team of the year since the County Derry Post began and he was hurler of the year in . He is just a natural and like Cormac ODoherty and Brendan Rogers, would probably grace any team in Ireland. He is ultra-completive and has a skill set to match.  – Gerald Bradley You dont miss anything until its gone. Gerald Bradleys knee injury probably cost Slaughtneil the Ulster title in , such is his natural leap and catch. He is now back to his best and last season excelled in the role of the teams quarter-back, sitting in the pocket to frustrate Dunloy and Ballyhale but was able to spring Slaughtneil into an attacking outfit. His point against Dunloy last year...well, what can say. Awesome.  – Kevin Hinphey Joins Liam Oacuteg as the second set of brothers on the team. A very astute player who could play up front and in defence, where he was named on the hurling team of the year on three occasions. Another terric servant of the Derry county team and he battled back from a serious knee injury to get back playing last season. Like his father did, he has invested a lot of time in the clubs underage who are now coming through to the county team. - Cormac ODoherty He was born to play hurling. Played in goals at underage, in the teams well before his years, with a touch developed playing with his older brothers at home. Once he progressed outfield, in his own age groups, he was destined for greatness. Accurate from frees and play, but it is his awareness that sets him apart. Very smart on the ball and can see pass before the inside forward even calls for the ball. A natural.  – Paddy Henry Paddy landed - in Laveys  win over Kevin Lynchs. It was a year to remember, as he kicked the winner fo his native Castledawson in the intermediate football final. He has been a consistent performer and has been selected on the County Derry Post hurling team of the year on three occasions. He is now sowing the seeds of hurling in the Dawson.  – Brendan Rogers Rogers was named at full-back on the club football team of the decade and with the small ball, he is the assassin in Slaughtneils attack. He is terric in the air, is quick, has power and a terric eye for goal. He took a bursting collection of underage medals into the senior ranks and was arguably the main reason for their early domination at senior level, with an attacking power few could match.  – Seacute McGuigan The Slaughtneil man is a brilliant ball winner and has an eye for goal that has helped the club dominate the club and provincial championship scene. For the guts of five years, he was unmarkable at the edge of the square and it allowed Brendan Rogers to be deployed where. Has a very relaxed demeanour, but knows how to perform when it matters. Named on the Champions team of the season at last years All-Star awards.  - Ruairi ConveryWhen Convery hung up his hurl, Eamonn Hasson commented that you just dont replace men like him. He was pivotal in Swatraghs hurling and football double season in , a fittingfor a man who spearheaded their march up through underage. A huge loss to Derry hurling as well and its a pity Swatragh didnt land an intermediate Ulster before he hung up his hurl.

Second past the judge Iain Duff was Supersat, ridden by Leo Gracey, with James McGurgen third on John Megawrsquos Gortmerron Lady.Mark is now the only local amateur to have ridden out his racecourse riders claim.The First Trust Maiden race was ided and in the first ision Jackie Kidd from Loughinisland won on Tullamore, owned and trained by her father, Mayne, beating Brian Dougan on his own Russell Lodge, with Jimmy Henry third on Redheadmustgo.The winner of the second ision was Cortynan in the colours of Dr Fitz Gillespie, who sadly passed away recently.This one providing Glyne Dyne with his third career success. Bend in the River was second ahead of Crawfordstowncross, with Jimmy Henry in the saddle.In the Ulster Bank Open race Liam Lennon had his first winner of the day as a trainer when Younowhat, which he also rode, won in the colours of Moirarsquos Jim McMullan.He also saddled the runner-up, Patsy Murphyrsquos Blackout, ridden by Mark OrsquoHare. Glencloy was third.The W  C Glazing Ltd two winner race saw Banbridge rider James Smyth record his first success of the season when successful on Supreme Lancer, in the colours of Mrs Carol Rooney from Newry.

As part of the Marathon Potential  cohort, I attended a two week training camp near Torre-Vieja, Spain, organised jointly by Athletics Northern Ireland and Athletics Ireland.I had the honour of going toe-to-toe with then NI marathon record holder, Paul Pollock, on the track.I also had the opportunity to spend time with Paul off-track, alongside Kevin Seaward, learning from two powerhouses of Irish marathon running and building on the advice we received from Stephen Scullion, in Belfast in early December.Most importantly, I made lasting friendships with my fellow Marathon Potential  athletes. The sense of community allowed me to really embrace the project.Setting a goal of putting two of us on the start line of the  Paris Olympics is very ambitious. As a younger athlete, I always felt like an underdog.This feeling, which I once perceived as a negative, has become one of my chief strengths. The goal of becoming an Olympian, which I have chased mdash still chasing mdash from an early age, has, at times seemed unattainable.However, as time has passed, I have grown to love the chase. I look forward to the next stage on this journey, in the company of the Marathon Potential  athletes and support staff, under the stewardship of my coach and mentor of  years, Richard Rodgers, and the band of local training partners.Our way of le has changed dramatically in the space of four months due to COVID-. I remember reading the news in January and having the unnerving feeling that it would not be the last time that I would do so.When I recorded a : personal best over the half marathon in Barcelona in mid-February, the virus was relatively undocumented in Europe. By mid March, I understood that I would not be racing for a long time.My biggest mdash and somewhat selfish mdash fear was that there would be a blanket ban on exercise. Nonetheless, the sanctions under which we are all living have forced me to reconsider the spirit in which I run.To those friends and family in the health service, who have been tackling the virus over the past six weeks, I am amazed beyond words. Thank you for what you are doing.As a PhD student I do not consider myself a key worker. I decided that I would follow lockdown protocol as strictly as possible to do my part. Double runs mdash two runs a day mdash have always been a staple part of my training, allowing me to hit the high mileage required to prepare for the marathon.Completing the same mileage across the week off one daily training session was initially challenging. However, I eventually adapted after two weeks of attrition. In the process, I learned that I benefit from the extra recovery time between runs. This pleasant surprise helped me come to terms with what seems like a more or less empty race calendar in .Athletes are creatures of habit. We are conditioned to race on a monthly or two-monthly basis. Having the options restricted has enabled me to focus on the process of training without looking too far ahead. It has reminded me that, despite thriving off pushing to my limits in races, I love the journey, equally as much.Yes, it is all about achieving in races, but also, to get there a long time is spent training mdash  years and counting. So we have to love the training too. A consequence of this has been that I have begun to pay attention to the finer details in training.When doing a hard workout, I set high standards for each and every repetition, be it focusing on my running form, my cadence or my composure in a strong headwind. I have been trying out new drills and core routines to break up the days.Beyond training itself, I have found myself looking after my kit better than I may have done in the past. This, strangely enough, has been one of the most fulfilling aspects of my day.Given the recent stint of unusually sunny and warmer April weather, I have been leaving my shoes to dry in the sun after runs. A friend recently told me that this is a standard practice in Japan, harnessing the heat of the sun to kill off microbes.It has become a bit of a ritual for me. My shoes fairly pound the roads, so I guess they deserve some respect for what they allow me to do. Seeing them propped against the wall lts my spirits.I can understand that many of you will be disappointed not to have run the Deep RiverRock Belfast City Marathon, but your chance to do so will come around again in September or the future.Anyone who is brave enough to step on the start line of a marathon is a special type of person, irrespective of fitness.More so those who run to raise money for a cause. It takes courage to do this. Bank that courage and build on it over the coming months. It is directly transferable to enduring the current crisis.I remember passing the -mile mark in the  Dublin Marathon. I was in a world of pain mdash itrsquos worth it when yoursquore on track for : mdash when I passed a sign that read lsquoWhat wall rsquoI knew then that I would be coming back to this distance time and again. Right now, I have to wait. We all have to wait. Runners are resilient. Focus on whatever training you can do right now and enjoy the journey..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20th May 2020 Dundrum.jpg","title":"Dundrum chef stars in Great British Menu final  ","story":"CHEF Alex Greene narrowly missed out on being crowned Champion of Champions at the Great British Menu banquet to honour  years of childrenrsquos literature.The Dundrum man admitted he was ldquogutted at not securing the final accolade for the best dish at the event ndash despite becoming the second chef to have got two dishes through to the final and the only Northern Ireland finalist ever to have done it.He lost out to double Michelin-starred chef Niall Keating whose fish dish was voted the best by the  diners, who included Alexrsquos mother, Glynis, his employer, Michael Deane, and Michaelrsquos we, former UTV presenter Kate Smith.However, he was being feted by local fans and well-wishers after the show came to an end on BBC on Friday night.The highly competitive  year-old wowed judges and guests with his starter and desert dishes - a potato and cheese sauce based dish inspired by CS Lewisrsquo book, The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe and a coconut and chocolate ganache dessert with edible rice pages and covers presented as a book inspired by Oliver Jeffersrsquo book, The Incredible Book Eating Boy.The event was held in early February, so Alex, who started his career off in the Buckrsquos Head restaurant in his home village, has had some time to reflect on his success.ldquoIrsquove been overwhelmed by the response Irsquove had from people on social media itrsquos been just mental, he said.ldquoItrsquos another achievement for me and itrsquos something I wanted to do for a long time. To get one dish is big, to get two dishes to the banquet is major as itrsquos only happened twice before and never for someone from Northern Ireland.ldquoAlthough I think everyone was shocked that I didnrsquot get Champion of Champions. A producer came afterwards to ask me how I felt about it and even Niall didnrsquot think he would get it.ldquoI was gutted to be honest. It couldnrsquot have been any closer and I did feel it after all the hard work I put into it. While I enjoyed the whole experience, I do regret not getting Champion of Champions. To me, not to get the whole thing, particularly after coming so far, was tough and hard to stomach. Itrsquos hard when I know the amount of effort I put in and then to get so close. But I know that I couldnrsquot had done anymore.Alex revealed that he worked seven days a week on perfecting his menu dishes for four months while maintaining his demanding job as chef at the Michelin-starred EIPIC restaurant in Belfast, the fine dining experience of the Michael Deane group, where he has worked for the last three years.ldquoWe started filming last November and I was working in the kitchen at Deanes every day, and even on Sundays when Irsquom normally off. The guys at work and Michael were absolutely amazing with their support as well as the local guys who produced the props for me, said Alex.Viewers saw that all the chefs were up against it at the banquet as they had to do all their own food preparation with the work being doubled for AlexldquoIt was a hard couple of days and it wasnrsquot all fun and games.

He also raised concern that a commitment to pay staff for the days they went on strike last December has not been delivered.In a detailed response mdash issued after last weekrsquos production deadline had passed ndash the South Eastern Trust said while the Covid- outbreak appeared to have reached a plateau within its hospitals, ldquothe incidents and challenges within the care sector continue to increase and the organisation is currently some distance from being able toto business as usual.The statement continues: ldquoWe are now considering a recovery plan for our elective, cancer and all other key services. This will include the services we can safely restore and by when.ldquoThere is also a global supply issue regarding anaesthetic, opioid and other medications.The shortage of these medications, amongst others, will have an impact on what services we can restore and how quickly.ldquoRoyal College guidelines for surgical specialities and endoscopy currently advise risk assessment and only performing very urgent procedures. This is due to the risk to the staff and also the patient attending hospital.ldquoThis is signicantly limiting the level of endoscopy we can carry out at this time. There are no plans to cease the reprocessing and maintenance of the endoscopy equipment in the Downe day procedure unit.The health trust insists that it is required to agree any recovery plan regionally to ensure equitable provision, explaining the bowel screening programme Mr Hazzard refers to has been suspended across Northern Ireland.ldquoOur priority will continue to be the safety of our patients and staff whilst we do this, said the health trust.ldquoThere is an ongoing requirement for additional staffing from across the organisation within the emergency departments at the Ulster and Lagan Valley hospitals which continue to have signicant and rising numbers of patients attending.ldquoBoth EDs have been separated into Covid- and non-Covid- spaces. The safe separation of patients requires the support of more staff, helping to reduce the likelihood of cross infection and facilitates the requirement for social distancing.The health trust says there is also a requirement to separate inpatient wards into Covid- and non-Covid- spaces at the Ulster, Lagan Valley and Downe hospitals which requires the support of more staff.ldquoUnfortunately, the Trust is also experiencing signicant numbers of staff absences at present. The reasons include self-isolation due to symptoms and shielding of vulnerable persons. This includes a high number of staff who work in the day procedure unit in the Downe Hospital, the statement continues.ldquoIn addition, we continue to work with colleagues in primary care, including the independent sector where there is an ongoing high level of pressure as a result of the virus.ldquoIn some cases, our staff have been providing care and support to the nursing and residential homes in the locality where the need is most acute. Supporting our colleagues within the care sector and the most vulnerable in our society is an absolute priority.The health trust insists that a commitment to pay staff travel time between the Downe and Ulster hospitals has not been rescinded and that eligible staff will receive a payment in lieu of travel time.In relation to strike pay, the Trust said Stormont health minister Robin Swann gave a commitment that pay deducted as a result of industrial action would be reinstated, with payments from the Business Services Organisation delayed as a result of Covid-.

These protocols will help advise any future science-led coastal management approaches we may adopt for protecting these vulnerable environments.Gina McIntyre, CEO of the Special EU Programmes Body, said the research being carried out will provide invaluable data to help protect Murlough Bay for many years to come.ldquoIt is one of the key environmental protection projects that will lead to better, more sustainable, marine conservation activities across Northern Ireland, Ireland and Western Scotland, she said.Dr Melanie Biausque, who can often be seen surveying the beach at low tide using a quad bike, explained what is done with the collected data.ldquoWe visit the site every month and for the next few years this will help generate a visualisation of surface height changes on the beach, telling us how waves move sand around under dferent wave events, she said.ldquoThese are incorporated in a computer model that should allow us to see how future storms will react with the underlying sandy seabed and beach.Another Ulster University researcher, Dr Edoardo Grottoli, has also been collating information of past changes of the coastal system in Murlough Bay using historical maps, past aerial photography and historical accounts of storm impact.He said: ldquoPast events will show us to better understand how important patterns of change have unfolded through time and how the coastline is evolving to present and future positions.ldquoSociety needs to understand the movement of the coast and the processes that drive the changes in order to protect our marine environment in the longer term..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20th May 2020 Supporters Club.jpg","title":"Supporters’ club members select their favourite Man Utd team  ","story":"LOCAL Manchester United fans have picked their favourite Reds team of the Premier League era.Members of the Downpatrick Manchester United Supportersrsquo Club were asked to pick their favourite players since the start of the Premier League in .They were tasked with selecting a best eleven along with five subs.

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues warning over the use of parksFines increased for coronavirus lockdown breachesMarie Curie Great Blooming Tea Party goes virtualA few years later in , the drama section came into being and with it a new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch

I think our teams worked together in a really impressive way, making good decisions all along.ldquoWe have a lot to look forward to. In just a few short days on Saturday afternoon we are going to do it again.ldquoHere is what we know ndash we are going to launch American astronauts on an American rocket from American soil.
