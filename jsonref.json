Photographer Diana Bagnoli followed the lavish first communions produced by Ivana and Miriam Pipolo in Naplesby Diana Bagnoli and Marzia MaurielloNine-year-old Maria wakes up and can’t wait for her party day to get started, after the first communion sacrament she received the day before. When the photographers and the videomakers arrive at her home, she slips into her bedroom and puts on some makeup to welcome the guests. She is ready for the day she will never forget.First communion in Naples is not just a religious sacrament but is experienced as an important rite of passage to be properly celebrated, and a community event with many levels of interpretation and meaning, not just limited to religion.For the young person involved and for their family the holy communion is filled with social and moral public obligations to be fulfilled, from wearing expensive clothes to providing banquets and putting on spectacular stage shows with bands singing modern Neapolitan pop music.In recent years, communions have often become more important than weddings, especially for parents who have had children before marriage. The celebration of their child’s communion becomes the feast of their dreams, the one they did not have for their wedding, and it is also perceived as an entrance into society.Even though in 1910 the Pope reduced the age for receiving the sacrament from 10-14 years old to seven, the first communion in the social context appears to be still related to the arrival of puberty, especially for the female communicants, often called spose bambine (child brides). They are in fact dressed, embellished and treated like young brides, with elaborate and expensive dresses made in the city’s best ateliers.In this photographic project Diana Bagnoli follows the daughters of the famous photographer of events and ceremonies, Oreste Pipolo, called “the shaman of weddings”. His daughters, Ivana and Miriam, inherited their father’s studio and, like him, they sell a dream, building elaborate photo sets before, during and after the first communion day.All the big expenditures – banquets, dresses, entertainments, photo shoots and so on – serve to convey a sense of social worth and to mark, or sometimes re-establish, the status of the communicant’s family within the local community. There is also a competitive element in displaying and sharing your goods with the community members and putting on the best and most lavish show.Such behaviour appears to be particularly related to a social milieu that is historically connected to poverty to show economic capacity may mean power but also social improvement. And it is also related to the high level of “theatricality” of Neapolitans in the public space, as observed by anthropologists who have done fieldwork in Naples – including myself, having carried out ethnographic work in this city for more than a decade.The celebration of the first communion, as it involves young children and the whole community, holds a great social meaning. It is a premise and a promise for future success. And it has to be a day to remember forever.Diana Bagnoli is a freelance portrait and social reportage photographer based in Italy.Marzia Mauriello is an anthropology research fellow at the University of Naples L’orientale, focusing on construction, deconstruction and representation of gender identities in the contemporary world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a7d2b3567af82d34ff2d68bf5372eb16fa32def/0_99_2756_1654/master/2756.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc4c90c7d5fb3c9bf42710bc37558e65","title":"gossamer tights in art nylons fetish fantasy gold man ray louise bourgeois","story":"From Man Ray to Louise Bourgeois, an astonishing range of artists have used tights and stockings to turbocharge their work. We go behind the scenes at Gossamer, a celebration of hosieryAn art exhibition about tights? In Margate? It sounds very end-of-the-pier, all saucy postcards and mother-in-law jokes. There is something a bit icky about hosiery in the day-to-day. Tights are underwear, sure, but they’re more business end than babe-wear: functional, grubby, prone to tugs and bald patches. There are few words uglier in the English language than “gusset”.“Tights sit in the innermost, intimate regions of the female form,” says Zoe Bedeaux, curator of Gossamer, at Margate’s Carl Freedman Gallery. “So when one thinks about their function and then imagines them in the context of art, I guess they can conjure an element of humour.”While Gossamer is a witty, knowing exhibition, it approaches hosiery with barely a smirk, for tights and stockings have actually been used by an astonishing range of artists, from Man Ray and Louise Bourgeois to Sarah Lucas and Senga Nengudi. Nylons do, after all, work brilliantly in sculpture – stretching, masking, distending and accommodating almost anything stuffed into them.The idea for Gossamer was sparked by a chair made by superstar Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama that appeared to be made of stuffed stockings. Bedeaux found herself conducting a roll-call of artworks she had encountered using tights and stockings: it went on and on. Carrying associations with femininity, fetishism, domesticity, dominance, smut, suburbia, sexual freedom, “standard” skin colours and body types, hosiery offers a rich seam for exploration.Before his 12-year partnership with Marina Abramović, performance artist Ulay produced a series of works exploring gender, among them SHe and Death of a Transvestite, which show him in glamorous makeup, dressed in nightclub and bridal costume and stockings.Ulay was less interested in the erotic, sexual connotations of feminine dress than in a personal exploration of gender. “I had an incredibly beautiful – actually female-beautiful – body. “All the stockings, everything, suited me,” says the artist who was keen to see how the feminine aspect of himself coexisted with the masculine. “I wanted to explore the in-between. I wanted to make clear that my queerness is not an inborn thing: it’s not a social, not an economical, not a cultural thing. It’s just a sympathy for the other – and of course I always wanted to be part of the other.”Japanese photographer Daido Moriyama, meanwhile, approaches tights as a voyeur. His images of stark fishnet patterning taut across pale flesh are so up-close that the curving contours of the human body feel architectural in scale. Moriyama is a photographer of the street rather than the studio, his beat being Tokyo’s underbelly. His artfully arranged landscapes of the human body encased in mesh seem to blend the abstract patterns of the built environment with the erotics of Moriyama’s predatory gaze.Polly Borland’s photo series Bunny is simultaneously sexy and strange. Borland started working on Bunny in 2002 with a then unknown young actress called Gwendoline Christie. Excited by Christie’s striking looks, Borland first planned to shoot her as a kind of Bunny Girl pinup, but thanks to the uncanny, mutating effects of stretchy hosiery, the project got odder and more animalistic. Christie became beast-like, her body by turns male, female and monster. Borland has continued to experiment with hosiery, covering and moulding the body in her more sculptural series Smudge and Morph.“With Bunny and then Smudge, the idea was to use stockings to conceal the human face and make dolls out of people,” says Borland. “My favourite books as a child were the Lonely Doll series. Edith the doll character had a felt face with painted eyes. I also had a doll with a painted stocking face. With the Bunny series, the work partially became about the different identities or cliches that are used to describe or in some cases define women.” The combination of naked flesh and the clingy veil of gossamer hosiery brings an unnerving sensuality to Borland’s work. “Fetish doesn’t interest me,” she says however. Leigh Bowery, by contrast, constructed fantastical costumes that manipulated his body to disturbing, erotic effect. Photographer Fergus Greer, who made detailed portraits of the performance artist’s highly textured looks, says: “Leigh’s use of hosiery, whether fetishistically or just to delineate form, gave a sexual, metaphoric language to his work.” Hosiery gave him “an open landscape of creative space for erotic fantasies to play in”.The overlap between the sculptural potential of hosiery and its sexual associations is further explored in works by Louise Bourgeois and Sarah Lucas. Bourgeois used tights to form mutant bodies: stuffed as sausage-like limbs, stretched over metal frameworks to resemble female torsos, or strange, expressive, semi-human creatures.In her ongoing Bunny series, Lucas built on Bourgeois’s mutant female stocking sculptures, using three pairs of stuffed tights stretched over a chair to suggest the body of a drunk (literally legless) woman whose supposedly sexy attire – stockings and bunny ears – look tawdry in the morning-after light of a gallery. Lucas’s Bunnys are female bodies reduced to a few sexual signifiers: all stockings and stilettos. In her NUDS sculptures, stuffed tights stand in for human limbs of unspecified gender, twisting like fleshy serpents in a strangling, sensual embrace.As the title NUDS suggests, much of the sculptural impact of tights comes from their resemblance to human skin, and the body-like forms they offer. That of course depends on whose skin and whose body: until shockingly recently, the term “nude” in fashion indicated only a beige-pink colour.As brands making nude tights for women of colour (Sheer Chemistry, Bianca Miller, Nubian Skin) appeared on the British market, Enam Gbewonyo started “to chart the history of hosiery and its relationship with black women. I thought about how this item of clothing had till then marginalised black women and how we are often made to feel invisible in the fashion and beauty markets.”Her exploration led back to the days of slavery and empire, to the tights worn by black nurses on the NHS, and the pink tights and shoes that black dancers were forced to wear as a ballet “norm”. Throughout the history of hosiery advertising, she sees the “eroticisation of white women and subjugation of black women”.Gbewonyo has been working with hosiery since 2016. “I was both interested in it as a material in its malleability and how I could manipulate it in so many interesting ways,” she says. “I cut tights up, stitch them into yarn and create hand-knitted and woven works. I also stitch the legs together to make ruffled fabric that is stretched over canvas. I burn into them, embroider by hand on them and trap them in tissue paper. There’s practically no limit to how they can be used.”In Gossamer, Gbewonyo will show alongside Senga Nengudi, her hero. Nengudi started making sculpture with nylon tights in the mid-1970s, works she referred to as “abstracted reflections of used bodies”.Bedeaux agrees: “Tights are highly transformative, loaded with all sorts of socio-political connotations. The show is complex, it’s not a show about tights per se: it’s about the possibilities that can come from using a particular object outside of its utilitarian function. This show explores the alchemy of hosiery.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c9a70ccc3d9742c1ac542ff2d2ddf6e66a3e47f/0_181_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8fad0a9c3abadbd0bf57605afe4ab362","title":"tacita dean storm clouds print to be sent to uk diplomatic offices globally","story":"The artist originally made chalk drawing, Foreign Policy, for Sir Simon McDonald’s London officeFor the artist Tacita Dean it represents fears over a gathering political storm. For the head of the UK’s diplomatic service, whose office it dominates, it represents hope that things will be all right.Whatever the interpretation, a screen print of the work is to be sent to government offices around the world, it was announced on Friday.The work is called Foreign Policy which Dean made for Sir Simon McDonald’s office in Whitehall after he became permanent under-secretary at the Foreign Office in 2015.The two met when McDonald was the UK’s ambassador to Berlin, where Dean was then based. They became friends and he turned to Dean to fill the “huge blank wall” in his office when he got the job.In 2016 it arrived. Because the work is not fixed chalk it can in theory be rubbed off. “If you were that way inclined you could destroy this in two minutes flat,” said McDonald. “I can reveal that Tacita brought chalks with her this morning just in case.”Dean said she made the work when the referendum to leave the EU was in the air. “I think I made it far too gentle. I think it should be way, way more angry.”McDonald concentrates less on the storm clouds and more on the light behind them. “It makes me feel better about life … it is the light breaking through that keeps me going.”The prints of the work are being commissioned by the Government Art Collection (GAC) for a 10-year project, which launched last year. The idea is that 30 prints are made, with 15 going to diplomatic buildings around the world. A further 11 will be sold by the Outset contemporary art fund to raise money for the GAC, and the remainder will be held by the artist and their dealer.The inaugural print was a vibrant still life by Hurvin Anderson, an edition of 32 which now hangs at No 10 Downing Street.The money for the initiative, called TenTen, has been given by the Walmart heir Sybil Robson Orr, a film and stage producer, and her husband, Matthew.

One of its central conceits was that two siblings who had lost a parent would speak in one voice, for each other, against each other, in a state of play. A language game of ever-mourning. For them, time was unfixed. Their childhoods, their growing into teenagers then adults, their notional futures as parents and as dead men themselves, this was all present in the nowness of their storytelling.These children were an autobiographical device. I had been trying to find a way of writing about what it is like to lose a parent. About growing up in cahoots with my time-travelling co-conspirator (my brother) along our illusory and twisting lateral axis, backwards and make-believe-forwards, about what seemed like a distinct way we had of seeing other people, granted to us by the absence. To us it seemed as if we had our own time and our own sight, defined by what we shared. And I had wanted to write about that, in an attempt to better grasp it.I had been to interview the poet Alice Oswald. Afterwards, she read my novel and wrote to me. She said she had identified in the book some truth, as regards grief: “I’m not really a fiction reader so the first thing I look for in any writing is its truth ... I’m interested in the being of grief not the feeling of grief.”She asked if I had read Denise Riley’s essay on atemporality, on mourning and time. I hadn’t. All I knew of it was that it related to the astonishing poem “A Part Song”. It is a long poem about maternal grief. It is about elegy, but rages against the elegiac mode, and takes its reader on an extraordinary journey.A few weeks later Riley’s book Time Lived, Without Its Flow arrived. I found that it was an essay about the being of grief. Its subject therefore is not death, but arrested time. Riley’s project is to describe and interrogate “that acute sensation of being cut off from any temporal flow after the sudden death of your child”. It is an essay about minutes, hours, days, weeks, months and years. It is also an essay that gathers into itself the poetry, philosophy and being grief of others.After reading it, I sat for some time with the small book in my hands marvelling that so few pages could have such an impact, could contain so much. I felt sure that I had emerged from the final pages quite changed, and I was grateful. A reader is changed by any text, but here the alteration felt fundamental. I felt I might never read poetry the same way again, and I felt I finally had some clarity about what happens to us who are still here when someone is suddenly gone. I can think of only a handful of works of art which have had such an instantaneous and welcome impact on me. Truthfully, I might have thrown my own book in the bin had it not already gone to the printers.Later, I discovered that Time Lived, Without Its Flow is one of those books that has been handed from reader to reader like a secret. Many people have told me that they were looking for something – as the poet who doesn’t read much fiction was looking for truth – and that they found it in this essay. I feel the same. Simply put, I was looking for a literary account of bereavement that did more than recreate or reshuffle existing (at best inadequate or boring, at worst idiotic or hopelessly sentimental) ways of writing about grief. I was looking for non-fiction burnished to the point of poetic intensity. I was looking for writing that carried in the very texture of its lines the remade relationship between a person gone and a person remaining. Not about grief, but fashioned of it and for it.I was looking for a single line as good as this: “I work to earth my heart.”The overwhelming characteristic of this essay is brilliant exactitude. It has the focused clarity of a recitation. It is profoundly powerful without so much as a whiff of melodrama. As with Riley’s poems, one needs to read certain lines over and over because of the sheer quality and complexity of the thinking within. Reflecting on the “paucity of accounts” of the arrested time she is experiencing, Riley asks: “Wherever is the literature – for it must exist, it’s needed – that deals closely with this strange arresting of time?” My pulse quickened when I read this. This had been my question too. And her asking is so deftly personal, and so clear, it reminds me (this can’t be coincidence, or a wishful trick of tonal transference) of my mum. And of my grandmother. It is a way of speaking that is part and parcel of maternal authority and experience. It both subtly contains and moves past a vocabulary of pain in the same quick gesture. It’s the brisk sureness of “it must exist” combined with the open-hearted simplicity of how much it is “needed”. How unusual to state so calmly in a critical context what is needed.It struck me as deliciously un-English (as jouissance is, as analysis is?). And it struck me as absolutely correct. “Yes!” I felt like screaming, “See? We need it!” How startling and unusual is Riley’s singular manner of essayism, which balances desire and theoretical rigour so generatively. It’s deep mastery. And then there’s her answer, which is to go on and make it. A literature of consolation. To create what doesn’t exist. Through and with poetry, because it is poetry that best deals with the “serious problems of what’s describable”.Riley has the scalpel-fine touch of a literary surgeon. And that she has turned this sharp tool on herself, on the writer in the world reckoning with classical agony the no-return of her son, means that this is literary criticism as love, and I have always hoped such a thing might exist, just as the poet hoped truth in fiction might exist. And Riley shows us how, in what ways, tentatively or objectively, this must be a maternal project. A continuation of the relationship she had with a living son. She shows us that the “time of the dead is, from now on, contained within your own”. Her son’s time is her own. What a wonderful idea. What a vital corrective to banal narratives of “moving on”, this radically un-deathly conception of an altered life. What a promise this might be to the living, that we will contain their time within our own once they are gone. “Time is the person,” she writes. How much brighter, wilder and more essential this feels as a formulation than any “blandly containing” concept of mourning.In contemplating Riley’s hesitant portrait of a maternal temporality, I wondered if I might begin to grope my way towards a paternal or fraternal way of holding the still living and the dead together, enduringly related. Sharing time. I understood that this might not necessarily be an esoteric or rarefied thing, or even a literary thing, but a straightforward, domestic thing. A manifestation of care. I could see a way to think it through. Riley’s essay is a permission giver. Each reader runs off with it, like Tom into the garden after the clock has struck 13. Ghost siblings, parents, friends, grandparents, the distant lives of others. The grief of groups, of nation states. From such a stunningly compelling analysis, for each of us, a way of being in the broken clock of the world might emerge. In times of spasmodic political upheaval, or extremism of opinion on national matters, I always think of Riley’s transpersonal “generational temporalities”. In Riley’s delicate formation we might mourn better. We might speak to each other and make sense of things better if we know better how we are living with the dead.This is not a sweet book, or an easy book, but I consider it to be a radically kind book. At the start of “A Part Song”, Riley asks: “You principle of song, what are you for now ...” I have sat with this book, and with Riley’s poems, and I have felt the critical sometimes angry dead read with me, and I have thought slantwise and differently about myself and them and others, and seen light in areas I had wanted to be flooded dark. And I have rejoiced and rushed to share the song with others. That is what it’s for.• A new edition of Time Lived, Without Its Flow is published by Picador on 3 October.

Since 1985 the series average is -12. In August 2019 the series fell to a low of -36 it was -34 in April 2008. Consumers are also expecting a big rise in unemployment.”Blanchflower, a professor of economics at the Ivy League Dartmouth College in the US, was the only member of the monetary policy committee to vote for interest rate cuts in early 2008, well ahead of the Lehman Brothers collapse in September that year.He said the Bank of England was repeating the same mistake by waiting until a downturn is crystal clear before acting to avoid it.However, redundancies among retail workers, a decline in job vacancies and a slowing in the rate of job hiring, has revealed a weaker employment market compared with earlier in the year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba7f435176154f38a127da16d2b4502ebad51e4a/6_0_1908_1145/master/1908.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de17c888b6c7c2bdcf6a5654b8e79eb2","title":"how has brexit vote affected the uk economy september verdict","story":"Each month we look at key indicators to see what effect the Brexit process has had on growth, prosperity and tradeThe pound has recovered some of its value since it dropped in August to a decade-low against the euro of €1.07. Sterling’s summertime blues were triggered by Boris Johnson’s declaration soon after becoming prime minister that the government would suspend parliament as it prepared to leave the EU without a deal. Turmoil in the commons triggered another fall in early September, when the pound hit a three-year low against the dollar of below $1.20. But by the middle of the month, the government’s insistence that it would prefer to strike a deal with Brussels pushed sterling back to $1.25 and €1.13.Fears that the two main drivers of global economic growth, China and the US, could be heading for a severe slowdown next year have frayed the nerves of traders across the main financial centres in London, Tokyo and New York. The US central bank, in a move to prevent the US economy from slowing, cut interest rates. Stock markets rewarded the Federal Reserve with a rally that took the Dow Jones Industrial Average from a two-month low of 25,479 on 14 August back up to a near-record 27,219 on 13 September. The FTSE followed suit, though with a more modest increase from 7,067 to 7,289.The slowdown in the British economy in recent months comes as the major economies of the EU have suffered the spillover effects of Brexit uncertainty and the US-China trade war. Consumers have tended to ride out fears of an economic slowdown, preferring to carry on spending. But consumer sentiment about the health of the economy, as measured by the European commission in its monthly barometer, fell in September to the biggest low since the 2012 euro crisis. Households feel better about their personal finances. However, they don’t like the look of what they see around them and are starting to worry in the same way they did seven years ago and clamp down on their spending."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/257a7cfc60a34be69f8b56a9f181b7770c51ae4a/0_207_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0193f40b1962710254b87a6855342ae","title":"chinese factory profits slowdown bank of england brexit stock markets oil business live","story":"BoE’s Michael Saunders says Brexit uncertainty could trigger interest rate cutThe latest economic data out of America is a little mixed.On the upside, Americans are more confidence about economic prospects, according to the University of Michigan.Peloton is one of those ‘hot’ companies, billing itself as a “social connection” firm. It’s premise is that health-conscious consumers can join classes remotely, creating a community buzz that encourages them to work up a sweat as they work out.The problem, I suspect, is that investors have spotted that Peleton is loss-making, doesn’t expect to make a profit until 2023, and sells rather expensive kit (£1,990 for the bike!) - suggesting its potential market may not be huge...There’s a lot of drama in the oil price today.Crude prices fell sharply, following reports that Saudi Arabia has agreed to a partial ceasefire in Yemen, where it has been fighting Houthi militants since 2015.This has bolstered hopes that tensions in the region could ease, following the attack on Saudi Aramco’s oil production site.Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, also excited the markets, by claiming that the US had offered to remove all sanction in exchange for talks.Rouhani said he hasn’t accepted the offer due to the current “toxic atmosphere”.The process to bring Thomas Cook’s holidaymakers home is continuing today.By the end of the day, the Civil Aviation Authority expects to have returned another 16,000 people. That means 77,000 customers will have been repatriated since the company went into liquidation on Monday morning.This isn’t much relief for the 9,000 Thomas Cook staff who are losing their jobs. But there is some hope there too. Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham says a jobs fair has been organised at Manchester Airport next week:Despite ongoing Brexit uncertainty, and the drop in eurozone business confidence, European stock markets are all rising today.London is leading the way, thanks to the weaker pound. But Germany is also up, on hopes that Berlin could boost public spending to boost growth.The EC’s next economic commissioner is also pushing for governments to spend more.Former Italian PM Paolo Gentiloni argued today, in written answers to lawmakers, that politicians should make “full use of the flexibility allowed in the rules” to raise public spending and support their economies.Over in the eurozone, economic sentiment has tumbled to its lowest level in five years.The European Commission reports that factories became even more glum this month, as trade war worries hit confidence.This “substantial deterioration” in industrial confidence dragged its monthly gauge of economic measure down to just 101.7 points from 103.1 in August. That’s the weakest since 2014.Michael Saunders’ speech has highlight the marked weakening of the UK economy over recent quarters, says Fiona Cincotta of City Index.She points out that Brexit uncertainty will linger for a long time, so the BoE will be cautious about risking higher interest rates. Even if the UK did manage to pull the rabbit out the bag and leave the EU with a deal, the elevated levels of uncertainty are unlikely to end there. Uncertainty over future trade agreements with the EU and other countries could leave companies in the lurch and unsure how to prepare for the different possible outcomes of those trade agreements.The other scenario, that Brexit is once again extended, would also mean continued uncertainty over the future. As BoE Governor Mark Carney pointed out earlier this month, this scenario could also lead to a rate cut.The Bank of England is right to keep interest rates low, argues Artur Baluszynski, Head of Research at Henderson Rowe.Even if we avoid a no-deal Brexit, the last three years have done enough damage to the UK economy to warrant a ‘lower for longer’ approach to interest rates.With a short average fixed-term period on their mortgages, UK households are very sensitive to any hikes in interest rates so unless we experience a currency crisis, the Bank of England should continue to keep the ‘cost of money’ reasonably low.”Here’s another chart from the Saunders speech, showing the drop in business investment since the Brexit vote:A no-deal Brexit could be very bad news for rural businesses, with fears that one in four could go bust.Farmers are particularly vulnerable to a no-deal Brexit because tariffs would be levied on exports, imports of cheap food could flood the market, and because decisions must be made now which will have an impact for the next year. Arable farmers are putting crops in the ground now for spring, and livestock farmers are preparing to breed sheep and other livestock for next year.Tim Breitmeyer, president of the Country Land and Business Association, said farms and the rural businesses that rely on them were not in a position to absorb the shock of Brexit, and estimates suggested a large number would be in danger.To no-one’s surprise, the drop in sterling has pushed up the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares.A weaker pound boosts the value of overseas earnings, so this is an obvious reaction to the pound’s drop.Sebastien Clements, currency analyst at OFX, says Michael Saunders’ dovish speech has given the pound a jolt: “Sterling had a rude awakening this morning, tumbling downwards after BoE member Saunders’ comments on the future of the British economy soured market sentiment. “Saunders considers current monetary policy inadequate, and claims the BoE could conceivably cut rates, even if a no-deal Brexit is avoided. “In a period of sustained market fickleness, we can expect the pound to reposition itself once further Brexit announcements are made.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b018232688a2be478f7e33772fad570cd9ed9eb/40_319_4865_2920/master/4865.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0db44d6087fd2710ede08290f9f68678","title":"lady hale pulled points bar work","story":"For all the talk of an industry in crisis, you have to hand it to the British media for their ability to get to the nub of a story. It was, one imagines, with a gasp of triumph that the Daily Mail was able to deliver a stinging blow to the president of the supreme court, Lady Hale, she of the spider brooch and the damning verdict on our prime minister’s prorogation wheeze. Via a stunned headline, the paper was this week able to reveal that Hale, who graduated top of her class at Cambridge in law, who was the first woman to be appointed to the Law Commission, and the second to be appointed to the court of appeal, was in fact an “ex-barmaid”. Truly, we must applaud this mighty organ’s dogged commitment to truth and scrutiny.I do worry about what sort of precedent this sets, however. When the day comes that I achieve something of professional import that has implications on the very notion of democracy, will I too be put through the media wringer? I may not have a law degree or a seat on the most powerful court in the land but, like Hale, I am an ex-barmaid. I’m also an ex-waitress, dishwasher and tour guide, and – my personal nadir – a former milk factory worker required to wear a hairnet and fetching paper suit. These jobs were executed through my late teens and early 20s with varying degrees of competency and enthusiasm. I still maintain, however, that my three years working behind a bar were the best fun I’ve ever had in a job.While no one is suggesting there’s anything heroic about waiting tables, having to make ends meet through assorted McJobs in your formative years can be character building and lead to a more rounded and compassionate view of the world. For me, bar work yielded all manner of skills, from teasing out the life stories of strangers to dealing with casual misogyny and the ability to unblock vomit-clogged toilets.More pointedly, these poorly paid starter jobs separate the grafters from the pampered layabouts. It’s always instructive to read about the likes of Hale, the daughter of schoolteachers who went to a grammar school and worked through her university years, being part of the remainer “elite”, versus such ordinary folk as the Eton- and Oxford-educated Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg. How many members of Oxford’s illustrious Bullingdon Club do we think could unblock a toilet or change a pub barrel?

Ministers assure us they are moving towards a deal. The European Union tells us they are not – because no new or viable proposals have been put forward by the British government. The prime minister tells us he wishes to have a deal with Europe. But we don’t see him sitting down in Brussels, hammering out an agreement.Lip service is paid to the unanimous judgment of the supreme court – that it was unlawful to prorogue parliament for five weeks – while the prime minister tells us the court was wrong and he was right. That is the cry of those found guilty of misdemeanours throughout the ages.Meanwhile, ministers continue to offer fantasy outcomes of what a post-Brexit future holds for people in every corner of our United Kingdom. As day succeeds day, it seems more likely that we will end up leaving the European Union without any deal at all. On Wednesday night, the prime minister wilfully destroyed any hope of cross-party agreement.The price of such a negotiating failure will be widespread and will affect rich and poor alike – with one difference: the poor will be far less able to protect themselves.Far more is at stake than simply our relationship with the European Union. At stake also is our relationship with the wider world and – because of the nature of our Brexit debate – very probably the future of our domestic politics as well.I don’t believe, after the schism Brexit has created, that we will be able to return to the status quo ante. The government constantly tells us that everyone is fed up with Brexit. So am I. They tell us everyone wants an end to Brexit. So do I. But no one should believe that Brexit will end on the day we leave – whether that is on 31 October, or beyond. Far from it. The impact of Brexit – both internally and externally – will be felt negatively for a very long time.From the outset, the government’s whole negotiating strategy – if such it can be called – has been driven by a desire to win the support of the anti-European hard right of the Conservative party, together with like-minded media.If the government is to get a deal if the House of Commons is to approve it if the scars of Brexit are to be diminished then there must be compromise in the negotiations. And not only compromise, but understanding – from both sets of negotiators. Little of that has been forthcoming.There is much talk of a general election. In the present atmosphere it would be likely to become the most unsavoury election of modern times. Until Brexit is resolved, a general election would solve nothing. It would merely fuel the current feeling of disillusionment and disunity. It may also be pointless, as the most likely outcome is another fragmented parliament – even more bitterly ided than it is now.So why is the government so keen to put our country through that? There may be a political calculation: they believe the Labour party is unelectable under the present leadership ministers know how serious the problems will be for the people of this country after a no-deal Brexit, and wish to have the election out of the way before the reality of the mess that lies ahead becomes clear.Let me put it another way: if the government was truly confident in the aftermath of their Brexit policy, they would wait for next spring, when they could take credit for the success of Brexit rejoice – even gloat – that all fears about it were unfounded and propose a few popular one nation policies to restore the fortunes of the Conservatives.But instead, to reinforce their electoral appeal, the government seems intent on whipping up dissent by using highly emotional and evocative language that can only provoke fear and anger, and fuel grievances against parliament and the law – inciting opposition to the most important bulwarks of our state and its freedom.Their approach is profoundly un-Conservative and – whatever its short-term effect – will do permanent damage to the reputation of the party. I cannot believe any previous government in our long history would have even considered such reckless and isive behaviour.We were promised, during the referendum campaign, that Brexit would “… restore parliamentary sovereignty and the supremacy of UK law”. For that reason, I am assuming there will be no further political trickery from this government.There is a contradiction between the act prohibiting the UK leaving the EU without a deal, and the prime minister’s continued assertion that he will leave on 31 October.My fear is that the government will seek to bypass statute law by passing an order of council to suspend the act until after 31 October. It is important to note that an order of council can be passed by privy councillors – that is government ministers – without involving the Queen.I should warn the prime minister that – if this route is taken – it will be in flagrant defiance of parliament and utterly disrespectful to the supreme court. It would be a piece of political chicanery that no one should ever forgive or forget.I am a lifelong Conservative. I hope our millions of traditional, moderate, middle-of-the-road supporters understand that this Conservative government’s present position is an aberration.Most Conservatives are not a Brexit party tribute band, nor have we abandoned our core values to find compromise, seek allies, and strive for unity, rather than ision and disarray. We abhor the language of ision and hate – and words such as “saboteur”, “traitor”, “enemy”, “surrender”, “betrayal” have no place in our party, our politics, nor in our society. It is emphatically not who we are as a people. And must never be seen as so.I hope the Conservative parliamentary party will regain its sense of balance, and rein in the faction of a faction that now prevails in cabinet.Now that parliament is sitting again, it has the opportunity to prove its quality, its strength, its purpose and its power. I hope that every member of parliament – from all parties – will unite together, and rise to that challenge.• John Major is a former prime minister.

As British broadcasters and journalists of colour, we demand it reconsidersOn 16 July 2019, President Trump tweeted that four congresswomen should “go back to the totally broken and crime-infested places from which they came”. All four congresswomen are people of colour, all four are US citizens and only congresswoman Ilhan Omar was born overseas. These comments were widely acknowledged as racist in a broad spectrum of reputable international news outlets, including the Washington Post, New York Times, CNN, MSNBC, Sky News and the .On 17 July 2019, Dan Walker, a host on BBC Breakfast, commented that a woman had shared a similar experience of being told to “go home” and that he found that remark “telling”. Walker added that the person in question had never been told that by the “man sitting in the Oval Office”.Walker asked his co-host Naga Munchetty how she felt, inviting personal commentary.In response to these remarks, Munchetty shared her own experiences of being told “as a woman of colour, to go back to where I came from” and added, “That was embedded in racism. Now, I’m not accusing anyone of anything here, but you know what certain phrases mean.”When asked by Walker how she felt about Trump’s remarks, she replied “furious”. “Absolutely furious and I can imagine lots of people in this country will be feeling absolutely furious a man in that position thinks it’s OK to skirt the lines by using language like that.”On 25 September, the BBC’s Editorial Complaints Unit (ECU) found Munchetty had breached the corporation’s guidelines in issuing this remark.We, the undersigned group of people of colour who work in the media and broadcasting in the UK, strongly condemn this finding and assert that it amounts to both a misunderstanding of the BBC’s editorial guidelines, and a form of racially discriminatory treatment towards BAME people who work on programming.The BBC’s editorial guidelines allow for “professional judgment, rooted in evidence”, and require “cultural views in other communities” to be taken into account. The ECU – which we believe does not reflect the erse cultural views in the BAME communities in the UK – has failed to acknowledge the following: Racism is not a valid opinion on which an “impartial” stance can or should be maintained For communities and iniduals who experience racist abuse – including Munchetty – being expected to treat racist ideas as potentially valid has devastating and maybe illegal consequences for our dignity and ability to work in a professional environment, as well as being contrary to race equality and human rights legislation To suggest a journalist can “talk about her own experiences of racism” while withholding a critique on the author of racism (in this case President Trump) has the ludicrous implication that such racism may be legitimate and should be contemplated as suchWhile we stand in support of Munchetty, the consequences of this decision are widespread with implications for the entire media landscape in the UK and those who work within it. The scope of its effect is already evidenced in the unprecedented number of BAME media figures who have openly and publicly voiced their condemnation on social media.In addition, we note the number of BBC journalists who have contacted us privately to express their concern at the climate of fear at the organisation, their feeling of being censored, and their apprehension at the consequences of their speaking out in support of this statement.1. The ECU revisits and takes seriously overturning its decision2. BBC management issue their support for journalists and acknowledge there can be no expectation of “impartiality” over expressions and experiences of racism3. The bodies that oversee complaints about broadcasting, including the ECU and Ofcom, address their own levels of ersity and increase transparency as to how they reach their decisions, and how that process takes place in a manner reflective of the ersity of the populationWe believe that, in addition to being deeply flawed, illegal and contrary to the spirit and purpose of public broadcasting, the BBC’s current position will have a profound effect on future ersity within the BBC. To suggest that future BAME broadcasters will be hired at the corporation on the premise that they remain “impartial” about how they feel about their experiences of racism is ludicrous. To require journalists of all ethnicities and races to endorse racism as a legitimate “opinion” is an abrogation of responsibility of the most serious nature.• This letter is signed by Afua Hirsch, Lenny Henry, Adrian Lester, Krishnan Guru-Murthy, Gina Yashere, Hugh Woozencroft, Gillian Joseph, Michelle Matherson, Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff, Elaine Dunkley, Amal Ahmed, Charlene White, Lina-Sirine Zitout, Marverine Cole, Tsedenia Skitch, Jayson Mansaray, Rabiya Limbada, Aaron Roach Bridgeman, Holly Henry-Long, Diana Evans, Anjana Ahuja, Katrina Marshall Beharry, Yemi Bamiro, Claire Clottey, Ayshah Tull, Shaista Aziz, Patrick Younge, Jamal Osman, Catherine Baksi, Liliane Landor, Bethel Tesfaye, Girish Juneja, Daniel Henry, Eno Adeogun, Dope Black Dads, Marvyn Harrison, Warren Nettleford, Nels Abbey, Henry Bonsu, Nisha Lahiri, Jordan Jarrett Bryan, Rowena Twesigye, Alex Murray, Asif Kapadia, Claudia-Liza Armah, Antoine Allen, Symeon Brown, Lynda Smith, Ayo Akinwolere, Reya El-Salahi, Warren Haughton, Anne Alexander, Ria Chatterjee, Natalie Morris, Seren Jones, Hila May, Sejal Karia, Jasmine Dotiwala, Toyin Amusan, Colin Salmon"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d047ca6365a57f03621bf8ab91c5538445ab34ee/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d067dd30b044ad4924e83713b3b7ac44","title":"top class finland schools envy world ofsted education","story":"After the party’s conference pledge to scrap Ofsted and private schools, does the envied Finnish education system provide the blueprint?It’s early afternoon in Lintulaakson school in Espoo, near Helsinki. The younger children are having a snack before starting their after-school activities. Upstairs a group of 12-year-olds are in a craft class, cutting patterns and making clothes on sewing machines.Outside, children play in an enormous outdoor space, equipped with a climbing frames, football pitches and basketball courts. “Hey, Petteri,” one boy yells casually at the principal, Petteri Kuusimäki. “Next year can we start school a bit later, at 10am?” Kuusimäki jokes with them. It’s all first names here.The Finnish education system is the envy of the world. Along with Tove Jansson’s Moomins, Nokia phones and Iittala glassware, it has become one of the country’s most celebrated exports – and it’s easy to see why.Its students consistently score well at the top end of the Pisa international league tables, and as Kuusimäki walks me round his school he describes a kind of education utopia – a place where teachers are highly trained, revered and trusted, and children’s wellbeing is paramount.There are no Ofsted-style inspections, no streaming by ability, no national exams until 18, no school uniforms, no school league tables and no fee-paying private schools.At its party conference this week, Labour committed to follow Finland’s lead and not only scrap Ofsted but abolish private schools by forcing them to integrate them in the state sector. Explaining the policy, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, told BBC Radio 4: “In some countries, it is not allowed to charge for education in any form … in Finland, for example.”The British Labour party is far from alone in its enthusiasm for the Finnish education system. Every year hundreds of delegations of teachers and policymakers from all over the world pour into Helsinki to see this nirvana for themselves. So popular has it become that international visits are strictly regulated and have to be paid for – a presentation costs €682 (£607) per hour and a school visit €1,240.In the past two months there have been groups from Israel, Brazil, China and Korea. In the coming weeks there will be visits from New Zealand and Lithuania.Meanwhile, Finland’s influence is spreading far and wide. Last month a school opened in Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam based on the Finnish curriculum and pedagogical approach, with Finnish staff on the teaching team.Kuusimäki tells me Finland’s schools are well-funded and built around the principle of equality of opportunity for all pupils. He is baffled when I try to explain that some state schools in England are so strapped for cash that they are asking parents for donations. “As you may know, everything is free in Finland,” he says, university included.There is just one fee-paying school in the country, the International School of Helsinki, which has mainly catered for international employees of Nokia and other industries. Otherwise, charging fees is illegal and parents are happy by and large to send their children to their local school. “We really don’t have bad schools,” Kuusimäki says.In class children are listened to and respected, school lunches are free, detentions are rare and exclusions pretty much unheard of. Kuusimäki gave his last detention 15 years ago, and is visibly horrified at the idea of excluding a child from school. “As a principal, you can’t think like that. We are responsible for these children and their lives. We can’t give up.”A compulsory pre-school year for six-year-olds has been introduced to help with school-readiness, and there is talk of starting even earlier, while the minimum school leaving age has recently been raised to 18. Meanwhile, parents “shopping for schools” is on the increase.Finnish education experts would be the first to admit they do not have all the answers and methods in one country do not always translate to another. John Jerrim, professor of education and social statistics at the University College London Institute of Education, does not believe England should be looking to Finland. “Its Pisa scores have actually been in decline. And there is no reason to believe their high scores on international tests are due to their schools. So there is no reason to try to copy Finland.”Not even on outlawing school fees? “The resource will just be shifted elsewhere,” Jerrim says. “There are lots of potential unintended consequences, for example, pushing up house prices near good schools.”In 2013 the celebrated Finnish educator Pasi Sahlberg paid a visit to Eton College, the most famous of the UK’s ancient, elite boarding schools. Once a maths and science teacher in Helsinki, Sahlberg now tours the world spreading the word about the wonders of Finnish education and advising on education reform.“It was like going 200 years backwards in time,” Sahlberg recalls of his visit. “I remember thinking while walking the corridors of Eton and watching students there that even if I had a chance to enrol my own kids to that school I would probably say ‘no, thank you’.”With its illustrious history, bizarre uniforms and £40,000 a year fees, Eton – which educated the current British prime minister and many before him – is a million miles from the modern egalitarianism of Finland’s schools.“I am often asked by people what is the most important thing I learned in school,” Sahlberg says. “I say that to learn to understand that there are different kinds of people in this world and that regardless where we come from we can be in same school and learn in same classroom. Eton boys won’t learn that in their school.”Like Jerrim, Sahlberg is sceptical about other countries trying to simply copy the Finland model. “There are so many myths about what the Finnish system is and is not. This idea of copying has done a lot of damage.” Finland’s schools are rooted in the country’s distinctive history and culture the population is small (5.5 million), and taxes are high.“You can’t go to Finland and cherry-pick the things that seem to be interesting and say, ‘We want to do like Finland is doing’. It’s much more complicated than that.” He also thinks it’s unrealistic for Labour to promise to abolish private schools. “It’s come too far this whole private education thinking. It’s very hard to remove it altogether.”It would be better, he says, for Labour to focus on strengthening the existing state sector in England, which has become fragmented through academisation and free schools. “Just abolishing something, saying private schools should be made illegal, it’s not going happen.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6f60d396614aee6e20f5eaa86998990664fbd27/0_61_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4730418ad26f43506a6521b3c54fd12a","title":"fresh wave of climate strikes take place around the world","story":"Hundreds of thousands hit streets across continents to demand action on climateHundreds of thousands of people around the world are taking place in the latest wave of climate strikes to demand urgent action on the escalating ecological emergency.Last week, millions walked out of schools and workplaces, uniting across timezones, cultures and generations in the biggest climate protests in history before a special UN conference in New York.Organisers said they were expecting another huge turnout on Friday, with demonstrations planned from Canada to the Netherlands, Sweden to Morocco, Italy to India.An open-letter signed by 11,000 New Zealanders was delivered to parliament on Friday morning calling on the government to declare a climate emergency – following the lead of numerous councils around the country.“Our representatives need to show us meaningful and immediate action that safeguards our futures on this planet,” Raven Maeder, the School Strike 4 Climate national coordinator, said. “Nothing else will matter if we cannot look after the Earth for current and future generations. This is our home.”As part of the Earth Strike events, there are also expected to be big demonstrations in South America from Mexico City’s vast Zócalo square to the Plaza de Mayo in Buenos Aires.Activists say Plaza Italia in Santiago, Chile, will be flooded with demonstrators from 6pm, while protests will be staged in cities in Brazil, Bolivia, Ecuador and Paraguay around the rim of the Amazon rainforest.On Bogotá’s high Andean plain, the environmental movement has faced a severe crackdown. In July, protesters across the country pleaded for an end to the violence that has resulted in numerous activists being killed, with peace and development thinktank Indepaz putting the figure at 734 deaths in the first seven months of 2019.“We want to keep fracking out of our country and demand an immediate change towards decarbonisation,” said the activist Susana Muhamad, who was planning to march past the offices of the country’s largest petroleum company, Ecopetrol, at midday. More than 30 events have been planned in Argentina, where crowds will be marching across the capital from the Plaza de Mayo to the seat of the national congress.Among them will be Stephanie Cabovianco, a 30-year-old activist from Buenos Aires. “There are no outright leaders coordinating our movement in Latin America – and that’s a good thing,” she explains. “This is a fight led by young people, and its structure should be as horizontal as possible.”The strikes are a sign of the growing awareness and anger of the severity and scale of the climate crisis among people around the world.Earlier this week, Thunberg excoriated world leaders at the UN for their “betrayal” of young people after the New York summit failed to deliver ambitious new commitments to address dangerous global heating.The climate activist told governments: “You are still not mature enough to tell it like it is. You are failing us. But the young people are starting to understand your betrayal.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d27d832fa9a0190a16a5f9763e954cc17cfe725/0_291_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ef04d74b03c519ec0e3fef9df90642e","title":"uk roadsides verge wildlife corridors guidelines wildflowers","story":"New guidelines could save councils money and lead to 400bn more wildflowersBritain could enjoy 400bn more flowers if road verges were cut later and less often according to guidelines drawn up by wildlife charities, highways authorities and contractors.The national guidance for managing roadside verges for wildflowers calls for just two cuts a year – instead of four or more – and only after flowers have set seed, to restore floral ersity and save councils money. It would also provide grassland habitat the size of London, Birmingham, Manchester, Cardiff and Edinburgh combined.The recommendations have been produced by the wildlife charity Plantlife, backed by national highways agencies, the industry bodies Skanska and Kier, as well as Natural England and other environmental groups.Trevor Dines, a botanical specialist at Plantlife, said: “Publishing these new guidelines endorsed by so many influential players is an exciting step forward. Widespread adoption of this best practice management by councils and their contractors could transform our road verge network.“Grassy verges cover an area equivalent to all our remaining lowland species-rich grassland so this new approach can literally double the opportunities for wildflowers and wildlife.”Matt Tompsett, the senior environment and sustainability manager at Kier, said: “For too long our roadside verges have been neglected and under-utilised, with their potential as wildlife havens and corridors unrealised. These new guidelines demonstrate just how easily this can be changed with some simple tweaks to management regimes helping to achieve bioersity net gain and a save a little money in the process.”The guidance recommends different numbers of cuts depending on the type of grassland but with several key principles – no cutting before the end of July, and the removal of all grass cuttings to lower soil fertility and allow a more erse range of wildflowers to flourish.The guidelines concede that some residents and road users view wildflower-rich verges as “untidy and neglected” but says managers can cut narrow strips around the wilder verges to frame them – “a simple but effective way to give the perception of tidiness and help offset potential negative feedback”.Clare Warburton, the principal green infrastructure adviser for Natural England, welcomed the “cost-effective, practical solutions” in the new guidance. “Road verges can be designed and managed to support an array of wildlife, as well as helping us tune into nature on our daily walk, cycle or drive,” she said.“A great multitasker, nature on the road verge does a number of jobs like cleaning the air, storing carbon, pollinating crops and providing sustainable drainage.”Phil Sterling, a programme manager at Butterfly Conservation, said: “The new guidance provides practical, realistic and affordable examples of how to turn road verges into wildlife corridors.“We can and must change the way we create and manage road verges, to encourage wildflowers, butterflies, moths and other insects. The guidance also shows it can cost us less to do exactly that.”Red clover and lady’s bedstraw, two of the roadside wildflowers that support the highest number of invertebrates, are among the plants experiencing the most rapid decline.According to Plantlife, wildlife-friendly management of verges has saved councils money in recent years, with Dorset council estimating it reduced the cost of verge management by more than £100,000 since 2004."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1dac882a14bc5426b6ee8b25cac04eb2cae67f2c/0_0_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5649ed6da4237be32d1099bda781a1f","title":"communities coping with climate change in pictures","story":"This week the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will release a special report, which the WWF has contributed to, laying out in stark detail the impact of the melting of frozen regions on oceans and coastal areas.

For her, clothes are about identity, history and craft and definitely not about the “thigh gap”. She values intrigue over prettiness. Her cultural choices – what she reads and the exhibitions she goes to – are at least as important to her self-image as anything she wears.She probably watches Killing Eve, this woman, so it makes perfect sense that Jodie Comer – AKA Villanelle – stars in the advertising campaign for Loewe, the craft-luxe brand that presented its springsummer 2020 collection in Paris on Friday morning.The set – a series of white-curtained antechambers created within the brutalist concrete curves of the Unesco heritage building – set the tone. Seven-feet-high shimmering amethyst geodes stood sentry, while fluffy clusters of pampas grass – a plant with undeniable connotations – were dotted around. Just before the first model stepped out they started to twirl slowly, to eccentric effect.The show presented a continuation of the Loewe template: fine fabrics, artisanal details and a flattering fit-and-flare silhouette.This season there was more precision, the designer Jonathan Anderson – who also runs JW Anderson – said backstage.Innovations included three dresses with dramatic panniers, made in fine buttercream, lilac and black lace, their white trimming echoing corsetry boning. “I liked exploring hips this season,” said Anderson, adding that he had been looking at the 16th and 17th century, playing with proportions and had taken inspiration from the silhouettes in Irving Penn’s photography. “I wanted it to be aristocratic,” he said.There were voluminous smock-like dresses and exaggerated collars in Pierrot and puritan styles. Long petal sleeves created a liturgical tone. A series of white dresses in delicate fabrics – Japanese satin, geometric, guipure, chantilly and marguerite lace – felt at times like christening, communion or bridal gowns.It was definitely sexy, with bra tops and a lot of transparency – perhaps that was what the pampas grass was about. At times it felt pagan, with a touch of the bucolic horror film Midsommer to the aesthetic.Likely hits included the mackintoshes – one was oversized, with tendrils flowing to the floor, another was neat and A-line, with a contrasting leather collar. The bags, which are Loewe’s bread and butter, included a soft bucket-shaped balloon bag, particularly covetable in crochet raffia.The Comer advertising campaign – which went viral days before the show – features the Killing Eve actor staring into a mirror and saying “Loewe” repeatedly while acting out a series of emotions: sorrow, indignation, gratitude. Loewe is not a brand that everyone knows, and the fact that to the uninitiated its name is probably unpronounceable is surely part of the joke.Since Phoebe Philo left Celine, almost two years ago, Loewe’s aesthetic has become the dominant force in a look pegged as the decade’s most influential by the ’s Jess Cartner-Morley, who described it as “ceramicist with a private income”.Sadly, with clothes this beautiful, the private income bit would be essential for top-to-toe Loewe, but the collection’s influence will be felt far and wide. Judging by the reaction to the show, it may well dominate the next decade too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd70285df4f67fc991fc3ad2d7b3d8095f5f6ce4/1_0_4165_2500/master/4165.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=069c530593d0b4ab3162da9535657ad0","title":"this isnt a paranoid future nightmare the explosive return of chris morris","story":"The satirist’s new film was inspired by the FBI’s attempts to manufacture terrorists. He talks about the problem with white liberals – and his duty to provokeChris Morris first saw the reports on Sky News. The FBI had arrested an army planning “full ground war” on the United States. A massive jihadi battalion, trained in Miami but backed by al-Qaida, was promising to “kill all the devils we can” – starting with Chicago’s most famous skyscraper, Sears Tower.That was in 2006. Two years later, Morris got a tipoff from someone involved in the trial that the case could be “a bit whiffy”. In fact, it was a colossal stitch-up. The bureau’s biggest counterterrorism scalp of recent times was, says Morris, “all a huge lie, before it was called fake news. Totally manufactured nonsense.”Six broke builders in Liberty City – the impoverished suburb of Miami where Moonlight was shot – had fallen under the sway of a local preacher. Narseal Batiste’s cut-and-paste philosophy involved Haitian Catholicism, Judaism, karate – and a dash of Islam. He mouthed off but lacked the funds, foresight or any particular desire to take things further.So the FBI paid informants, including a convicted rapist, to pose as emissaries from al-Qaida and egg Batiste on to accept $50,000 with the promise he would spend it on guns and explosives. He never did. “Instead they wanted work boots and overalls, because they were construction workers, then ceremonial swords and horses to lead a protest to the governor’s house about living conditions in Liberty City.”Morris chucks up his hands, still agog, 13 years later. “Their idea was to push Sears Tower into a lake and swamp Chicago with a tidal wave. None of which is remotely possible. They might as well have wanted to invade Washington DC on hippos.”Only one of the seven had any familiarity with the tower. They had no weapons or contact with anyone not being bankrolled – and scripted – by the FBI. The deputy director himselfadmitted any plans were “more aspirational than operational”. Eventually, five of them were sentenced to a total of 44 years in prison.Next month sees the release of The Day Shall Come, the movie Morris made after being inspired by the case, along with the 400 or so similar ones he has come across since 911. He estimates one arrest is made every three weeks of a suspect the FBI has coached into declaring terrorist intent. “It’s harder to capture real terrorists than it is to manufacture your own. And as someone at the Department of Justice said to me: ‘We’re not going to stop a system unless it doesn’t work.’”The film’s hero is Moses (Marchant Davis), who runs a community farm and preaches peaceful revolution – aided by dinosaurs, summonable by trumpet – to a congregation of four, including his wife and young daughter. But a local informant (Kayvan Novak) shops him to a needy FBI agent (Anna Kendrick), eager to impress her boss (Denis O’Hare), himself in need of a high-profile victory. With the aid of a fake sheikh, a literal gift horse for Moses (with whom he talks), and some empty uranium canisters, a case is constructed. Lives are at stake. More pressingly, so are promotions.Save for directing a few episodes of Veep, this is Morris’s first project since 2010’s Four Lions. He says that he is not concerned the films might be seen as too similar, that only the dopey would confuse the two. “They relate only in terms of the Wikipedia heading you might lazily use. Four Lions is about a group of terrorists and the flawed male psychology of the typical bunch of guys that constitutes that kind of cell. This is about a group of people the government decides are terrorists. About governments betraying citizens in the name of some bogus war on terror, flawed in its conception and execution.”This is also Morris’s first full interview for almost a decade. Today, the most mysterious man in British comedy is wearing shorts, a T-shirt and a checked shirt that, later, he will suddenly unbutton and remove. He has ridden to his agent’s office in Fitzrovia from Brixton, where he lives with his literary agent wife and two sons, on his own trusty steed: a white racer with brass bell and vast panniers. The bike is his own friend and confidant, “partly because it doesn’t talk back”.Morris has the alpha confidence of having been the cleverest man in the room for most of his 57 years, and probably the tallest, even without the ringlets on top. A lean wolf dressed as an off-duty headmaster, he also has the longest fingers I’ve ever seen, which rap the table for emphasis or amazement or exasperation. It gets quite a hammering.Make no mistake: The Day Shall Come is different from Four Lions. Like much of his TV work, that film was an audacious mockery of known bogeymen, albeit slightly more deadly than the claptrap current affairs shows of The Day Today and Brass Eye, or the hipsters of Nathan Barley.The Day Shall Come, however, is a further departure: an imagined riff on an institutional injustice that – by Morris’s own admission – has taken him 10 years to gen up on. I loved it. It has a wallop rare in cinema today when you have done the immersive research, he says, “you’re committed to wallop”.The films he prizes highest – Come and See, The Battle of Algiers, Son of Saul – involve “quite insane levels of commitment. False button-pushing has to be resisted as an article of faith. Resist full sentimentality! Set fire to the screen!”But does The Day Shall Come assume too much knowledge on the part of the audience? Reaction so far seems split between those with recognition of the situation and those without. A black audience in Philadelphia, Morris reports, responded with nods. “‘Yeah, the law is a mincing machine, they’ll take advantage of any frailty you’ve got.’” They indulged Moses and “laughed across an icy ide” at the FBI. “You think: ‘Oh, this actually is the firing range. We’re sitting in it.’”Morris’s core audience, though, has exhibited a little resistance. Perhaps such people only like to be challenged so far? “Oh God, white liberals are terrible! They’re awful! There’s a sort of feeling that they’ve done the due diligence on their own conscience and if somebody comes in and says something else bad about them, that person must be wrong.“Of course, I’m talking about my friends here. It’s a sort of privileged position whereby your conscience is allowed to operate in a particular way, without fracturing your worldview. Then they go and have a bracing latte.”Morris has the flippant strictness of someone who has done his homework and is unsurprised you haven’t. He didn’t feel awkward being a white man telling a black man’s story, he says, “because I felt the story had rather rudely impinged itself on me. It was a colour blind inquiry I was trying to hunt down a lie. And I ended up looking at a system where mainly white people are manipulating mainly black and brown people. That’s the way the gradient is shaped. And people were extremely welcoming, despite my sort of alien appearance.”He says that he never considered making a documentary, much as he delights and despairs in the zany details of the real-life cases: the FBI informant sent to infiltrate a Californian mosque who so overdid it, the mosque reported him to the FBI the fake imam the bureau devised to try and radicalise a Chicago carjacker whose own imam denounced violence. “They made up their own ideological godfather!”No wonder people often laugh when they are being arrested. “It’s so strongly against their sense of reality. They’ve been living in a Truman Show existence, and then they’ve bumped into the wall.”Yet he still insisted his film be fiction. “You have to be seductive. There’s a universal story at the heart of this film that’s quite hard to ignore. It doesn’t mean it’s going to work. But what can you do? You have to point things out. And if you run into a room and say: anybody who doesn’t agree is a fucking idiot, you’ve elected to preach to the converted.”He swigs his coffee – black americano, not bracing latte – and gives the table a breather. “But I may be talking old-fashioned nonsense language. Because the way to persuade people might be to measure what they think, treat them like a Skinner animal: put some stimulus in their way that makes them behave differently.”Spend two hours with Morris and you start to realise that, unlike most people in film or TV or comedy, or even journalism or politics, he is a scientist. – one who happens to like working in the humanities. Raised by two doctors, Morris studied zoology at Bristol, and has essentially been practising it ever since. His mind is as much analytical as imaginative. Institutional irrationality annoys, as do non-contextual metrics and linguistic slippage. At one point I ask if he thinks we need “seismic change”. He explains that the word only applies to earthquakes and volcanoes, so he would have to be in “a certain kind of extreme water to suggest that’s what we need”. Such keen observational skills might also explain the sometimes messianic impression he leaves. It’s a bit misleading: Morris is perfectly nice and kind and calm as he completely wipes the floor with you.It was during his time at Bristol that he was introduced to operant conditioning, the system pioneered by the American behavioural psychologist BF Skinner, who stuck rats and hermit crabs in (separate) boxes, exposed them to variant forces and recorded their reactions. Morris has de facto been doing this to us for decades. Think what we can still learn from, say, the celebrities who appeared on Brass Eye’s drugs episode and Paedogeddon! special, from the media fallout and the reaction of others to what has or has not happened since to reporting, witch-hunting and moral panic.Actual human-sized Skinner machines are around already, Morris thinks. We’re just kidding ourselves that we’re not trapped in them. The other day, an AA man showed Morris the snazzy monitoring kit in his van, which even recorded how long before a junction he indicated. “I said: ‘Isn’t that creepy?’ He said: ‘Not really. My daughter’s just passed her driving test and I’ve got half-price insurance for her. And all I have to do is install a black box recorder in the car and a camera on the dashboard that measures exactly how she drives and the character of her facial movements. As long as she stays within the parameters set by the insurance company, her premium stays low.’”Soon, such tech will run in real time, thinks Morris. “So any change in her facial alignments will be picked up and a friendly warning on the dashboard will say: ‘You’re looking a bit tired, there’s a Costa three miles on the right. If you pop in, your insurance level stays low.“Suddenly, you’ve got a Skinner machine that will nudge you in the direction that it wants you to behave. And we just happily ignore it! Or think it’s amusing. The problem with Black Mirror is it’s set in the future. But this isn’t a paranoid future nightmare. It’s just casually what’s happening in the name of being helpful.”Morris uses a 2G phone. It’s not that he’s particularly worried about being bugged, as he just assumes we all are anyway. What concerns him is the casual way we “volunteer data in the interest of some convenience we don’t really need, which is probably going to come back and bite you on the arse much harder than the FBI would”.He sighs. People are beasts of instinct, not logic. The seriously poor residents of Liberty City – like those men stung by the FBI – voted Trump because “people’s sense of what should happen is very, very driven by exactly where they are, and what they think about the status quo. We may look upon it as rash or self-damaging, but it doesn’t feel like that.” Plus, if one person thinks they might have found an escape route, the rest of the tribe will cluster. “We were a bubble species long before the internet.”Touring the world with Four Lions, says Morris, confirmed his view that “every human being is slightly racist and every nation has a different way of being racist”. Australia especially so, he thinks. “When did they repeal the White Australia Act? 1975? It’s like a time-slip.” America is “raw” because of its recent slavery Britain’s racism is stranger, more complicated, but no less dismaying.The shirt has come off, replaced by a neon cycling jacket for the trip home. Talk turns inevitably to Brexit and Boris Johnson, on whom Morris is reluctant to pass judgment because – ever the scientist – he hasn’t observed him up close. Still, he does suspect that today’s leaders are “giving signals that allow people to walk out into the street and shout their worst thoughts. When, actually, you should have just kept it to yourself, mate.”And, just in case any of those white liberals happen to be reading: this means you. “You have very, very bien pensant liberals who are just bloody racist about Muslims. People saying: ‘Well, I think they should dress more carefully, because otherwise they’ll make you feel awkward on the tube and you don’t know what’s under those garments and they’re weird anyway.’” The table gets a final smack. “Come on, guys! We can do better than that.”The Day Shall Come opens in the US on 27 September and in the UK on 11 October. An Australian release has not yet been set."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e7d2e8b46191e74c393d405145f0b79a4ce6802/0_58_4440_2664/master/4440.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ee5054bc1350036c181a5c0e2694b43","title":"us cinemas ban masks and costumes at joker screenings","story":"Following concerns about the potential for violence, several chains will not allow face coverings or clothing that ‘would make other guests feel uncomfortable’Major cinema chains in the US have announced that they will enforce bans of masks, costumes and toy weapons at screenings of Joker, the new film starring Joaquin Phoenix as Batman’s nemesis, as concerns about the potential for violence connected to the film’s release on 4 October circulate.Security concerns were raised on Tuesday when families of victims of the 2012 shooting in Aurora, Colorado, at a midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises, wrote to Warner Bros condemning gun violence in the film and asking them to withdraw funding from politicians who oppose gun law reform. The studio’s reply said the film was not “an endorsement of real-world violence of any kind”. However, Joker will not be showing at the Century Aurora and XD theatre where the shooting took place.A bulletin issued by US army officials at a base in Oklahoma suggested that the FBI had collected intelligence of a “credible potential mass shooting” connected to the film after “disturbing and very specific” discussions on the dark web. However, police in Los Angeles issued a statement playing down possible threats, saying: “While there are no credible threats in the Los Angeles area, the department will maintain high visibility around movie theatres when it opens.”Box office tracking suggests Joker will collect more than $80m on its opening weekend, a record for October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2dac61852a1e3739d74e1b02723c78dc835c2347/0_566_3209_1926/master/3209.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f37311c9d9cef19e6075d31300394d80","title":"premier league team news injury updates and and more live","story":"Nobody said it was easyNo one ever said it would be this hardOh take me back to the start ...This is tenuous Premier League news at best ... but here it goes while we wait for Unai Emery, who is apparently running behind schedule owing to a longer-than-anticipated training session and a squad photo.

And here’s a meaningless quirk: Simpson will wear the No 17 shirt at Huddersfield – the same number he wore when winning the Premier League title ...Unai Emery is running late – so get yer fix below for the time being:Unai Emery is up shortly, with the Arsenal manager expected to confirm Granit Xhaka as the team’s permanent captain. A youthful side breezed past Nottingham Forest in midweek, with the 18-year-old Gabriel Martinelli, who scored twice, among those catch Emery’s eye. “He deserves it,” Emery said. “He has worked and trained with big spirit and a big performance.” Leicester City team news: Brendan Rodgers says midfielder James Maddison is a doubt for the Newcastle game on Sunday. “He’s put some weight on his ankle so we’ll see over the coming days,” Rodgers says. “He’s a big talent and he’s been playing great. We’ve got a really strong squad. We made some changes in the week, and the rhythm, speed and intensity in the team was the same. It’s just the risk of whether he’s going to last the game or not. He’s such a talented player, we’ll give him every chance.”Some murmurs in Manchester that Bernardo Silva submitted a letter to the FA on Thursday, in which he expressed regret for any unintentional offence caused as a result of that tweet, stressing that that was not his intention. Mendy has reportedly also issued a supporting statement, outlining he did not take offence. Earlier, his manager Pep Guardiola said: “It was just a joke. The same happened a thousand million times with white people, it’s the same. If someone is offended I can understand it. Bernardo is maybe going to take a lesson from it and it won’t happen again.”Pep Guardiola speaks. He settles into his chair at Manchester City’s auditorium and is straight on to the defensive regarding that Bernardo Silva tweet. “If they believe, other people believe, if the FA believe Bernardo is this type of player, they are completely wrong,” he says. “They judge one joke, I judge three years of work with him, every single day how he is, his friendship. Benjamin is like a brother for Bernardo. It was just a joke. The same happened a thousand million times with white people, it’s the same. Maybe Bernardo will take a lesson and it will not happen again.” It’s not all doom and gloom at Hotspur Way, for Moussa Sissoko has signed a king new four-year contract. That’s a long-term renewal for a Spurs player in their 30s, which represents a considerable change of tack. The midfielder, a £30m signing from Newcastle in 2016, has made eight appearances this season. Norwich City team news: goalkeeper Tim Krul is out but right-back Max Aarons will be part of the squad at Crystal Palace. “It’s still a bit doubtful with Ralf Fahrmann as well,” says manager Daniel Farke. “We are still missing Christoph Zimmermann and Timm Klose as well. Mario Vrancic is still out as is Onel Hernández. I hope a few players return after the international break. It’s important to gain points now, even with this situation.”Aston Villa team news: Henri Lansbury is back jogging but remains out, while James Chester, who played in an Under-23s game on Monday, is still a few weeks away from first-team action. Jonathan Kodjia is back training, “looking like a super-hero”, says manager Dean Smith owing to the face mask he has been wearing after fracturing a cheekbone. Villa host Burnley on Saturday in search of a first Premier League win in four matches. “I look at the eight games we have played this season and I think only Tottenham have been better than us,” says Smith, whose Villa side enter the weekend in the relegation zone. United’s season may well be grim, but it will still be gripping. They’re like the England cricket team now – forever landing on the ladder or the snake, skipping the dull squares in betweenSo, Fikayo Tomori, Tammy Abraham, Hudson-Odoi and Reece James could all feature at Stamford Bridge this weekend. More brownie points incoming for the Chelsea academy. What about Christian Pulisic, a £58m signing? The USA winger started in midweek against Grimsby. Lampard has had his say. I have four wingers to chose from now they are all fit. Pulisic we forget is 21 because of the price tag. It is normal to have an adaptation period. He has shown some good moments this season and in pre-season but he must do it daily. He needs time to adapt but we support him on that. His time will come.” Chelsea team news: Antonio Rüdiger will not feature against Brighton owing to a recurring groin injury, says Frank Lampard. The Chelsea boss also confirms Reece James and Callum Hudson-Odoi, who featured in midweek, will be included in his 18-man squad. Andreas Christensen is ready to rumble, while Olivier Giroud could feature following illness. Emerson Palmieri, Lampard says, is likely to return after the international break. Another big plus that Ruben Loftus-Cheek has been outside jogging this week. Good news for West Ham! Manuel Lanzini is in the squad for Saturday’s trip to Bournemouth after returning to training. Michail Antonio and Winston Reid remain absent from the travelling party. Asked if Bournemouth can battle their way into the top six, Manuel Pellegrini said: “We are just starting the season and we know that a lot of clubs – Everton, Aston Villa, and more –have a lot of good squads and can be involved in that position.”Manuel Pellegrini says he fancies West Ham to bounce back from a humbling 4-0 defeat to Oxford by giving Bournemouth a pasting: Of Saturday’s opponents, he says:  It is a team that plays offensive football, with two strikers and Joshua King on the left side, which is like another striker. We must be concentrated in defending but we will go for the three points like always and attack from the first minute.”A quick glance at the Championship, and it’s a mightily big game for Nathan Jones and Stoke against Nottingham Forest tonight. Stoke host in-form Forest having not tasted victory since April and not won before their home fans for 209 days and counting. Jones did not speak to the media pre-match, with his assistant, Paul Hart, giving him a breather amid the pressure. Get a load of Dani Alves talking Bahia, Brazil and Barcelona:I’m going after that dream to be champion, to close an era with the Brazilian national team, to help my country get back on top. You know what motivates me most? When everybody stops believing in me. When they say: ‘This guy is worthless, this guy can’t play in midfield, can’t do this or that.’ Just wait. On the way there I’m going to work like a filho da puta, like I’ve done all my life. That’s why I came here. I was comfortable in Europe, but I like discomfort. Nothing in life is easy. If you want to reach you objectives, you have to make the effort. Unless your dad owns the team – when my dad ran our São Paulo, I always played and played up front.”Here we go again – and down an extremely familiar path this time. We are talking potential takeovers of Newcastle United – reports of deals being supposedly close tend to average about two a year – and the news that Peter Kenyon is back for a second attempt at trying to buy Mike Ashley out.This time the former Chelsea and Manchester United chief executive has teamed up with GACP sports – a Florida based investment firm who hold a 14 per cent stake in Bordeaux – and they have produced a 46-page document outlining their plans for Newcastle should Ashley agree to a £125m down payment with the remainder of the £300m asking price paid in instalments over three years. Kenyon would be chief executive.While the brochure is genuine it all seems highly unlikely to actually happen. As Ashley himself said in a rare interview in the summer when a successful takeover at St James’ Park finally happens the overwhelmingly odds are that it will be conducted in such discretion no one bar the involved parties will get a hint of anything being in the offing until it is announced. Manchester City’s Abu Dhabi buyout serves as the template for the deals that actually happen rather than are merely talked up. Newcastle, as is their habit in such situations – think Amanda Staveley, think the Dubai-based Bin Zayed Group, think Kenyon’s initial attempt – are saying nothing but the brochure raised more questions than answers. Not least why would a buyer confident of pulling off a takeover leak details to a newspaper?As Steve Bruce, who said the first he heard of it was Friday morning and that he had not spoken to Ashley recently, said: “Watch this space”He did not add “with a considerable degree of scepticism” but such an approach is probably prudent ...Steve Bruce says he is in the dark with regards to yet more talk of a Newcastle takeover. Reports this morning suggest Peter Kenyon, the former Manchester United and Chelsea chief executive, has launched a £300m bid for the club. “It’s happened that many times,” said Bruce, “even from reading about it from afar. At this club, in particular, there’s always speculation surrounding it and it’s never happened. Let’s watch this space. You have to get used to it. It’s happened to me three or four times previously.”Could 17-year-old Mason Greenwood get the nod against Arsenal on Monday? Well, Ole Gunnar Solskjær is playing his cards close to his chest and says he will spend the next 48 hours mulling over whether to include the teenager, who has scored against Astana and Rochdale over the past week, in his starting XI at Old Trafford. “Mason has proved when he gets in the box he is dangerous,” Solskjær said. “I am not worried about him at all but we have to manage him. You can’t throw him in at the deep end all the time. I have the weekend to think about it.”Arsenal reportedly naming Granit Xhaka as captain does at least put an end to Unai Emery passing the armband around the dressing room. According to our friends at Opta, since the start of 2018-19, Arsenal are the only club to have had as many as six different players start more than one Premier League game as captain. Laurent Koscielny (13 games) Xhaka (10) Mesut Özil (eight) Petr Cech (seven) Aaron Ramsey (four) Nacho Monreal (two).Thanks, Gregg. Let’s get stuck straight into some breaking Arsenal news, with the BBC’s David Ornstein reporting Unai Emery has named Granit Xhaka as the team’s new captain following a discussion with his players. Xhaka is expected to take the armband on a permanent basis, having led the side in six of their eight matches this season. Former skipper Laurent Koscielny left the club for Bordeaux in the summer.I’m going to hand the blog over to Ben Fisher now. He’ll guide you through the lunchtime flurry of press conferences. Bye. Jürgen Klopp is speaking at Melwood before Liverpool’s trip to Sheffield United. He’s confirmed that Xherdan Shaqiri is not available as he has a small calf tear. But Divock Origi and Sadio Mané are both fit again. He was also glowing in his praise for Liverpool’s stand-in goalkeeper, saying there is no need to fast-track Alisson back into the first XI even though the Brazilian is almost ready to train again. Another player Klopp was cooing over, was Joel Matip, who he thinks has been one of Liverpool’s best signings (he was a free transfer). Klopp believes Matip will be vital on Saturday.After a proposal for Bury to be readmitted to League Two next season was rejected by the English Football League’s 71 member clubs on Thursday, the mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, has taken up the fight. He’s an avid campaigner and does not give up a fight lightly. Not a bad man to have in your corner. Liverpool have a few injury concerns before they travel to Brammal Lane. Xherdan Shaqiri felt a twinge in his calf in training so was not available to face MK Dons and Sadio Mané picked up a thigh strain against Chelsea. Though, as the picture shows above, he was in training yesterday so would appear to have recovered. Jürgen Klopp will issue an update in his press conference shortly. Liverpool haven’t beaten Sheffield United away in 29 years. The last time they won there was the last time Liverpool were defending champions – 25 August 1990. In case you’ve been holding off on making plans to go to Qatar 2022 because you’re worried you might not be able to take your preferred refreshment while out following your nation, here’s a bit of news from Sean Ingle that might interest you.Here’s more from Solskjær on Manchester United’s struggle this season. He says he’s not bothered about criticism in the media and he’s grateful to United fans for their support:As for the fans, he says they’re still behind him and his team:Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba is in a “race” to be fit for Arsenal’s visit to Manchester United on Monday evening. The midfielder is a doubt because of an ankle injury sustained in the Carabao Cup win over Rochdale in midweek. Pogba picked up a knock to an ankle on Wednesday. His absence at a team-bonding meal led to further scrutiny on his Old Trafford future but United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjær said:The situation is he finished the game, which is fantastic, but he got a knock to his ankle which is very swollen. It was better for him not to go there with the team and he’s in a race, I would guess, for Monday.”Pogba would be an eighth frontline player unavailable to Solskjær. Eddie Howe is another manager who has risen early and got his press conference out of the way. Sixth-placed Bournemouth host fifth-placed West Ham tomorrow. Both sides had disappointing League Cup exits in midweek. The Cherries were beaten by Burton and the Hammers lost at Oxford but Howe is not too concerned having beaten Everton and Southampton in his last two Premier League games by the same scoreline, 3-1. The Cherries and the Hammers in a top-six clash? What a time to be alive!Our early season form with the Everton and Southampton wins, in my mind it’s very positive as we approach West Ham and it’s important we put on a good show on Saturday. Our early game against West Ham last season was very early in the manager’s reign there and he was still implementing his ideas. I think they have very good players and they’ve had a good start to the season so it promises to be a good game. Their general performances have been very strong and it’s two teams who have been strong at the start of the season. We’d like to win three in a row, the first time we’ve done that in a while, and that’s a huge incentive for us.”He also spoke to BBC Radio 5 earlier about Andy Carroll’s ongoing battle to get fit. It’s been a long one hasn’t it? “Of his type there isn’t anybody better,” he said, begging the question what is “his type”? “We just hope he has a bit of luck in terms of injuries. We know he’s a very good player. Our aim now is how can we get him on the pitch frequently and regularly? Obviously you need some luck along the way. But a fit and firing Andy Carroll would help more teams.” Maybe Carroll should just be a 20-minute impact sub these days. An incredible jumping man who is just thrown into the fray towards the end of games. Morning all. The League Cup games are done and dusted and we’re straight back into the seventh round of Premier League matches. Eight of them are on Saturday which is quite a rarity in these days of spreading matches out across the weekend. Kicking things off tomorrow at 12.30pm are league leaders, Liverpool, who travel to Bramall Lane for a 12.30pm kick-off against Sheffield United hoping to go eight points clear of Manchester City. Pep Guardiola’s side are in action at Everton in a 5.30pm kick-off. Jürgen Klopp managed to rotate all 11 of his starters against Chelsea when they beat MK Dons 2-0, so there’ll be no worry of fatigue. The Blades face a daunting task against the Reds, who have won their last 15 Premier League matches stretching back to last season, but Chris Wilder is backing his on-loan Manchester United goalkeeper, Dean Henderson, to perform well on what could be a busy day between the sticks.“Liverpool’s forward three have been unbelievable for the past couple of years,” said Wilder. “In terms of the quality they’ve got, the mobility and way they interchange, we’re going to have to have an unbelievably great day to keep the ball out of our net. Our goalkeeper is going to have to make saves, we understand that, but I feel we have the best young goalkeeper in the country.”In the 3pm kick-offs, the bottom two meet at Molineux. Watford and Wolves are yet to win a game this season. A six-pointer already? Nearer the top, fifth-placed West Ham face sixth-placed Bournemouth. The Hammers were, erm, hammered 4-0 by Oxford in the League Cup but Manuel Pellegrini made a raft of changes and their rock at the back, Angelo Ogbonna, did not start. Bournemouth are scoring for fun in the league at the moment, while the Hammers have conceded only two goals in their past five league games. It’s an intriguing one. Third-bottom Aston Villa host Burnley, who have yet to win away this season. Opportunity knocks for Villa to move out of the bottom three. After the embarrassment of defeat at Colchester on Tuesday and murmurings of discontent in the ranks, how Maurico Pochettino could do with a win when his former club Southampton visit Tottenham. Saints beat their local rivals Pompey in the League Cup in midweek but in their last home game, against Bournemouth, they were second best as they lost 3-1. Ralph Hasenhüttl will expect a reaction. It could be a tricky one for Spurs. There is Chelsea v Brighton and Crystal Palace v Norwich to look foward to on Saturday, too, and as mentioned earlier, Everton host Manchester City. Pressure is building on Marco Silva after an underwhelming start to the season, including the 2-0 home defeat by Sheffield United last time out. Silva is still struggling to work out what his best team is. He could do with figuring it out quick if City play anything like they did in last week’s 8-0 hammering of Watford. And on Sunday, Newcastle take on in-form Leicester at the King Power Stadium with takeover talk in the air during the buildup to the match. Manchester United host Arsenal on Monday night.

I did not carry this burden (my mother spoke English well) but I did become the de facto strongly worded letter-writer, and the one who would manage any bureaucratic nightmares. This was because, even though Mum’s English was great, there was a part she couldn’t quite get – the bit of the dance that is indirect, where the bad news is obfuscated in politeness: “Thank you for your complaint. We are terribly sorry to offer you nothing.” Instead, Mum would tell me what she wanted to happen, and I would begin, “Dear Sir, I write to you regarding an urgent matter…”I’ve been thinking about this, because I have started to send my own letters to a friend. I call her my “doubt proofer”: she removes the parts where I doubt myself. For example, my application to volunteer on an education scheme: “I care passionately about the education outcomes of poorer children,” I began, “although I have no direct education experience nor children in the age range of the scheme.”“Delete this” came her note, with the second part underlined.It makes sense: language reveals us more than we think, and as we are human, that includes our shortcomings.

It even counts towards the 150 minutes of moderate-to-brisk exercise you ought to be getting per week. The previous recommendation was for a 10-minute minimum, but for years, the general direction of research has been toward the conclusion that there is no minimum at all. This doesn’t just go for exercise, either. Tiny amounts of meditation make a difference five minutes in nature can boost your mental health and while one daily serving of vegetables may be too few, it’s definitely preferable to zero. If you are wondering whether or not some tiny but healthful activity is worth it, the answer, almost always, is yes.It’s a little strange, actually, that this is even a topic of debate. Of course anything is better than nothing. For one thing, it’s a good start for building more substantial habits. But tiny actions are valuable in themselves. Human bodies aren’t digital devices, and health generally isn’t a matter of reaching fixed thresholds, or fulfilling quotas what is good for the organism in large quantities is usually good in smaller ones, too. Naturally, if you have a specific goal – such as running the marathon next year, or measurably reducing your chances of an early death – specific minimums may apply. But for any meaningful definition of “health” it’s still healthier to spend 23 hours and 59 minutes per day in bed, punctuated by a short stroll around the room, than if you had never got up at all.The real reason for the controversy is not that the facts are in dispute. It’s that information is dangerous. When public bodies recommend, say, a 10-minute minimum, it’s because they worry that if they don’t, people who might otherwise have exercised for 10 minutes will stop after two.Even this column risks making things worse. If you had truly been planning to spend all day on the sofa, perhaps I have inspired you to take a five-minute walk but if there is a chance that you would have gone to the gym for an hour, reading these words might persuade you to settle for the stroll instead.To justify your preferred course of action, you simply conjure a hypothetical alternative version of yourself who would have been even lazier – by not exercising at all – then congratulate yourself on doing better than that. (You can justify anything this way: 10 long-haul flights per year may be awful for the climate, but better than the 200 you could have taken.)Ideally, we would stop thinking about healthy behaviours in terms of minimums: within reason, you should be doing as much exercise as you can, not as little as you can get away with – while remembering that nothing is too minor to be not worth the bother. This is a sensible approach to much of life, I would say, from being a good friend or paying attention to your kids, to saving money or reducing your environmental impact. However much you do, it will never be enough.

All four were people of colour, with only one born outside of the US.In response to Walker’s question, Munchetty said: “Every time I have been told, as a woman of colour, to go back to where I came from, that was embedded in racism.” She added that she was “absolutely furious a man in that position thinks it’s OK to skirt the lines by using language like that”.The BBC said Trump’s remarks were widely condemned as racist, and Munchetty was entitled to give her personal response. However, its editorial complaints unit (ECU) found she had breached editorial guidelines because BBC journalists were not allowed to “give their opinions about the inidual making the remarks or their motives for doing so”.The letter to the BBC on Friday warns the decision will have a “profound effect on the future ersity within the BBC”.It says requiring BAME broadcasters to remain “impartial” about how they feel about their experiences of racism is “ludicrous” and that to require them to “endorse racism as a legitimate ‘opinion’ is an abrogation of responsibility of the most serious nature”.The consequences of the decision are “widespread with implications for the entire media landscape in the UK”, it says. The scope of its effect, the signatories say, is already evident in the “unprecedented number of BAME media figures who have openly and publicly voiced their condemnation”.The letter states that the ECU “does not reflect the erse cultural views in the BAME communities in the UK”, and that it should address its own levels of ersity.It calls on BBC management to support journalists and acknowledge there can be no expectation of impartiality over expressions and experiences of racism.It says the ECU ruling failed to acknowledge that “racism is not a valid opinion on which an ‘impartial’ stance can or should be maintained”. For those who experience racist abuse, including Munchetty, “being expected to treat racist ideas as potentially valid has devastating and maybe illegal consequences” and is contrary to race equality and human rights legislation, it says.“To suggest a journalist can ‘talk about her own experiences of racism’ while withholding a critique on the author of racism (in this case President Trump) has the ludicrous implication that such racism may be legitimate and should be contemplated as such,” it adds.The letter’s signatories, who also include the broadcaster and writer Afua Hirsch and the science journalist Angela Saini, say that BBC journalists have contacted them privately to express concern about the “climate of fear” at the organisation and concerns over the consequences of their speaking out in support of the statement.Among those who have also backed the presenter are the chancellor, Sajid Javid, who called the decision “ridiculous” and added that Munchetty’s reaction was “perfectly understandable”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fae4060f1f30ec82f1a5843a180904af26288175/0_0_5319_3546/master/5319.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3576061240a8a7014548d9c93b3c93ab 2020w","title":"no deal brexit fault uk government alone juncker eu","story":"Jean-Claude Juncker has said blame for a no-deal Brexit will lie solely with the British government after the UK’s latest efforts to fix the problem of the Irish border were found wanting.Ahead of a second visit to Brussels within as many weeks by the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, the European commission president emphasised the EU’s desire for a mutually satisfactory agreement.“We are working hard on a deal,” Juncker told the German newspaper Augsburger Allgemeine. “An exit of the British from the EU without agreement would be a disaster for the United Kingdom and for the European continent.

If this fails in the end, the responsibility lies solely with the British side.”The two negotiating sides are wide apart on the fundamentals of how to deal with the problem of the Irish border, and there is growing and grave scepticism that the government will be able to produce anything reasonable for leaders to sign off on at a crunch summit on 17 October.The UK has insisted that Northern Ireland cannot be “left behind” in the EU’s single market and shared customs territory, nor can the whole of the UK be “trapped” in the bloc’s structures simply to avoid a hard border.Barclay emphasised in a recent speech in Madrid that any deal must recognise that there will be two regulatory zones on the island of Ireland. The government insists that controls and checks on trade through the border can be done in a light-touch way to ensure there is no infrastructure or huge changes to the local economy.The EU has said that, as yet, there does not appear to be any solution beyond Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland remaining in regulatory alignment. “What they are proposing is for us to ignore huge blocks of EU law – make massive derogations for them,” a source said. “It doesn’t work.”On the eve of his meeting with Barclay, Barnier told EU ambassadors that the proposals so far tabled by the UK were not workable. He reiterated that time was running out, adding in an aside that the dramatic scenes in Westminster did not offer much confidence that a majority for any deal could be found.Inside the EU, both Ireland and Northern Ireland are part of the single market and customs union so share the same regulations and standards, allowing a soft or invisible border between the two.Britain’s exit from the EU – taking Northern Ireland with it – risks a return to a hard or policed border. The only way to avoid this post-Brexit is for regulations on both sides to remain more or less the same in key areas including food, animal welfare, medicines and product safety.Early drafts of the agreement Britain hoped to get signed off on Monday said there would be “no ergence” from EU rules that “support north-south cooperation”, later changed to “continued alignment” in a formulation that appeared to allow for subtle ergences.But it raised new questions about who would oversee it and how disputes might be resolved. It was also clearly still a step too far for the DUP.“But the biggest obstacle to a deal remains the absence until now of serious, workable proposals,” a source said.Several EU diplomats told Barnier that the UK would have to table “serious” plans to replace the Irish backstop by the end of next week – immediately after the Conservative party conference in Manchester.“The clock is ticking, after that, time would be in too short supply,” an EU diplomat said.But the person added that the mood around the table was “highly sceptical” that it will be possible to agree a deal, also because of the “political situation” in London.If the UK fails to produce proposals within the next seven days, EU diplomats say their governments will not have enough time to assess the politically sensitive and deeply technical issues at stake.The pessimistic mood deepened after the UK presented earlier this week its latest discussion paper on breaking the backstop deadlock - a six-page document on moving food, animal and plant products between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, as part of a plan for an all-Ireland agri food zone.EU diplomats are unhappy that the UK seems to be picking holes in the logic of the EU’s strict rules on food, animal and plant safety (sanitary and phytosanitary measures). “If you are staying in our SPS zone you don’t get to start second guessing the logic of it,” said one source, describing the mood. “I sense an extra frustration. There is a bit of a ‘how dare you’ kind of line.”Voicing his frustrations, Barnier told the diplomats the UK was “basically asking us to organise shortfalls and imperfections at our border”.While EU diplomats were focused on technical talks, many have been aghast at the UK prime minister’s performance in the Commons on Wednesday night. EU officials feel Johnson and his ministers have burned bridges with Labour and one-nation Tories. “How do you get to a point where if magically you get to a deal at the European council, you are able to get the Commons to vote it through?” asked a source.“There was very little talk of recent developments in Westminster, if only to note that it seemed increasingly difficult to see how the government would obtain a majority for a deal, given the isions getting more entrenched by the day,” a second diplomat added.When asked if Johnson had ever lied about the EU, a spokeswoman for the European commission said: “I think President Juncker himself has said in a number of interviews, without referring to Prime Minister Johnson himself, but referring to events related to the brexit referendum campaign has said he should have intervened because a lot of untruths were told back then.“He would have been quite busy correcting all these untruths every day but he was not referring specifically to Prime Minister Johnson with whom he has a constructive exchange but indeed it does matter that we all stay true to the facts as much as possible.”Speaking to reporters in Brussels, where he was seeing Barnier, Ireland’s deputy prime minister Simon Coveney said the UK had yet to put forward a “serious” proposal, with just four weeks to go before the country is due to leave.He said: “There are still significant gaps between both sides. A serious proposal coming forward from the UK side that hasn’t happened yet.“Until there’s a serious proposal in writing that can be the basis for a negotiation then the gaps that are wide at the moment will remain and time is running out we need to move this process on but really the onus is on the British prime minister and his team to allow that to happen by putting serious proposals on the table that the EU can then negotiate around to try and find a way of getting a deal done.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfe3c1cb433956b9a0562757d544cfad8918c087/0_720_5129_3077/master/5129.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d53d103d41d37a518afc6ef41cf46e8f","title":"voters so promiscuous the pollsters working to predict next election","story":"Despite past failures, the polling industry is back in overdrive. But it isn’t easy getting voters to nail their colours to the mastOf course, if polls all said the same thing, there wouldn’t be so many of them. But when they vary so widely, what is the point of them? Over the last few years, as the polling industry has suffered a series of failures, that question has become more urgent. To recap: at the 2015 election, the polls didn’t see the Tory majority coming. Two years later, most of them made the opposite mistake: predicting a Tory majority when we got a hung parliament. In between, came the EU referendum – where the polls weren’t quite so far out, but most put remain ahead.But even if polls aren’t always trusted, their findings are still cheered, lamented, disputed and weaponised. They shape the way journalists talk about parties and politics they put leaders under pressure. This is why they are used by campaigners – groups such as People’s Vote, which has commissioned a series of polls that highlight support for staying in the EU. Not that everyone is willing to accept the results. “My impression is that when people like poll findings, they seize on them and quote them,” says Peter Kellner, the former president of YouGov. “And when they don’t like them, they say: ‘Oh, they got the 2015 election wrong, they got the 2017 election wrong, it must be a load of bollocks.’” Pollsters themselves urge caution. “Polls aren’t magic they can’t predict the future,” says Anthony Wells, YouGov’s director of political research. “But, clearly, they are the only good way we’ve got of measuring public opinion.”And the polls keep coming. This is the strange position pollsters now find themselves in: the turbulence of the times may have caught them out, but it has also made us more dependent on them, as we struggle to decipher the country’s thinking and what on earth might happen next.After two general elections and two referendums in five years, pollsters are as sick of elections as the rest of us. “We’d like to get a rest sometime,” says Gideon Skinner, the head of political research at Ipsos Mori. ICM’s research director, Gregor Jackson, tells me that, if there were another high-profile failure,“We’d have to be honest and ask if there is a long-term future for political polling – in the narrow sense of accurately predicting the results of general elections.” When the next election comes, pollsters know they will face their biggest test yet.On a miserable Saturday morning in July, I arrive at an Ipsos Mori call centre in Leith, Edinburgh. The main room – a sparse space overlooking a park – is filled with 50 people sitting at five banks of desks, each themed around a bright colour. Most of them are young: the call centre employs lots of students, as well as actors, musicians and comedians looking for casual work. They patiently make call after call.Like most polling firms, Ipsos Mori devotes the majority of its work to market research. But I am here to sit in on telephone polling for its monthly Political Monitor: a voting-intention poll, with additional questions about respondents’ political views. This is the most high-profile work the firms carry out, often commissioned by newspapers, but it is also the least lucrative. “Most companies use it as a shop window to build their name,” says Deborah Mattinson, who runs the research consultancy Britain Thinks.For its phone polls, Ipsos Mori calls a mixture of landlines and mobiles that have been selected at random. What surprises me, sitting in the call centre, is just how hard it is to convince people to participate. “That’s actually the biggest problem we have,” says Ian Douglas, a cheery man with white hair, who is the firm’s director of telephone project management. What has made phone polling increasingly challenging is “the number of people you have to convince it’s not a PPI call”, he says. Sometimes they slam down the phone or shout abuse. Interviewers are only expected to complete one 15-minute interview each hour the rest of the time, they are being turned down or ignored.Once they find someone willing to take part, the interviewers launch into their script: a set of questions written by Ipsos Mori’s political team in London. They can’t do anything that might influence the answers, like engage with an interviewee’s jokes or political asides, so some interviewers resort to a stiff, robotic delivery. Others make an effort to keep the interviews lively: one young man with jaunty diction, emphasises different words as he sets out the options on whether Britain will leave the EU without a deal: “Would you say it’s very unlikely, fairly unlikely…” It reminds me of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?.A voting-intention poll is usually based on interviews with between 1,000 and 2,000 people. But they can’t just be the first 1,000 who agree to take part – pollsters need a sample that is representative of the whole country. “The traditional analogy is eating a cake,” says Skinner. “You don’t need to eat the whole cake, you just need to get a good slice.” That means having the right proportion of men and women, 18- to 24-year-olds and over-65s, Scots and Londoners. So, pollsters set quotas for those different categories. Douglas tells me that it is easiest to persuade people over 45 who live in Scotland, Wales or the north of England to take part. It can take four or five days of polling to fill the final quota: 18- to 24-year-old men. They have learned that there are particular times when it is easiest to reach younger age groups: earlier in the week or Saturday mornings. When I arrive, at 11am on a Saturday, the main room is filled with the hubbub of interviewing. But as morning blurs into afternoon, it becomes quieter by the time I leave, it is almost silent.It is no surprise, then, that almost all voting-intention polls now take place online. It is cheaper, easier and quicker. Each agency has its own online panel: a group of people – more than 800,000, in the case of YouGov’s UK panel – who have agreed to take part in surveys, on politics or anything else, in exchange for a small payment.Online polls have quotas to be filled, just like telephone polls. But it is hard to hit every one. So, once the polling has finished, pollsters adjust their results through a process known as weighting: if they needed to poll 120 people aged 25 to 34, but could find only 100, for example, they will make each response in that age group count for 1.2 people.Polling firms weight their results for turnout, too: they take into account what someone says about how likely they are to vote or whether they voted in the previous election. It is this weighting that explains why pollsters can get such different results. “They’ve got a choice of levers to pull,” says Patrick Sturgis, a professor at the London School of Economics who led an independent inquiry into why the polling for the 2015 election went so wrong. “They pull a certain set of levers and it gives the Tories a five-point lead they pull a different set and it gives the Tories a two-point lead.”For decades, voters were split into two main groups – Labour and Conservative – ided by class. “Fifty, 60 years ago, most working-class voters voted Labour, most middle-class voters voted Conservative,” says YouGov’s Kellner. So, if a sample had the right proportion of working-class and middle-class people, pollsters had a decent chance of predicting an election accurately. That is no longer the case. “If you’re middle class, you’re only very slightly more likely to be Conservative than if you’re working class,” says Kellner. “If you’re working class, you’re only very slightly more likely to be Labour than if you’re middle class.”The things that determine how people vote are always changing: to get a representative sample, pollsters must now pay particular attention to age, education, and, of course, views on Brexit. “The leaveremain camps have almost redefined how politics is seen,” says Tanya Abraham, who works on YouGov’s political team. “Because they can be any voter.” James Kanagasooriam, a partner in charge of polling at the lobbying firm Hanbury Strategy, tells me that the two traditional voting blocs have now fragmented into four groups of roughly equal size: as well as traditional Labour and Tory supporters, there is a coalition of liberal, metropolitan, remain-leaning voters, as well as core Brexit supporters. Leave voters can now back the Brexit party, remainers the Lib Dems.“In my professional life, I’ve never known a time when voters have been so promiscuous with their votes,” says Andrew Hawkins, the founder of ComRes. ICM’s Jackson says: “Having a four-party system – and in particular the existence of the Brexit party – just makes it more difficult for polling agencies.” Most polling firms weight their data according to how people voted in the previous general election – but it is impossible to weight by a vote for the Brexit party, because it only launched in April.It is even harder to predict what will happen in a general election, because it is dependent on whether Brexit happens before it takes place. “If we have left, and we haven’t run out of mangetout at Waitrose and people aren’t dying because they’re unable to get the right drugs, then I suspect there’d be a fillip in the polls for the Tories,” Hawkins says. If we don’t leave on 31 October, he suggests, the Conservatives will be in a much trickier position. Meanwhile, Jackson says: “The polling data is showing increasing polarisation in British views towards Boris Johnson. He’s off-putting for many people now, in a way he wasn’t three years ago.”Andrew Cooper is one of British polling’s grandees. The founder of Populus, he spent two years as David Cameron’s director of strategy at No 10. Like many firms, Populus did not come out of the 2015 election well. After that shock, Cooper resolved not to be caught out again. “We did a very, very thorough review,” he says. “It took lots of time, money and intellectual effort.” Eventually, Populus made a number of changes: it started weighting according to how interested people were in politics, for instance, rather than how they identified politically to estimate turnout, it took into account demographic factors, and interviewees’ attitudes, in order to determine how likely different groups were to vote.This time there would be no attempt to put things right. “We came to the conclusion that the underlying methodological problems of voting-intention polls are so fundamental that we can’t solve them,” Cooper says. So that was that: since the referendum, Populus hasn’t carried out a single voting-intention poll. Instead, using data analytics, it looks at what Cooper describes as “the structure of political attitudes” – the patterns behind public opinion. (Similarly, while the  continues to use ICM to carry out polls, the paper has shifted its focus to more in-depth research about public views and attitudes.)“The traditional voting-intention poll is actually just a rubbish product,” adds Cooper. “It’s an attempt, by asking only two questions, to get at what is getting to be an increasingly complicated piece of information.”This is the kind of statement one might expect to hear from a polling sceptic – someone such as Labour peer David Lipsey, who chaired a House of Lords committee that last year produced a critical report on political polling. It called for more oversight and suggested the media give less attention to voting-intention polls at the time, Lipsey urged the industry to “get its house in order”. I meet him at his office, across the road from the House of Lords in Westminster. Protesters are gathered near his window as a man repeatedly yells “Brexit means Brexit”, it feels as if public opinion is intruding very literally into our conversation.If anything, Lipsey is surprised that the polling industry hasn’t attracted more hostile criticism. It wasn’t just the recent errors, he says, pointing to the election of 1992, when the polls mistakenly put Labour ahead, and to 1997 and 2001, when they hugely overestimated Labour’s lead. “In any case, if I predicted election results with a pin, I’d get it right half the time,” he says. Polling does have its uses, he concedes: it is effective at broadly gauging views on a wide range of subjects. But “the worst thing to use it for is predicting the results of elections.”Despite all the challenges that political polling faces, new players are still entering the industry. Last year, two veteran pollsters, Joe Twyman and Martin Boon, set up their own firm, Deltapoll. They thought politics was becoming more emotional, and that this was key to understanding how voters felt.Delta uses something it calls “emotional resonance scoring” (ERS). A traditional poll might ask someone how far they agree with a statement ERS tries to determine the intensity of their feeling, by measuring how quickly – and therefore how emphatically – they respond to it. Twyman gives the example of the EU referendum: polling showed that about as many people agreed with the remain campaign’s warnings about the economy as they did with leave’s “take back control” message but ERS found the latter had twice the emotional resonance.For now, Delta uses ERS to test the strength of voters’ feelings on politicians and parties eventually, Twyman says, it will offer a new way of measuring voting intention.Other firms are also experimenting with cutting-edge techniques to complement traditional methods. They show people speeches by politicians, then measure their heart rate or monitor their facial expressions, which are then recorded using a webcam and analysed by an algorithm to see how intensely they react to the different messages. But when I speak to people in the industry, the development they appear to be most excited about is a kind of modelling called multilevel regression and post-stratification (MRP), which YouGov used in the 2017 general election. Traditional voting-intention polls give you each party’s share of the vote for the country as a whole, rather than telling you how many seats they will get. But MRP enables polling firms to forecast election results on a constituency-by-constituency basis.At least political pollsters can take comfort from the fact that voting-intention polls are only a small part of their work. Kanagasooriam compares it to the tip of an iceberg. The real value of polling, he tells me, lies in all the other data. “Why do people vote a certain way? Who’s voting? Where they are on the issues, where they are on the parties, where they are on iniduals, on messages.” He believes that, for all the emphasis on Brexit, voters continue to care about what they have always cared about: which party they trust to look after the economy and which leader they like most.Of everyone I speak to, Kanagasooriam seems the most enthusiastic about what polling can achieve. He energetically describes to me the sophisticated insights offered by data science. It doesn’t matter, he insists, that polling often fails to predict election results, because it keeps getting better at understanding what drives voters – and, at a time of upheaval, politicians need that information more than ever. He points to the Johnson government’s emphasis on tackling crime and investing in the NHS and the rest of the public sector – issues that have, over the past few years, ranked among voters’ top priorities. “This is the first time we have seen an administration actually pivot towards the things that matter for voters.” That’s the kind of impact polling can have, he suggests. “This is what affects stuff in Westminster.”But voting-intention polls can affect Westminster, too. In 2014, 12 days before the Scottish referendum, the Sunday Times ran a YouGov poll showing a two-point lead for independence. It was only one poll – an outlier – but it rattled Britain’s political establishment and compelled David Cameron to launch a final intervention: he promised to give the Scottish parliament more powers if Scotland voted to stay in the UK. And it was encouraging polls in the early months of 2017 that helped convince Theresa May to call a general election, with disastrous consequences.Even after a long career in polling, Ipsos Mori’s Douglas still seems fascinated by what each person has to say. “Your family and friends are a closed network – they usually have a lot of the same views,” he says, as we sit in Leith, dozens of his colleagues on the phone, hundreds of miles away from people at the other end of the line. “It’s easy to think it’s what the rest of the country is thinking, but often it’s not.” While we listen to interviews, he marvels at each surprising response. “The great British public tend to absolutely amaze you, time and time again.”• If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b858235a242932e60c4f97a9d0e9f0f4dbc89d35/550_1136_4693_2816/master/4693.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5dd37fda1ac9629420d15a993b876c1c","title":"can labour unite and plot a path to power","story":"Sonia Sodha joins Anushka Asthana to discuss Labour’s options now that parliament has resumed and the party has backed Jeremy Corbyn’s Brexit strategy.

Until 2015 nursing attracted an high number of mature students, who often already had debts totalling tens of thousands of pounds from paying tuition fees for their first course. Applications have declined since then.Sources close to the discussions say ministers are cautious about endorsing “debt forgiveness” as an inducement because it would cost too much money.Any financial incentives for nurses are likely to be made available only to certain groups, and not to everyone starting a three-year nursing degree. They would be targeted at mature students and those seeking to specialise in mental health and learning disability nursing, two areas in which workforce shortages are particularly acute.Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, has hinted at his support for reintroducing bursaries.Dame Donna Kinnair, the chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, welcomed the possibility of financial packages to persuade people to become nurses.Saffron Cordery, the deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents trusts, said: “The commitment towards greater financial support for nursing students would be extremely welcome if implemented.“The shortage of nurses, and low rate of applications for training, shows that the current financial offer for nursing students is inadequate.“With a relentless rise in demand for care, today’s commitment would be progress towards filling these vacancies to ensure that services are safe and appropriately staffed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71b32f06e78e2a124dad597052205b1294e45e4d/0_87_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a8d109a9cc8539d124455e141f60a9b","title":"world athletics championships 2019 day one live","story":"Between heaving gulps of air, Oskan-Clarke seemed pleased: Cool finish from Britain’s Shelayna Oskan-Clarke to qualify second in heat two behind Raevyn Rogers.

The opening afternoon session will kick off with the men’s long jump qualifying, where 21 year-old Juan Miguel Echevarria is favourite to become the first Cuban world champion since 2001. At 2:35pm GMT the men’s 100m preliminary round will begin, before Brits Zharnel Hugues, Ojie Edoburun and Adam Gemili enter the competition at the heats from 4:05pm GMT. All eyes will be on the budding rivalry between 2017 silver medalist Christian Coleman and Noah Lyles.From 2:40pm, Doha will see a flurry of women’s qualification events starting with two groups of hammer throw. Britain’s Holly Bradshaw will then attempt to make another final in women’s pole vault qualifications, before the women’s high jump qualification and 3000m Steeplechase heats. Later, the block of men events will include triple jump qualification from 5:25pm, 5000m heats and 400m hurdles heats.

Also the fear that if it was as good as rumoured, I would end up some annoying evangelical banging on about it constantly. It’s the best thing I have seen in my life. If you haven’t seen it: beg, steal or borrow the money and get a ticket.The most beautiful, heartbreaking piece of theatre I’ve ever seen.‘Emotional and spectacular’: Nomadteacher205My favourite dance experience of the last decade. The first half was a slightly languid affair, but the second half was outstanding, emotional and spectacular in equal measure.The Danny Boyle production of Frankenstein at the National theatre was incredible.‘It should be there’: Iron MikeThe Mother with Osipova should be there as should anything with the great Zakharova.‘Guillem looked like she was bathed in flames’: BrightdaylerPush is indeed fantastic, but I also love the solo Two, choreographed by Russell Maliphant in Two: Four: Ten. I was lucky enough to see both performed more than once. When I saw Two at the London Coliseum, during the more animated segments Sylvie Guillem looked like she was bathed in flames. It was one of the most stunning things I’ve ever seen (along with the opening of the balcony scene in the Budapest Opera House’s Romeo and Juliet).The Book of Mormon was pretty damn fabulous, and deserves a place on this list.The Book of Mormon – obviously. Nemo81What, no Book of Mormon?! YorkshireExPatKinky Boots is easy to dismiss as flippant, but it’s a very poignant story dealing with a lot of deep issues, with heart and laughter, tears and great fun combined. Matt Henry as Lola was just incredible – Olivier and MBE very well deserved. I’m not in London nowadays but made the trip to see this several times. I’m very excited to catch it on tour next month, can’t wait!It proved to be one of the most exhilarating nights I have ever spent in the theatre.Michael Clark’s work was absolutely stunning.

Has a piece of contemporary dance ever had a bigger audience? Many of whom commented on just how moved they were by something they had not been exposed to before.A small but perfect piece of theatre by The Wooster Group, featuring Eric Berryman. This piece had a quiet stillness, spare set and the magnificent voices of Eric Berryman, Jasper McGruder and Philip Moore all coming together perfectly to bring to life the pain and pathos of work songs, spirituals, and toasts recorded in 1964 in Texas’s then-segregated prison farms. It’s a piece of theatre that exemplifies the very special and unique value of live performance.‘Hilarious and poignant’: freewheelingfrankieI loved Graeae Theatre Company’s by turns hilarious and poignant Reasons to Be Cheerful, which did superb justice to most of Ian Dury’s best songs and wove them into a rite-of-passage story that was much more than a contrived excuse for playing them.‘Blew me away’: dude1981The Flick deserves its spot. Blew me away. Felt like I was seeing someone of my generation writing a play for someone like me.‘Hilarious and scary’: BacteriaThe Pillowman by Martin McDonagh was the most enjoyable new play I saw this century. Hilarious, scary, constantly surprising and finally intensely moving. It screams out for a major revival.‘Thrilling, gorgeous and joyous’: richardthomsonShobana Jeyasingh’s Counterpoint, performed in 2010 as a Cultural Olympics test event, filled the whole of the fountains area of Somerset House. Big-scale, fast, expansive, lovely patterns, lots of performances so easy to go and see and above all, thrilling, gorgeous and joyous. There was a lot of good outdoor and site-specific dance all over London in 2010 and 2012. It feels like a different world now, never mind a different country. It will never happen again.‘So good I saw it twice’: ThespionicGirl from the North Country is definitely one of the best I’ve seen and certainly the best vocalssongs.

But the truth is that you can get great phones at almost any price.With so many different brands, models and capabilities to choose from it can be difficult to know which to buy. So here’s a guide to some of the best phones at different price points, so you don’t end up buying a dud.RRP: £25 - deals from £15It has an FM radio, charges via microUSB, has a headphone socket and a 1.8in display, on which you can even play Snake or Crossy Road. It has space for all your contacts and 100s of SMS, because you might be that popular.Press the up key twice to turn on a flashlight to find your keys. There’s no camera, though, which some might see as an advantage. It’s not a “rugged phone” but it’ll survive the odd spill no problem with its hardy plastic body. And it only weighs 73g. One caveat is that it’s only 2G and as networks move to 5G, 2G coverage may suffer.Harking back to a simpler time, the Nokia 105 is dirt cheap and gets the job doneRRP: £259 - deals from £149.99Xiaomi, once described as China’s Apple, isn’t a household name in the UK, but perhaps it should be. Known for excellent phones at rock-bottom prices, the Mi A2 is no exception. Available in several versions including a “Lite” model, the one to buy is the full-blooded Mi A2 with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage for £159.50 straight from Xiaomi.You get a good-looking 5.99in full HD+ LCD screen, solid Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 processor, with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. Best of all you get Android One software, which means no unwanted apps or bloatware, a clean Android experience and snappy performance, plus at least two years of software updates straight from Google.The dual camera on the back won’t win you any photography awards, but will do for the odd snap of people or landscapes. The battery should last a day, and it has quick wireless charging via the modern USB-C port. The fingerprint scanner on the back makes unlocking it a breeze and it even supports Bluetooth 5 (useful for modern wireless headphones) and dual-sim for two network connections at once (great for traveling). There’s no headphone socket, though.Bloat-free Android One software, snappy performance and modern features often reserved for phones at much higher price points make the Xiaomi Mi A2 a bargain.RRP: £380 - deals from £280Under the hood you have Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 710, which is a step up from the 6-series in much of the competition, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, plus a microSD card slot for adding more space. It runs Android One too, which means no bloat and snappy performance, plus at least three years of updates straight from Google.The 6.18in LCD is pretty good too, with an iPhone-like camera notch at the top, while the metal and glass sandwich construction feels more modern and premium, although you’ll probably need a case to keep it that way. A fingerprint scanner on the back takes care of unlocking the phone, there’s Bluetooth 5 support and 18W fast charging via USB-C.Battery life is a good day of fairly heavy usage (games, video and lots of messaging), longer if you’re only a light user.The 12-megapixel camera on the back is a cut above many at this price, but falls short of the modern miracles mastered by the top tier of phones.Good performance, software, build and camera make the Nokia 8.1 good value at less than £300RRP: £399 - deals from £350Google’s cheapest Android phone is one of its best, offering most of what makes its top-end Pixel 3 good but for about half the price.You get a good-looking 5.6in FHD+ OLED display in a solid-feeling but light polycarbonate body. The back of the phone is two-tone, with a glossy panel at the top. There’s a USB-C port in the bottom for fast charging and the lesser-spotted headphones socket in the top.A an excellent fingerprint scanner on the back takes care of unlocking the phone, while Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 670, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage keeps things clocking along for about a day.The Pixel 3a has two big advantages over everything else at this price. The first is Google’s great software, with three-years of updates, day and date with the release of each new Android version, where some other manufacturers take over six months to update their phones.The second is Google’s stellar camera, which matches flagship smartphones in both picture quality and night sight. Nothing comes close at under £500.Cracking camera and excellent software with rapid updates make the Pixel 3a a winner at £400Simply put, if you want the best phone right now that’s the OnePlus 7 Pro. Available in both 4G and 5G variants, the OnePlus offers the fastest, smoothest experience available even though it’s almost half the price of some rivals.It starts with the giant, notchless 6.67in QHD+ AMOLED screen which is the best in the business: super bright, super sharp and with a 90Hz refresh rate (versus 60Hz for the competition) making everything super smooth. A best-in-class fast and accurate fingerprint sensor under the screen takes care of unlocking duties, while the selfie camera literally pops up from the top.Performance is equally stellar, with Qualcomm’s top of the line Snapdragon 855 chip, at least 6GB of RAM and 128GB of UFS3 storage (which is faster than the competition too). The battery will last well into your second day between charges, with very fast cable charging when needed.OnePlus’s slick Android OxygenOS is excellent too, and updated rapidly for at least three years. The triple camera system on the back is great too, although bettered in some areas by Huawei’s £899 P30 Pro and Apple’s new £1,049 iPhone 11 Pro.One caveat is that it’s massive, so not for those who want a small phone it is due to be replaced in October too, so it might be worth waiting for that.Big, fast and slick, the OnePlus 7 Pro is a joy to useRRP: €450 – deals from £420If a fixed budget or flashy features aren’t your primary driver, the Fairphone 3 offers something others can’t: being ethical.Made by a Dutch co-operative, the Fairphone 3 is the most repairable phone available, with a removable battery and modules you can unscrew and replace yourself (including the screen if you smash it).It’s also produced in the most fair way currently possible, including ethical sourcing of raw materials where possible and bring made by people paid a living wage. Some materials cannot currently be sourced from conflict-free zones, so the firm has various schemes in place to help solve these issues, having succeeded with a Fairtrade gold initiative.The phone isn’t bad either, with simple, bloat-free Android software, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 632, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage plus a microSD card slot and a 12-megapixel camera on the back.Fairphone 3 isn’t just another smartphone: it’s an entirely different way of thinking about how a phone and its creation fits into the world.

Our passionloathing for mornings comes down to our chronotype. Ellis explains: “This is the inidual difference in the timing of the sleepwake circadian rhythm.” Morning people, also known as larks, like to get challenging things done early in the day – more than 817k Instagram posts celebrate #5am.Evening types prefer to go to bed late and sleep late and, warns Ellis, the mismatch between standard working hours and this chronotype means night owls are more at risk of developing insomnia.Try M\u0026ampS’s This Works Deep Sleep Pillow Spray 75ml, £19.50, to help reduce sleep-associated anxiety.If you want to get promoted, improve your memory or ace an exam, sleep is proven to increase concentration and productivity.

A spokeswoman for All Nippon Airways said its seat maps have shown where children are sitting “for a while”.JAL and other airlines have yet to come up with way of anticipating seat reservations by serial snorers and passengers who fully recline their seats during in-flight meals.JAL’s move attracted praise from some social media users.“Thank you, @JAL_Official_jp for warnings me about where babies plan to scream and yell during a 13 hour trip,” Rahat Ahmed, a businessman, tweeted. “This really ought to be mandatory across the board.”Others, though, castigated travellers for intolerance towards fellow passengers.“They are babies, as we all once were. We need to learn tolerance or will soon start needing a map of seat locations for mouth breathers, droolers, farters, drunks, and perhaps a lot more things in life,” one user said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5505c127b9d5d1b8c8bdd0b13ca3d05010de452f/0_117_2817_1690/master/2817.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d24596d3b1415a3f904146d2a3970ba","title":"french mps approve ivf draft law single women lesbians","story":"Bill is Emmanuel Macron’s biggest social reform since he was elected in 2017France has taken a step towards allowing lesbian and single women to conceive children with medical help, setting the stage for a clash with the country’s religious conservatives.To loud applause, France’s lower house of parliament approved a draft bioethics law in a move that has already sparked outrage from opponents, including some in President Emmanuel Macron’s own centrist party.For now, only heterosexual couples have the right to use medically assisted reproduction methods such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF).Given the green light by the national assembly, the bill must also get the go-ahead from the upper house, or senate, before it can become law. The assembly passed the draft law by 55 votes to 17.It represents Macron’s biggest social reform since coming to power in 2017. But the president has acknowledged the political risk he is taking, and is mindful of the backlash six years ago against gay marriage, legalised under his Socialist predecessor François Hollande.A coalition of grassroots religious groups, Catholic figures and rightwing political opponents organised mass demonstrations against Hollande.About 20 conservative groups have called for a rally in Paris on 6 October against the proposed changes, which they say will “deprive children of their fathers”.Under the bill – for which lawmakers have suggested 2,500 amendments – the child of a lesbian couple would have the names of the “mother and mother” on its birth certificate instead of the “mother and father”.“The state is going to lie to a child by saying that you are born from two mothers,” Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National Rally, told RTL radio on Tuesday. “The state should not lie on a birth certificate … you can say that you are born from an unknown father.”The conservative Le Figaro newspaper said in an editorial on Monday that the change “threatens the foundation of our humanity”, while the prestigious French Academy of Medicine has raised concerns about the potential psychological impact on children.Under the proposed law, the country’s healthcare system would cover the cost of the procedure for all women under 43. It also would allow children conceived with donated sperm to find out the donor’s identity when they turn 18, a change from France’s strict donor anonymity protections.If approved, the law would bring French legislation in line with other European nations such as Britain, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, Ireland, Belgium and Scandinavian countries, which authorise medically assisted procreation for all women.In France, lesbian and single women who want to have children often travel to fertility clinics abroad, a situation they say is discriminatory."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/424062783dce71fcbf7ded5d62eb3c038927ff60/0_184_3192_1915/master/3192.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf7227c15380565d77e2937d3ce3ff37","title":"honduras central america asylum seekers us guatemala el salvador","story":"The US has signed agreements to send vulnerable asylum seekers to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador – experts describe the plan as a recipe for disasterby  Tom Phillips in San Pedro Sula and  Jo Tuckman in Mexico CityNight had fallen on one of the most dangerous cities in one of the most dangerous countries on Earth and José Mendoza was making his escape.“So much killing,” the 32-year-old said as he began his punishing 2,000-mile odyssey to the United States on foot.Mendoza lived in San Pedro Sula, a gang-ridden industrial hub of about 700,000 in north-western Honduras where body-strewn tabloid front pages provide a grotesque daily reminder of the carnage.But – like thousands of violence-weary compatriots – he had decided he could bear the bloodletting no more and headed north, through Guatemala and Mexico, to the United States.“There are no reasons to stay here – only to leave,” said Giovanni Rodríguez, a Honduran author who draws inspiration for his work from his days as a corpse-counting crime reporter on the mean streets of San Pedro Sula.For all the dangers fueling the exodus from Central America, Donald Trump now wants to turn the region into a destination for the thousands of unwanted asylum seekers he is battling to turn away from the United States.This week Trump officials unveiled the latest in a slew of highly controversial agreements and policies designed to stop migrants and asylum seekers such as Mendoza reaching the southern border.The deal – announced by Trump and his Honduran counterpart, Juan Orlando Hernández, on Wednesday – will allow the US to return asylum seekers from third countries to the violence-stricken Central American nation which has the US state department’s second-highest travel warning.That followed similar accords with El Salvador and Guatemala, the two other countries that form Central America’s “Northern Triangle”.Speaking at the UN general assembly this week, Trump boasted he was taking “very unprecedented action to stop the flow of illegal immigration” and warned those heading north not to come, “because if you make it here, you will not be allowed in – you will be promptly returned home”.US officials claim their hardline policies will protect migrants from the long and perilous journey through Central America and Mexico.But critics say returning often vulnerable migrants from countries in Central America, Africa and the Caribbean to unprepared and often extraordinarily violent cities such as San Pedro Sula is a recipe for disaster.Under this week’s agreement, Haitian or Congolese asylum seekers could be sent from the US to Honduras, for example, while Honduran asylum seekers could be sent to El Salvador or Guatemala under the previous deals with those countries.Clara Long, an immigration researcher from Human Rights Watch, said: “As a protection scheme this is a nonsensical solution. As a scheme for keeping asylum seekers as far away from the US as possible it could be effective – and with very harmful consequences.“El Salvador has a staggeringly high homicide rate, similarly Honduras. Guatemala isn’t as bad but it is still elevated. And these are countries from which hundreds of thousands of people are fleeing, many of them from targeted threats,” Long added.Eric Olson, a Central America specialist from Washington’s Woodrow Wilson Centre, said Northern Triangle countries lacked even the most basic institutional infrastructure to receive so many rejected asylum seekers.While the United States handled hundreds of thousands of asylum applications last year, El Salvador received just 20.“What it does is put vulnerable, weak countries at greater risk, and migrants who have a legitimate claim to asylum are also put at greater risk. That is the bottom line,” Olson said.“When you have a weak and unstable country to begin with … and you add to that burden, I think you create greater instability. Maybe if it were Switzerland it wouldn’t be a problem. But these are vulnerable, weak countries.”Iduvina Hernández, a Guatemalan journalist and human rights activist, said she feared her country’s health system could collapse under the strain of the new arrivals.Given the massive stress the US deals are likely to place on their countries, many wonder why El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala have signed up to such schemes, details of which remain sketchy.There is similar speculation in Honduras, where President Hernández is caught up in a major drug trafficking investigation which will see his brother go on trial in the US next month.Olson called such speculation “preposterous”, arguing it would be impossible for a US president to guarantee impunity to any foreign leader.But the deals did underscore the lopsided nature of relations between the US and its far poorer regional neighbours who are massively reliant on it for trade, aid and remittances from their nationals who live there.“I think it’s an indication of how vulnerable these countries are vis-a-vis the Trump administration. The US carries a huge stick,” Olson said. “There is too much at play for these small countries. They are just not in a position to resist the enormous pressure that the US puts on them.”Trump has celebrated his migration deals as a major victory for his administration, this week claiming he had “sort of solved asylum”. “Mass illegal migration is unfair, unsafe and unsustainable for everyone involved,” Trump told the UN.But Long warned his project to bar asylum seekers and migrants would ultimately fail. “Nothing is changing about the circumstances forcing people to flee or their desperation. But things are changing to make the outcomes worse.”“In the last 10 years more Hondurans have died than in 10 years of civil war in El Salvador,” said Bartolo Fuentes, a Honduran migrant activist, who also believes Trump will be unable to stop migrants trying to outrun the killing.“Sometimes our death rates have gone above Syria’s – and we don’t have the war.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcd34154e604da4f8883c29872f23fbada6b603f/0_291_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=248a2c97cd8b66af5a8c86ba39512500","title":"saudi arabia offer tourist visas for first time","story":"Kingdom eyes holidaymakers as part of plan to ersify economy away from oilSaudi Arabia will begin offering visas on Saturday for the first time to non-religious tourists, days after the country was criticised at the UN for its grim human rights record.The kingdom – which has imprisoned and tortured women’s rights activists, carries out regular public executions, and was responsible for the high-profile murder of the Washington Post columnist Jamal Kashoggi – has said it is opening up to holidaymakers as part of a push to ersify its economy away from oil.The new visa programme for citizens of 49 countries, including the UK and the US, was announced by Saudi tourism officials, quickly followed by a Twitter campaign exhorting users to @VisitSaudiNow.As part of the scheme, which promises to deliver a visa in seven minutes, female tourists will be exempted from wearing the all-covering abaya robe, but will be required to dress “modestly”.The Twitter account, which does not appear to accept comments, has so far posted three times, including promoting an image showing rock climbing and one featuring sheep in what appears to be a snow-covered setting.Getting tourists to visit the austere kingdom, which forbids alcohol and enforces a strict social code, however, is seen by many as a hard sell.While Saudi Arabia has a relatively well-established hotel and air transit network, serving the millions of Muslim pilgrims who travel to the country to perform the Hajj and Umrah, its new tourism strategy marks a stark departure.The announcement comes as the country has been on a diplomatic offensive, both to counter criticism of its human rights record and to bolster its proxy conflict with neighbouring Iran, which has been played out largely in Yemen.The move also prefigures the anticipated acknowledgement by Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, in a PBS documentary next week, that he bears responsibility for the killing of Khashoggi last year by Saudi operatives “because it happened under my watch”.Kickstarting tourism is one of the centrepieces of Prince Mohammed’s Vision 2030 reform programme to prepare the biggest Arab economy for a post-oil era.“Opening Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country,” its tourism chief, Ahmed al-Khateeb, said in a statement. “Visitors will be surprised … by the treasures we have to share – five Unesco world heritage sites, a vibrant local culture and breathtaking natural beauty.”He said the kingdom would also ease its strict dress code for foreign women, allowing them to go without the abaya that is mandatory public wear for Saudi women. Foreign women, however, will be required to wear “modest clothing”, he added, without elaborating.Visas in the desert kingdom, rich in bedouin heritage and archaeological sites, are currently restricted to workers, their dependents and Muslim pilgrims travelling to holy sites in Mecca and Medina.Among attractions in the kingdom are Nabataean ruins in Madâin Sâlih, once part of the spice route, the palace complex in the Najdi architectural style in Ad-Diriyah, capital of the first Saudi dynasty, and the Red Sea coast.In a rare move, Saudi Arabia last year began issuing temporary visas to visitors to attend sporting and cultural events in an effort to kickstart tourism.Prince Mohammed is seeking to change that through a sweeping liberalisation drive that has brought new cinemas, mixed-gender concerts and sporting extravaganzas to Saudi Arabia.In 2017, the kingdom announced a multibillion dollar project to turn 50 islands and other pristine sites on the Red Sea into luxury resorts.The ancient archeological site became a Unesco world heritage site in 2008. It is located along an ancient trade route and has a large collection of monumental tombs. With 111 monumental tombs, it is the largest conserved site of the Nabataean civilisation. One remote tomb, known as Qasr al-Farid or the Lonely Castle, is carved into a giant boulder but was never finished.Standing in the Red Sea between 260 metres and 312 metres high, the fountain is the world’s tallest. It was opened in 1985 and is visible around the city. It does not use freshwater, instead taking the Red Sea’s saltwater.Construction began in 2013 and has been subject to delays. However, it is expected to be the world’s tallest building on completion in 2020. It will rise at least 1,000 metres, overtaking Dubai’s Burj Khalifa. Previously known as Kingdom Tower, it will be the centre of the Jeddah Economic City development and will contain a Four Seasons Hotel and the world’s highest observatory. Once believed to be created by a meteorite, the crater is thought to have appeared due to volcanic activity. Standing at 2km across and 250 metres deep, the bottom is covered with white salt and is home to palm trees and green grass despite being surrounded by desert. The most famous rock art site in Saudi Arabia became a Unesco world heritage site in 2015. Located in the Jabel Umm Sinman range, the carvings cover a wide range of representations including humans, cattle, lions and ostriches. Some of the carvings are possibly 10,000 years old and were created using a range of techniques."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7601afa768799b9839e9c06b3c427c0a2b68f336/29_146_2746_1647/master/2746.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e11f9ceb7cd6db528c6ca1148bcbda47","title":"jacques chirac a life in pictures","story":"A look back at the life of Jacques Chirac, who had one of the longest continuous political careers in Europe"},{"url":null,"title":"graduate","story":"Grad Week: Most graduates have viable opportunities to secure jobs in IrelandDeciding what type of company you would like to work for will probably be the first big decision you make after collegeA selection of organisations recruiting graduates explain what they are looking for in their hiresWe speak to three experts for their views on what graduates and employers want from one another, and what each should be looking out forGrad Week: What do employers expect from candidates as they try to sell themselves in the interviewGrad Week: Should you consider an internship considering the jobs economy is doing well?More than 100 graduate employers expected at 2019 gradireland careers fairFinishing college can be overwhelming so what apps can make your life easier?Grad Week: Do employers value work experience more than a postgraduate qualification?What you need to bear in mind to make sure you end up in the best possible working environmentWomen in the workforce: It is often left up to iniduals to challenge company culture themselvesDespite the positive economic environment, a practical approach to determining what next steps to take is recommendedOne of the key advantages for companies is attracting and retaining talentWith more formal education than any previous generation, today\u0026rsquos graduates are tech savvy and ambitiousKey skills include teamwork, problem-solving and adaptabilityToday\u0026rsquos graduates want more from work than just the pay chequeStudents are well-positioned as the growing economy increases employment demand for graduatesFrom science to construction, skills shortages continue to be a challenge for employers across industryHow graduates can make sure they are skilled-up and job-readyEmployees are looking to companies for provision of workplace wellness initiativesGrad Week: What do employers expect from candidates as they try to sell themselves in the interviewTips for graduates looking to make structured start to their careersKey skills include teamwork, problem-solving and adaptabilityWhat is likely to pay off the most \u0026ndash investing in furthering your education or starting your career instead?Graduates are well-positioned for jobs in policy, research, business and administration in the public and private sectorsInternships can be an effective way to gain work experience and increase your employability \u0026ndash but is there a downside?Jobseekers can take steps to maximise their chances of getting hiredHow employers use interviews to gain an understanding of what makes people tickAs soon as you walk into the building, you are on interview"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Two high-end vehicles seized in raids targeting a west Dublin family-based gangT\u0026aacutenaiste says \u0026lsquosignificant gaps\u0026rsquo remain between the EU and UK on the backstopGarda\u0026iacute discover drugs during search of house in Lanesborough, Co RoscommonMinister for Housing says rent pressure zones need to work but rents are \u0026lsquounsustainable\u0026rsquoChallenge in High Court brought against Child and Family AgencyGrad Week: Most graduates have viable opportunities to secure jobs in IrelandApplicants argued UK government must seek deal to protect north-south co-operationDispute centres on working conditions for staff operating the speed camera vansSatellite and telescopes are used to view rare cosmic occurrence from start to finishMinister\u0026rsquos first attempt to link excessive speeds to penalties was sent back to drawing boardMy Career Path: Jane Goldrick, Jameson International Graduate ProgrammeMy Career Path: Caoimhe Cleere took part in a PwC placement for nine months while she was still in college.Not clear yet whether open top bus will bring teams through city centre to Merrion SquareResearchers found platic tea bag releases around 11.6 bn microplastics into the cupMan (44) had ordered sex doll online but customs intercepted item at postal sorting centre"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4032267.1569571493!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"bright and breezy weather expected for dublin homecoming on sunday","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDublin celebrate with the Brendan Martin Cup following the TG4 Ladies Football All-Ireland Senior Championship final at Croke Park.

Dublin City Council defended the decision earlier this week to hold a ticket-only event earlier, saying the restriction on numbers was for health and safety reasons. The 3,500 general release tickets for the homecoming were snapped up within an hour of being made availing on Monday morning. The remaining 11,000 tickets for the event were allocated to the Dublin County Board and Dublin Ladies Gaelic Football Association for dispersal.The council has said no alcohol will be permitted at the event, which runs between 1.30pm-4.30pm and that searches will be in place at access points. They have asked fans not to bring bags bigger than A4 size or any large flags or flag poles.Merrion Square South and East, Fitzwilliam Street Lower and Mount Street Upper will be closed to traffic from 6pm on Saturday, September 28th and there is no parking at the event.Weather conditions for the rest of the weekend, through Friday and Saturday, are forecast to be far wetter. Friday morning will see heavy showers around the country with a risk of thunder and spot flooding. This will clear in the afternoon as brighter conditions spread from the west and with temperatures ranging between 13 and 16 degrees. Saturday will also see persistent and heavy rain developing in the south before spreading over Munster and Leinster in the evening with similar mid-teen temperatures.The rain will continue on Saturday night over Munster and Leinster with a chance of spreading across the rest of the country. However, rain showers will clear overnight leading to bright, breezy day for Sunday’s homecoming.The rain is forecast to return on Monday with clearer conditions on Tuesday and Wednesday.

The dispute centres on working conditions for staff operating speed camera vans and trade union recognition.Siptu said its members can be confined to their van for up to 11 hours while conducting their duties. This results in workers being placed under extreme circumstances while at the same time trying to conduct their road safety service. The Department of Justice said last week the contract for the safety camera service was awarded to Road Safety Operations Ireland, trading as GoSafe, following a public procurement competition. The Minister is unable to intervene in a dispute between the contracted service provider and its employees and members of Siptu.” “The safety camera network makes a significant contribution to road safety by directly influencing and promoting responsible driver behaviour and the Minister urges all those concerned to seek a positive resolution to this dispute through the appropriate channels.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4032343.1569579481!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"speeding penalties ross to bring revised plan back to cabinet","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPlan proposes drivers detected travelling at speeds 10- 20kmh above the limit would receive between four and six points and a €150 fine. Photograph: Getty ImagesMinister for Transport Shane Ross is to attempt to reintroduce plans for graduated penalties for speeding motorists, the Minister told an international conference on roads policing.A first attempt to link excessive speeds to levels of penalties was sent back to the drawing board by Cabinet, after they were questioned by Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan and Attorney General Séamus Woulfe.Mr Ross had produced proposals which envisaged drivers travelling up to 10kmh above the speed limit would receive between three and five penalty points and an €80 fine.Drivers detected travelling at speeds 10- 20kmh above the limit would receive between four and six points and a €150 fine. A €200 fine and up to seven penalty points would apply for speeding 20-30kmh above the limit.Those travelling more than 30kmh above the limit would no longer be dealt with under the penalty points system and instead would face prosecution for dangerous driving.However, the proposals were deferred to a Cabinet sub-committee after the Attorney General said there was “a question as to whether it is proportionate to stipulate the penalties in this manner.” In a Cabinet memo Mr Woulfe said, “10kmh over the speed limit in a 120kmh zone might not represent as big a danger or as intentional a wrongdoing as the same breach in a 30kmh zone.”Mr Flanagan said there were concerns about the ability of gardaí to enforce graduated penalties.But speaking at the European Traffic Police Network (Tispol) conference on Thursday, Mr Ross said the measure was currently with a Cabinet sub-committee and would be reintroduced by him very soon.Addressing a session on Edward Day, a pan European initiative designed to have one day without road deaths, which coincided with the opening of the Tispol conference, Mr Ross said: I think Ireland needs greater sanctions on speed limits altogether”.Referring to his proposals on graduated speed limits he said: “I intend to bring that back to the Cabinet and the Dáil at a very early stage.“We recognise that speed is as big a problem as alcohol and that we have not got a very good record on speed in this country. It is not just a matter of reviewing the speed limits which are anomalous and don’t make sense in certain places such as county boundaries. But it is a matter of reducing speed and increasing the penalties. I think global evidence is quite clear that if you graduate the speed limits it is best international practise and it will save lives”.Mr Ross told session facilitator Dr Margie Peden of the George Institute for Global Health at Oxford University that Ireland had “tackled the alcohol problem in very controversial circumstances last year, but we were successful eventually in getting the legislation through”.He said he wondered if people in rural Ireland realised that the measures were to protect them. But he said “resistance in rural Ireland” had not come from the people themselves, but from “some vested interests”.Mr Ross said he had asked local authorities to speed up their review of speed limits to help spread the prevalence of 30kmh limits and more information on the results of that would be visible by at the end of the year.Edward Day is an acronym of the campaign slogan European Day Without a Road Death. The seminar in Dublin Castle was held as part of this year’s Tispol conference hosted by the Road Safety Authority. During the conference broadcast, Tispol reported 12 million people had interracted with the seminar."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4032573.1569592561!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland would prefer brexit extension to no deal says coveney","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Foreign Affairs   Simon Coveney (left) arrives to meet  European Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier at the EU Commission  in Brussels on Friday. Photograph: AFP Ireland’s focus in the Brexit talks is avoiding a no-deal but Dublin would be amenable to granting a further extension to the UK if no agreement can be reached, Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said on Friday.“From an Irish perspective we of course think an extension is preferable to a no deal but I think there would need to be good reason behind that ask for an extension,” he said. He would not be drawn on whether that would have to be a general election in Britain. Speaking in Brussels after a regular meeting with the EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier, Mr Coveney told journalists there were “significant gaps between both sides” and said progress could not be made until the UK submitted substantial, legally operational proposals on an alternative to the backstop “which we simply haven’t seen yet”.“Our focus in Ireland right now is working with Michel Barnier and his task force to try to find a way of avoiding a no deal and settling these issues to actually get a managed Brexit which moves us in to a transition period for a next two to four years that gives us space to hopefully design a future relationship for everybody,” Mr Coveney said. “But until there’s a deal done, until there’s a withdrawal greed that can’t happen and there cannot be an agreement on a Withdrawal Agreement until we get a proposal which we simply haven’t seen yet. “As a result the two sides are quite a long way apart in my view.” Mr Barnier is also due to meet the UK Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay on Friday."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons september 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraph matt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Comment: The rise in private tutors is a sign of aspiration.

The Dutch bank’s Additional Tier 1 bonds fell the most in six months following news of the probe.“There’s so much uncertainty for the shareholders now,” said KBW analyst Jean-Pierre Lambert by phone. “The big question is whether there’s actual money laundering involved in this case. That’s what the prosecutor’s investigation probably is trying to find out.”The Dutch bank said in July said that it needs to review all of its 5 million retail clients after receiving a warning from the Dutch central bank. ABN Amro took a €114m\u0026nbspprovision for the checks in the second quarter, after already setting aside 85 million euros at the end of last year for stepping up financial crime prevention in commercial banking and the credit card business.Ex-CEO of bank unit at heart of money-laundering scandal found deadThe bank said at the time that sanctions may be imposed by the authorities but said it hasn’t made a provision for a possible fine as the “amount cannot be estimated at this time”.The investigation and the resulting share price drop may make it harder for the Dutch government – which still owns 56 per cent\u0026nbspafter a bailout in 2009 – to sell off the rest of its stake as it pledged to do during the bank’s IPO in 2015. Meanwhile, the bank is still looking for a new chief executive officer after Kees van Dijkhuizen announced in June that he will leave when his term ends in April.Following the ING fine and the central bank’s criticism, the largest Dutch banks have been stepping up compliance spending, including adding more staff to its crime prevention teams. Earlier this month, five of the country’s largest lenders said they are exploring a system to jointly monitor transactions in the fight against money laundering after the government pledged to clear legal hurdles that might prevent them from doing so.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Dutch bank’s Additional Tier 1 bonds fell the most in six months following news of the probe.“There’s so much uncertainty for the shareholders now,” said KBW analyst Jean-Pierre Lambert by phone. “The big question is whether there’s actual money laundering involved in this case.

In this case, some further monetary tightening (limited and gradual) is likely to be needed over time.Another scenario, and this is perhaps more likely to me, is of prolonged high Brexit uncertainty (even without a no-deal Brexit actually occurring). In this case, it might well be appropriate to maintain a highly accommodative monetary policy stance for an extended period and perhaps to loosen policy at some stage, especially if global growth remains disappointing.Welcome to The Independent\u0027s live coverage of business and economics events.\u0026nbspSterling has dropped sharply this morning after Bank of England policymaker Michael Saunders suggested that interest rates could be cut to cushion the blow of prolonged Brexit uncertainty.\u0026nbspPreviously the Bank had hinted that it would only cut rates in the near future if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.\u0026nbspThe pound fell to £1.228.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But overseas immigration, already lower than to England, has dropped sharply in recent years.“Now that net migration is falling and we face the coming challenge of Brexit, we find ourselves once again facing a major demographic challenge,” the authors write.By 2041, Scotland’s pensionable-age population is projected to increase by 265,000, while the working-age population is seen rising only by 38,000, according to National Records of Scotland. Net migration from overseas, or inflows minus outflows, is forecast to decline substantially in the next few years.The report says part of the solution will come from future technological change and from encouraging more people of working age to enter the labour market.“But even together these will not be enough to cover expected shortages. Immigration must, therefore, be a priority,” it notes.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.England\u0027s Jonathan Joseph is tackled by United State\u0027s Marcel Brache during their group match at the Rugby World Cup in Japan.

One example is the shops, hotels and restaurants sector. Another is what is known as the caring, leisure and other services industry.“Given the ageing population, the health and social care sector is likely to be particularly affected by labour shortages,” the authors write.In turn, the ageing of Scotland’s population will be partly determined by immigration, since foreign nationals living in the country are on average considerably younger than the domestic population.Given Scotland’s peculiarities, including a lower birth rate than in all other parts of the UK, it needs an immigration policy tailored to its needs, the report argues.The report\u0026nbspgoes on to examine the example of Canada where inidual provinces design the immigration policy together with the federal government, taking into account their distinct needs.“Evidence suggests this approach has mitigated depopulation in some provinces and has had a significant economic benefit,” the paper says.The authors stress they do not suggest importing Canada’s immigration model wholesale but, rather, using it as a starting point for designing a system for the UK and Scotland.“The biggest challenge to implementing such a system in the UK would be the tradition of centralised decision-making in this area, as well as the lack of a political consensus over the benefits of immigration,” they write.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A Labour government would move towards a 32-hour working week, raise the minimum wage to “at least £10 an hour”, ban zero-hours contracts and give all workers full employment rights from day one of employment, he pledged.He said he believed in “working to live, not living to work”.Eyes will now turn to the Conservative Party conference, which is scheduled to get underway on Sunday.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

But households do not expect broader economic difficulties to affect them confidence about the outlook for their \u0026nbsp personal finances is only fractionally below pre-referendum levels.\u0026nbspHowever, he cautions:\u0026nbspLooking ahead, the slowdown in both employment and wage growth signalled by most surveys suggests consumers’ optimism might begin to fade.\u0026nbspIn addition, we doubt that the forthcoming election will lead to a swift resolution of Brexit uncertainty indeed, the current level of consumers\u0027 confidence points on past form to another hung parliament.\u0026nbspConsumer confidence up in September\u0026nbspConsumers are feeling a little better than they did last month, suggesting they are keeping their fingers crossed in the run up-to the 31 October Brexit deadline, according to a new poll.\u0026nbspGfK\u0027s long-running index of what shoppers are thinking moved up to (minus) -12 in September from -14 in August, meaning more people are still pessimistic than optimistic.\u0026nbspPeople are very downbeat about the economy but much more positive when it comes to their own personal financial situation, the survey\u0026nbspreveals.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspJoe Staton, client strategy director at GfK, says:\u0026nbsp“More mixed signals this month as consumers continue to feel less than positive about the state of their personal finances and the general economy.\u0026nbspYes, all sub measures are higher, but they are anaemic in the case of our purchase intentions and how we view our wallets, while the results on the wider economy are still depressed.\u0026nbspSince the Brexit referendum we have witnessed a long succession of negative Overall Index scores with the overall trend downwards. This month, British consumers appear to be treading water during this wait-and-see run-up to October 31st.\u0026nbspConfidence is an important indicator which typically increases as the economy expands and decreases when the economy contracts and so far, consumer confidence is holding up.\u0026nbspWe certainly have a long way to go to match the record low headline score of -39 witnessed during the early days of the last recession.

In this case, some further monetary tightening (limited and gradual) is likely to be needed over time.Another scenario, and this is perhaps more likely to me, is of prolonged high Brexit uncertainty (even without a no-deal Brexit actually occurring). In this case, it might well be appropriate to maintain a highly accommodative monetary policy stance for an extended period and perhaps to loosen policy at some stage, especially if global growth remains disappointing.Welcome to The Independent\u0027s live coverage of business and economics events.\u0026nbspSterling has dropped sharply this morning after Bank of England policymaker Michael Saunders suggested that interest rates could be cut to cushion the blow of prolonged Brexit uncertainty.\u0026nbspPreviously the Bank had hinted that it would only cut rates in the near future if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.\u0026nbspThe pound fell to £1.228.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Until 2005 the website celebrated its birthday on September 7, supposedly marking the day it became an incorporated company.But the company actually filed incorporation papers on September 4, 1998, though it has never used this date as its birthday. Since 2005 it has marked its birthday on September 8, September 26 and, more recently, September 27.“When is Google’s birthday? I’m not sure even we know,” wrote Google employee Ryan Germick in 2013, adding: “Still, while there’s some differing opinions about when to bust out the candles and cake, one fun fact is that our first Doodle was posted even before Google was officially incorporated (30 August, 1998 vs 4 September, 1998).”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That site had a rather obvious picture at the top: a photo of a hairy hand on top of what appears to be skin, with large letter saying “BackRub” placed on top of it.It became Google in late 1997. The look was a little reminiscent of Word Art of old: the 3D letters tipped back, with strange pixelated edges.Created with Sketch.Here\u0027s how the Google logo has evolved  Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.This was Google\u0027s first ever logo, used from September to October 1998 Google went with an exclamation point from  October 1998 to May 1999 This newer logo lasted for 10 years and 11 months,  from May 31, 1999 to May 5, 2010This Google logo was used from May 6, 2010 to September 18, 2013The Google logo used from September 19, 2013 to September 1, 201566 The new additionThe newest Google Logo launched on the 1st of September 2015 This was Google\u0027s first ever logo, used from September to October 1998 Google went with an exclamation point from  October 1998 to May 1999 This newer logo lasted for 10 years and 11 months,  from May 31, 1999 to May 5, 2010This Google logo was used from May 6, 2010 to September 18, 2013The Google logo used from September 19, 2013 to September 1, 201566 The new additionThe newest Google Logo launched on the 1st of September 2015 At that time, the site was just as youthful. It was still functioning largely as a search engine for Stanford University, as well as the web, and offered an explanation of what it was at the top with a little text box underneath.The logo then got slightly more grown-up. It got a little flattened down –\u0026nbspthe 3D letters becoming curvy rather than looking like real objects – and the colours changed.Google also briefly got an exclamation mark in 1999. It disappeared a year later.That shouting logo would be the last very different one that the site would have. Until today’s redesign, the site stuck by its formula: two blue letters, two red and one yellow and one green, all in an entirely unobjectionable serif font.The company would gradually change that look, moving letters around, softening the colours and getting rid of shadow, but the concept remained the same until 2015.Most recently, it dropped the serifs that made the letters distinctive but harder to read on the tiny screens of mobiles. In doing so, it recognised one of the most important changes during its 21 years –\u0026nbsplike Google itself, the logo had been designed to be looked at on screens, but now a huge proportion of web browsing is done from phones and other mobile devices.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

For one, sudden delays at the border would damage the vital “just-in-time” supply chains across the English Channel, costing it as much as £50,000 a minute.JLR joins Toyota and BMW who have both announced temporary plant closures after the Brexit date.\u0026nbspToyota will stop production at its Burnaston factory in Derbyshire on 1 November.BMW is planning to shut down its Oxford site on 31 October and 1 November. If Britain leaves the EU without a deal and there is major disruption to BMW’s operations, the carmaker will send its Oxford workers on unpaid leave for at least two weeks.Anticipation of Brexit has compounded the problems facing UK carmakers. Like their peers around the world, they have been hit by an economic slowdown in China and lower sales of diesel cars, particularly in Europe.Additional reporting by ReutersOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They constantly sprinkled a gaseous mixture of\u0026nbspwater, carbon monoxide, ammonia, and methanol onto a material made to simulate cosmic dust, which was cooled down to -263C, and then hit with lamps that could kick off chemical reactions.Out of that machine came an icy film that gathered on the simulation of the dust that was inside the chamber. When researchers warmed that up and then analysed it, they found those nucleobases that are required to create\u0026nbspDNA and RNA, which are in turn required for life.They also found other interesting materials, such as amino acids, which make up proteins.Our findings suggest that the processes we reproduced could lead to the formation of the molecular precursors of life, said\u0026nbspYasuhiro\u0026nbspOba\u0026nbspin a statement. The results could improve our understanding of the early stages of chemical evolution in space.Previous experiments might actually have created those\u0026nbspnucleobases, the researchers said, but those conducting them did not have the highly precise measuring techniques to see that they were there.building blocks of life\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And the saintly and regal Danny Dyer stands as its finest ambassador.” “West believes Valjean to be “the greatest hero in all literature”, and he plays the part with all the care and intricacy such a character deserves.” 934 Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil (BBC2)“For anyone who’s not altogether sure how British politics turned so suddenly into a rolling dumpster fire from which all exits are blocked then Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil is a necessary public service to explain exactly, and exactly how needlessly, we all came to be here.”“There’s really been nothing quite like Catastrophe on our screens before, and it deserves its cult status for the quality of everything the production team do, not least the stunning cinematography in this finale. Thanks, all. I’m glad Catastrophe died happy. “Yet again the Williams have woven a brilliantly tangled web, helped in no small part by Karyo’s quietly arresting central turn” “It is both a revisionist – and frequently batty – take on the caped milieu and a winningly knotty mystery. And it surely is the first big-budget superhero tale more indebted to Wes Anderson than to Stan Lee.” “Like all the best detective dramas, Shetland engages the audience in the very process of detection. That way we grow intrigued, and we care. And so we find ourselves sitting next to Henshall in his (prominently featured) Volvo V70 estate, sharing his thoughts, intercepting suspects and being driven off the road by unidentified enemies.” 1434 This Time with Alan Partridge* (BBC1)This Time with Alan Partridge is such a consistently strong creative achievement that fears for the future of Alan Gordon Partridge, may, once again, be allayed.

But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland” Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme – but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise. The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he’s stray cat that’s just wandered in.1734 The Murder of Jill Dando (BBC)A tremendously sad, strange story then, and just as unfathomable today. Dando’s friends, family and the producer and director of the film have made a fitting and balanced tribute to her, something she deserves. I can’t really add anything to that.It is sometimes remarked that the Troubles in Northern Ireland make for an unpromising backdrop for a sitcom about adolescent kids. Well, yer man’s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.While there are plenty of well-turned one-liners, the deeper attraction of Fleabag is schadenfreude.

OK, not much competition, but still... Despite the po-faced title, you realise very quickly that it’s not yet another drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch or yet another attempt by Laura Kuenssberg to explain the inexplicable, or yet another show with the public arguing about stuff they don’t understand. Rather, it’s a very clever, very funny, very \u0027different\u0027 parcel of bollocks to Brexit.The footage is glorious, especially the side-on tracking shots of the birds and the hunting, where it is as if the cameramen were able to set up a rail along the ocean. Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough’s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families. Our Planet is more of a greatest-hits parade, with overblown orchestral soundtrack and ponderous intonation. You can’t buy love, even if you pay for David Attenborough.2234 Line of Duty (BBC)Plausibility is a spectrum Bodyguard became ridiculous but Line of Duty stays just the right side, and as usual there is more plot in an hour than in whole series of other programmes. As well as being gripping entertainment, Line of Duty has become an effective examination of the relationship between the state and the inidual.

The police are there to save us from ourselves but can only do it if they are subjected to constant scrutiny. It’s exhausting work, policing the police.Joseph is almost never out of shot, whether seen from afar, contemplating a bottle of strong cider in a playground, or in visceral close-up, clutching his doner to his face.

The fact any of it is remotely watchable is testament to Stephen Graham’s abilities.

The dominant one as we continue our quest into the 2030s and beyond, will be Vivienne, or Viv, Rook, played brilliantly by Emma Thompson. As a bit of a long-term Emma-sceptic I was actually startled by how good she is in the role of the epitome of everything she has spent her life hating and campaigning against, for Viv is a horrifically nasty businessperson turned populist politician with the most terrifying of views. Viv Rook makes Ann Widdecombe look like, well, Emma Thompson at an Extinction Rebellion sit-in.As the series develops, it’s clearer than ever that Eve and Villanelle are more similar than they are different. Villanelle’s new vulnerability invites us to question what it is exactly she wants from Polastri. First time around she was toying with a more worthy adversary, but why now? Polastri, by contrast, is frayed around the edges, a terrible wife to her husband Nico (Owen McDonnell) and an even worse intelligence agent to her boss Carolyn Martens (Fiona Shaw). The script is still tight and the jokes are still there, as are Villanelle’s accents, outfits and abrupt killings, but without the will-theywon’t-they energy of the initial plot, it is harder to care.Timely, bleak, intelligent and compelling, Chernobyl is a triumph of a disaster.Season three\u0027s knuckle-whitening finale is far less disappointing than the last.The writing is sharp and well observed, probing the fault lines between small talk and real problems.A touching tribute to a flawed reality TV star.Despite the strength of its ensemble cast, Succession is a feat of writing above all. Although it is ostensibly a business show, you won’t learn much about the minutiae of media deals by watching it. Its key dynamic, between father and children, means that it is limited in the amount that can actually happen without risking the magic. The writers, led by the creator Jesse Armstrong, who also gave us Peep Show, weave just-about-plausible and sympathetic characters from a web of insults and backstabbing, and tight editing and camerawork ratchets up tension from a slow-moving plot.In Kathy Burke’s All Women on Channel 4, the unapologetic, effing-and-blinding, salt-of-the-earth actor meets lots of different women – from nuns to reality stars – to understand what it means to be a member of the fairer sex, so to speak, in 2019.So here we have an intriguing, but rather flawed sort of Big Brother thriller set in our contemporary world of digital snooping, near constant surveillance and (a topical touch) widespread use of facial recognition technology.Top Boy can be bleak and violent, with dialogue so naturalistic that it verges on the impenetrable, but in telling stories that rarely get heard, it asks us to think differently about the city we live in.“As a slightly cheesy reminder of what we love about Doctor Who – i.e. the fact it gives us an intergalactic eccentric in a big flappy overcoat shouting at Daleks  – this is a New Year treat that more than delivers” 234 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2)“Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity – a “Proustian wander through Scotland”.

But, inevitably, as he scrawls out his campaigning brainwaves on a whiteboard, there is a touch of that deductive maverick Sherlock in his portrayal of this scruffy, balding political saboteur.” 534 A Year of British Murder (Channel 4)“The programme-makers must have done much to win the confidence of so many friends and families, as they went through unspeakable personal pain but they repay that confidence with an understated and powerful film.” 634 The Secret Life of the Zoo (Channel 4)“This documentary goes behind the shrubbery to show off these animals and their s. The humans are a pretty exotic bunch too, judging by some of the lines they come out with.”“You see, saint or sinner, prince or pauper, we are all part of one race, the brotherhood of man. And the saintly and regal Danny Dyer stands as its finest ambassador.” “West believes Valjean to be “the greatest hero in all literature”, and he plays the part with all the care and intricacy such a character deserves.” 934 Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil (BBC2)“For anyone who’s not altogether sure how British politics turned so suddenly into a rolling dumpster fire from which all exits are blocked then Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil is a necessary public service to explain exactly, and exactly how needlessly, we all came to be here.”“There’s really been nothing quite like Catastrophe on our screens before, and it deserves its cult status for the quality of everything the production team do, not least the stunning cinematography in this finale. Thanks, all. I’m glad Catastrophe died happy. “Yet again the Williams have woven a brilliantly tangled web, helped in no small part by Karyo’s quietly arresting central turn” “It is both a revisionist – and frequently batty – take on the caped milieu and a winningly knotty mystery. And it surely is the first big-budget superhero tale more indebted to Wes Anderson than to Stan Lee.” “Like all the best detective dramas, Shetland engages the audience in the very process of detection. That way we grow intrigued, and we care. And so we find ourselves sitting next to Henshall in his (prominently featured) Volvo V70 estate, sharing his thoughts, intercepting suspects and being driven off the road by unidentified enemies.” 1434 This Time with Alan Partridge* (BBC1)This Time with Alan Partridge is such a consistently strong creative achievement that fears for the future of Alan Gordon Partridge, may, once again, be allayed. Or Alayned, perhaps.” Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard. There were the allegations, the out-of-court settlements, the arrest, the trial and not-guilty verdict. But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland” Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme – but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise. The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he’s stray cat that’s just wandered in.1734 The Murder of Jill Dando (BBC)A tremendously sad, strange story then, and just as unfathomable today. Dando’s friends, family and the producer and director of the film have made a fitting and balanced tribute to her, something she deserves. I can’t really add anything to that.It is sometimes remarked that the Troubles in Northern Ireland make for an unpromising backdrop for a sitcom about adolescent kids. Well, yer man’s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.While there are plenty of well-turned one-liners, the deeper attraction of Fleabag is schadenfreude. The character is as old as Daisy Buchanan or Lydia Bennett or Scarlett O’Hara. The best compliment to Waller-Bridge and her cast is that they find fresh clothes in which to dress these ancient monsters.2034 Road to Brexit (BBC)The Road to Brexit is easily the best thing to emerge from the whole brexit imbroglio. OK, not much competition, but still... Despite the po-faced title, you realise very quickly that it’s not yet another drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch or yet another attempt by Laura Kuenssberg to explain the inexplicable, or yet another show with the public arguing about stuff they don’t understand. Rather, it’s a very clever, very funny, very \u0027different\u0027 parcel of bollocks to Brexit.The footage is glorious, especially the side-on tracking shots of the birds and the hunting, where it is as if the cameramen were able to set up a rail along the ocean. Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough’s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families. Our Planet is more of a greatest-hits parade, with overblown orchestral soundtrack and ponderous intonation. You can’t buy love, even if you pay for David Attenborough.2234 Line of Duty (BBC)Plausibility is a spectrum Bodyguard became ridiculous but Line of Duty stays just the right side, and as usual there is more plot in an hour than in whole series of other programmes. As well as being gripping entertainment, Line of Duty has become an effective examination of the relationship between the state and the inidual. The shadowy government forces are elected the organised crime gangs are fuelled by the drug trade. The police are there to save us from ourselves but can only do it if they are subjected to constant scrutiny. It’s exhausting work, policing the police.Joseph is almost never out of shot, whether seen from afar, contemplating a bottle of strong cider in a playground, or in visceral close-up, clutching his doner to his face. There are few actors you could trust with so much screen time, especially with such a pared back and naturalistic script. The fact any of it is remotely watchable is testament to Stephen Graham’s abilities. No man working in Britain today can drink a pint with more pathos.\u0027Good Omens is a hugely enjoyable, imaginative premiere, as close to Pratchett’s vision as anyone could have dared dream. And while the melancholy tone may not be for everyone, fans of the book will surely be sated.\u00272534 Years and YearsYears and Years, then, is favoured by some wit, a cornucopia of fab talent and promising characters. The dominant one as we continue our quest into the 2030s and beyond, will be Vivienne, or Viv, Rook, played brilliantly by Emma Thompson. As a bit of a long-term Emma-sceptic I was actually startled by how good she is in the role of the epitome of everything she has spent her life hating and campaigning against, for Viv is a horrifically nasty businessperson turned populist politician with the most terrifying of views. Viv Rook makes Ann Widdecombe look like, well, Emma Thompson at an Extinction Rebellion sit-in.As the series develops, it’s clearer than ever that Eve and Villanelle are more similar than they are different. Villanelle’s new vulnerability invites us to question what it is exactly she wants from Polastri. First time around she was toying with a more worthy adversary, but why now? Polastri, by contrast, is frayed around the edges, a terrible wife to her husband Nico (Owen McDonnell) and an even worse intelligence agent to her boss Carolyn Martens (Fiona Shaw). The script is still tight and the jokes are still there, as are Villanelle’s accents, outfits and abrupt killings, but without the will-theywon’t-they energy of the initial plot, it is harder to care.Timely, bleak, intelligent and compelling, Chernobyl is a triumph of a disaster.Season three\u0027s knuckle-whitening finale is far less disappointing than the last.The writing is sharp and well observed, probing the fault lines between small talk and real problems.A touching tribute to a flawed reality TV star.Despite the strength of its ensemble cast, Succession is a feat of writing above all. Although it is ostensibly a business show, you won’t learn much about the minutiae of media deals by watching it. Its key dynamic, between father and children, means that it is limited in the amount that can actually happen without risking the magic. The writers, led by the creator Jesse Armstrong, who also gave us Peep Show, weave just-about-plausible and sympathetic characters from a web of insults and backstabbing, and tight editing and camerawork ratchets up tension from a slow-moving plot.In Kathy Burke’s All Women on Channel 4, the unapologetic, effing-and-blinding, salt-of-the-earth actor meets lots of different women – from nuns to reality stars – to understand what it means to be a member of the fairer sex, so to speak, in 2019.So here we have an intriguing, but rather flawed sort of Big Brother thriller set in our contemporary world of digital snooping, near constant surveillance and (a topical touch) widespread use of facial recognition technology.Top Boy can be bleak and violent, with dialogue so naturalistic that it verges on the impenetrable, but in telling stories that rarely get heard, it asks us to think differently about the city we live in.Markle’s Suits storyline ended with her character Rachel marrying Mike Ross (Patrick J Adams) and subsequently leaving for Seattle.Suits has a spin-off series, Pearson, which follows Gina Torres’s eponymous lawyer as she enters the dirty world of Chicago politics.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

For example, scheduled payments may not go through or, if consumers can’t access their accounts to make payments, that can have a negative impact on their credit report. This can damage their ability to be accepted for financial products in future, like a mobile phone contract or even a mortgage. It could mean they only have access to higher interest rates, which increases the cost of credit.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But overseas immigration, already lower than to England, has dropped sharply in recent years.“Now that net migration is falling and we face the coming challenge of Brexit, we find ourselves once again facing a major demographic challenge,” the authors write.By 2041, Scotland’s pensionable-age population is projected to increase by 265,000, while the working-age population is seen rising only by 38,000, according to National Records of Scotland. Net migration from overseas, or inflows minus outflows, is forecast to decline substantially in the next few years.The report says part of the solution will come from future technological change and from encouraging more people of working age to enter the labour market.“But even together these will not be enough to cover expected shortages. Immigration must, therefore, be a priority,” it notes.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.England\u0027s Jonathan Joseph is tackled by United State\u0027s Marcel Brache during their group match at the Rugby World Cup in Japan.

One example is the shops, hotels and restaurants sector. Another is what is known as the caring, leisure and other services industry.“Given the ageing population, the health and social care sector is likely to be particularly affected by labour shortages,” the authors write.In turn, the ageing of Scotland’s population will be partly determined by immigration, since foreign nationals living in the country are on average considerably younger than the domestic population.Given Scotland’s peculiarities, including a lower birth rate than in all other parts of the UK, it needs an immigration policy tailored to its needs, the report argues.The report\u0026nbspgoes on to examine the example of Canada where inidual provinces design the immigration policy together with the federal government, taking into account their distinct needs.“Evidence suggests this approach has mitigated depopulation in some provinces and has had a significant economic benefit,” the paper says.The authors stress they do not suggest importing Canada’s immigration model wholesale but, rather, using it as a starting point for designing a system for the UK and Scotland.“The biggest challenge to implementing such a system in the UK would be the tradition of centralised decision-making in this area, as well as the lack of a political consensus over the benefits of immigration,” they write.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Astronomers did not expect that such a small star would be able to serve as home to such a vast planet.Around such stars there should only be planets the size of the Earth or somewhat more massive Super-Earths, said Christoph Mordasini, professor at the University of Bern and member of the National Centre of Competence in Research (NCCR) PlanetS. GJ 3512b, however, is a giant planet with a mass about half as big as the one of Jupiter, and thus at least one order of magnitude more massive than the planets predicted by theoretical models for such small stars.The Spanish-led team who first spotted the planet wrote in the journal Science that the newly confirmed planet did not form the usual, gradual way, where a solid core of merging particles takes shape before a gas buildup. Instead, in a surprise to scientists, the planet seems to have arisen straight from gas.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberThe eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberLead author Juan Carlos Morales of the Institute of Space Studies of Catalonia said the planet may be almost as big as its star. A year there is about 200 days.It was very exciting finding this planet because it was completely unexpected, Morales wrote in an email. The results indicate a new population of massive planets may also exist around low-mass stars.Nasa scientists get unprecedented view as black hole rips apart a starMorales and his team maintain that gravitational instability in a young star\u0027s disk of gas and dust could, in some cases, result in the quick formation of huge gas planets — even when the star is minuscule. This new world is an extraordinary candidate for this process, said Hubert Klahr of Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Germany, part of the research team. This find prompts us to review our models.In a companion article, Yale University astronomer Greg Laughlin, who was not involved in the study, pointed out that more than 4,000 so-called exoplanets have been confirmed in solar systems outside our own. While another new one, by itself, is no longer particularly noteworthy, he said, one that challenges current theories of planet formation can animate astronomers.The planet orbiting this particularly small and cool red dwarf star, officially known as GJ 3512, is at least half the mass of Jupiter. Scientists are unable to measure its dimensions, but models indicate it may be comparable to Jupiter in size, according to Morales.Using observatories in Spain, the researchers repeatedly studied the star\u0027s wobbling motion to disclose the planet in its lopsided orbit, rather than rely on the transit method in which a brief, periodic dimming of starlight indicates a planet passing in front of its star.The star is so faint it almost didn\u0027t make it into the group\u0027s survey. Scientists needed more small stars for sampling and so added a few at the last minute.We were lucky to do so because otherwise we would have never made this discovery, Ignasi Ribas, director of the Catalonia space studies institute, said in a statement.Morales and his colleagues continue to search for a second planet orbiting this dwarf star. There may have been a third planet that was ejected from the system long ago, they noted.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Whether people like it or not, the temporary prime minister has to be Corbyn.An SNP spokesperson said the party was committed to stopping a no-deal Brexit and removing this dangerous and undemocratic prime minister as soon as possible.The spokesperson said: “It is now possible - if the political will is there - that parties could come together to ensure that the letter to secure an extension is not left in the hands of Boris Johnson and his cronies, who are determined to find a way to get around the Benn Act, but is instead sent by a temporary caretaker prime minister, who would be in office only as long as is necessary to send the letter, with an election held immediately afterwards.We remain open to all options to achieve the aim of stopping a no-deal Brexit and getting rid of Boris Johnson.”Even with SNP support, it would come down to a knife-edge vote for Mr Corbyn. There are 288 Tory MPs, as well as 10\u0026nbspDemocratic Unionists, so the opposition would need some of the 34 independent MPs\u0026nbspto come on board.Labour argued that the plan was the simplest and most democratic way to stop no deal.However the Liberal Democrats believe a temporary government led by Mr Corbyn cannot achieve the necessary support across the House, as he would need the backing of ex-Tory MPs and defectors from his own party.Kirstene Hair, Tory\u0026nbspMP for Angus, said: “This report confirms what many have long suspected – SNP MPs will happily prop up Jeremy Corbyn in No10.“There is no doubt that Corbyn’s weak stance on indyref2 is a deciding factor for the nationalists.“He has already left the door open for a re-run of the 2014 referendum if he becomes prime minister.“Only a Conservative government will stand up for those who voted ‘No’ in what was meant to be a once in a generation event.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Umar’s wife was among six Pakistani women and a Bangladeshi national arrested, and a huge cache of weapons was recovered.Tribal leaders, politicians and officials in Helmand, however, disputed this account and accused the US and Afghan forces of killing around 40 civilians, most of them returning from a wedding party on Sunday night, many of them women and children.Hamid Karzai, the former Afghan president, has been among public figures who has condemned the deaths and called for an investigation into what happened.Created with Sketch.Afghanistan war: lives of children devastated by the endless conflict Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Andrew QuiltySave the Children220 Nooria*, 15 in the home her family has lived in for the past two years in Mazar-i SharifShe was forced to flee her home with her family after their town was attacked by armed groups.

They say that Umar had been tracked to the compound in the town of Musa Qala after extensive surveillance and was about to carry out terrorist acts when the military mission was authorised.AQIS, which was set up by Zawahiri in 2014, is known to have operated in Pakistan and Bangladesh as well as Afghanistan. It is not known to have a strong presence in India, but has received support from some Kashmiri separatist groups, including Anasurut-Tawhid Wai Jihad Kashmir.Four years ago, US forces raided an AQIS training facility in Kandahar, where they are believed to have established bases before branching out to Helmand, the former centre of British operations in Afghanistan. The town of Musa Qala, where the raid took place, had particular resonance, having changed hands several times under a British strategy of engagement with the Talibs,\u0026nbspone which the Americans were highly critical.airstrike in Lashkar Gah\u0026nbsp(AFPGetty)US and Afghan forces faced fierce resistance, according to American officials, from a combined group of determined al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters when they surrounded a compound in Musa Qala late on Sunday night, with a firefight lasting more than six hours.US warplanes were then called in to break the stalemate and carried out what American officials described as “precision strikes”, followed by the troops moving in.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Because of the heavy fighting, we did conduct targeted precision strikes against barricaded terrorists firing on Afghan and US forces.”US officials say that they are attempting to establish whether women, apart from the ones they had captured, may have been hiding in the compound when the shooting and air strikes were taking place.Mohammed Zaman Hamdard, an official with the Helmand police force, said that the al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters had fled into people’s homes during the raid and started shooting from there, drawing fire back in response. As a result “three women are among the dead, and three children are wounded”, he stated.Karim Atal, a member of Helmand’s Provincial Council, said it had not been possible to obtain reliable information because mobile phones were not working in the area. US-led forces jam signals as a matter of routine during operations. “Some say 14 civilians were killed, others says 60, many are saying 40,” he said.Abdul Majid Akhunzada, a fellow council member, claimed that at least 12 people from a wedding party were wounded in the air strike, but he was unaware of their identities. Omar Zowak, a spokesman for the Helmand Governorate, claimed that three cars had been hit from the air, but the numbers of wounded were unclear.Read the first part of the Conflict Without End series here:\u0026nbspAfghanistan election marred by bloodshed and corruption and the second part here:\u0026nbspAfghanistan families torn apart by deadly carnage: ‘My grandson will have to see more dead bodies when he grows up’Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

But there is expectation that they will resume again in the future, with the US president desperate to get US forces back home before the election next year, allowing him to claim credit for ending the longest war in America’s history.Many of the candidates in the coming Afghan election, including some who would not have countenanced this happening in the past, now say\u0026nbspthe push for Taliban involvement in government is going to get stronger over the coming months and may be difficult to resist.\u0026nbspThis is likely, they say, not just because of the signals from Washington\u0026nbspbut the violent reality on the ground, with the Taliban\u0026nbspand other Islamist groups like al-Qaeda and Isis controlling expanding swathes of territory, and war weariness from a population suffering relentless bombings and shootings.\u0026nbspThe star attraction at the Bamiyan rally is Abdullah Abdullah, who had been\u0026nbspco-leader of the current National Unity Government with President Ashraf Ghani and who is now his main rival at the polls.Bamiyan via helicopter on Wednesday\u0026nbsp(Getty)As we fly\u0026nbspup to Bamiyan together from Kabul on an army helicopter, Dr Abdullah, who had the title of chief executive in the administration, tells\u0026nbspof the need to find a way to end the bloody conflict, and how power-sharing with the Taliban could be the answer.“The Taliban are a reality in the country, their forces, their supporters, their foreign connections. Everybody agrees you cannot finish this war by just fighting and killing everybody. Hopefully the Taliban see it as well,” he said.“The point is to move to a solution, and one I would like to have is an interim set-up.

The Americans are concerned – they think they can get troop levels down to zero – and so there is urgency to all this, and we need to take this seriously.”There are many among the people of Bamiyan who will view the Taliban regaining authority with great trepidation. The Hazara Shias of the region were the victims of a number of massacres and mass rapes at the hands of the Pashtun Sunni Islamists during the savage civil war.Bamiyan province has experienced clashes between the two ethnic groups since the fall of the Taliban. Its wondrous landscape of mountains, gorges and valleys, deep green fields and turquoise lakes – and fascinating architecture from its time as a conduit of the Silk Road – have largely escaped the strife of recent years.There has been investment in infrastructure and education and promotion of woman’s rights. Four years after the Taliban were whipping women for not wearing the burqa, Habiba Sarabi in Bamiyan became Afghanistan’s first female governor in 2005.But the region has become more isolated. The roads to Kabul in the southeast are now dangerous, as are the roads to Kunduz and Mazari Sharif in the north. In the autumn of last year, the Taliban fighters began targeting Hazara residents in the central provinces of Uruzgan and Ghazni. Hundreds of people were killed and thousands displaced in the fighting which followed.Residents of Bamiyan, like those in other parts of the country, have received messages from the Taliban to keep away from election rallies during the campaign and polling stations on voting days. But a group of young students waiting to hear Dr Abdullah and the fellow speakers in his coalition, Karim Khalili and Mohammed Mohaqiq, point out they have\u0026nbspno intention of being put off by the threats. They have\u0026nbspcome to confirm they are making the right decision when they vote in Saturday’s presidential election.“It’s the first one that I have been able to vote in because of my age and I don’t want to make a mistake”, said Parwan Nazari, who is studying at Bamiyan University. “I think I’ll vote for Dr Abdullah, but I wanted to listen to him and also the others, this is a good opportunity. I will certainly be voting and so will all my friends, our families are very encouraging about this.”Ms Nazari and her friend, Nisa Ghaznavi, both 19, are reading English literature and both want to be journalists. “I want to find out for myself what is going on rather than just depending on social media. I want to travel as well and see other places. I want to look at the future,” says\u0026nbspMs Ghaznavi. Banen Haidari is also looking to the future, but is also deeply interested in aspects of the past. She is studying geology and architecture, and one of the key reasons for her doing so is “that”, she says, pointing at the rock niches where one of the Buddhas once stood.They are now covered in scaffolding for buttresses. “But we are hoping that work will start, and I want to be part of a team which works on rebuilding them. I have always been interested, since I was little.”\u0026nbspAll the women in the group want\u0026nbspthe statues to be rebuilt, some not just to restore heritage, but in the hope\u0026nbspit will bring in tourists. “We need the money, and it’s always good to see foreign people,”\u0026nbspsays\u0026nbspMs Ghaznavi.The women in the group are too young to have experienced Taliban atrocities firsthand, although they have\u0026nbspheard about them from their parents. None of them, however, object\u0026nbspto the Taliban forming part of a future government – “people are just tired of war”, Ms Nazari says.\u0026nbspBut the friends agree\u0026nbspwith Fatima Alizada, who warns\u0026nbspcaution:\u0026nbsp“We need to make sure that the Taliban don’t impose their old rules, that they respect the reforms which have been carried out.”Ms Alizada, 19, who is doing a course in Islamic studies and wants to be a defence lawyer, does not think the emancipation of women has gone far enough in Afghanistan. “Why haven’t we got one single woman running for the presidency?” she wants\u0026nbspto know.\u0026nbspSitting in the shade of a wall, Haji Abdullah can\u0026nbspthink of no good memories of the Taliban. “All I can recall are tortures and beatings, people being jailed, men forced not to cut their beards, so no, that was a bad time,” he says.\u0026nbspBamiyan (Getty)“I remember when they blew up the Buddha. They had these big guns, they were firing from a long way away. I could see the statues getting hit, 18, 19 times, they just kept on firing at them. What they did was very bad.”Haji Abdullah is ambivalent about the Taliban returning. “We want peace, yes, but they must accept the laws and not interfere with our lives.” The\u0026nbsp36-year-old shopkeeper is doing alright, and not hard-up financially, despite having six children. He would vote for Dr Abdullah\u0026nbspbut also wants\u0026nbspto say Ashraf Ghani\u0026nbspis “a good man.”Ahmed Ali Wahdat, the owner of a carpentry business, is more forthright. “You cannot trust the Taliban. We know what they did last time, all the killings that took place, homes burnt.“They wanted to destroy. They used cannons and dynamite on the Buddhas, but even then it took them weeks – you know, those statues were so strong.\u0026nbspAnd now they can be rebuilt again, so they won’t stay destroyed. It’s the way us Hazaras have had to be strong to survive, the way Afghanistan has had to survive. Why give all that up, bringing back the people who did this?”Read the first part of the Conflict Without End series here:\u0026nbspAfghanistan election marred by bloodshed and corruption and the second part here:\u0026nbspAfghanistan families torn apart by deadly carnage: ‘My grandson will have to see more dead bodies when he grows up’ and the third part here:\u0026nbspRaid on al-Qaeda bomb factory leaves dozens of wedding-goers dead, in latest Afghan violence​Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

time, as long as they promise to dress “modestly”.The oil-rich Islamic kingdom has announced it will offer tourist visas as part of a drive to ersify its economy away from oil.Women who come to Saudi Arabia from overseas will not have to wear the abaya – a long, black robe and headscarf which covers women from head to foot – which all locals by law must wear outside their homes.But they will be required to wear “modest clothing”, the country’s head of tourism Ahmed al-Khateeb said in a statement.He did not elaborate on what exactly would amount to modest dress in the eyes of the ultra-conservative religious authorities who govern the kingdom.Created with Sketch.Attack on major oil facilities in Saudi Arabia: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with

the treasures we have to share – five UNESCO World Heritage Sites, a vibrant local culture and breath-taking natural beauty.”The opening up of the country to foreigners is part of a recent effort to change perceptions of the reclusive kingdom by the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.In 2017 women were finally allowed to drive and last year the rules which forbade travel without a male  were also relaxed.\u0026nbspThe liberalisation programme has also introduced mixed-gender concerts and new cinemas.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill

As well as creating new visas, the authorities are also spending billions of dollars trying to build a tourism industry from scratch, including constructing new hotels, luxury island resorts, theme parks, a safari, and developing some of its ancient historical sites.The push to ersify away from oil was given greater urgency just a few weeks ago when a drone attack, blamed by the West on Iran, targeted Saudi Arabia’s oil infrastructure.Damage done at the plants in Abqaiq and Khurais cut Saudi oil production by half and the volume will not be returned to normal levels until next month, underlying the vulnerability of the kingdom’s oil economy to attack.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The least we can do is take care of those they leave behind.These failings are immoral and they are a direct assault on military effectiveness and therefore the defence of our country.Why  Because they corrode the morale of our servicemen and women.However many ultra-sophisticated aircraft carriers, F combat fighters, tanks and missiles we supply, the morale of the fighting man will always remain the cornerstone of combat power.High morale achieves miracles in battle, low morale leads to disaster and defeat.Low morale also makes people vote with their feet, signing off for civilian jobs where they will be properly looked after.This helps explain the woeful undermanning in the forces today, where recruiting has failed miserably to keep up with outflow.Yet a government that hopes to plug the gaping hole by increasing recruitment of soldiers from the Commonwealth shoots itself in both feet. It has made it virtually impossible for many recruits to be joined here by their families due to petty bureaucracy that could be overcome at a stroke.The Sun’s Never Forget Them campaign led the Government in July to create an Office for Veterans’ Affairs, with direct access to the Cabinet, with a new minister for Defence People and Veterans heading it.At the same time the PM promised the Government would: “Do all it can to support our Armed Forces from the day they enlist and for the rest of their lives.”No one expects overnight transformation.But after two months we have not heard one single new idea on tackling all of these age-old problems from the minister, Johnny Mercer.Mr Mercer is no ordinary politician. He’s a distinguished and courageous former soldier who fought in Afghanistan during three tours of duty and a man who I and many veterans admire and respect.He went “on strike” during Theresa May’s premiership in protest at the prosecution of British troops over historical allegations from the Northern Ireland campaign.Yet only last week we witnessed the opening of a murder trial against an elderly former soldier for alleged crimes in Londonderry half a century ago.Mr Mercer could not have done anything to prevent this.But he has not explained to the public how he intends to halt the disgraceful hounding of veterans through the courts in what is the greatest betrayal of their own Armed Forces by any government in history.In response to the Defence Committee report Mr Mercer tweeted: “I will offer a private informal session to the committee and update on every single issue raised.”Such discretion would be the way of a soldier but it is not what we expect from political leaders.The British public, as well as serving soldiers and veterans, are outraged by the abuse of our troops and those who have served.What we demand is to be told about solutions that will be actioned as soon as possible.Mr Mercer has experience of the issues raised in the latest report and served on the Defence Committee.Since entering Parliament in  he has campaigned energetically to sort out the plight of both servicemen and veterans, describing it as his main mission.If he was new to the forces’ problems we could understand he might need time to gain understanding and consider possible options.But he was selected because he has a deep understanding and experience and should have been able to announce his programme on day one.I worked at the centre of government for years and know the quagmire that confronts a minister trying to fight through a bureaucracy resistant to change and adept at wielding the civil service machinery that exists to frustrate progress.But Mr Mercer must find the resolve to overcome these obstacles. He should adopt Churchill’s dictum of “action this day”.There is no time for private briefings, blusterings and paralysis.Our troops are deployed on operations around the globe today. And who knows when the next intense battle will begin, whether over Russian expansion, Iranian aggression, or Chinese provocation, or something totally unforeseen We expect our fighting men and women to lay down their livesnecessary.It is vital that the Government and Mr Mercer do everything they can totheir courage and dedication in deeds as well as words.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Heres the latest on the teenager and her UN Climate summit address.Greta was born in Stockholm, Sweden, in .She shot to fame as the poster-girl for climate change awareness after a picture of her “school strike for climate change” was posted on Facebook by Swedish eco-warrior, Ingmar Rentzhog.Her strike inspired tens of thousands of students from around the world to join her #FridaysforFuture demonstrations - skipping school every Friday to protest climate change.Her work in the UK has included meeting politicians from across the spectrum in Westminster as the Extinction Rebellion protests took place outside.She told them her future and those of other young people had been sold adding: We probably dont even have a future any more.The Swedish teenager grabbed the worlds attention when she staged a School Strike for Climate in front of the Swedish Parliament in August .Greta was driven to take action by a record heatwave in northern Europe and forest fires that ravaged swathes of Swedish land up to the Arctic.The teenager said she is inspired by US civil rights activist Rosa Parks, who refused to give up her seat to a white passenger on a racially segregated bus.I learned she was an introvert, and Im also an introvert, she said.The eldest of two girls, Greta’s mother is Swedish opera singer Malena Ernman while her father is actor Svante Thunberg.The young activist sailed across the Atlantic in a “zero carbon” yacht to attend the UN climate action summit in August .She made the two-week voyage in the state-of-the-art ft Malizia II yacht - one of the fastest ocean sailing boats on the planet.The £m boat - skippered by Boris Herrmann - was fitted with solar  and underwater turbines that produce electricity on board, with the aim of making the journey zero-carbon.The non-stop journey eco warrior Greta made is - in theory - the lowest-carbon option to cross the Atlantic.Before setting off from Plymouth, Thunberg accepted that solar yachts are not for everyone but says she was hoping to demonstrate there are alternatives to air travel.“I don’t tell people what to do. People can do what they want,” she said.Once in the US, Greta continued to meet with fellow activists and addressed world leaders on their moral imperative to tackle climate change.Greta delivered an impassioned speech to world leaders at the summit, saying they had “stolen my childhood” with their “empty words”.She told leaders they would never be forgiventhey failed to tackle rising temperatures.People are suffering, people are dying, entire ecosystems are collapsing, we are in the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is money and the fairy tale of endless economic growth. How dare you  she asked.How dare you continue to look away, and come here saying that you are doing enough, when the politics and solutions needed are still nowhere in sight.The teenager said emissions should be cut to keep temperature rises to .C, beyond which scientists have warned the impacts of climate change become much more severe.And she warned that the situation could not be solved by business as usual and some technological solutions.The eyes of all future generations are on you. If you choose to fail us, I say we will never forgive you.Greta looked furiously at US President Donald Trump as he unexpectedly arrived at the summit, before leaving again after  minutes.The climate change sceptic then took to Twitter to mock the internationally respected activist, who is nearly  years his junior.Greta, who has taken a year off school to bring about more action on climate change, will also be speaking at the COP climate conference in Chile in December.Greta says she first heard about climate change when she was eight, but couldnt understand why so little was being done about it.When she was aged  she suffered severe depression and stopped talking which led to her being diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder and selective mutism.Greta has persuaded her parents to become vegan like herself and to give up flying and she only travels abroad by train - unlike other climate change campaigners.According to one profile, she doesn’t make small talk, explaining that: “I only say what’s necessary.”After her school strike inspired millions, she continued to gain international attention after speaking at the UN Climate Talks in Poland in December  before speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos a month later.In March  she was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by three Norwegian MPs which she said she was honoured to receive.In August , she said of the devastating Amazon rainforest fires that they are a clear sign we need to stop destroying nature."},{"url":null,"title":"jane moore climate change greta thunberg","story":"She cares deeply about climate change and, evenshe’s simply citing the scientic research of more experienced others, her glowering, teenage presence at the UN summit has certainly thrown down a gauntlet to world leaders.Trouble is, that while her compelling, “you have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words”, speech was specically aimed at those in power, some of her less well informed young fans have seized it as a “them and us” narrative against their parents.“My kids are giving me hell about how we’ve destroyed the planet for them,” sighed a friend whose children took the day off from their private school to attend the recent climate change march.“Will they refuse to get on a plane for a foreign holiday ” I inquired. “Will they refuse to get in the car when it’s raining and walk instead  Will they relinquish their smart phones or the TVs in their bedrooms ”“Don’t be daft,” she said with a laugh.Indeed. While a large percentage of the younger generation are genuinely concerned about the planet — and rightly so — how many of them are actually going to do their bit beyond the enviable opportunity to skip school on a sunny day and virtue signal with a hand-made banner Deliciously tempting though it may be to blame their parents, the simple truth is that up to  years ago, no one had even heard of climate change.Far from worrying about the planet heating up, I distinctly remember our geography teacher telling us that a mini ice age was coming.In the meantime, I walked or cycled to school every day, wore jumpers indoors in winter because we didn’t have central heating and baked in the stling heat of the summer of ’ in classrooms without the luxury of air-con.There were no ready meals, we ate simple food cooked by mothers who had grown up with rationing, the vast supermarkets of today didn’t exist and we didn’t have a freezer.The only “takeaway” in easy reach was a fish and chip shop and the first time we ever ate out was when I scraped a couple of O-level passes and my mum took me to the local Berni Inn to celebrate.Our milk came in glass bottles, we ate locally grown, seasonal fruit and vegetablesand I didn’t set eyes on an avocado or any other exotic foodstuff until well into adulthood.At school, I was taught to mend things, not throw them away, would wear something several times before my mother would even think about washing it, and only received new clothesat Christmas or on birthdays.We had one TV, didn’t even get a landline until I was and I didn’t go abroad until I was  — by boat, not plane.No one went on “a gap yah” and my mum would have killed meI left our tent at Glastonbury, because we used it for holidays in Wales.I could go on, but the younger generation’s collective eye-roll of boredom might cause a damaging tremor.Suffice to say,today’s kids are happy to strip their lives back to reflect the childhood we had, it would be a great step towards helping the planet. But it’s not going to happen.So, instead of the lame, “old people have ruined everything for young people”, mantra, all generations should be working together to not only do their bit at homebut to continue putting pressure on those who govern us and have the power to effect realistic, not idealistic, change for a planet that currently accommodates seven and a half billion people.Then the admirable young Greta can go back to school and get on with having a normal le.THE Duchess of Sussex has learned the hard way that making inclusive speeches and appearing accessible has its pitfalls.In other words, someone might ask you to dance. When everyone’s watching.Shortly after declaring to the people of Nyanga, in South Africa: “I am here with you as . . . a woman of colour and as your sister,” she was grabbed by the hand to take part in a traditional dancing display, an offer she could then hardly refuse.From memory, the inscrutable Queen’s “don’t touch me” demeanour has thus far prevented her from being urged to participate in anything beyond a bit of heavily stage-managed ribbon-cutting, but her more modern-minded children have had their dignity sorely tested by many a tribal dance.Prince Charles’s awkward sword dance in Saudi Arabia springs to mind, and the rictus “please make it stop” grins of William and Kate when shimmying with the locals on the Pacic island of Tuvalu in .But Meghan pulled off her global dance debut with cheery aplomb, rhythmically wiggling her hips in time to the music and deftly moving on before it got too eggy.As Strictly’s Craig might say: “Fab-u-louuuus, dahling.”Consequently, he and we Adele live “mostly on benefits” in a Brighton council house along with their three young children.Thankfully, working hard is in the psyche of the majority, so luckily for him we help pay for his self-indulgent lestyle choice.JAMES Anderson has been dubbed “Britain’s kindest plumber” after fixing the boilers of the elderly for free.James, , above, from Burnley, risked going bankrupt but is now hoping to extend his services across the country after receiving £, in public donations.A truly heart-warming story.But why don’t councils nationwide use cash from their parking fine coffers to employ a “James” to help the needy in their area It would be a far better use of our money than some of the daft initiatives they come up with.AROUND  per cent of us hide treats so they don’t get eaten by our partners or kids.The top ten hiding places include under the bed and in the car.Puh, amateurs.Mine’s the back of the vegetable drawer.A record  people took part and celebrated with a BBQ straight afterwards.DEMI Moores newly released memoir reveals she engaged in threesomes while married to fellow actor Ashton Kutcher.“I wanted to show him how great and fun I could be,” she says.Ah, yes, the perils of an age-gap relationship and the continual struggle to appear “on the same page” as your much younger partner.Ashton was  to Demi’s  when they met in  and, no doubt, his sex drive was at its optimum while hers was perhaps struggling for air under the pressure of bringing up her three children with former husband Bruce Willis.While you fancy a night in with a boxset and some Pinot, he’s wanting to leave the house at pm for a night of clubbing and group sex.No thanks.And don’t even get me started on all the times you’d talk about David Cassidy and they’d reply: “Who ”ACCORDING to SNP MP Joanna Cherry: “The UK Supreme Court has made the ruling necessary to restore democracy and the rule of law.”She adds: “Now politicians must make sure that ruling is respected.”What, in the same way they respected the democratic vote to leave the EU Sigh.

Whether people like it or not, the temporary prime minister has to be Corbyn.And sources said the plot could be moved as early as next week.Earlier this week the partys Westminster leader Ian Blackford suggested the party wouldnt be opposed to putting the leftie Labour boss in No.Asked on Radio s Today programmehe’d back the Labour leader to succeed Mr Johnson after a successful no-confidence vote, he said: Im less concerned about the inidual. I think it is fair to say that, in such a scenario, the official leader of the Opposition is the first point of contact as far as that is concerned.But we are only talking about putting someone in place in order to call an election. On that basis, I wouldnt be opposed to that.He tweeted last night: We are facing someone that will stop at nothing. We need to take the keys of number  from him.However, the two parties would have to get the Liberal Democrats or other MPs on board to help push a vote of no confidence in Boris over the line, and to get enough MPs together to form a temporary coalition.At the moment there is little prospect of Lib Dem boss Jo Swinson agreeing to put Corbyn into No.Some of the  independent MPs may be willing to get them across the line - but most of them are former Tories and unlikely to back them.Only with the help of them are they likely to succeed.Under the plans Mr Corbyn would then seek an extension to Brexit, and then call an election.Last night opposition parties including Labour, the SNP, Lib Dems, Greens and Plaid Cymru met again to discuss how to stop a No Deal Brexit.They agreed that they wouldnt vote for an election unless there was a lock preventing a No Deal.The parties will look at all parliamentary mechanisms they can and would meet again on Monday.An SNP spokesperson said this morning: It is now possible -the political will is there - that parties could come together to ensure that the letter to secure an extension is not left in the hands of Boris Johnson and his cronies, who are determined to find a way to get around the Benn Act, but is instead sent by a temporary caretaker prime minister, who would be in office only as long as is necessary to send the letter, with an election held immediately afterwards.We remain open to all options to achieve the aim of stopping a No Deal Brexit and getting rid of Boris Johnson.A Labour source said this morning: It might have to come out of the box.Its the simplest and most democratic way to stop No Deal. It would be strictly time-limited government to stop no deal.MPs across the ide dont trust that Boris Johnson will obey a new law called the Benn Act which will force the PM to go to Brussels and seek a third Brexit delay - which is why they are considering the extreme plan.Opposition leaders have refused to bring Boris government down because theres no consensus around a unity PM at the moment, and they are concerned about him taking Britain out during an election periodone is automatically called within  days.The PM has insisted he will obey the Benn law and we will still leave on October .But its unclear how he would do thathe didnt get a deal signed off.Last night ex-PM Sir John Major suggested that Boris may use an order of council to delay the implementation of the Benn Act.Sir John said last night: It is important to note that an Order of Council can be passed by Privy Councillors – that is Government Ministers – without involving HM The Queen. I should warn the Prime Minister that –this route is taken – it will be in flagrant defiance of Parliament and utterly disrespectful to the Supreme Court.It would be a piece of political chicanery that no-one should ever forgive or forget.Ministers today refused to comment on whether theyve discussed a new plan to avoid a third Brexit extension.International Development Secretary Alok Sharma told Radio : Im not going to set out discussions that have occurred in the privacy of Cabinet, he told the BBC.We are absolutely going to comply with the law, we are working incredibly hard to get a deal and we will be leaving on October .Last night Tory party chairman James Cleverly was asked about the idea on Question Time, but he refused to comment.I’m not going to discuss how we progress with this, he said.Meanwhile Brexit Secretary Steven Barclay is jetting to Brussels this morning for fresh talks with Michel Barnier.But already hes briefing that the current talks are not producing anything, and that Britain isnt any closer to a deal.He also expressed concern that the current row in the Commons over political language had damaged chances of a deal.Mr Barnier added: Even with two meetings a week the non-papers so far do not make up as serious alternative for the backstop. The current polarization in the UK has further reduced the chances of agreement in the House of Commons.At last nights ambassadors meeting on Brexit member states discussed a cut off date for Brexit proposals to be put forward from the EU.SEVEN out of ten leave voters have NO trust in MPs at all, a shock poll has revealed.Trust among Brits who opted for Brexit has dramatically dropped from  per cent back in , the Deltapoll survey for the Centre for Policy Studies showed. per cent of Brits did not have faith in MPs at all.Only  per cent did, it showed.The damning results show the impact of failing to deliver Brexit on trust in British politics.Boris Johnson has warned that never again will the public back the Conservatives - or other politicians -they dont follow through with their promise and come out of the EU on October ."},{"url":null,"title":"ally ross eastenders right on agenda","story":"First the BBC soap posted its lowest ever ratings, .million viewers for an episode back in June, and now respected BBC commentator Mark Lawson has pointed out the show, along with Coronation Street and Emmerdale, has become outlandish and ­unsustainable on account of the ludicrous number of rape victims and murderers.And that’s before you even start trying to calculate the number of Walford characters who’ve been abducted.Personally, though, I don’t ­remember a time when EastEnders was anything other than the most deranged show on television.I would’ve thought more obvious signs it had lost the plot would be Ben Mitchell’s six ­dferent heads, Phil Mitchell’s ­people smuggling operation with Barry Grant off Brookside and the surprisingly high number of ­characters who revealed they were gay in time for the opening of the show’s new LGBT bar.Which has to be the happiest ­EastEnders coincidence since The Queen Vic organised a “European night,” not long after the Brexit vote.It’s good to have your prejudices ­questioned, though, so I watched with added care last week to seeI’d been missing a trick, as the Square came to terms with the bloody aftermath of the pub siege.Hunter’s still dead, thankfully, but Keanu’s made a remarkable recovery from being shot at point blank range and Bex is up for something called a “Pride of Walford award.” The real focus of the drama, however, was Bobby Beale, who’s freshly released from prison and so traumatised he’s prone to taking drugs and wandering off into train tunnels.As would youyou’d killed your sister and undergone four head transplants.The cure for all this ­torment is classic EastEnders and actually a bit easier to believe than the idea Ian Beale’s new lodger is Rainie, the ­prostitute he had sex with the night daughter Lucy was killed.Bobby’s embraced Islam.He says: “It helps me see the good in people.”The show says it is “to counter negative representations of Islam.”No word on why these representations might be negative, of course, just as EastEnders never had any dramatic response or even a mention of ­Islamist terror attacks in London or three East End schoolgirls running away to join IS.Bobby’s story exists in a soap vacuum.It’s a no-context approach that treats the viewers as dangerous idiots, of course, but wouldn’t grate quite so much­EastEnders had a blanket approach to all religions.It doesn’t, though. Only a ­couple of weeks ago some Christian “End is nigh” nutter was roaming the market and the show had no qualms about introducing Rev Lucas Johnson, who was driven to kill by his Christianity.This slanted agenda defines EastEnders as much as all its murders, rapes and abductions.The only thing that’s changed here, since the dawn of time , is the amount of ­scrutiny and competition it gets, which, given that ratings have recovered, means the misery will probably continue indefinitely.Still, on the positive side, Adam Woodyatt’s tenderloin of Iberico pork, with parsnip three ways, has seen him through to the next round of Celebrity MasterChef.#PrideOfWalford.Sent in by the brilliant Reenie E.Picture research: Marta Ovod.STRICTLY Come Dancing came out of the traps like Johnny Vegas on the opening leg of a x metres relay on Saturday.Two weeks they’ve been rehearsing and viewers still aren’t trusted enough to vote.Instead, the contestants laid out their nervous credentials over  testing minutes.“Eighteen years in the Premiership and I’ve never been as nervous as . . . ”We know, we know.There was an awful lot of “great energy” flannel from the judges as well, including Craig Revel Horwood, who needs to ignore any “be more positive” instructions.This ’s already compromised enough by the fact Motsi Mabuse’s sister Oti has – by accident rather than design – ended up with Kelvin Fletcher, who’s one of the favourites.Mercully, there are two dancers no amount of “great energy” can save. One is James Cracknell, whose tango had more than a touch of the Boris Karloffs about it.The other is BBC reporter Mike Bushell, who did a sailor’s hornpipe to The Contours with double nork-grab to finish, accompanied by the insatiable Katya Jones, who sounds like she still won’t take no for an answer.“Even when I was in bed, next to my we,” complained Mike, “Katya’s saying, ‘Give me five, give me five, give me five’.”Mike. Don’t even think about it.Mark: “March.”Ben Shephard: “Hock and pork shoulder are cuts of meat from which animal ”Mark: “Lamb.”Tipping Point: Lucky Stars, Ben Shephard: “Which British band recorded their track Bloom with composer Hans Zimmer for the TV series Blue Planet II ”Danny O’Carroll: “Slade.”And Ben Shephard: “Which British Prime Minister’s surname is an anagram of ‘re-thatch’ ”Jason: “Churchill.”THE potential of Channel ’s Treasure Island With Bear Grylls has been clear from the moment the contestants introduced themselves to each other, day one.“My name’s Mano, I’m  years old and I’m a doctor.”Wild applause.“I’m Marco, I’m  and I’ve been in the Royal Marines for the last six years.”Whooping and cheering.“And my name’s Ben, I’m  and I’m a double-glazing salesman . . . ”Silence.Channel  can choose contestants as well as it likes.Of course, the magic new ingredient here is £,, which is being dropped in separate boxes all over the Pacic island and has immediately opened up all sorts of camp isions, including political.Chief protagonists are energetic capitalist Lord I Mountbatten who, with Marco’s help, has already hunted down and hidden £,, and champagne socialist Morag, who prefers to sit around moaning but has scrounged £, off other contestants.It gives the series real edge, forces viewers to pick sides and has been a welcome ersion from attention-craving Elissa, who’s been trying to make hungry islanders give a toss about the identity of the man whose sexual advances she once turned down.“He’s world-famous.”“Boris Johnson ” “No.”“Donald Trump ” “No.”“Leonardo diCaprio ”“No. Higher paid.”Got it.Gary Lineker Sue: “The jury’s out on that one.”Oh.

She was found to have breached strict rules on the show in  July, by saying Donald Trump’s tweet that four US politicians should “go back” to where they came from was “embedded in racism”. Stars have lined up to voice their anger at the ruling by the BBC’s Editorial Complaints Unit. Channel  News anchor Krishnan Guru-Murthy said: “You should not be able to tell whether or not journalists think terrorism or genocide or racism or paedophilia or climate change are good or bad things.” Many called on the Beeb to acknowledge there can be no expectation of “impartiality” on racism and strongly condemned the finding.    Separately, BBC correspondent Carrie Gracie tweeted that the ruling caused unease among journalists “for whom ‘go back’  racist”. Fellow correspondent San­­gita Myska said: “Right now, there is a lot of bewilderment among BAME staff.” But the BBC tried to dampen support. ,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:\" One production executive in digital current affairs told staff: “People should not be tweeting anything that can be construed as an opinion... on the findings of the ECU and Naga.” "},{"url":null,"title":"boris advisor dominic cummings brags","story":"NewsBoris Johnson aide Dominic Cummings brags were enjoying this despite MPs furyBoris Johnsons top aide said MPs shouldnt be surprised they receive abuse - and boasted No was a walk in the park despite losing all seven Commons votesShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political EditorSam BlewettBenjamin Cooper:,  SEP Updated:,  SEP Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video brexit-negotiations-walk-park-claims-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news politics boris-advisor-dominic-cummings-brags-\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Dominic Cummings also boasted No le was a walk in the park last night - despite having lost all seven votes in the Commons since Mr Johnson took power. His arrogant display, during a rare public appearance at a book launch, risks increasing tensions even further in Westminster. Speaker John Bercow warned of the most toxic atmosphere in  years after Boris Johnson portrayed the Brexit debate as Parliament versus the people - despite a growing threat from the far-right. The PM said MPs should back Brexit to honour the memory of murdered Remain campaigner Jo Cox. And he dismissed a plea to moderate his language from Labour MP Paula Sherrf, who has received regular death threats, as humbug. As fury mounted today, Church of England bishops issued a joint statement slamming the ision and abuse and saying: In the last few days, the use of language, both in debates and outside Parliament, has been unacceptable. Yet last night a senior Cabinet minister stoked tensions further by telling the Times the country risks a violent, popular uprisingRemain prevails in a second referendum. And asked about the abuse last night Mr Cummings said: It is not surprising that some people are angry.     Cummings said both Leave and Remain campaigners had had serious threats of violence made against them, which should be dealt with appropriately. In the end the situation can only be resolved by Parliament honouring its promise to respect the result, he added. He also described the current chaos as a walk in the park compared to the  EU referendum - despite his boss losing seven straight votes in Parliament since becoming PM. We are enjoying this, he said, with a smirk. We are going to leave and we are going to win. He added: The MPs said we will have a referendum, we will respect the result and then they spent three years swerving all over the shop.  It is not surprising some people are angry about it. I find it very odd that these characters are complaining that people are unhappy about their behaviour now and they also say they want a referendum. If you are a bunch of politicians and say that we swear we are going to respect the result of a democratic vote, and then after you lose you say, we donapost want to respect that vote, what do you expect to happen  The comments come after the Prime Minister stoked tensions during fiery exchanges in the Commons on Wednesday, where he repeatedly described attempts to block no-deal as the surrender act. Earlier in the day, when approached by Labour MP Karl Turner in Portcullis House to be told Johnsonaposs recent remarks had led to death threats being levelled at parliamentarians, Cummings simply replied: Back a deal, then. Britain will face civil unrest on the scale of the Gilets Jaunes protests in France or the riots in Los AngelesBrexit is frustrated, an unnamed senior Cabinet minister has told the Times in comments which will do little to calm the situation. A No spokesman later said: I really donapost recognise those comments at all. What the PM is doing is making sure we deliver Brexit on October , to take advantage of all the opportunities which it provides and being able to focus on the countryaposs domestic priorities.     Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn warned that the PMaposs language was encouraging people to behave in a disgraceful and abusive way. And Labour MP Jess Phillips confronted him in the Commons voting lobbies yesterday, asking how he felt about his name being mentioned in a death threat against her this week. Ms Phillips - whose constituency office was approached by a man later arrested yesterday - told the Mirror: “I asked how he felt about about being quoted in a death threat to me. He exhaled in that way he does and had nothing to say.” But Cabinet minister Alok Sharma today claimed there has been an elevation of the temperature on all sides. He said people being intimidated was wrong and the fear felt by people like Yvette Cooperaposs daughter, who spoke out yesterday, was deplorable. Yet Mr Sharma claimed people should not conflate Mr Johnsonaposs language with threats against MPs.  Caustic remarks have been hallmarks of Johnsonaposs senior adviser, long before he started working at Number . Born in Durham and educated at Oxford University, he rose to notoriety in politics first as an adviser to Michael Gove and then as campaign director at the official Brexit group. Many will know him as the character played by Benedict Cumberbatch in the HBO Channel  comedy-drama film Brexit, and for as his role in covering a red bus with the £ million NHS claim.    That, or the Parliamentary contempt finding in March for failing to appear before MPs investigating so-called fake news. Cummings has been credited with creating the take back control slogan and criticised over the monetary figure advertised on the side of the bus which travelled the country. He would later say the pledge was necessary to win.

The former Prime Minister last night claimed the Prime Minister could use an aposOrder in Councilapos from the Queen to override a law thataposs designed to stop no-deal happening on October . Remainer Sir John declared: If this route is taken it will be in flagrant defiance of Parliament and utterly disrespectful to the Supreme Court. It would be a piece of political chicanery that no-one should ever forgive or forget. After senior Tories initially refused to rule out the move, government sources later attempted to dampen Sir Johnaposs claims. A senior government source described Sir Johnaposs theory as total cobblers and a No source said it was “the kind of thing that usually has its place in university debating halls”. “It’s just one example of how some parliamentarians donapost understand how legislation works, the No source added.    MPs passed a law that will force the PM to request a three-month Brexit delaythereaposs no agreement by October . But asked this weekhe would seek that delay, Boris Johnson said bluntly: No. Yet Mr Johnson has also claimed he will abide by the law. Now Sir John Major believes he knows the answer. Last night he said he fears the government will bypass the law using an Order of the Privy Council, made by the Queen on the advice of senior government advisors - and usually used for minor issues. Government sources insist Boris Johnson will not attempt the wheeze. Boris Johnsonaposs official spokesman today said: “I don’t recognise that at all”. Immediately after Sir John made his claim, when questioned on it in public, senior Tories did not deny it was possible.    Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly, who sits in the Cabinet, did not rule out the move last night. Mr Cleverly told the BBCaposs Question Time: I’m not going to discuss how we’re going to progress with this. I’ll tell you why, because what we have seen in parliament is people bending conventions, stepping outside standing orders, making up new procedures on the hoof in order to prevent Brexit being delivered, in the face of the largest electoral event in our country’s history.

I think itaposs absolutely reasonable... it would take away the power of this government, and the power of this country, to decide how long it would remain in the EU and give that power to the EU and thataposs really quite an extraordinary thing, Boris Johnson told the BBC yestersday. And heaposs right. Because itaposs quite an extraordinary load of bollocks. The law of which he speaks, the European Union Act , does not deliver a single power to the European Union. It merely takes away the power to decide on Brexit from the government - which has a majority of - in any case and couldnapost govern a knackered tap - and gives it to Parliament. In March , Boris Johnson said: You cannot express the sovereignty of Parliament and accept the  European Communities Act.Except, we are. And we have. And can carry on doing do, for as long as we please.  The act even ensures that power cannot be nicked by the House of Lords. It expressly states that only the Commons needs to vote to pass a motion either to accept a deal, or to ask the EU for an extension.  The Lords can talk about it til theyaposre blue in the face, but only our democratically-elected representatives can decide what happens next.It is only a surrenderJohnson knows Parliament will not vote for whatever deal he places before it. And the only way he can know that ishe knows there will be no fresh deal.And the only way he can know THAT iseverything he told Conservative Party members during the leadership race, everything he told world leaders at summits, and everything he has said to the public since, is a STONE. COLD. LIE .   The act does not take away the power of government to negotiate the better deal he insisted was possible when he resigned from Theresa Mayaposs government. It does not take away the power of aposthis countryapos to decide how long we stay in the EU, or give a single power to the EU. It just says itaposs up to the Commons. The Commons which has run this country for almost  years, and which negotiated with, threatened and bullied the monarchs running the country before that. The Commons which aposthis countryapos voted for a year after the referendum, and which therefore has a greater democratic mandate.The Commons has spent  years respecting that poll by trying to deliver a form of Brexit that would not kill people. This, its fans must agree, is the preferred form of Brexit.The Commons has failed to make up its mind, and in that it is doing a splendid job of reflecting the views of the people who voted for it. There are no apostraitorsapos in Parliament, any more than there are apostraitorsapos in your family, pub, or place of work. There are just people, arguing about the best way of not smashing things to pieces.    He might legitimately call it a surrender actit revoked Article , but that would be surrendering only to logic. It would mean the UK ceased resisting the bleedinapos obvious, and submitted to the authority of geography, the Act of Union , and the basic moral tenet observed by every religion, atheist, and sweet fluffy bunny wabbit worldwide which is aposthou shalt not killapos.What this law represents,it is enacted, will be Johnsonaposs failure to deliver the Brexit he promised when he took office. It is the failure of a Prime Minister to wield willy-nilly the Royal Prerogative, because the Commons has had control of that ever since it lopped off the head of the current monarchaposs great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great uncle in . The fact Johnson cannot use it without the consent of Parliament was codied in the Bill of Rights  years later, and reiterated by the Supreme Court last week.But it also demonstrates the failure of politicians and journalists to discuss properly the promises we were all made. Because this is not Johnsonaposs only failure. He has also failed to deliver the Brexit he promised in the referendum, when the Vote Leave campaign he led pledged a -year negotiation by experts from business, law and civil society a free trade agreement before triggering Article  and sunlit uplands which, it now appears, are the result of grouse-shooting arsonists up on the moors.When he was in government, he could have worked towards all that. When he became PM, he could have torn up Theresa Mayaposs approach and gone back to the democratic mandate he received. But he did not. He promised to take back control. All he has done is lost it.    The fact you are not told this explicitly is the fault of two groups of people. First, his opponents, who are disorganised and so politically disparate that they are coalescing against him only by accident, and therefore have no clear message with which to counter his. If they said aposfailureapos as often as he says apossurrenderapos, we might be within shouting distance of reality.And secondly, the journalists, who have allowed him to repeat his taglines without hauling him up during his all-too-rare interviews to say: Hang on, surrender to who  Surrendering what  Explain yourself. The news cycle moves too fast to allow for much analysis, but there is no reason for fact-checking the fundamentals to have gone down the drain in quite the same way as everything .Yesterday, Johnson used the word apossurrenderapos twice times in one sentence to claim the act was a thing that itaposs not. International Aid Secretary Alok Sharma said it three times in  seconds the DUPaposs Sammy Wilson talked about surrender and aposfth columnistsapos and in Parliament on Wednesday, Johnson said it  times in  separate answers to questions. If you say it often enough, it trickles down even to those who arenapost watching. And his opponents would do well to note that, in that same Commons debate, they said it almost as often as him.    Thataposs why voters who do not read newspapers or watch the evening news feel betrayed, and call it humiliation, and say the Remoaners want to surrender. Itaposs because those words have been used so often, in places that echo, by those with the loudest voices, that it reverberates.Butitaposs not a surrender -heaposs not working for a deal -the person who sold us Brexit is not working to give us the version of it he sold, version . or even version . - then what, exactly, IS he doing The thing to remember with Johnson is that he cannot stop lying, but he also cannot help telling the truth. One is always buried inside the other. In February  he announced he would back the Leave campaign, saying: I want a better deal for the people of this country, to save them money and to take control. That is really what all this is about.Campaigning for Brexit made him the darling of the Tory membership. Taking a moral stand on the wrong sort of Brexit got him the Tory leadership. Now he has taken control which is all he ever wanted, and heaposs spaffed it up the wall.  He is tasked with delivering something that cannot be done, has pledged to do it in a way that can only harm us and him, and the Commons has removed his ability to wriggle out of it. The previous administration made aposgargantuan effortsapos to move the Downing Street drinks cabinet  inches further away from Berlin, every negotiating gain was offset by a car bomb in Derry, and Speckled Jim copped it in the No Deal stockpiling. Everyoneaposs a spy. General Melchett has retired quietly behind the lines to play with his hedge fund, Steve aposDarlingapos Baker no longer has any idea whose side heaposs on or what heaposs fighting for, and Baroness Angela von Richotofen is quite content to let the Brits torture themselves.Johnson has no escape. He and his supporters rage like bankers presented with a rush-hour train cancellation. They howl words that hook the minds of people a long way from the front, who call others cowards and want to hang everyone who changes their minds about the wisdom of all this.Anger is a temporary form of insanity. When he says apossurrenderapos he might as well be saying aposwibbleapos. It makes as much sense. Being mad is all thataposs Johnsonaposs got left. But whoaposd notice another madman, around here If he is lucky, the Commons will save him from his own stupid ideas, at the expense of whatever is left of his reputation. But soon he will realise that surrendering to Parliament is the only way he can survive.

Jo was ­genuinely one of the nicest people you could possibly meet.” A day later, the MP Paula Sherrf was forced to point to Jo’s plaque – “the shield of our departed friend” – in the House of Commons as she pleaded for the Prime Minister to think about his language. Women MPs like her, she said, were getting daily death threats due to his rhetoric of surrender and betrayal.    The Prime Minister called this “humbug”. He even said that the way to best remember Jo, a passionate Remainer killed seven days before the referendum, was to “get Brexit done”.Hearing those words, I could only think of how a pro-Brexit plane flew over Jo’s memorial at TrafalgarSquare, drowning out speeches of love and hope.I could only think of how when Jo died, Arron Banks, who bankrolled the Leave campaign, called on colleagues to “press it harder”. But I also tried to think what Jo would do, as her widower Brendan Cox has said so eloquently. Jess Phillips MP also stepped back from the response the behaviour was intended to provoke. “Calling me names, putting words in my mouth and in the mouth of my dead friend makes me cross and angry,” she told ­Parliament.“It makes me scared even, but I will not react. The Prime Minister wants me to react, so I join in the chaosthat keeps this hatred and fear on our streets.”Jo’s family have always been clear that the best way to remember her is to help Jo’s incredible love and compassion live on in the world.    Last week, the Jo Cox Foundation ­celebrated its third year – a year with a Great Get Together that saw , people take part in , events nationwide. Britain Talks is the Daily Mirror and ’s response to bridging the political ide. And while we’ve been working on it, we’ve found dozens of amazing projects trying to do the same. Not responding in anger to Wednesday’s dark and dangerous events doesn’t mean being blind to them. As Phillips says, language invoking the Second World War, treachery and betrayal “has clearly been tested, and workshopped and worked up and entirely designed to inflame hatred and ision”. Yesterday Dominic Cummings told Labour MP Karl Turner, who confronted him about death threats including his own, to “vote for a deal then”. Asusing threats made by others was a way to get what he wants. And asBrexit is the cause and not a symptom of culture wars our country and others are facing. And, of course, by yesterday the official Tommy Robinson channel was using #GetBrexitDone as a hashtag. “Boris for the people vs all the traitors in Parliament,” it blasted, raging against “corrupt elite scumbags”.    Don’t tell me mainstream ­politicians don’t understand that they inflame extremists’ rhetoric. Three years after the referendum, we are more not less polarised. We live in a country where the Liberal Democrats want to revoke a ­democratic vote, where the Prime Minister shouts about surrender, and where some Labour MPs’ social media timelines are a cesspit of abuse from people allegedly on their own side. A Britain where, as Kim says, the Prime Minister “came up here the other week and  minutes from where Jo got killed, talked about being dead in a ditch”. As the people behind The Conversation Project say: “We’ve got a big problem, we human beings. Bigger than plastic in the oceans and toxins in the air, bigger even than climate change. It’s how we talk and listen to each other.” You might think the climate­ breakdown or Brexit are bigger than this challenge. But the point is that these issues are too big to be solved without collaboration. After three years, we have waited for our politics to change. That has ­not happened.  We now face the most polarising election in modern times, perhaps even followed by a terryingly isive further referendum. But we are not powerless. We must demand MPs sign up to a code of ­practice on language and behaviour before the election.We can make a donation, however small, to the Jo Cox Foundation to build the positive legacy Jo’s family and friends are fighting so hard for.We can support initiatives like Compassion in Politics, HOPE not Hate, and write to good decent MPs and thank them for representing us.

Sir Desmond Swayne was condemned by Labour over the astonishing brag after Canadaaposs Prime Minister was exposed using dark make-up at least twice at fancy dress parties in his youth. Justin Trudeau apologised and admitted white privilege had blinded him to the fact wearing blackface was racist. Yet former International Development minister Sir Desmond has now defended the practice an entirely acceptable bit of fun. The -year-old MP for New Forest West, handed a knighthood by David Cameron in , said he blacked up as Godfather of Soul James Brown at a Blues Brothers party and had no intention of apologising. He added the only reason he would not put on blackface again is because you have to go to some trouble to get it off. Sir Desmond bizarrely made the confession in a blog post on his personal website despite no one asking himheaposd ever blacked up or what he thought about the row.     Sir Desmond did not say when he attended the Blues Brothers party or what the context was. Labouraposs Shadow Women and Equalities Secretary Dawn Butler said: This is another example of a politician not even trying to understand the history of oppression and racism. Desmond Swayne has not only admitted to blacking up himself, but is now actively encouraging others to do so.The Tories need to explain what action will be taken against him and whether this took place while he was a government minister. This is a Party that failed to reprimand an MP who used the N-word, implemented the hostile environment policy that has led to black people being wrongfully deported, and is run by Boris Johnson whose racist words incited a  per cent increase in racist hate crime. The MP wrote: I suspect that Justin Trudeauaposs cringing apology for blacking himself aposblinded by his own white privilegeapos has done him rather more harm than the original offence. It was a themed aposArabian Nightsapos fancy-dress party for heavenaposs sake! It comes to something when you canapost dress-up as Aladdin without attracting the opprobrium of the aposgreat and goodapos.  He would have done better to have said it was an entirely acceptable bit of fun and refused to apologise. I once went to a aposBlues Brothersapos themed fancy-dress party as James Brown. I went to some trouble to be as authentic as possible. I can assure readers of this column that I have no intention of apologising. Constituents often write to me having been infuriated by some latest absurdity of political correctness. I tell them that the best response is simply to laugh at it. Singer Brown starred in the hit s film Blues Brothers, playing Cleophus James, a reverend of the Triple Rock Baptist Church. Sir Desmond, a former economics teacher and Major in the British Army who joined Parliament in , refused to back down when questioned by his local newspaper the Bournemouth Echo. Askedhe could see the issue with the practice, he said: No one has complained to me about it. The reason I wouldnapost do it again is because you have to go to some trouble to get it off. Itaposs not a non-trivial exercise.  In his online rant Sir Desmond also attacked an academic conference at Roehampton University at which delegates wore badges letting others know whether they were happy to talk to each other. He said: Hereaposs one to amuse. Last week, academics attended a conference at Roehampton University. [It was] entitled Thinking beyond Transversal Transfeminisms and [they wore] badges informing each otherthey were happy to chat, or prefer not to be spoken to at all.

Paul Cartwright plunged from his hotel room in Malta where he was celebrating his th birthday with his girlfriend. The father-of-two suffered  broken bones in the fall and says the last thing he remembers was smoking a cigarette on the balcony before plummeting onto the concrete below. His fall also left him with a fractured neck, a smashed pelvis, a broken femur and foot as well as internal bleeding and cracked ribs. Paul, a DJ on London-based radio station MuusicFM, said his girlfriend Danielle Hickey found him after getting up in the middle of the night. He spent two-and-a-half weeks in an induced coma after his fall on Thursday August .    Paul was finally airlted from Malta back to to Biggin Hill airport last Saturday, racking up an air ambulance bill of more than £, on the way. Speaking from his bed at Kings College Hospital, London, Paul said his ambition is to learn how to walk again unaided - and he has started a fundraiser to help with rehabilitation costs. He said: I was having a good read and thataposs all I can remember. I was out on holiday with the love of my le and bosh - it could happen to anybody. Iaposm lucky to be alive. Paul believes his history of sleepwalking caused the freak accident.    The dad of twin girls, who turned  on the day he landed back in the UK, said he was not drunk and would not self-harm. He said: I love my girls. Iaposm happy - Iaposm alive to be a dad to my beautul daughters. They have been my guiding light through this. I told myself I am not going to die like this and they kept coming into my mindset. Bur he has not lost his sense of humour, despite his injuries and having part of his bowel removed.

The event - called The Hop - has been going for  years and is held for the countryaposs future doctors, nurses and other medical professional students the week after Fresheraposs Week. There is no theme to the fancy dress, prompting a huge array of weird and wonderful outfits from the first year students. In previous years people have dressed as anything from an electricity pylon to a North Korean ballistic missile. This year saw some hilarious creations including a lady dressed as a Durex box, completing her outfit with a pair of condom earrings and slicked back hair.    A group of girls also dressed as the classic character from Eric Carleaposs childrenaposs picture book the Hungry Caterpillar. Another group of girls dressed as a four-pack of Corona while a group went as a Meal Deal - complete with a packet of Doritos and Tropicana drink. The students started out at a packed out Players nightclub at .pm and then went on to The Walkabout a short distance away and partied until the early hours.  The revellers were in high spirits as they flaunted their creations which took some of them hours to make. Among other creations were a group of brides, Queens Guards, a man dressed as a baby and a group of men dressed as beekepers. A man also dressed as Mr Bump, a group of girls went as ducklings, a group dressed as heavy metal band Kiss and three girls all went as Britney Spears throughout the years.  The students enjoyed the night without a hitch, knowing their limits and not putting pressure on AE departments unlike other recent fresher events.

Kate Beveridge, , claimed she was too drunk to remember launching the missiles at police during the rally on Trafalgar Square and Whitehall on June , . The school cook appeared in the dock at Southwark Crown Court along with four other defendants. She pleaded guilty to violent disorder after being caught on camera pelting officers with the improvised missiles as police desperately tried to control the baying far-right crowd. Prosecutor Aska Fujita said: This is a case which relates to the th of June last year. A demonstration in support of Mr Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson, had been planned. This was due to his being imprisoned for contempt of court. Ms Fujita told how police were aposoverrun by the demonstratorsapos as drunken thugs began to kick and spit at officers.  She continued: The police have been consistently abused, had missiles thrown at them, they have been punched, kicked and had barriers thrown at them. Each of the defendants were involved in serious acts of violence, including using weapons. A number of defendantaposs have accepted being intoxicated, which is, of course, an aggravating feature. Turning to mother-of-two Ms Beveridge, the prosecutor said: Cans and bottles thrown at signicant distance with force can also cause serious injury. She said she had no memory of throwing the bottle but apologised for her actions.  Defence counsel Sheryl Nwosu said: She is a mother of two young children, a son aged two and a daughter aged fourteen. She is in part time work as a cook at a primary school or a nursery. She expresses not only sorrows but indeed embarrassment and shame. The barrister described Beveridgeaposs actions as being driven by aposintoxicated impulsivityapos, adding: Intoxication does not provide an excuse. The court heard that the primary school worker turned herself into the police when a video of her violent actions emerged. Judge Deborah Taylor told her: You intended to use or threaten violence. There was drunkenness and confrontation with the police.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A British aviation expert says missing MH was taken out of the sky by a highly qualied person who had advanced flight skills.Independent experts believe that the Malaysia Airlines plane was taken off course and deliberately crashed into the remote sea by its captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah. One recent report claimed the captain was depressed and had locked his co-pilot out of the cockpit before taking the plane on a suicide mission that killed all  people on board. David Learmount, a British pilot and aviation commentator, said only a person with a lot of training and an intimate knowledge of that type of plane could seize control of the aircraft.    Mr Learmount, consulting editor at FlightGlobal, told the recent Channel  documentary called aposFlight MHapos: “It was a highly qualied human being, well-trained in the workings of the  who did this.” The person behind the controls when the plane was turned around would have known about dead zones in air traffic control, he added. The plane is believed to have crashed in the southern Indian Ocean after it was taken off course during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in March . The plane flew for hours before it ended up in the sea.    Pieces of the plane have washed up on shorelines but none of the remains of the passengers or crew have ever been found. There have been plenty of far-fetched conspiracy theories in the years since the plane vanished. But an international group of experts who have studied all the available evidence and data have concluded that the only plausible theory is that the captain seized control of the aircraft and was responsible for downing it where it could not be found. The official report by Malaysiaaposs government did not come to that conclusion. It has been branded a cover-up.  The independent experts disagreed over whether Shah was still alive when the plane crashed into the sea and disintegrated. In June, a lelong friend claimed the captain likely locked his co-pilot out of the cockpit and deliberately crashed the passenger jet into the sea. The friend, a fellow Boeing  pilot, said he believes Shah is guilty of an atrocity and it’s the necessary conclusion to one of the worldaposs greatest aviation mysteries.In the years since the Malaysia Airlines plane vanished, the leading theory is Shah, , deliberately took the plane off course on a carefully planned murder-suicide mission. Data analysis indicates the Boeing -ER flew over the Indian Ocean until it ran out of fuel and violently slammed into the water with  people on board. There is a suspicion that Shah - who flew a similar path on his flight simulator at home - was clinically depressed. It is suspected the planeaposs passenger cabin was deliberately depressurised by Shah to kill everyone on board hours before the crash. Before doing so, he could have put on an oxygen mask in the cockpit so he could continue to fly the aircraft for hours. At around the same time the cabin was depressurised the electrical system was deliberately turned off, making the plane impossible to track by satellite.  An FBI inspection of Shahaposs Microsoft flight simulator at home showed he had tested a flight roughly matching the path of MH, ending in the Indian Ocean after running out of fuel. His voice was heard in the final radio communication less than two minutes before the plane began to ert from its flight path from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March , .One of his lelong friends told the Atlantic that he had reluctantly come to the conclusion that Shah deliberately crashed the plane, given the evidence amassed by independent investigators.The friend, who wasnapost named, said: “It’s hard to reconcile with the man I knew. But it’s the necessary conclusion.” The friend said Shah likely tricked his inexperienced -year-old co-pilot, Fariq Hamid, who was on his final training flight, into leaving the cockpit and locked him out.

The Anti-Defamation League , a Jewish non-governmental organisation based in New York City, has also added the bowlcut hairstyle worn by American white supremacist and mass murderer Dylann Roof to its list, among a number of other new symbols, memes and slogans. In a statement, the CEO of ADL, Jonathan Greenblatt, said: “Even as extremists continue to use symbols that may be years or decades old, they regularly create new symbols, memes and slogans to express their hateful sentiments. “We believe law enforcement and the public needs to be fully informed about the meaning of these images, which can serve as a first warning sign to the presence of haters in a community or school.” In total there are  new entries to the online resource of hate symbols.    In a statement, an ADL spokesman said a number of the new entries include white supremacist symbols adopted in recent years by the alt right segment of the white supremacist movement. The ADL highlights that they have added the aposMoon Manapos, the aposHappy Merchantapos and logos for a number of new white supremacist groups to their database. Scroll down for explanations of some of the symbols which have been added to the database. The ADL says their online database provides explanations for many of the symbols, memes and slogans most frequently used by a iety of white supremacist and other hate groups.    Mark Pitcavage, of ADL’s Center on Extremism, said: “These are the latest calling cards of hate. “While some hate symbols are short-lived, others take on a le of their own and become tools for online trolling. We pay special attention to those symbols that exhibit staying power as well as those that move from online usage into the real world.”  Such symbols, the organisation says, have appeared at white supremacist events such as the aposUnite the Rightapos rally in Charlottesville and were painted on the guns allegedly used by the suspect in the Christchurch mosque shootings in New Zealand, Brenton Tarrant. The ADL spokesman added: These slogans and symbols also frequently appear online in venues such as chan, chan and Reddit.Some have also spread into other more popular mainstream s such as Twitter and Facebook , or gaming s.A July  ADL survey found that nearly one-quarterof all online gamers have been exposed to white supremacist ideology while gaming. Some of the slogans, such as the phrase, aposIt’s Okay to be White,apos have recently appeared in white supremacist fliering campaigns both on and off campus. During the - academic year, ADL documented  cases of white supremacist propaganda on campus, a  percent increase from the prior year. ADL explains some of the newly added symbols, slogans and memesThe aposOKapos hand symbol – Begun as a hoax by members of the website chan, the OK symbol became a popular trolling tactic. By , the symbol was being used in some circles as a sincere expression of white supremacy. Australian Brenton Tarrant flashed the symbol during his March  courtroom appearance soon after his arrest for allegedly murdering  people in mosques in Christchurch.The aposMoon Manapos is an Internet meme originally popularized on the now-defunct Internet forum You’re the Man Now Dog. The forum appropriated the s McDonald’s restaurant chain mascot aposMac Tonight,apos which featured a smiling crescent moon image wearing sunglasses. In the s, internet users began to create GIFs and videos of Mac Tonight, which they called aposMoon Man,apos typically coupled with violent or racist rap songs using computer-generated voices. By , the Moon Man meme spread to other forums such as chan and chan, where it became associated with alt right language and imagery, including explicit white supremacist imagery. For a time, hundreds of offensive aposMoon Manapos songs existed online.

Police burst into the compound and rescued  people after one follower of the Zhonghua Rixing Yishang - China Daily Virtue - was allegedly killed in a sick ritual. Cult leader Lin Hsin-yue, , was among five people arrested at the remote mountain monastery in Nantou, Taiwan, which had been sealed shut by a large red metal gate and surrounded by chain-linked fences. The cult has around  members - ranging from two to  - across either side of the Taiwan Strait.    Taiwan’s Criminal Investigation Bureausaid followers were not allowed mobile phones and were beaten for speaking out of turn and attempting to run away. Investigators with the CID’s th investigative unit seized cult propaganda, ious rods, plastic and wooden sticks, as well as metal pipes wrapped in cloth used to beat followers in exorcisms or so-called ‘soul purying’ ceremonies. The unit’s lead investigator, Lai Ying-men, said the beatings were carried out or authorised by the ring leader herself, who was referred to as the ‘Holy Mother’ or ‘Living Buddha’.    The raid on the compound came during a months-long investigation into the group - established by Lin in  as a fusion of Eastern and Westerns religious teachings. Authorities became involved in March after family members of -year-old follower Ms Fang, from Taiwan’s western city of Taichung, reported that she had been beaten to death during a visit to mainland China with the matriarch. Lin allegedly ordered Ms Fang to be flogged during a purication ceremony in Nanning, capital of China’s southern Guangxi region, where she had hoped to open a new compound.  She then fled back to Taiwan to avoid arrest by local authorities, the CIB, which is the bureau under the National Police Agency, said on September . According to reports, the religious cult’s alleged purpose is to inspire good virtues and promote physical and spiritual health, but those who joined found themselves unable to leave, often suffering violent and brutal beatings when they attempted to escape. All  followers rescued from the compound had been beaten for the purposes of exorcism, or for failing to follow the cult’s rules.

That’s just football – the goalscorers get the headlines.“Shanks is big enough and ugly enough to deal with the pressure that comes with starting the season so well. He has looked asit has not fazed him.“As a coaching staff, you do want goals to be spread around the team and that will mean centre-halves having to convert set-plays, midfielders to chip in and wingers to be nipping in at the back post to score.“In an ideal world you would like that and we had that in the Dundee derby. That was the perfect scenario so, hopefully, we can get back to that.“I don’t think, however, that we can take anything away from Lawrence and play down how good he has been considering every new singing is a gamble.“He has been perfect for us so far.”Former Rangers, Wigan and Motherwell forward Lee also heaped praise on young striker Louis Appere for his performances to date.And the former Killie gaffer believes the -year-old is already a better player than he was at that age.“I think he is a wee bit better than me, to be honest,” Lee added. “I would say that, especially at the age he is at.“I am a big fan of Louis. He has the pace, ability and the stature.“I can only see him kicking on because he has a fantastic attitude.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/5d88933ceb4769.54724060-e1569239377405.jpg ","title":"moment of madness cost dundee against morton says gaffer mcpake","story":"Dundee manager James McPake was today lamenting a “moment of madness” which cost them in Saturday’s - defeat at Morton.Peter Grant’s headed goal on the stroke of half-time won the points in the end at Cappielow.And boss James was left frustrated after Cammy Kerr gave away the free-kick which led to the goal and failed to pick up Ton centre-half Grant in the box.“I thought, for the first  minutes of the game, we defended exceptionally well,” he said.“We knew, especially with John Sutton playing, what was going to happen and, credit to them, they did it very well.“I thought my defenders stood up and I have been very critical of them at times, particularly in a game which we lost heavily.“They stood up well and handled everything that was coming into the box but then a moment of madness a minute before half-time costs us the game.“You give away a silly free-kick when the guy is  yards from your goal on the touchline facing his own goal. Then you lose your man for the goal.“We’ve got to give Morton credit. I thought they were decent at what they do and that’s why they’ve had a decent start in the league.“We knew and we said ‘don’t give away daft free-kicks’ but there are times you can’t help give away a free-kick or put it out for a throw-in.“We worked all week to deal with them but a player gets a rush of blood to the head and it cost us the game, which is unfortunate for us because I think the players worked ever so hard.“They gave me everything and I couldn’t have asked for any more in terms of effort and endeavour to go and do it.“We got people on the pitch to go and do it and get us back in the game but, in the end, it’s a poor goal that’s cost us in that game.”Stepping into the breach for Ton’s suspended manager David Hopkin, No  Anton McElhone was happy with his side’s performance as they leapfrogged Dundee into fourth spot.“We said that before, we’ve got a really good team that probably doesn’t get as much attention at times but we should,” he said.“Our budget, everything’s against us, but the lads put in a sht every week.“It was a great time to score a goal and we weathered the storm in the second half against a very talented Dundee team.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/DNic_Taw_Teams_Podcast-7-846x564.jpg ","title":"win 100 with the teles fantastic strictly come dancing competition every friday","story":"Every Friday whilst Strictly Come Dancing is gracing our TVs the Tele is giving you the chance to cash in!Every Friday, each copy of the Eveningwill have the name of one of the dancers taking part on the show printed on the front page along with a Unique Reference Number.If your dancer is voted off on Sunday then you are in with a chance to win £!TO ENTER:Simply enter your dancer#s name and Unique Reference Number in the boxes below along with your contact details…that’s it!Good luck!Terms  Conditions:Entrants must register by midnight on Saturday, .

I think we should be seeing the game out on  minutes.“That makes it even more frustrating because we need to see that last couple of minutes out.“They got back in the game – but in extra-time I thought we were the better team and we were more likely to score.“It didn’t happen and it went to penalties and we didn’t manage to win it“We’ve got another massive gameso we don’t have time to sulk or be too focused on the defeat.“It’s a huge game for the football club on Saturday and we’ve got to get on to that and focus on that.“Obviously there is disappointment on the night and the morning after when the lads wake up.“But we’ll recover and make sure we’re fully focused on the next game because there’s no real time to dwell on that.”Lewis also says Aberdeen’s penalty takers shouldn’t beat themselves up after missing in the shoot-out against Hearts.Sam Cosgrove hit his th and th goals of the season from the spot in the first half to twice put the Reds in front in the capital.But when it came to the shoot-out the English striker fired over the crossbar.Niall McGinn did likewise and Bruce Anderson’s effort was saved by Jambos keeper Joel Pereira.Lewis added: “Sam doesn’t need to beat himself up because he missed that penalty.“He scored two in the game and has scored plenty of other penalties for us.“The lads had the courage to step up and take them but unfortunately they didn’t go in.“That’s what can happen with penalties. I hope they don’t get too disappointed because they missed this time round.”During McInnes’ time as manager the Dons have a fine cup record. As well as winning the League Cup in  Aberdeen have reached three more finals.Last term they made it to the final of the Betfred Cup and the semi-final of the Scottish Cup.With the Reds regulars at Hampden in recent times, perhaps the law of averages dictated they were bound to exit a cup competition before the semi-finals or finals Lewis doesn’t subscribe to that theory.The former England squad keeper said: “I’m not necessarily a great believer in that. If you look at it Mikey Devlin has possibly slipped for the first goal and MacLean has time to put it in the bottom corner.“That was unfortunate for Mikey and for the second one the centre-half gambled and got his reward. I don’t think it’s law of averages because we played really well in phases and deservedly got our two penalties.“It wasn’t poor decisions or luck – they were clear-cut chancesour players hadn’t been brought down.“I don’t think we can be too disappointed with the performance overall – but cup football is all about getting through and we didn’t do that.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.44817554-3-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.44817554-3-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.44817554-3-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.44817554-3-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"more injury woe as vital clash looms","story":"Aberdeen#s injury crisis could deepen further for the Premiership trip to Rangers with Connor McLennan and James Wilson both doubts for Ibrox.Former Manchester United striker Wilson limped off early in the second half of the League Cup quarter-final exit at Hearts.Boss Derek McInnes confirmed the -year-old has suffered a medial ligament injury.Winger McLennan suffered a dead leg and also had to be replaced in the second half at Tynecastle.Both are doubts for Saturday’s league clash at Ibrox with McInnes already down six players due to injury.Midfielders Funso Ojo, Craig Bryson, Stephen Gleeson and Scott Wright are all out for Ibrox with centre-backs Scott McKenna and Ash Taylor also sidelined by injury.McInnes said: McLennan is more of a dead leg so he might have a chance.“Wilson has stretched his medial ligament.“In itself they are two injuries that are not too signicant.“It is just the quickness of the game coming round that might keep them out.”Teenage midfielder Dean Campbell had to come off late in the second half of regulation time with cramp but is expected to be fit to face Rangers.McInnes said: “Wilson and McLennan coming off with injuries wasn’t ideal.“Then we are trying to put bodies in positions that are maybe not natural to them. Campbell had to come off with cramp and we had to readjust again.”Leading - two minutes into injury-time the Dons were agonisingly close to a semi-final clash with Rangers at Hampden in early November.However, Hearts hit a last-gasp equaliser to force extra-time.With the sides still level at - after  minutes the tie went to a penalty shoot-out where Aberdeen missed all three of their spot-kicks.Sam Cosgrove and Niall McGinn shot over the bar while Bruce Anderson’s penalty was saved by keeper Joel Pereira.McInnes believes the cup exit was harsh on his side.He said: “We were very good in the game and also trying to manage a situation with injuries.“It was really harsh on my players that they haven’t had a winning performance.“It is cup football and you are either in or you are out.“When that five minuteswent up we have to see off one more cross and win one more header and we are home and dry.“We had possession in the bottom corner and should have kept it down there better than we did.“We allowed ourselves to be counter attacked.“In extra-time there felt an inevitability that it was going to go to penalties.It was a sore one because our support and my players were great.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/09/5d84af5a727f20.58412537-375x564.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet could rehome any of these animals","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable pets from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home.Handsome Gus is looking for an adult-only home where he is also the only pet.He very affectionate but likes all the attention and wouldn’t be keen to share it.Gus, who is six, will need access to the outdoors so he can explore.

The two practices are run separately but with many shared resources.

Your understanding and patience is very much appreciated as we seek to find the safest way to deliver the most effective and high quality health care for us all.We look forward to seeing the talent of our local young people when competition entries close on October  and celebrating that talent when we announce our winner on October .Dr Andrew Strain, Lochgilphead Medical Centre and Furnace and Inveraray SurgerySir,My favourite activity at this time of the year is picking brambles. Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate.

have already been expressed by the UK Department for Transport over the benefits of the reintroduction of tracks all the way to Carlisle.Momentum has been growing since funding was announced for a feasibility study earlier this year into taking the Borders Railway through Hawick, Newcastleton and across the English border.But the papers released by the Scottish government in response to a Freedom of Information request reveal that they cant give the go-ahead.And that support from south of the border is not universal.Among the released files and emails is a previously confidential Transport Position Paper from September, .It states: \" It should be noted that Scottish Ministers do not have the powers to construct a cross-border railway line as they only have the powers to construct a railway which starts, ends and remains in Scotland.\"Accordingly, the power to construct a railway line from Tweedbank to Carlisle in its entirety would rest with the UK Government.\"The signing of the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal partnership, which is made up of five local authority areas either side of the border, was seen as a major boost for the extension going ahead.The newly released papers show the partnership wrote in June  to Hamza Yousaf, then Scottish Transport Minister, regarding the Borders Railway extension.According to that letter: \"The Settle-Carlisle line shows the benefits of having alternative routes to support the resilience of the rail network.\"The line was threatened with closure in the s but following a successful campaign to keep it open the line was reprieved in .\"Since then the line has played a key role for re-routed main line passenger services when the West Coast or East Coast Main Lines have been closed and for freight services between Scotland Cumbria and the rest of England.\"The Borders Railway between Carlisle and Edinburgh could be equally successful in providing this vital role as an alternative route to the West and East Coast Main Lines for freight and passenger traffic and through this help maximise the growth of the Scottish and UK economy.\"But the enthusiasm and optimism wasnt shared by the UK Department for Transport.Feedback provided by the Department in July  stated: \"We are not convinced an extended Borders Railway would help with capacity issues on the West Coast Main Line.\"Assuming any such extension would have similar characteristics to the existing line i.e. slow and un-electried, it would not be attractive for re-routing any of the existing services using the West Coast Main Line.\"Diesel hauled trains not in a hurry already go via Dumfries so having another ersionary alternative route would not add

Police Scotland does not make any financial contribution to the town centre schemes.ldquoThe councilrsquos current position with regard to CCTV provision is not to install new CCTV equipment or replace le-expired systems but to continue to maintain the current asset within the existing revenue budget until they are beyond economic repair.ldquoFor information, previous work undertaken by officers in  indicated that the likely total capital cost of replacement, on a like for like basis, while utilising more modern digital technologies, could be in the region of circa pound,.ldquoThere would be potentially additional costs associated with related civils works and infrastructure in the region of pound,.ldquoA follow up report could update and validate this figure to present-day costs, however given the anticipated capital expenditure of circa poundm, plus a requirement for future on-going enhanced revenue expenditure, officers do not believe that this will provide value for money.ldquoIn addition, there is currently no identied budget, either capital or revenue.However, at a full council meeting in May, Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell put forward a motion calling on officers to explore options for keeping the CCTV network, and officers have suggested a public consultation be held.The motion was agreed, and so the council will consult with ious stakeholders in the CCTV network, including Police Scotland, community councils and area partnerships, as well as providers of CCTV network systems and infrastructure to determine potential costs.The consultation will then form the basis of a series of options for CCTV in the Borders which councillors will be asked to approve, most likely in December.The councilrsquos executive member for roads and infrastructure, councillor Gordon Edgar, said: ldquoWe know that CCTV can be a useful tool for the police and communities in terms of public safety.ldquoHowever, we also know that in order for the cameras to contribute to creating safe environments in our towns, the technology needs to be kept up-to-date.ldquoWith a growing demand for our services, and budget constraints, the Council must consider whether replacing the current system is value for money, and what other options are available.ldquoIn order for the council to make a fully informed decision, we need the views of the public and would encourage residents, businesses and community groups to take part in our consultation before the October  deadline.The survey is available at scotborders.citizenspace"},{"url":null,"title":"dream-wedding-dashed-thomas-cook-goes-bust","story":"A PEEBLES couple have had their dream wedding in Turkey shattered by the collapse of Thomas Cook.Groom Kevin Weir and his bride Kirsteen Barrett forked out pound, to fly their  guests to celebrate their wedding in the sun.But with only two weeks to go until they jetted off to say their vows, news that the travel firm had gone bust wrecked their plans.The distraught couplersquos wedding is now in ruins and they fear it could take months before they see a penny of their money refunded.Bride-to-be Kirsteen told us she broke down after hearing news that the travel operator had gone into liquidation this week.ldquoI just couldnrsquot believe it.

The ladies# choirs are going well and the men’s group has recruited a few more, though still not enough.’So here is the challenge to the men of Kintyre, especiallythey enjoy singing in the car, in the shower or anywhere , don’t know how much fun it is to sing in a group and would like an activity which helps forget worries: go along to Campbeltown Town Hall at pm on Tuesday September  or telephone   and give the men’s group a try.The women are meeting separately. You don’t have to audition or read music you just have to enjoy singing. Being part of a group is more fun with more back-up and less daunting than singing on your own.Paula added: ‘The challenge for the women of Campbeltown and Kintyre is to persuade your men folk to give singing a chance.’"},{"url":null,"title":"campbeltown picture house joins in with into film festival","story":"The festival, which runs from November  to , is hosted by British film education charity Into Film, which runs film-based programmes for children aged five to .This year’s festival comprises eight strands which can help educators navigate the packed programme: Mental Wellbeing and Identity, Language and Creativity, The Natural World, Exploring History, Debate, Fantasy and Adventure, Rebellion, and Musicals.CPH is showing Beautul Boy for secondary pupils, Singin# in the Rain for primary pupils and The Grinch for families.The cinema#s manager, Ellen Mainwood, said: #Into Film has become a popular part of Campbeltown Picture House#s calendar and inviting the young people in to enjoy a free screening is such a privilege.#This year, Campbeltown children were given the task of deciding which films would be screened in the Musicals category so it#s fun to now see those films being watched by children across the country.#Dferent movies will also be on offer in Dunoon Burgh Hall and at Oban Phoenix Cinema.Kirsty Gallacher, Into Film programme delivery manager for Scotland, said: #Film is a powerful tool for learning and engagement.

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved. It resulted in a second booking for Kenny Kerr, a yellow for J McCallum, and a red card for the original Glynhill culprit, as well as yellow for the visiting keeper from referee Jimmy Litster, after charging from his own goalmouth to become involved.Undeterred, the Pupils settled back down to seal a richly deserved victory,achieved through a disciplined and determined performance.The Kintyre Park side will now enjoy a free week, with ato action scheduled for Saturday October , opponent to be confirmed.For fixture updates, and to see second-half action and goals from last Saturday’s match, see Campbeltown Football on Facebook, or @PupilsAFC on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"weather wont play fair for men","story":"Strong winds, for most of the players, deflected several balls into the severe rough and out of bounds and pushed scores upwards.Robert Shaw, one of the first out in the morning ballot, had an excellent round to finish on a nett  from Ken MacMillan on nett .The wind continued in the afternoon but didn#t deter John Docherty from the best scratch score of the day.

However, it was the home side that took the lead on the nd minute when Ashfield’s centre forward cut in from the left before sending an unstoppable shot in to the top corner.A test of character was required from the boys as they fell behind and with five minutes of the half remaining they were rewarded after a corner dropped to Stuart Phillps in the box. The young forward adjusted his feet quickly to send a beautul curling shot past everyone to make it -.Fteen minutes into the second half the Pupils took the lead. New signing Raphael MacLachlan, playing in only his second appearance for the s, sent in a delightful whipped corner that brushed off the Ashfield centre-half into the goal to make it -. The Clachan youngster can be proud of his impact on the game and is already proving to be a valuable addition to the team.As the Pupils pressed for their third of the game a long ball evaded the defence to allow the Ashfield number  in again to equalise with  minutes remaining.As the game drew to a close, it looked like both sides would share the points until a dramatic final minute. A long clearance by Ashfield was misjudged by the Pupils defence to allow Ashfield’s player in with a chance of his hat-trick but the youngster scuffed his shot into thankful hands of Pupils goal-keeper Lorne Paterson.Knowing it was the final minute, Paterson tried to kick the ball up the field as quickly as possible only for it to cannon off the back of Euan O’May’s head! It landed back in Paterson’s hands and he quickly dispersed the ball, long up the field where the ball bounced high over everyone, only for Calum Ellis to nip in front of the Ashfield centre-half, run in on goal, calmly round the advancing goal-keeper and stroke the ball home to make it - to the Ardshield Hotel-sponsored side – much to the delight of his fellow team mates and coaches.Ellis who has now scored seven goals in the Under s# opening four games.This weekend the team will enjoy a free fixture due before playing at home to Glasgow Boys Club on Sunday October ."},{"url":null,"title":"ohara receives unanimous backing to defend argyll and bute seat","story":"On the day the UK Supreme Court declared that Boris Johnson had acted illegally in suspending parliament, and as he prepared toto London to resume his seat at Westminster, Mr O’Hara said: #In these deeply worrying times, I am both honoured and humbled to have received such an incredible show of support from our local SNP members here in Argyll and Bute.#Looking ahead to a possible general election, Mr O’Hara added: #When the general election comes, we in Scotland must be able to choose our own future.#Here in Argyll and Bute, this election will be a straight fight between the SNP and Boris Johnson#s Tories.

This occurs when cats come in contact with chemicals such as fuels, lubricants and some solvents.Usually, self-grooming causes the cat to ingest the toxin, or in some cases they inhale it which can cause a severe pneumonia.The toxin can cause problems throughout the body and on the skin too.When Jonny had examined Tikka, he immediately sent her to our Tranent surgery for blood tests and intravenous fluids as she was dehydrated.Fortunately, Tikkarsquos blood tests were normal so she did not have kidney damage.She tolerated her fluid therapy well and was soon looking much happier however several areas of her skin had become red and she was losing hair especially on her front legs.Tikka did not want to eat or drink. She was given analgesics, antibiotics and soothing cream was applied to her skin.Our nursing staff ensured she was as comfortable as possible and as she was not eating by herself, they fed her via a feeding tube several times a day.Her skin became red and thickened and some areas sloughed off.She had to have cream applied frequently to the damaged skin, just asshe had suffered burns.Tikka was finally well enough to go home where Mrs Taylor continued to treat her skin. Tikka started eating well again and is improving daily. Her fur is regrowing and soon she will have her beautul coat again.Now Mrs Taylor was very vigilant and realised she had to do something to help Tikka immediately.If you suspect your cat may have had contact with petroleum-based substances, please contact your vet as soon as possible.Often the first sign you may have is your pet smells of petrol or diesel.There may be vomiting or diarrhoea. They may actually be dizzy or confused or showing other neurological problems such as staggering and trembling. There may be respiratory signs such as coughing or wheezingthey have inhaled the chemical.Do not try to make your pet vomit as this can exacerbate the toxicity.The first thing you should do is try to remove the chemical from the fur.In many cases, it is best to bring your pet straight to your vets as soon as possible. The nursing staff at veterinary practices are well trained in dealing with intoxication emergencies.With petroleum products there are three main areas where the body can be affected: l The internal organs especially the kidneys, so your vet will want to blood sample your pet to check for any damage to the kidneys or other organsl The respiratory system can be affected especiallythe toxin is inhaled. This often happensthe patient vomits then inhales some resulting in a very severe pneumonia. Your vet may wish to take x-rays to check for this.l The animalrsquos skin can also be affected. The petroleum products sit on the fur then soaks through to the skin where they are held in contact by the fur. This causes them to act as a caustic substance, damaging the skin and hair follicles. Often the first sign before the skin damage is seen is hair loss due to the follicle damage.The treatment for these causes is supportive at all times. There are no specic antidotes. Intravenous fluids are administered, this helps overcome dehydration and helps eliminate toxins from the body.Analgesics are given to help keep pain from damaged skin and internal organs to a minimum.Antibiotics are given, as damaged skin is very prone to secondary infection and they are always givenpneumonia is present. Skin treatment has to be intense to keep infection to a minimum and encourage damaged skin to recover.Thankfully Tikka has made an excellent recovery, thanks to Mrs Taylorrsquos quick thinking and the intense nursing care given by the nursing team at Dunedin Vets."},{"url":null,"title":"tim-39-s-tales-magic-real-39-s-around-us","story":"Of course, in stories magic is very real a frog or beast can transform into a prince, dragons and witches can fly, animals can talk, wishes can be granted by faeries and spells cast by wizards.

Donrsquot speak to that squirrel wersquove no time to talk.But of course we do live in a magic world, a world just as magical as any story world. Itrsquos just that we have stopped noticing the magic that is real.In our world, a frog may not turn into a prince with a kiss, but a caterpillar turns into a butterfly, a tadpole into a frog.And such magic is all around us. Leaves change colour with the seasons, magic transformation is everywhere. Animals do talk, any dog lover will tell us that.Have you ever seen a hare and made eye contact and felt the connection or watched a squirrel hide nuts, and then come up to you asking for more Walk in a wood, or by a riverbank, or just sit in your garden or a park and the magic is all around you. We watched wood pigeons nest in a small elder tree outside our front window over the summer. Two eggs hatched and we watched as they were fed and finally flew the nest. It was, truly, magic.The magic all around us is still vast, and we could all make our own list the sound of birdsong, watching a butterfly flutter, a spiderrsquos web decorated with dew, the glimpse of a deer in a wood, the mist wrapped mountains, a red sparkling cloud during sunset, a wee beastie under a rock as it scampers for cover, the whisper of an ancient tree and the sweet smell of a wood.But I believe that sadly too many of us donrsquot notice real magic anymore.And when we donrsquot notice something we donrsquot feel connected to it, so we donrsquot care about it. And when we donrsquot care about it we donrsquot protect or value it.And when we donrsquot value it, we canrsquot feel the wonder and sense of awe it creates. And so we trash it, ignore and neglect it, exploit it. And we forget we are part of this magic that we are sons and daughters of nature too. And so we disconnect ourselves from what can truly make us feel happy, and instead drug ourselves with the articial magic of our own technology which makes us feel all powerful.But the truth is we are not.Ultimately we rely on the natural environment for our physical and emotional well-being, as much as the creatures we are making extinct.We need nature, it doesnrsquot need us, and eventually it is in control. Asto make this point huge waves hit the rocks of Prestonpans in a storm not so long ago, drenching the nearby houses in a display of naturersquos power. It was scary but also spectacular.In  such a storm was believed to have been the result of magic conjured by the ldquoNorth Berwick Witches.That storm, like the recent one, was indeed magic, conjured by nature, which can whip up a whirlwind more effectively than any wizard or witch.Magic is real.

I walked through woods to primary school.The committee approved the conditions with an added condition which called for the developer to produce details of a footpath link to the south of the strip of

amid concerns about access to the site which is through a narrow C-class road and reports of heavy construction vehicles parking off site.A third additional condition, addressing the local

He seemed interested in how our land was used, and he told me that back home he owned a ranch, which included a medium-sized forest of native trees.I remember saying ldquowow, thatrsquos so special, but he shook his head, saying: ldquoSpecial  No, not really, a stupid law means the forest is worthless.I was a bit confused, so I asked him what he meant. ldquoTherersquos a preservation order on it, which means that part of my land is unproductive, he said.I realised at this point that although we were having the same conversation about land, we were having dferent understandings of it.He shook his head sadly and said: ldquoItrsquos just a waste of good timber.That kind of ended our conversation. I didnrsquot try to persuade him to think dferently, I felt that I wasnrsquot in a position to do that since he was a paying customer and my tip could have been at stake.That conversation was nearly  years ago. And yet his comment ldquoitrsquos just a waste of good timber has stuck with me ever since. The reason for this was the mindset it revealed. I found it depressing that he could not see the value of something so precious because it would make him no financial profit.As my kids get geared up for the school climate strike this week, I realise now this mindset is one which has to be challenged. When I look back, I am ashamed of myself that I did not have the courage to speak out to the man, simply because I needed his tip.There are many parts of the climate crisis, but one truth within the debate is trees are our le. I have seen one calculation that each human breathes in the oxygen produced by around eight trees. So count the number in your family and those you love and multiply by eight. That is the number of trees needed to help your family and loved ones breathe. For sure, trees arenrsquot the only source of the oxygen we breathe, but they are a signicant part of it, and they hold tons of carbon. Surely that alone is lsquoprofitrsquo enough.But while the riches of woodland go way beyond that of timber profit, I understand that environmental destruction is linked to poverty as well as greed. We need to challenge both. But we will never do thiswe are made to be too afraid to speak out, either because we fear those who wield financial power over us, or the ridicule of others who as yet donrsquot get it.In a storytelling session last week for a P class in an East Lothian primary school, I told the tale of the king who wanted to touch the moon. He always gets his way because people are afraid of him, so the forest in his kingdom is cut down to make a tower of wooden boxes to the moon. But he is impatient and foolish, and falls from the tower, and the boxes all get smashed. The forest has been destroyed for the kingrsquos failed vanity project, while his people remain poor and still afraid of him.One of the girls in the class put her hand up then said: ldquoBut we need trees to live. Later she told me: ldquoThey should get rid of the kinghe doesnrsquot change his bad ways.Many of our young people get it. Itrsquos their future. We can all make our own small personal contribution, but to save our childrenrsquos future, courage is needed to speak out, for adults too.Never again will I remain silent, for either reward or fear of ridicule. There is too much at stake, not just for me but for my children and this dear planet which is home for us all, but dying in our care."},{"url":null,"title":"haddington-parking-plans-discussion-held-private","story":"East Lothian Council is working on designs that would see the parking provision changed in the town, including the possibility of a -plus-space long-stay car park on the townrsquos Whittingehame Drive.However, town centre traders are concerned about the possibility of spaces being lost on High Street and Market Street, with it also being mooted that the long-stay car park at Tesco, which is used by many people working in the town centre, could become short-stay only.The issue was briefly mentioned at the townrsquos community council meeting last Tuesday evening.Usually, these meetings are open to the public and the press however, it was agreed to cut short next monthrsquos meeting to allow community councillors to discuss the controversial plans in private.Jan Wilson, the grouprsquos long-standing chairwoman, said: ldquoIrsquom not sure how much can be made public at the moment.ldquoI know community council meetings should be public but there are times when I have to say no because the proposals are not set in stone yet. It would be stupid of me to say lsquothis could happenrsquo or lsquothat could happenrsquo when it might not.According to East Lothian Council the plans are still at ldquothe initial stage. However, the local authority has stressed it is aiming to ldquoenhance parking provision in such a way that the number of available spaces in Haddington is increased beyond current levels and that better use is made of each space.Currently, Haddington town centre is home to more than  spaces.The long-stay car park at Tesco has  spaces, which includes two disabled and car club spaces and four public electric charge spaces.On the opposite side of Court Street, the car park at East Lothian Councilrsquos headquarters, John Muir House, has  spaces.The majority of those ndash  ndash are long stay but the car park is reserved for ldquocouncil-based activities between am and pm throughout the week and is only available to the general public at the weekend and outwith those times.Proposals suggest a revamp of High Street, which has  spaces Market Street, which has  spaces Hardgate, which has four spaces and Court Street, which can accommodate  cars.Meanwhile,  town centre residents have parking permits, which enable them to park in any of the restricted -minute maximum parking areas for any duration.East Lothian Council has not revealed the number of spaces ndash or the site ndash for any proposed car park at Whittingehame Drive, although it has been suggested as having between  and  spaces.Liz McDougall, chairwoman of the Nungate Gala committee, told the Courier that the council had not been in touch about the proposals.She was concerned about the impact it could have on their gala activities. Andshe questionedthe local authority were ldquotrying to slide it in the back door and said: ldquoWe have never heard anything from the council.ldquoI was told about it from another colleague and then I spoke to Moira Graham, of Graham the Jeweller, and she was telling me about it and saying this was going to happen.Irsquom not exactly thrilled about the idea to be honest simply because this is going to cause a lot of issues for the gala.The new car park would need a planning application to progress.Ward councillor Craig Hoy, who lives in the town, said: ldquoI welcome plans for signicant long-stay parking facilities at Whittingehame Drive and have been pressing for action in this area.ldquoThis could be the missing piece of the jigsaw which allows us to press ahead with investment to enhance the town centre, overcoming very valid concerns about a net loss of parking.

and loneliness in the town.The project was officially launched in the summer in the community centre, with almost half of those attending signing up to volunteer.Similar projects exist in other places called lsquoCommunity Links Projectsrsquo but the team in North Berwick wanted to do something on a dferent model.Community Connections uses members of the community to introduce others to groups and sports clubs, emphasising community development and outreach.The project is helping tackle social isolation by encouraging GPs and other health professionals to refer those at risk of isolation to ldquosocial prescribing rather than provide medication.Members of the public can also refer someone.Carol said: ldquoPeople who refer someone at risk of isolation to me may have medical problems that they need attended to, but social prescribing means that they are also trying to recommend other things that will benefit their wellbeing.ldquoIt might be to do with meeting other people, exercise or all those non-medical things that might make the biggest dference to improving their health and wellbeing overall.Carol then meets the referred person to discuss their likes and dislikes, what is important to them and what the barriers are to taking part in community groups.She then puts the inidual into contact with one of her lsquocommunity connectorsrsquo related to a certain

one-off basis.Others can meet someone over a number of occasions, providing them someone to talk to over coffee.Carol has also set up smallscale cafe meetings for those who would like to meet new people.She highlighted it was not only older people who were at risk of social isolation, referring to her own experience of losing her dad and becoming a new mother soon after.She explained how the experience left her ldquocompletely wrecked and thinking that everyone around her was coping very well.She said: ldquoThere are a lot of reasons people might feel isolated at some point.ldquoIf you have been through something that is a huge setback then your confidence is that much lower.As well as mental health, other reasons people could use Community Connections could be due to accident,

After  months, wersquove barely reached base camp, yet we canrsquot give up now. The gardens hereabouts are a constant reminder of how much there is to learn. Some of them are as lovely as Sissinghurst or Inverewe, and quite obviously require as much hard work. As a result, when neighbours meet, conversation is more likely to turn to brassicas and box blight than Brexit and the Backstop. Also high on the agenda are butterflies and bees, the absence or superabundance of rain, heat surges, the proleration of wasps, and the effect of all the above on the quality of their compost. If you chance to look up at the sky, someone will guess, to within a degree of accuracy, what the next dayrsquos temperature will be.This must be because, like gardeners everywhere, they are acutely attuned to the weather. Other than farmers, I doubt there is any single group more intensely aware of our climate, and the ways in which it is fast changing. For some of them, the young Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is like Joan of Arc, fearlessly confronting the forces of destruction, and inspiring all of us to be more vocal, angry and proactive. If you have a garden, you cannot be unaware that when she says ldquochange is coming, whether you like it or not, itrsquos not a prediction for the far future. Change is already here. Indeed, serious gardeners are already taking steps, tree by tree, shrub by shrub, to mitigate or adapt to its impact.This became particularly evident last weekend at a Gardenerrsquos Question Time, run by Borders Organic Gardeners, in St Boswellrsquos village hall. The room was packed with people so experienced they cast Monty Don into the shade. A  of three experts, including this paperrsquos gardening columnist Dave Allan, held their nerve for almost two hours to answer a barrage of questions that ranged from how to deal with snails and slugs , and the best apple trees for a cold spot .Opinion ied on what tree to plant to replace a dying ash, but in answering, the alpine expert Ron McBeath said that all our ash trees will probably be gone within ten years. There would even be spores carrying ash dieback in the village hall where we sat, he told us, making a few of us shuffle our boots. It was an uncomfortable reminder that certain forces are beyond control, some bad situations irreversible. Other, thankfully less devastating, diseases were mentioned, heading northwards in our direction on the warming thermal tide. Above all, as Emma Emmerson, of Woodside Plant Centre near Ancrum remarked, everyone is noticing the ldquocollapsed seasons, and the challenges they present to making a garden grow as it did in the past.Concern in the hall was palpable. Gardeners are in the frontline of climate change, seeing in miniature what is happening in the world at large. The  discussion ranged over what we could do to help wildle and especially birds to thrive ndash cat lovers should lock up their pets ndash but in terms of plants, it would seem that we are approaching uncharted territory. Old certainties are no longer reliable.Sombre though it sounds, it was not an afternoon of gloom ndash quite the reverse. For a start it was a reminder of how much fun it is to grow things and, in the case of vegetables and fruits, to watch them ripen, before falling upon them with kne, fork and spoon. It was also an encouragement, for beginners like me, to get more serious. To learn that, across the UK, more land is covered by gardens than by nature reserves is to understand the humble back yard or allotmentrsquos place in a giant living patchwork. Each of these plots, and not just those abiding by organic principles, stands guard on the ramparts, defending the gate against attack.This mild month, with bees still nose-deep in our flower beds, and hedges quivering with sparrows, finches and tits with owls keeping us awake from the horse chestnut tree outside the window, hedgehogs rootling in the field we call our lawn, and a young woodpecker learning his trade on the telegraph pole by our fence, it becomes abundantly clear that the place you like to think of as your own is in fact shared with thousands of other creatures.That will not be news to those who have gone out of their way to help feed the birds. A recent survey showed that in Britain enough food is served to sustain  million birds every year. Species that were struggling  years ago are now making a comeback, among them goldfinches and nuthatches.Itrsquos a glimmer of hope amid the increasingly apocalyptic language around climate change. As the villagersquos green-fingered army shows, there is nothing egotistical or self-centred about people devoted to the upkeep of their borders and trellises, their fruit trees and raised beds. When Voltaire wrote, ldquoit is our duty to cultivate our garden he was not, for once, being sarcastic. A passionate gardener who, as he grew older, craved the simple le, he understood the deeper meaning to be found in tending your own patch. The upkeep of that little bit of earth results in spiritual well-being as well as a barrowload of juicy carrots. Those of us cheering on crusaders like Thunberg can still raise our own battle standard. It should be planted carefully between the raspberry canes or beside a clematis or, in our case, among the rampant, bee-friendly weeds."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10459949.jpg?type=article-full","title":"guide-scotlands-best-seafood-experiences","story":"The Seafood Ristorante, St AndrewsLocated in an iconic lsquoglass boxrsquo, the Seafood Ristorante relaunched in March  and isnow one of Scotlandrsquos premium dining venues.

The book, a witty and poignant read, is also a fascinating portrayal of the way newspapers operated half-a-century ago.Eleven years later, Tom Stoppard produced Night and Day, a play set in a fictitious African country, with a visiting Fleet Street journalist and photographer among the cast. The journalistis delighted when he realises that he will be able to use a telex machine to get his story back to London.Wersquore going to make them sick, he crows, referring to his hapless rivals on other Fleet Street papers.Today, of course, the visiting journalists would be equipped with laptops and smartphones that enable their words to go online within seconds.When away from the office, reporters, back in the day, would phone their story - their lsquocopyrsquo - from the nearest phone kiosk, with the words being taken down by copytakers in the office. .I remember covering football matches in the s. In most press boxes, the phone was on a ledge in front of you, but at one particular ground the phone was inconveniently located in a row of kiosks down a narrow wooden staircase using it to phone your copy in meant that you missed several valuable minutes of live action on the pitch. When you were on the phone and you heard a goal being scored, you had to beg the copytaker to hang on: you sprinted up the stairs, asked your colleagues who had scored, ran back down the stairs again and, out of breath, relayed the updated information to the copytaker.If nothing , that sort of thing kept you fit.Gradually, technology began to encroach on the business of producing newspapers. The late Bill Deedes, when editor of the Daily , visited newspaper offices in the late s and at one leading US paper, he writes, ldquoI saw the new dawn - direct input through the computer by journalists and advertising staff that would transform this industry.Which it did, signicantly. Further radical changes would in time arrive with the internet, and email, which made research and communication incredibly convenient. Now, you can carry out entire interviews with distant people while on a train, via a smartphone and email. Smartphones can record conversations, which you can save to your desktop: no more need for laborious shorthand, written out with a Biro in a sodden notebook in the pouring rain. Reporters can shoot and upload video, too.Itrsquos all so convenient and easy, in fact, that we often take it for granted.

Money is finite and decisions have had to be made.Ralph Roberts says the fund is a lsquoseminal momentrsquo for bus user and companiesThe good news is that bus companies have continued to invest in new, greener vehicles and the air quality and carbon emissions of the bus fleet in Scotland is dropping signicantly. Bus companies are limited in what they can do though so this infrastructure fund has come at a seminal moment for bus users and bus companies alike.The system cannot be revolutionised at the drop of a hat, so this crucial first investment in bus priority will be the acid test as to whether local authorities are willing to make the tough decisions required and whether bus can be seen as attractive enough to car users to give it a try.Poor air quality and congestion affects peoplersquos health and damages our economy.

Disposing this total of  tonnes of material properly would be the equivalent of removing , cars off UK roads every year.When sent to landfill, food waste releases methane, a dangerous greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide in the short term.By successfully capturing food waste it can be converted into sustainable energy, instead of being sent to landfill or incineration. The resulting material can also be used as a fertiliser for soil to help grow more food, more sustainably. Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, said: “It wasn’t just fantasy when the Doc and Marty were discovering how they could power the DeLorean to time travel – they hit upon an idea that over  years later could make a signicant dference in how we combat the climate emergency.“Time is running out as we look to tackle the climate emergency. “The good news is that inedible food waste has huge potential as its energy can be used to make sustainable fuel and we can harness this by simply using our food recycling caddy. “You could provide enough power to watch the entire Back to the Future trilogy from the food held in nearly two and a half food recycling caddies.”Around  per cent of the , tonnes of food waste produced by households in Scotland every year is unavoidable.

The labels specy what can be recycled at kerbside and give details of where more information can be found.Crews will aim to cover all recycling bins by the end of the month, but stickers will also be available for residents at household recycling centres .More information about recycling can be found on the council’s website, from checking recycling bin day to an A-Z recycling guide and what happens to the materials afterwards.Councillor Peter Argyle, chair of the infrastructure services committee, said: “Recycle Week is a great opportunity for householders to make a positive contribution to Aberdeenshire’s recycling efforts. “We hope the information provided during the week will encourage residents to make a push towards increased recycling rates.”For a complete guide on the materials that can be recycled in Aberdeenshire, see the A-Z guide at http:bit.ly AshireAZ.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..!

Bailies of Bennachie outreach officer Fiona Cormack said: “It was a special moment to have everyone joined together around the top of the hill.“Participants sang along to the sound of the Kintore Pipe Band playing Scotland the Brave, Flower of Scotland and Auld Lang Syne.“Some did a Mexican wave, others swung arms and some took a little time to reflect on their reasons for doing the walk.“One family from New South Wales in Australia took part and there was great support for this community event from the towns and villages around Bennachie.”“Mither Tap means ‘mother’s breast’ and that led us to raise money for breast cancer care and the University of Aberdeen Development Trust’s research into cures for breast cancer through this event.“We know that many people who have been affected by the disease took part in the walk.”One of the participants, Kate Brosman from Daviot, said she was last up Bennachie after her diagnosis and before her treatment.She explained: “I promised myself that I would come back once I was through the other side. It has been a while and I wasn’t sure that I would make it to the top but I was just up in time for the bosie and feel I have parked the whole experience there.”Funds raised will be spilt after costs between the two breast cancer charities and the Aberdeen Mountain Rescue Trust who provided marshals on the day.The Kemany Scout group also came out to help with members assisting with car parking and marshalling. data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Did you complain about any of these shows  \"  \"  These were the top  most complained about TV shows this year viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"After the bosie walkers ed to the field at the Back of Bennachie where they rested in the sunshine and enjoyed pizza, ice cream and coffee and cakes provided by local caterers.

Spending on these ads, often targeted to specic groups, has totalled more than £. million since last October.And while much of the attention has focused on the big parties and pressure groups on either side of the Brexit ide, the data also reveals the thousands of adverts placed at a local level, often seeking to influence constituents on what can appear to be seemingly mundane neighbourhood issues.Under new rules Facebook introduced in October , anyone placing a political advert must declare who paid for it.Our investigation identied around  ads on the pages of local politicians and councils which were run without these disclaimers – including  placed on behalf of sitting MPs.There is no suggestion that any of the adverts had been deliberate attempts to deceive constituents. They were all found and removed by Facebook.Most adverts placed by or on behalf of Scottish MPs from October  to September , , were for amounts less than £.There were a few exceptions – £ spent by Gordon Conservatives, £ by Lib Dem leader and East Dunbartonshire MP Jo Swinson, £ by Angus Conservatives, £ by the Perth and Kinross Conservative Association, £ by Linlithgow MP Martyn Day, and £ by the Conservative Party.For MSPs, the majority also spent sums less than £ promoting material on Facebook.The exceptions were former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson , Anas Sarwar , Johann Lamont , Liam Kerr , Alex Rowley , Alexander BurnettPeter Chapman , Beatrice Wishart , Richard Leonard , and West Lothian Courier Partners .Two Scottish local authorities spent money with Facebook – City of Edinburgh Counciland the SNP Group on North Ayrshire Council .data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.carlukegazette webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Wallace Day  Aug\"  Braveheart spiritlives on in Lanark viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"CARL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"CARL | Article Teaser\"Two Scottish politicans each had a Facebook advert removed as it appeared without a disclaimer – Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East MP Stuart McDonald and Martin Docherty-Hughes, MP for West Dunbartonshire.Unsurprisingly the biggest spenders on Facebook over the past year have included ious Brexit campaigns – People’s Vote UK , Best for BritainandBritain’s Future .Production company Slainte Media spent £, promoting former First Minister Alex Salmond’s televisionchat show.A Westminster Government spokesperson said: “There should be greater transparency in political advertising, which is why we have already pledged to introduce the requirement for digital election material to be clearly branded.

This OpenRoaming technology is being trailed in the county as part of the UK’s most ambitious testbed for connectivity in rural areas, in a project that aims demonstrate the potential and practical use cases that connectivity could bring to rural businesses.CloudNet, is enabling Orkney residents and tourists to use Cisco’s OpenRoaming services across key locations on the island including the ferries, ports, piers, distilleries and libraries. The trial is testing how handsets can provide a frictionless connected experience for residents and tourists in Orkney. G RuralFirst’s public Wi-Fi access network in Orkney is the first of its kind to support OpenRoaming in a live trial environment.OpenRoaming aims to combine the convenience of roaming with Wi-Fi connectivity. Users’ identities are authenticated once before they can access Wi-Fi without needing to login or register again. By linking access providers such as public venues, retailers, ports and offices, together with identity providers, such as carriers, devices and cloud services, OpenRoaming offers mobile users frictionless Wi-Fi onboarding.“OpenRoaming will change the way we connect to Wi-Fi and presents new opportunities for providers in a world where we expect high quality ubiquitous broadband access where ever we go,” said Dez O’Connor, Cisco and project CTO, G RuralFirst.“Customers tell us that Wi-Fi onboarding is a major pain point and there is a perception that it can be unreliable and insecure. OpenRoaming will transform the experience of using Wi-Fi into a seamless and positive one. As well as improving the connected experience for industries like tourism in Orkney, venues providing Wi-Fi to their customers will be able to use it as a means of engaging with them.”He added, “This trial shows the benefit of seamless connectivity in one of the most complex, challenging environments. It lays the foundations for many new WiFi solutions as our most innovative customers and partners join us to develop access networks and identity provider services across the UK and the rest of the world.”Around , tourists visit Orkney every year, making it a signicant contributor to the local economy. By making OpenRoaming services available to tourists, the G RuralFirst project aims to provide a fully connected experience for visitors to Orkney as well as its residents. Furthermore, Cisco say that there is a commercial opportunity for local tour operators and cruise ships through selling Wi-Fi packages which leverage OpenRoaming and augmented reality tourist applications across the island.The technology is also being used to support connected tourism by promoting Orkney Origins, an augmented reality app developed as part of G RuralFirst. The app provides digital tour guides of Orkney’s historic and picturesque sites via tourists’ smart devices, at access points. Tourists are able to download the app on the spot through OpenRoaming, rather than in advance of arriving, and be guided by digital avatars, creating a more memorable tourist experience and narrating the unique history of the Orkney Islands.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He said: #We want to thank our residents for doing a great job in increasing the amount of metals they recycle at the kerbside.#However, we want to take that even further now by focusing on foil. I was amazed to learn that an average household can expect to use  foil trays and  metres of foil wrap each year.#The good news is that recycling a tonne of aluminium saves nine tonnes of C emissions and four tonnes of bauxite, the raw material from which aluminium is made. And aluminium can be recycled indefinitely.“So it’s clear that each household converted to foil recycling really does make a dference environmentally. The council also gets a goodfor metals recycling, which helps offset the costs of all our waste disposal activities in Orkney.“But we know from speaking to the public that some people are unaware they can recycle foil in Orkney, or aren’t aware of the benefits. That’s why, with Alupro’s help again, we’ll be highlighting foil recycling during Recycling Week and beyond.”As part of awareness-raising, the council will be installing banners provided by Alupro at recycling centres and other public places around Orkney.OIC’s waste team are also featuring facts and figures about foil recycling on the EcoActive Facebook page, and carrying out visits to schools over Recycling Week.In Orkney, householders can put aluminium foil and foil trays in the metal recycling banks at one of the council’s Household Waste Recycling Centres , or into their recycling bin. The advice is to just rinse off food residue and put in your recycling binalongside other metals you can recycle such as food and drink cans and tins, and metal lids and tops from jars and bottles.For smaller pieces of foilit#s best to make a larger ball of foilby scrunching pieces together # it will prevent smaller pieces falling through machinery during the recycling process.For more information about waste and recycling visit the council#s website or email recycling@orkney.gov.uk .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Mr McArthur and Ms Wishart subsequently wrote to Abellio to relay these concerns directly and urge a rethink on the decision.According to Mr McArthur, Abellio has responded to say that it is exploring the possibility of working with a retailer to provide a left luggage facility as part of the station redevelopment. Both Northern Isles MSPs have called on Abellio to fast track those discussions so that agreement is reached on a proposed alternative before the current facility is removed.Mr McArthur said: “Passengers travelling to and from Orkney and Shetland by ferry, rely on the left luggage facility at Aberdeen railway station.

Once there is a suitable window in the weather then a programme of herbicide sprayingwill begin.#Anyone interested in volunteering at Arcadia Park, or providing some sort of assistance with the project, is asked to contact Bob MacKenzie on   or email address bobm@oacas.org.uk.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The report suggests the UK could come out of the European Union without a deal on October the Government can successfully argue the Article  deadline must be respected over the demands of the Opposition MPs to extend negotiations until January.The newspaper quotes a senior Government source saying: ldquoEuropean law usurps British law. That means the Article  deadline trumps the Benn Act.The Prime Ministerrsquos spokesman on Friday said it was ldquoa matter of fact that international law takes precedence over UK statute.ldquoWe are talking about international law because the agreement that Article  would be extended until October  was made at the level of an international agreement by the former prime minister, they said. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he will comply with the Benn Act but still take the UK out of the EU on October --Number  suggested the superiority of EU law would only apply should the  member states reject any further extension of the Brexit deadline.Responding to questions at a briefing with journalists, the spokesman said: ldquoAre you asking me thatthe EU refuse an extension then we leave on October   Because then the answer is yes ndash thatrsquos what is stated in international law.They added: ldquoWe will comply with the law, but we will be leaving on October .Downing Street also said it did not ldquorecognise fears flagged by Sir John Major that Boris Johnson could circumvent the Benn Act.The former Tory prime minister said an Order of Council, issued by ministers in the Privy Council, could avoid having to comply MPsrsquo demands by suspending its power before the deadline.A source at Number  went further, calling the idea ldquototal cobblers.copy -.

So when they retire the feeling of sadness is akin to a death in the family.John Humphrys of the Today programme was the irascible uncle, the kind who at dinner would be very likely to start an argument while grace was being said – but first thing in the morning his rigour and tenacity as he, metaphorically at least, pinned an evasive politician under the wheels of the radio van until the poor sap answered the question would set me up for the challenges of the day.: Jackie Bird reveals she has quit Reporting ScotlandFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereBut we in Scotland are soon to suffer a loss far more grave. When we bid farewell to this bitter and isive year Jackie Bird won’t be around to point the way towards a hopefully better . Stop all the clocks. Stop them around .pm on  December. Cancel Hogmanay!Bird has fronted BBC Scotland’s Auld Year’s Night shindig since back in the auld century. If Humphrys was the grumpy uncle then she was the whoop-it-up aunt in the sparkly dress, capable of embarrassing you in your teens with slobbery festive-season kisses, but who you’d eventually come to appreciate was a good laugh and crucial to every party.Well, the party’s over. Hogmanay Live is to be revamped – it will probably get a name-change – and won’t be hosted by Bird. Unlike Humphrys who has gone willingly and was granted a long goodbye last week and one final opportunity to rough up David Cameron, Bird had rather hoped to stay involved, despite having quit newsreading duties earlier this year. But she was only offered a ten-minute slot leading up to the bells in Edinburgh – “You’ll have had your black bun” as they sometimes say in the capital – and has declined. Now I can’t get out of my head the sad image of Bird trudging the streets on a broken heel, her carryout bag about to burst, as she peers up at tenements looking for a light in a window, flickering to the beat of Prince’s , the year she first presented Hogmanay Live. Oh, and she’s got Phil Cunningham and Aly Bain propping each other up behind her as it doesn’t look like the trusty duo will be part of the new-look show either.Maybe Bird hasn’t been your glass of warm prosecco these past  years. If that’s the case, then it’s typical of the complex relationship Scots have with Hogmanay. It’s summed up for me by memories of my mother looking out the Crabbie’s Green Ginger Wine in anticipation of first-footers on that specially Scottish night of nights – and at the same time my father bolting the door.Everything about Hogmanay is complex, including the black bun. It looks luxurious but after you’ve gorged on it you feel like you’ve swallowed a depth-charge. The idea of a gigantic party sounds great but before too long you’ll be stuck in a corner having zoned out of a conversation with a woman about schools – this is an Edinburgh party – but becoming more and more morose as you reflect on the year ending and the diddly-squat you’ve achieved during it.For a long time Scots liked being viewed as unofficial world champs at Hogmanay, partly because our dear friends in England seemed to struggle with the concept. But when that status became official and Edinburgh started hosting the biggest open-air rave-up on the planet some of us thought: “This isn’t us. This rampant exhibitionism, frolicking in the Firth of Forth and all that, isn’t Scottish. Let’s get back to drinking an estuary’s worth of beer in the privacy of our own parlours then sleeping off the hangover while everything’s shut for two whole days.”Putting Hogmanay on TV is certainly complex. As any film director will tell you, party scenes are tricky to pull off. The nightclub looks half-empty because not enough extras have been hired and when the party is in a house, actors can prove themselves surprisingly bad at dancing, though I suppose the glass heron figurines can be inhibiting. When the programme is live, the date is  December and the entertainment are pished, though, then you’re asking for trouble. There was one notorious show, Live into ’, where comedian Chic Murray “died” and actor John Grieve “corpsed” and a drunken reveller groped singer Maggie Moone mid-song. Actually there were quite a few notorious shows, presenting a portrait of Caledonia that we thought the rest of Britain and, by extension the world, wanted to see. BBC Scotland producer Iain MacFadyen was the master of these hoary heather ’n’ haggis-stuffed heuch-athons, earning him the nickname of the Ayatollah Hogmanay.To minimise risk Grampian used to drape country houses in tinsel and pre-record their New Year celebrations in August. But, you know, I reckon Bird could have coped with one of those Hogmanays from hell. I can see her smiling sweetly while Tennent’s Lager Lovelies cavort with men dressed as Lee’s macaroon bars and a flying caber knocks out the foremost authority on William McGonagall just as Simple Minds roar into a medley of their hits.Unfortunately I’m not going to see this. I’m not going to see Bird again on Auld Year’s Night and that’s a great pity. In a dignied farewell, she says she knows what’s in the re-styled show but won’t comment on it, simply wishing Beeb Scotland well with their new endeavour. Should the rest of us be worried  Perhaps. Much as I would like to be more like my mum, I fear I’m turning into my dad. Thus, not only will the door be bolted, I might have to switch off the TV as well.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"snp would back plan to install jeremy corbyn as temporary prime minister to halt no deal","story":"Nicola Sturgeon has admitted the SNP would back a plan to install Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister on a temporary basis in order to avoid a no-deal Brexit.Senior Nationalists are concerned there is now little time left to agree on a compromise candidate among opposition parties to replace Boris Johnson,the Tory leader was to be forced from office by a vote of no confidence in the Commons.The First Minister tweeted on Friday that she agrees with the idea of installing the Labour leader as PM through a vote of no confidence in the Conservative administration so he can secure a Brexit extension, before then calling an immediate general election.In response to a tweet making the suggestion, Ms Sturgeon said: “Agree with this. VONC [vote of no confidence], opposition unites around someone for sole purpose of securing an extension, and then immediate General Election.“Nothing is risk free but leaving Johnson in post to force through no deal - or even a bad deal - seems like a terrible idea to me.”Mr Johnson has maintained Britain will leave the EU on October , with or without a deal.Former Scots Tory leader Ruth Davidson said Labour would “happilly” hand the SNP a second independence referendum “on a plate” as the price of a deal.Earlier on Friday, a senior SNP source told ITV News: “It is increasingly clear that we will have to install a new prime minister via a vote of no confidence, so that we can request a delay to Brexit and hold an election,” a party source told“The convention is absolutely clear that it is the leader of the opposition - in this case Jeremy Corbyn - who should become prime minister in those circumstances.“Trying to find a compromise candidate, a national unity candidate, is too complicated, especially in the time we have. Whether people like it or not, the temporary prime minister has to be Corbyn.”: Boris Johnson slams ‘inadequacies’ of SNP record in powerThe source added that the other opposition parties, and the  independent MPs, would have to come round to backing Corbyn,they want to be certain of avoiding a no deal Brexit.Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson has repeatedly said she would not support any deal that saw Mr Corbyn become PM.Nicola Sturgeon has previously claimed her party would explore all options to ensure the UK did not crash out of the EU.“I’ve said all along we would work across the parties to try and put a coalition together in Westminster to preferably stop Brexit altogether, but absolutely to stop a no deal Brexit,” she said in August.“My view is the consequences of a no deal Brexit are so severe that we should be exploring all options and we shouldn’t be ruling anything out.”An SNP spokesman told The Scotsman: “The SNP has led the way in ensuring Brexit can be stopped and in bringing parliament back into action after the Tories sought to shut down UK democracy, and we will continue to work with all opposition MPs to stop a no deal Brexit and call a General Election to remove this dangerous and undemocratic Prime Minister as soon as possible.“It is now possible -the political will is there - that parties could come together to ensure that the letter to secure an extension is not left in the hands of Boris Johnson and his cronies, who are determined to find a way to get around the Benn Act, but is instead sent by a temporary caretaker prime minister, who would be in office only as long as is necessary to send the letter, with an election held immediately afterwards. We remain open to all options to achieve the aim of stopping a No Deal Brexit and getting rid of Boris Johnson.”Scots Tory MP Kirstene Hair said: “This report confirms what many have long suspected – SNP MPs will happily prop up Jeremy Corbyn in Number .“There is no doubt that Corbyn’s weak stance on indyref is a deciding factor for the Nationalists.“He has already left the door open for a re-run of the  referendumhe becomes Prime Minister.“Only a Conservative government will stand up for those who voted ‘No’ in what was meant to be a once in a generation event.”Ms Davidson said: Let’s take a guess at what the SNP’s price would be for installing Corbyn in NO  - and we know from John McDonnell that Labour would happily hand them indyref on a plate.”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad ","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable.

Gareth’s identity was revealed in a News Letter article and the story was picked up by This Morning who invited him and his we Kirsty to appear on the show this morning.Lea also appeared on the show along with her sister Shannon and niece Akeelah, who slept soundly throughout the interview. Gareth Bronte on This MorningIt was to be the first time the family had met Gareth and his we Kirsty in the flesh.It made for an emotional segment on the show as presenters Phil Scholfield and Holly Willoughby introduced the story which was captioned ‘A Random ‘Slice’ Of Birthday Kindness’. Lea explained to Phil and Holly how she had been spurred on by Gareth’s kindness to carry on the good gesture: “I know it wasn’t absolutely the same circumstances, but I just thought I wanted to do a good gesture for somebody  so I paid off the same amount that he’d paid off our cake onto someone ’s. It carries on the story as well.”Gareth and his we Kirsty, who live between Loughbrickland and Rathfriland on the outskirts of Banbridge, were then introduced.Lea Ni Bhriain on This MorningTheir daughter Hannah Stella Bronte was born prematurely on September ,  weighing just two pounds, five and half ounces. Their baby girl lost her brave fight for le after eight days in ICU.Gareth told the show: “In the lead up to what would have been Hannah’s birthday my we and I wanted to do something to mark it. Our little boy Caleb, who is four, came up with the idea of letting a helium balloon go so that it would make its way up to heaven. That was something we had planned.“I’d said to Kirsty I wanted to do something dferent, maybe a little random act of kindness to share a little joy.

We were contacted by the show on Sunday and the next morning we were on the This Morning sofa.“We had so much more we wanted to say but it was tight for time but so nice to continue to be able to talk about Hannah.

I did Educating Rita at the Lyric and it felt right to perform Shirley here as well.“I was waiting to get to that right age in my career and we went into rehearsals in May. There is something about Willy Russell’s work that relates to me and to Belfast I think the humour translates exactly the same. Both Rita and Shirley have similarities, they are characters who want more,” she said.The Fall and In The Line of Duty actress said the play still has resonance today despite being written more than  years ago.“For many generations women have been told their place. Here is a woman that says ‘well this is what I want and I want to do it dferently’.”Tara spoke of how she “couldn’t wait” to work with acclaimed Tinderbox Artistic Director Patrick J O’Reilly on the production.“I knew he would bring such physicality to the piece, I never wanted it to be me playing lots of dferent people, it has to be Shirley. Patrick’s take on plays is always a little bit to the left so I couldn’t wait to see how left he would go and boy did he go left,” she laughed.“Right from the off Patrick and set and lighting designer Paul Keogan wanted the set to symbolise many things. It opens in Shirley’s kitchen, it’s stark, it’s white, it’s almost asylum like. Shirley keeps it so clean so the symbolism of her writing ‘Greece’ in huge colourful letters on a pristine white kitchen is a really beautul concept that Patrick and Paul came up with.”She continued: “When Act Two opens and Shirley is in Greece, she hasn’t completely left her le behind, she’s only gone to Greece for a fortnight. Her surroundings have changed but there are remnants of her le back home still on the stage. Because you change scene doesn’t mean you have changed, that change has to come from you and I loved that premise.“At the end of the show, her husband Joe is coming over to see her and she is excited by that. Willy Russell doesn’t knowthey are getting back together but they are meeting up. The character of Shirley doesn’t blame Joe for anything that has happened – or didn’t happen in her le. They were both these hopeful people when they married and somewhere along the way le got in the way, everyone in a couple can relate to that.”The former St Genevieve’s High School student does not wear a mic during performances, which helps herbe “intimate with the whole theatre”.“The character of Shirley is a gt, I always knew she was and I think there’s a Shirley in everyone. People seem to instantly connect and understand her and that make it really lovely because then it’s just a conversation I’m having with  people a night. It’s a conversation about le, the script is poignant, it’s sad but ultimately uplting for everyone.”Shirley Valentine runs at The Lyric Theatre until October .

Find out when the exams are and get the advice that the schools give out, but don’t waste your energy following rumours about what the grade is. It’s better to spend your time helping your child.It’s always worth practising. Whatever schools say, it’s worth it. Children can improve their performance by  -% by careful practice.Start earlyyou can, but don’t worryyou haven’t. Ideally it is best to start preparation for the Transfer Test exam at least one year ahead. However, don’t panicyou don’t have that much time even a few weeks can make a dference.Make a simple action plan. However long you’ve got, have a clear, simple strategy. There are two key principles: . Start from your child’s present level of knowledge. . Help your child to learn from their mistakes.Motivation, motivation, motivation! You have to take your child with you on this journey. A simple rewards system can be highly effective.Don’t just practice. There’s a tendency to think that just practising one test after anther will do the trick. It’s far more important to learn from mistakes. Going through the test afterwards with your child and filling in the the gaps in learning is crucial.Stay calm, manage stress, build confidence. Don’t talk about the Transfer test all the time. Use breaks, treats and bite-sized learning sessions to keep things fresh. Be realistic about your child’s potential. Pass or fail, it’s important to try to make this process a positive one.Manage the exam day. Make sure that you have everything ready for the day, that your child tries to get a good night’s sleep, eats breakfast and gets there in good time.How and when to use our testsIt’s best to use them as real exam practice. These tests are mock exams. They are set out in a style as close as possible to the real thing – though the format will y from year to year. It is best to use them as authentic exam experience rather than for general practice. Follow the instructions and advice in the sections before starting the test.What a score means and how to boost itIt is unfortunately impossible to say that a certain score can guarantee a pass in the actual exams. However, we suggest that a score of % would be a standard to aim at. It is important not to present this to your child as a concrete benchmark though, as the best motivator for them is to see the scores going up. Here are some tried and tested tips for improvement.Go over any incorrect answers. Always go over incorrect answers so that your child can see what went wrong. To help with this process, some of our harder Maths questions are explained.Use an action planner inside. This will provide a plan for what to do next when a test has been marked.Improve basic exam technique. Work on improving speed, working efficiently – coming back to trickier questions later – and pacing within the time limit.Improve general English skills. Ensure the foundations are strong enough. Use a range of checklists to help reinforce your child’s English skills.Target what is not fully understood. The secret is not to keep blindly practising but to target the areas of English Maths that your child is weakest in. This is where crucial marks can be picked up.Once your child has completed the papers you can download the corresponding answer sheets here:Answer sheets: Monday rd SeptemberAnswer sheets: Tuesday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Wednesday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Thursday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Friday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Saturday th SeptemberIf you would like to access the answer sheets for the transfer test practice papers from April May , you can access them here.Answer sheets: Monday th AprilAnswer sheets: Tuesday th AprilAnswer sheets: Wednesday st MayAnswer sheets: Thursday nd MayAnswer sheets: Friday rd MayAnswer sheets: Saturday th May"},{"url":null,"title":"28k for woman sacked by northern ireland firm for","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I was very worried that the stress could cause complications or even a miscarriage.\"We were in a very bad situation for a time and it is a great relief to me to have this all finished.\"Ms Gruzdaites case was supported by the Equality Commission. She added: \"I am very grateful to the Equality Commission for helping me.\"No woman should lose her job because she is pregnant and it is important that women challenge such treatment.\"Ms Gruzdaite and her husband Andrius Jasinevicius started work at McGrane Nurseries Ltd, a wholesale suppliers of plants, in January , and were given a blank contract to sign with no start or end dates.She believed she was coming to Northern Ireland for a permanent job but at no point was she told it was to be a seasonal job.When she announced her pregnancy and showed the appointment letter for her first antenatal appointment to one of her managers on September , , he forgot to tell the other manager about it.Ms Gruzdaite was called to a meeting on September  with both managers to explain why she had not been at work.She also told a manager on October  about a later scan appointment on October , and she was called in to a meeting about her absence on October .The tribunal found that she was unjustiably questioned about her absence on September  and October  when she had told her manager that she was off for antenatal appointments.The employer accepted that they failed to pay Ms Gruzdaite for her time off attending the antenatal appointments.The tribunal found that a manager was less friendly to Ms Gruzdaite after she announced her pregnancy.On October , while she and her husband were at that antenatal appointment, their employers held a meeting at which a group of seasonal workers were given one weeks notice of termination.The couple were subsequently called in to meet with their employers on October  and were informed of their dismissal.Other seasonal workers were kept on by the employer and carried out the duties previously performed by Laura.On that day, her manager said to her: \"You will need more days off for your pregnancy doctors appointment... you already skipped work on Wednesday when you had your ultrasound scan.\"At tribunal, Ms Gruzdaite said: \"On that day I got very upset because both of our contracts had been terminated.\"We were waiting for our child to come into this world but both of us were unemployed and had no additional income.\"When I ed to my place of work following this conversation, I felt nauseous, my hands were shaking, and I felt a dull pain and a stretching sensation in my stomach.\"The tribunal concluded the decision to terminate Ms Gruzdaites contract was tainted by discrimination in that it was connected to her pregnancy.Her dismissal was both unfair and an act of unlawful discrimination, it ruled.Dr Michael Wardlow, the chief commissioner of the Equality Commission, said around a quarter of all the complaints of discrimination made to its advice line each year are to do with sex discrimination.Of those, consistently the largest number, around % of the total, are about pregnancy and maternity discrimination.Mr Wardlow said: \"It is dispiriting that we are at tribunal once again supporting another case of pregnancy discrimination.\"Im afraid this is still all too common and, in spite of the legislation being in place for more than  years, some employers still seem to be unaware of the law and the consequences of breaching it.\"Laura Gruzdaite was  weeks pregnant at the time she and her husband were dismissed.\"They had arrived in Northern Ireland ready and willing to work and have started to make their le here.\"Lauras husband has since found other work and she is caring for their baby.\"A spokesperson for McGrane Nurseries said: \"We acknowledge the findings of the Equality Commission.\"We have engaged the services of a professional HR company who are assisting us in implementing a series of policies and practices to ensure we meet the highest standards in relation to the issues highlighted in the judgment of this case.\"This situation should never have occurred. We apologise to Laura for the upset caused to both her and her family and hope that this ruling will allow them to move forward.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38538473.ece/e76dc/BINARY/lia%20Cruise%20Ship%206.jpg","title":"belfasts biggest visitor megaship msc meraviglia thats the weight of four titanics","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Tragically, Dessie was killed in a car crash in .“Dessie was the best of us. Him and Brendan were the two runners. Dessie was a great runner at school and then at Sparta where he was captain. He was a very popular fella.“As well as being a great runner he was a great captain. He looked after his charges very well.“Brendan and his we both ran for Northern Ireland and were both very good athletes. Dessie ran shorter distances whereas Brendan ran anything from km right through to the marathon.”Harry was somewhat of a late starter when it came to running, his brothers talked him into it at a time he was overweight in the early s. About a year later he competed in his first marathon in Dublin.He was one of the founding members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club in . At the time they were told it wouldn’t survive six months, but  years later it now has approximately  members.It is an “all ability club” with dferent groups meeting weekly at Templemore Sports Complex and in the Waterside. “Anybody who wants to run will get the opportunity butyou don’t want to compete you can join to keep fit. We like people to compete but don’t put anyone under pressure to do so.”“I, to be perfectly frank, wasn’t brought in for my athletic expertise, I’m not saying I was useless but would’ve been average, but that fits into the ethos of the club.”Personal bestDespite his modesty, Harry has run impressive times over the years, recording a sub--hour marathon in Belfast. That is no mean feat, it requires dedicated training, and, on the day you have to run an average of around : per mile across the . mile course.Harry recalled his brother Dessie spurring him on as he neared the finish line that day, sadly, it would be the last time he saw him alive.“It was the st of May  and Dessie was killed ten days later on the th. I hadn’t enough long runs coming into it and at the latter stages I was absolutely out of it, really struggling.“Dessie was there at the  mile mark and, in Belfast I don’t know anybody, but I heard this voice shouting ‘Harry, get your head up out of your chest! You’ve come through  mile in : you can break  hours but you’re going to have to work for it’.“It just gave me enough encouragement to keep going. He came round to see me at the finish line. “He had just moved to Belfast and wanted me to see his new house but I had come with a crowd of boys on a train and said I’d be up in a couple of weeks to spend the weekend, to do a bit of running and play some snooker.“But he was killed ten days later.”Marty Gallaghergoogletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshTwenty years later, Marty Gallagher, a young prodigy of Harry’s, was killed in similarly tragic circumstances.Next month fty members of Foyle Valley will take part in this year’s Dublin marathon in memory of Marty who died after being hit by a car on the Racecourse Road while ing home on Halloween night.Martin was -years-old and it will be his th anniversary this year.Reflecting, Harry said: “Marty Gallagher was a lovely young fella, very modest, unassuming, and comes from such a nice family.“He was a member of the club and would’ve been one of my prodigies when he first came into running, I would’ve nurtured him, but then he got to the stage where he was too quick for me and I couldn’t stay with him. I’d have needed a bike to keep up with him.”Harry has been fortunate to avoid serious injury over the years aside from breaking his ankle in . Doctors warned that without an operation he would have chronic arthritis and would never run again.“You learn to live with the fact that on the long runs you’re going to be in pain. I was lucky to get away with running the Derry marathon this year.”After a more recent x-ray, a doctor warned thathe continued at his present rate he would need a new ankle.“I wear an ankle support and patella support, but you’re not going to let stuff like that stop you,” he added.CamaraderieSpecial club memories include a time when members competed in the All Ireland Marathon Championship in Mallow Co. Cork, in . They won the senior marathon and veteran’s championships.As winners they had the honour of hosting the competition in Derry the following year. It was a very successful event which stands out as one of the clubs highlights.Harry finished second in the veterans team and his brother Brendan competed well in the senior team.Looking back at other fond memories, Harry cited the Walled City Marathon in , which was the first marathon to be held in Derry for many years.“I thoroughly enjoyed it, along with the London marathon, I’ve done four of them, and the Great North Run, which I’ve done twice.“But the club itself, the camaraderie is just unbelievable. It’s a social outlet more than anything . In terms of the people, not just at Foyle Valley but running in general, there are very few people I’ve met through running that I could say I didn’t like, they’re all good hearted, good natured people, and help you in any way they can. They’re gracious in defeat and generous in victory.“Foyle Valley has a great family atmosphere,someone is training for a marathon they will always train with you and help you through. That’s part of the ethos of the club.”Fitness has become an essential component of many people’s lives as experts regularly expound on the benefits to both physical and mental health.Therefore, the emergence of new clubs, and the introduction of couch to k runs, has been “one of the best” things to happen in the city in Harry’s view. “The people behind these clubs love their running and are so friendly. They got people out who never would’ve necessarily been interested in running, and now they’re doing half marathons and marathons - that’s fabulous.”"},{"url":null,"title":"derry public invited quiz karaoke holywell trust support honesty cafe","story":"The Derry public have been invited to a quiz and karaoke night in support of the Holywell Trusts Honesty Cafe this Friday night, September .The cafe, which is the first initiative of its kind in Derry,  allows people to pay what they can.  It has been warmly welcomed by locals for its inclusive ethos and has been running successfully for three months.It is based in the Holywell building on Bishop Street but people can also enjoy their lunch in the Garden of Reflection.There is no till but instead three honesty boxes so people can pay whatever they decide its worth or contribute what they can afford.  If they have no cash they can donate online on our website.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshWith many people in poverty who have to make use of food banks it is a positive scheme which relies on public generosity and kind-heartedness - something Derry people are known to possess in abundance.Customers are able pay it forward so that someone in greater need can eat for less or for freeneeds be.Antoin OHara who frequents the cafe has organised the fundraising event and would urge people to come along and donate what they can.The event begins at pm and people can bring their own refreshments."},{"url":null,"title":"global climate strike wonderful thing see new generation rise","story":"Young people took to the streets of Derry over the weekend to demand action against climate change.Hundreds of Derry students left school on Friday as part of a global climate strike to sound the alarm about what is widely viewed as an “environmental emergency”.And again on Saturday, young people were at the centre of the Our Earth Our Future March, Rally and Gathering which retraced the original civil rights route from the Waterside to the Guildhall.At Friday’s climate strike, one organiser, Rois Hutton, told the crowd they must target political parties and people with influence to insist upon \"radical quick changes\" so that \"we can ensure the survival of the human race.”Another of those behind the strike action, Emma Farren, said that this strike dfered from those held on previous occasions because adults had taken a stand alongside the youth of the city.She urged those in attendance to continue to stand with them to bring about meaningful change.Their actions prompted veteran civil rights activist, Eamonn McCann, to declare on Saturday that in all his years of campaigning he has never been more \"hopeful\".\"What made me hopeful is the composition of the marches. The median age is under . Its a wonderful thing to see a new generation rise up and the first in my letime that % of marchers were women.\"I would put all my trust in the young women of Ireland to make a dference.

It read: “YOU ARE NOW ENTERING EXTINCTION ”, and encouraged people to join the environmental movement.By Saturday that message had been defaced by someone who scrawled \"globalist agenda\" underneath.The catalyst for the environmental movement is fteen-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg. Last year she protested for more than a month prior to Swedens parliamentary elections by sitting alone on the steps of the parliament building in Stockholm.Following the elections she spent Fridays there demanding the government undertake a radical response to climate change.She has since inspired a mass movement supported by people, young and old, around the world.On Saturday Derry people continued to champion her cause by carrying placards reading, The Sea is Rising and so are We and We Need to Change the Politics not the Climate.Linda O Sullivan of Friends of the Earth told an audience gathered in the Guildhall that we are facing an \"existential crisis\" and people \"need to be held accountable\".And Paddy Nash, musician and environmentalist, sang a song inspired by the Save Our Sperrins campaign against gold mining.

Starring alongside Chris in the film were André Hollandand Natalie Martinez .Scottish-born Chrismoved to Magherafelt in , where he worked as a personal trainer. He said that his acting career really began when the opportunity arose to work as an extra on Game of Thrones.As well as appearing as a member of the Nights Watch in three seasons of the show, hes also featured in Superman drama Krypton and filmed sword-fighting scenes for the film Viking Destiny, which is available on Netflix.He first heard about the Jurassic World role when a friend tagged him on Facebook in a post from Louise Kiely Casting, which gave away very few details about the role.“They were looking for a biker with a flawless American accent. I just thought Id go for it and see what happens,” he said.Chris said that when it came to the day of the audition in Dublin he was “sweating bullets” and almost didnt go through with it.“Just as I was walking up to the door, I sort of freaked out. I went past it and I said to myself I cant do this just because of the nerves, because I wanted it so badly,” he said.“Then I was thinking to myself, youve come this far, you need to do this. I genuinely thought I didnt stand a chance as I knew Id be up against actors with more experience.”“I went and got myself two pints of Guinness, settled my nerves and went back. I was happy when I came out and thought Id done well but I thought it would just be good experience and that I wasnt going to get it.”A few weeks later the casting agent emailed Chris to let him know that the role was his, but he still didnt know exactly what he had been cast in.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I thought it was probably some low-budget thing, but I was happy to get the experience and a few lines. To me, that would be a start at least.”Chris found a few clues about the production by looking up Jurassic World  director Colin Trevorrow on IMDB, but it was only at a costume fitting that he fully realised how big an opportunity he had been given.“They werent even allowed to say it but it was so secret,” he said.“One of the girls said to me that all they tell could me was that it rhymes with schminosaurs and I just knew. I was just blown away because Ive always loved Jurassic Park.”The eight-minute film was filmed in January in Co Wicklow, which means that Chris is happy to finally be able to talk about the role hes had to keep under wraps for months.“The weirdest thing is just seeing my name in the credits. Thats one of the most surreal things,” he said.Chris said that he hopes to find an agent in the near future to help him land more roles. He believes that a talent for accents hes developed from a young age can help him secure some great parts.“Accents have always been something that comes naturally to me. Even when I was only about four or five years old, I would talk to myself in the mirror and try out lots of dferent accents.”This skill came in handy when Chris played redneck biker Greg with an American accent so accurate that the production crew assumed it was his regular speaking voice.“Most of the crew on the set thought I was an American actor,” Chris said.“It wasnt until Id done my first scene and I asked someone what time it was, that they realised I wasnt an American. They couldnt believe it when I said Id just came down from Magherafelt.”"},{"url":null,"title":"mayor renews call back supporting people programme frontline workers","story":"The Mayor of Derry and

provide housing related support services, help people affected by domestic violence, those with addictions, families with child protection concerns, people in need of benefit advice and more.Earlier this year the local council unanimously backed a motion which recognised the work of frontline workers and called for an independent review into the programme, including terms and conditions of its

employers involved to review their practices and fully acknowledge the value of the staff delivering these much needed specialist services.\"Niall McCarroll, UNISON community branch chairperson said the Supporting People Campaign presented \"damning evidence\" to Derry City and Strabane District Councils Health and Community Committee.It detailed the outworkings of outsourced public contracts and the growing crisis within the Department for Communities and NIHE funded Supporting People Programme - \"a crisis which is impeding service delivery for vulnerable people and denying frontline workers the right to social justice.\"With specic reference to supported living workplaces, he said, the reality of outsourcing within the community sector is that some employers, unchallenged, choose not to value their frontline workers whilst garnishing a select few, who they deem worthy.\"The transfer of public services has many beneficiaries, however working class people are not included but rather excluded from benefiting from an honest days work.\"UNISON Community Branch activists are working hard and are committed to building a community wide culture of solidarity with regards the Supporting People Campaign and now with the direct involvement and support of the Mayor this solidarity focused campaign has become more dynamic and influential.\"The UNISON led Save the Foyle Haven Campaign began with the workers getting organised, the wider community mobilising in support and finally DCSDC joined the campaign through the office of the Mayor and collectively the workers driven movement protected jobs and a much valued and needed service.\"He continued: \"These are the fundamentals of any trade union movement campaigning formula, a blueprint for equality, integrity and the downfall of self serving governance.\"On behalf of our branch membership a UNISON delegation will now meet with the Mayor to deliver a list of human rights based questions, for both employers and all relevant statutory bodies to provide answers.\"The employers and statutory agencies will now be called in front of the DCSDC Health and Community Committee to engage in the UNISON led Supporting People Campaign as we focus on protecting the Supporting People programme and safeguarding frontline workers against corporate greed and those not fit for purpose employers who operate within this sector.\"The right of everyone to the enjoyment of just and favourable conditions of work is recognised in the United Nations International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, its time this same right was honoured and upheld within the Supporting People programme.\"UNISON would like to thank the DCSDC Health and Community Committee for the genuine support offered following the UNISON presentation to council and we look forward to working closely with them in the future.\"googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot

medical school and concerns raised by David Sterling around the need for ongoing funding which UU is not prepared to invest   A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"Following cross-party political and health and social care support in  for Ulster University’s Graduate Entry Medical School, the University has continued to proactively develop the project, working closely with the Department and other relevant partners. Our responses to any remaining clarications within the Graduate Entry Medical School business case were submitted to the Department of Health at the start of July, following prompt and close engagement with the Department and other relevant partners. Our proposed first academic year of projected enrolments outlined within the updated business case is  .“As the Department of Health has previously confirmed that any decision on funding can only be made by Ministers, the University is not actively recruiting medical students as yet for  entry until that decision on funding can be reached.· If funding was confirmed, all other elements of the proposal for our medical undergraduate degree programme have been firmly on track including continued progress with the GMC, clinical placement opportunities and the development of a curriculum to meet the needs of healthcare locally.“We value the continued support of all those who share our vision for medical education and we continue to work with the General Medical Council, St George’s University of London and local clinicians and partners building on our existing leadership in medical and healthcare provision to take forward graduate entry medical education for Northern Ireland.\"What does UU say in response to local councillors representatives who have claimed that UU has neglected the Magee campus for decades and should not be given money as part of the City Deal but should instead invest its own money in Derry   A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"Ulster University continues to invest in the Magee campus, most recently with the state-of-the-art £m teaching block which signals our ambition for higher education in the city, already enhancing campus le and paving the way for enhanced future capacity at Magee.    This and other investment priorities for students have resulted in a very strong performance for the Magee campus across all elements of the  National Student Survey, reflecting the very positive reaction from our students to these recent investments in University le at Magee.  With all four faculties of the University represented on the Magee campus – across health sciences, arts and humanities, business and computing and engineering, we are pushing boundaries and breaking new ground in emerging sectors as a progressive university, shortlisted for the prestigious Times Higher Education University of the Year Award, .“Our contribution to the City Deal opportunity is a signicant step forward in our collective opportunity to realise the full ambitions of this vibrant university city.  Our City Deals proposal will see us apply our expertise to help maximize the city’s potential in this unparalleled opportunity to boost economic growth and prosperity.  In our continued collaboration with industry partners, we look forward to driving innovation in personalised medicine, cognitive analytics, robotics and automation, leading to both new research posts and learning opportunities for additional students.  The proposed riverfront innovation hub will build upon the expertise of our first data analytics Institute, opened in  and headquartered at Magee campus, and which cemented our reputation as a global leader in this field. Also integral to the City Deal remains our commitment to establishing a Graduate Entry Medical School in a bid to address the challenges of a healthcare system at breaking point.   City Deal recognises the crucial role our University can play as an economic engine in the North West and is a major boost to the collective ambitions of the city and region.  We look forward to the development of our projects in partnership with industry, civic and educational partners.\"How much money will be needed in total to fund the projects put forward as part of the City Deal A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"The funding contributions by project across City Deal and the Inclusive Futures Funds are indicative at this stage, based on the allocations provided by Council, and subject to adjustment as we go forward.  Our contribution of % University funding to the Magee projects within City Deal reflects our belief in the impact they will make, and our commitment to playing our part in the collective ambitions of City Deal.“City Deal enables us to build further on our academic strengths that are signicant for the region’s growth, and to make sure that this expertise across world class research and progressive student learning works hard for the benefit of all in the city region. The City Deal bid has education, innovation, job creation and skills development at its core and each of these priorities are also central to our work across both teaching and research.  We are therefore a natural fit and a committed partner in this ambitious bid.  A continued collaborative approach is essential as we prepare to take forward the projects through planning and design and development of the business cases.”"},{"url":null,"title":"top welsh chefs serve treat high sheriffs charity gala dinner","story":"Nick Davies and pastry chef Will Richards giving a cooking demonstration at the ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtRoyal Welsh Show thiltspan classtruncate-full-screengts summer.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Top Welsh chefs to serve up a treat for High Sherf’s Charity Gala DinnerNick Davies and pastry chef Will Richards giving a cooking demonstration at the ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtRoyal Welsh Show thiltspan classtruncate-full-screengts summer.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"top welsh chefs serve treat high sheriffs charity gala dinner","story":"Nick Davies and pastry chef Will Richards giving a cooking demonstration at the ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtRoyal Welsh Show thiltspan classtruncate-full-screengts summer.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Top Welsh chefs to serve up a treat for High Sherf’s Charity Gala DinnerNick Davies and pastry chef Will Richards giving a cooking demonstration at the ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtRoyal Welsh Show thiltspan classtruncate-full-screengts summer.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"newtown pupils join global quot climate strike quot day","story":"Climate Strike at the Town Hall Grounds Newtown organised by Jasmine Jones, Rubyltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgt White and Lyssie Jaltspan classtruncate-full-screengtrvis last Friday th September..Pictured left to right, Kylie DaviesSophie WeaverRuby White, Lyssie Jarvisalt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Newtown pupils join global Climate Strike dayClimate Strike at the Town Hall Grounds Newtown organised by Jasmine Jones, Rubyltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgt White and Lyssie Jaltspan classtruncate-full-screengtrvis last Friday th September..Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"pump track wales uks largest split track opens rhayader","story":"Kirsty Williams AM tries her hand on one of the bicycles following the opening oltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtf the Wales Pump Traltspan classtruncate-full-screengtck together with some of the cycling enthusiasts present.

By comparison, the plaintf has been estimated in the recent past to have a turnover of poundm and is the third largest snack manufacturer in the UK, the lawyer said.Mr Morgan claimed that a public judgment against the defendant would be more valuable to the crisps company than a prolonged investigation into what profits Candy Plus made from selling Irish Tayto.He also disclosed that his client was willing to make a pound payment as part of any settlement.However, the court heard it was being wrongly portrayed as a ldquoDavid and Goliath case.Mr Hopkins challenged the lack of evidence to back assertions Mr Ferris only made pound profit from the trademark infringement.Entering judgment for Tayto Northern Ireland, Mr Justice Huddleston said: ldquoI fully accept this case is not at the higher end of the scale of either culpability or breach, but nonetheless itrsquos a breach and for that consequences do follow.Awarding costs to the company and remitting the case to a High Court master for further financial examinations, Mr Justice Huddleston added: ldquoUntil therersquos an assessment of damages or an account of profits we are at a loss..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th September 2019 Doors.jpg","title":"Doors to close at primary school  ","story":"THE death knell has been sounded for Castlewellan Primary School.The beleaguered school, which currently has only eight pupils, will close by the end of August next year at the earliest.The Education Authority yesterday sent out letters announcing that it had approved a proposal to close the school along with its Moderate Learning Dficulty class.There will now be a two-month period for objectors to make their views known, after which a final decision will be taken.School principal Niall McLean said yesterday: ldquoIt is highly regrettable that it has come to this, but we have to face reality.The school, which has been in existence for  years, has been experiencing falling enrolment numbers for several years.The school has capacity for  pupils and of the eight children currently on the register, six are in the Moderate Learning Dficulty class and two in the P-P class.

In addition, the foundations of the old blast wall at the former PSNI base posed construction issues for contractors.Cllr Curran said that while the Irish Street scheme was ldquobeset by problems and delays it was important to look forward.ldquoA lot of water has passed under the bridge since a one-way traffic system was introduced in Irish Street at the start of the year. While a number of factors delayed the project, it is important that work on the resurfacing scheme is now completed, he continued.ldquoIrish Street offers so much potential, both for the businesses located there and people who live at this very historic part of the town. The street has been transformed as a result of signicant investment which was long overdue.Cllr Curran said a new group was formed in July to oversee a pound, scheme to help revitalise shop fronts at Irish Street, with the so-called lsquorevitalisation fundingrsquo provided by the Department for Communities and local authority to help business owners improve the fronts of their respective properties.A working group to steer the project forward has been formed, with traders encouraged to come up with schemes to improve shop fronts.Cllr Curran added: ldquoThis is a timely initiative given what the Irish Street traders had to endure for the first six months of the year. It is also important that whatever schemes come forward that the character of this part of the town is retained.ldquoThere are also plans for an ambitious multi-million pound regeneration initiative via the redevelopment of the townrsquos former police base and a number of adjacent empty buildings. This means that the spotlight will be on Irish Street for the foreseeable future.As part of the planned commercial development, the townrsquos former police base, which enjoys protected status, could be utilised as an attractive entrance feature.Local council officials say they are excited at the development potential the Irish Street site offers and want to maximise its development opportunity..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th September 2019 Saintfield.jpg","title":"Saintfield’s recent run ended by Rosemount  ","story":"SAINTFIELD United ed to Pigeon Hill on Saturday looking to make it three league wins in a row, but it wasnrsquot to be as Rosemount Rec where eventually able to leave with the spoils.The Saints started the game brightly and in the opening minutes created a few opportunities, but against the run of play Rosemount took the lead when their number nine cut in from the left and found the bottom corner.From then on, Rosemount started to dominate possession and they found a second when a long-range effort found the bottom corner.

Wins over Tullylish, Teconnaught and Ballymartin has propelled them into the last four.The only blot on their landscape was a defeat to Ballymartin, but they avenged that loss later in the competition. However, they have not faced any side as good as Darragh yet and Jody McGovern, Jack Haughey, Niall Rafferty, Conor Donnelly and Kevin Hegarty will have to be at their best and then somethey are to get the better of Darragh.Glenn, seen as many punditsrsquo favourites to win the competition, then take on St Johnrsquos in what promises to be another close encounter.Glenn may not have made the impact on Division  as they would have liked, but they have been impressive in championship outings against Liatroimand Saul, winning all three games in style.St Johnrsquos have been as equally impressive and wins over Annaclone, Drumgath and Teconnaught have taken them to the brink of a final.The Johnnies will again rely on the firepower of John Clarke, Marty Keenan, Danny and Chris McKay and Conor Morgan to get them over the line, but they must beware the attacking abilities of Mattie Bagnall, Denis Murtagh, Jarlath McConaghy, Jack McCartan and Patrick Brooks.The top clash of the weekend at Pairc Esler on Saturday night then takes centre stage with Clonduff out to ruinrsquos Kilcoorsquos double bid.Kilcoo, who are sitting pretty at the top of Division , look certain to regain their ACFL crown, but nothing less than winning the Frank OrsquoHare Cup will do a hungry Magpies camp.However, you have to admire Kilcoorsquos resilience and fortitude.

Kim Kelly started drinking when she was  or  and ‘‘regularly drank from about ’’. Singer Daire OHagan has never drank alcohol‘‘I grew up in Portrush where it was much easier to drink. I would never have gone out sober. Nobody did,’’ said the -year-old magazine editor. ‘‘All through university and working in Dublin and London, where I was a showbiz journalist for The Sun newspaper, I lived a very boozy lestyle. I was a real Champagne Charlie.’’.ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button But earlier this year, the mum-of-one decided to do a ‘Dry January’, where drinkers pledge to start the new year alcohol-free, and it has just continued.‘I got drunk on Christmas Day, I was drinking all New Year and then when it came to New Year’s Day I decided that was enough, it stops now and it did.’’Kim hasn’t had a drink since then and describes it as a ‘le-changing experience’. ‘‘I didn’t have a troubled relationship with alcohol, but I decided I didn’t want to drink anymore.‘‘Because of my job, I would go out to a lot of parties. Every single night was champagne and I constantly felt under par. ‘‘I didn’t have a problem with drink, but I don’t have much of a tolerance for drink. I can’t drink a lot, it leaves me feeling terrible, although I loved it obviously.’’ Kim said that for years she would stop drinking for a month, but could never manage longer than this. ‘‘All my friends drink and I am very sociable. I love to go out, I love to party, I love to cook and I love to sit in the house and drink wine - I was one of those typical ‘Prosecco ‘o’ Clock’ people- I was the cliche. ‘‘And then waking up the next morning, not madly hungover but under par, chasing my tail. And then there were the big binges, where every now and again I would go out for a birthday or something and I would spend the whole next day in bed just feeling sick and dying with the guilt and embarrassment.

I used to sometimes take a little sleep pill at night, I don’t do any of that now.’’‘‘My eyes are really bright and sparkly - I even notice it. ‘‘My skin was always ok, but, it definitely looks better.’’‘‘At first I put on weight because I was eating sweets and treating myself. I know lots of people say they lost weight when they stopped drinking, but I was the other way. I was so unhealthy I would have replaced meals with wine.’’And for those worried about how they would cope drink-free in social situations, Kim is unequivocal. ‘‘I’ve been to weddings, I’ve had my birthday - all can be done sober. I’ve been to social events for work, like the races, sober and it doesn’t make any dference. ‘‘I think I first noticed it when I was at a dinner dance with my son and I was sitting round a table of  and we got up and we danced and I danced sober - it was a revelation and so liberating.’’According to her Dry January app Kim is on day  of not drinking,has saved , calories and £. ‘‘Everything is easier whenever you don’t drink. You can go out for a meal and not have to worry about taxis.‘‘You feel brighter, that fogginess goes, and the bad decisions go.‘‘I feel I have more patience and I am more present for my son, who is , ‘‘Now, I don’t know when I would find the time to drink - I don’t think I could fit it into my day, whereas I used to be able to fit it in rightly.’’ Kim really doesn’t think she’ll drink again. ‘‘I’ve now gone off the taste. Whenever I smell wine, it just turns me.‘‘I have never met anybody who is better drunk, includingmyself. Drinking is really unhealthynothing tastes quite as good as feeling smug on a Sunday morning.’’Drinking is shot through Northern Irish le like, well, shots in a pub -but over the past decade, that culture has shted.It has certainly been dficult to avoid the news that alcohol isn’t good for you.Overdo it, and you are at greater risk of stroke, fatal aneurysm, heart failure and early death. Then there’s the cancer risk. But recent trends suggest the message seems to be getting through to millennialsand the later Generation Z , with increasing numbers calling time on drinking. According to a ONS study, more than a quarter of - to -year-olds are teetotal, with just one in  seeing drinking as cool. There have been all sorts of schemes and campaigns designed to curb our enthusiasm for drinking. There’s the DOE’s anti-drink drive advertisements, Dry January, Go Sober for October and a plethora of apps and websites. And then there are some young people, like Daire O’Hagan, who have never felt the desire to drink. The -year-old singer and musician from Clonoe, Co Tyrone, said he never had an interest in alcohol. ‘‘I had two grandparents that never drank so they had quite a big influence on me. Because I was always into other stuff, like music, I never saw the appeal of drinking. I can have a good time without needing alcohol.’’Daire, who has just started his first year of university at Jordanstown, studying Finance, says all his friends drink,. ‘‘I suppose nowadays there aren’t many people my age who don’t drink. I’m living in Belfast this year, in the Holylands, so you can imagine what that’s like.’’But he said he ever feel like the odd one out.‘‘Not really. I suppose at the start they probably thought it was a bit strange that somebody doesn’t drink, but they just accept it now that I don’t need it and can have a good time without it. And, of course, there’s the obvious benefit for his friends in that Daire is the designated driver.‘‘I’m always therethey need a lt. I’m always the taxi man - I like to have the keys in my hand, just to be safe, so I’m never stuck.’’He added: ‘‘I don’t really like the thought of losing control - I see plenty of people like that round Belfast and the thought of that puts me off. I like to have my wits about me at all times. And it’s just such a waste of money I don’t understand how a student, especially, could afford it.’’Daire believes he will be able to get through his time at uni without drinking.‘‘I do have good will power and it’s never interested me, so, yes, I do.’’try catch  TrendingThis Wrightbus worker didnt hold back when asked how he felt about the firm going into administrationHeartbreaking tributes paid

He said: “He was a fine fella. One of the best I ever met. We got on very well.”Ryan had been a Catholic missionary in east Africa but was back in Ireland working as a parish priest when the Troubles began at the end of the s.He said that he financially contributed “as much help as I could – some of it out of the mission boxes – to the situation up north” and then was “approached by some of the IRA leaders down here [to ask]perchance I could work for them permanently. They asked me to travel the world and try to get help for them.”Ryan eventually fell out with the church and left the Pallottine order in .That year he was instrumental in securing a five-tonne shipment of weaponry from Tripoli but it was intercepted before arriving in Ireland. He said that the original plan had been for a -tonne shipment but that at the last minute the load had been slashed by the Libyan authorities for reasons which were never explained to him.\"  \"  Supreme Court rules Boris Johnsons decision to prorogue parliament unlawful\"  \"  Jeff Dudgeon: If even Sir Anthony Hart’s inquiry into Kincora, the most rigorous yet, is not believed then we’re in a world of conspiracy theories Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"It was Ryan who realised that a gadget used in continental Europe to remind drivers toto their cars before their parking tickets ran out could be used as timers in bombs.Hundreds of the Memopark timers were bought by the former priest on the continent and sent to the UK or Ireland for IRA use.The fragments of a Memopark timer was recovered from the rubble of the Brighton Hotel bombing which almost killed Margaret Thatcher in  and did kill five others, as well as injuring more than , some very seriously.In a declassied government document, Margaret Thatcher was shown to have described Ryan as “a very dangerous man” who had “an expert knowledge of bombing” and had been the key conduit between the IRA and Libya for over a decade.When Mrs Thatcher’s accusations were put to him and he was askedhe was involved in any of those incidents, he said: “I would say most of them one way or another, I had a hand in most of them. Yes, she was right.”Askedshe was right to link him to bombs such as Hyde Park and Brighton, he said: “Absolutely – %. Oh yes.”When askedhe had any regrets, he said: “Oh, I have, yes. Big regrets. Of what nature  I regret that I wasn’t even more effective. Oh yes absolutely. I’d like to have been even more effective than I actually was.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen. Myself and others had been feeling quite down because climate change is scary, we are worried about our childrenrsquos futures. Lets hope this walk leads to more local action on climate change.The young people on the march also spoke about their concerns.ldquoI went on strike because people cut down rainforests just to be able to eat meat, said seven-year-old Mylo Kitchiner. ldquoIf we keep cutting down trees we wonrsquot have oxygen to breath. I want the government to stop people cutting down trees. I liked the chanting, lsquoclimate justice nowrsquo but this is not just fun to shout, itrsquos actually really important.Sister Lily-Rose Kitchiner, , said: ldquoPeople in places like Africa suffer because of how we live here and it needs to stop. The government needs to do more to stop climate change.ldquoI donrsquot know why we have to tell them this, why donrsquot they think itrsquos important Penarth resident and leader of Wales Green Party, Anthony Slaughter, also attended the march. He said: \"The massive turnout for the climate strike march in Cardf showed the strength of feeling from all sections of our community on the ongoing crisis and the impacts already being felt across the world.\"While people of all ages were present, this was a day when young voices were prominent with speaker after speaker articulating their generations anger at government inertia. This was a day for politicians to listen and take real, meaningful action to tackle the climate emergency.\"Business as usual is no longer an option.\"The Welsh Government has declared a ldquoclimate emergency and set a target to cut carbon emission by  per cent by .Millions of people across the globe have joined the strikes, with major cities brought to a stand-still.Greta Thunberg, the -year-old who sparked the movement with a solitary protest outside Swedish parliament in August  tweeted: ldquoChange is coming. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/catherine_1.jpg","title":"word from the wise kathryn collie","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by Ulster Business How did you start out in your business  I followed the fairly well trodden path of completing my legal practice course at the University of Law in Guildford, having graduated with a degree in law from university in England. Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/da1.jpg","title":"clarity telecom building telecoms from the ground up","story":"Posted on Monday September  by Ulster Business Clarity Telecom helps businesses of all shapes and sizes develop their communications needs from the ground up, and is now rolling out its fast-growing cloud software across the UK and Ireland. Founder and managing director David Whelan speaks to Ulster Business about a business which boasts the right tools for the job David Whelan’s vision and mantra for what is now one of the leading telecoms businesses is clear – telecommunications services are only as good as the foundations on which they are built, with engineering front and centre. He’s the entrepreneur behind Clarity Telecom – a successful Belfast-based full-service telecommunications solutions company with almost  years under its belt, helping develop top-end connectivity – including lines, calls, mobile, broadband and cloud software – for businesses across Ireland and the UK. And for David, telecoms is all about engineering at the core of finding the best comprehensive solution to its customers, having the right tools for the job, and having world class people. For Clarity Telecom, it’s about developing a bespoke system for companies, focusing on engineering from day one. Since its inception in , Clarity Telecom has grown to have a greater engineering capability than any other independent telecommunications company in Northern Ireland, and is now rolling out its leading byphone VoIPsystem throughout the UK and Ireland. David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call. It’s about how customers can engage with your business – and we are at the heart of making that happen.” For further information, contact Clarity Telecom on    or visit www.clarityteleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con1.jpg","title":"us cyber security firm creating  jobs in belfast","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Alastair Hamilton and Alan Naumann A US cyber-security firm is creating  jobs with a new base in Belfast.

The company had been in talks to seek a buyer, with business advisory firm Deloitte being appointed. But this morning the -year-old family-owned firm has now entered administration. Around , of the firms , employees have now been made redundant. Unite addressed staff and journalists on Wednesday morning. The union has warned that up to , workers could be directly, and indirectly, impacted. Directors at the maker of the so-called Boris bus had been in talks with companies including Chinese giant Weichai and entrepreneur Jo Bamford about a potential sale. But talks broke down last week, with the amount of rent to be paid on the companys premises believed to be a stumbling block. Wrightbus, which was co-founded by Sir William Wright, has faced trading dficulties after a downturn in demand for its products. A spokesperson for the Wright family said: \"We are devastated at the news today that the company has been placed in administration by the Wright Group Board. Global changes from diesel to electric in bus technology have caused a sharp decline in demand for buses in the UK. As a shortfall became apparent, one of the steps taken was to move work from our Malaysia facility back to Ballymena to secure jobs here.\" \"These factors have resulted in signicant losses at Wrightbus which our family has been covering for over a year. This was undertaken to both protect the workforce and the engineering expertise in the company. It simply became impossible to sustain that level of support. \"We have worked hard to support the restructuring team based in Wrightbus, and we are confident that a buyer for the business can still be found. We would like to thank the bank for supporting the company over  years and in particular the last six months.\" \"Since it was established in  from a tin shed, Wrightbus has become a world leader in bus manufacture and technology, employing tens of thousands of people. The company has built a culture and tradition of expertise and innovation in the Ballymena area which is recognised across the globe. The production of the world-famous London Routemaster is just one example of the many achievements of the firm and we are hopeful that a new buyer will be found and that work at the factory can continue.\" Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, says \"news that Wrightbus has entered administration is a devastating blow to the staff, the manufacturing sector across Northern Ireland and particularly damaging to the Ballymena economy\". \"Businesses in the supply chain have been doing what they can to support the company over this past year in the hope the business can be saved. \"They to face some very uncertain months as they try to secure the money they are owed and replace the trade they have done with the Wrightbus. \"That wont be easy as theres a signicant cooling of demand across the UK economy as Brexit bites and buyers reluctant to make big capital purchases. \"The company have a great product and a very talented workforce. Hopefully the administration process will see the firm put back on to a firm footing. \"But in doing that, it is important to protect the SMEs in the supply chain.\" Michael Magnay and Peter Allen of Deloitte were today appointed as joint administrators to Wrights Group Limited, Wrightbus Limited, Wright En-Drive Limited, Wright Composites Limited and Metallix Limited. Mr Magnay, joint administrator, said: “It is bitterly disappointing for all concerned that despite extensive efforts over recent months it has not been possible to find a buyer who wanted to maintain the business as a going concern. “We recognise the Companies are crucially important employers in Ballymena, and this will be devastating news for those who worked there, their families and the town, which has already suffered from a number of manufacturing closures in recent years. We will continue to support employees through this dficult time. “The joint administrators will explore all remaining options for the business and assets, and would encourage any parties with an interest to contact them.” The Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Maureen Morrow, expressed her deep sadness following the announcement Wrightbus has entered administration. I am deeply saddened by this announcement and the loss of so many jobs. “Following requests from elected members, a special council meeting will be held on Tuesday evening at pm to discuss the emerging situation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jo-control-room_.jpg","title":"m green energy plan for northern ireland","story":"Posted on Thursday  September  by Ulster Business Northern Ireland’s electricity operator has outlined a major £m five-year investment plan for a green energy system here.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
