But the idea somehow that I\u0027m going to go on exactly the same way, if I have to succeed, is complete nonsense because the two situations are completely different.\u0027However, the prince is unrepentant about his public campaigning over the past half century. He says archly: \u0027I always wonder what meddling is? I mean I always thought it was motivating.\u0027But I\u0027ve always been intrigued, if it\u0027s meddling to worry about the inner cities as I did 40 years ago and what was happening or not happening there – the conditions in which people were living. If that\u0027s meddling I\u0027m very proud of it.\u0027Documentary-maker John Bridcut admitted Prince Charles appeared to resent the word meddling when he asked him the question.He said today: \u0027He bridled a bit at the word meddling and said he prefers the word motivating\u0027.Mr Bridcut said Charles\u0027 wife Camilla says the \u0027burden\u0027 of being the next monarch \u0027does not weigh heavily on his shoulders because he has known all his life it is going to happen\u0027.He added: \u0027Actually he told me he it might be rather relieving to step back from that rather more front line role he\u0027s carried on as Prince of Wales\u0027. Former cabinet minister Lord Hain says \u0027I don\u0027t see why the future monarch should be expected to be completely viewless and silent on everything\u0027Lord Hain added: \u0027I\u0027ve never been a monarchist, but if you believe in a monarchy, then I don\u0027t see why the monarch currently or the future monarch should be expected to be completely view-less and silent on everything.\u0027Asked if he thought it was a shame that Charles has said he will not speak out on issues, Lord Hain said: \u0027No. I respect his point of view, just as I respected our dialogues when I was in government.\u0027But anti-monarchy campaigners Republic said: \u0027The royal PR machine are facing a crisis as Charles prepares to take the throne.\u0027The organisation added: \u0027Charles has routinely abused his position of power, privately lobbying cabinet ministers and influencing government policy with his own political agenda. \u0027King Charles is just around the corner and we should be having a wide-ranging national debate about our country\u0027s future, not a coronation by default.\u0027Harry discusses moment he asked his father to walk Meghan down the aisleLoose Women question Rod Stewart on cheating on penny 20 years agoCamilla believes Prince Charles \u0027destiny\u0027 doesn\u0027t weigh on himMelbourne man \u0027sets fire to car and charges at police with knife\u0027Prince William and Harry watch Prince Charles 1970\u0027s speech on plasticMan is shot by Police on Bourke Street following attackBourke St attacker wields knife as man pushes trolley onto himMother prompts outrage by claiming measles isn\u0027t serious on GMBMan is arrested after fire and attack in Melbourne\u0027s Bourke StJo Johnson QUITS Government in protest at May’s Brexit planBritish bomb disposal expert\u0027s reunion with Syrian dog he rescuedPrince Charles on taking risks when it comes to charity work    Charles says: \u0027You can\u0027t be the same as the sovereign if you\u0027re the Prince of Wales or the heir.

It reveals that:Charles is such a workaholic that he often falls asleep at his desk at midnight with a memo stuck to his foreheadWhen the Duchess of Sussex found out her father would not be walking her down the aisle, Charles immediately volunteeredPrince William wishes his father could spend more time with grandchildren George, Charlotte and LouisAlthough born to be king, Charles does not think about his destiny muchWilliam insists he wants to be his \u0027own man\u0027 as Prince of Wales.Documentary-makers were  given unrivalled access to Charles for a year, watching him at close quarters both at work and in private.And although a sensitive subject with the prince, the issue of his life-long lobbying was difficult to ignore.Over the years, the prince has been accused of risking the monarch\u0027s constitutional impartiality by meddling in government policy.Tales of his so-called \u0027black spider memos\u0027, the regular missives written to ministers calling for action in his distinctive scrawled handwriting, have left many uneasy about his ability to be a neutral monarch.In the interview the prince confronts the issue directly, pointing out that as the longest-serving heir to the throne in British history – he inherited the role at the age of just four – it was his duty to find a way to live a productive public life.He compares his role to that of the 14th-century Black Prince, a predecessor as Prince of Wales and commander during the Hundred Years\u0027 War.Charles says: \u0027Each one of my predecessors had to find out how they would do it, a lot of them dropped dead or were killed before they got very far.\u0027I mean the Black Prince was the first one and he rushed about doing all the complicated bits and fighting battles while his father sat somewhere else. So you know he was busy winning his spurs, and in a sense that\u0027s still what has to happen.\u0027Charles says as a young man he was encouraged to \u0027get involved\u0027 by political leaders. \u0027I remember Jim Callaghan who was prime minister and he invited me to come and spend the whole day at No 10,\u0027 he recalled.\u0027I sat in on all his meetings, and the Cabinet meeting and his briefing before going to the House of Commons for Question Time, and then I was sent round all the different ministries to find out what went on.\u0027You have to make of it what you feel is right. There\u0027s nothing laid down – that\u0027s what makes it so interesting, challenging and of course complicated.\u0027When pushed by Mr Bridcut, who points out that people have openly expressed concern that he won\u0027t be able to resist getting involved, Charles explodes: \u0027I\u0027m not that stupid.\u0027He agrees that he could continue to use his \u0027convening\u0027 power – the ability to bring disparate people and groups together – but only \u0027with the agreement of ministers\u0027.Charles rarely gives interviews of a personal nature. The last one was to presenter Jonathan Dimbleby in 1994 when he admitted adultery.And he has never confronted the issue of how he intends to conduct himself as monarch before, believing it unseemly to refer to anything that involves the death of his mother.But it is understood the prince believes now is the time to lay to rest the suggestion that he will be anything other than constitutionally neutral.Charles\u0027s mention of his work in the inner cities is a reference to the highly successful Prince\u0027s Trust for disadvantaged youngsters.He also describes himself as a \u0027risk taker\u0027 when it comes to some of his public work, like Dumfries House, the Scottish stately home that he controversially saved after taking out a £20 million loan and has since turned into a thriving charity hub. The prince says: \u0027Having taken the risks, I believe in living dangerously.\u0027Prince, Son and Heir - Charles at 70 is on BBC One at 9pm tonight.Harry discusses moment he asked his father to walk Meghan down the aisleLoose Women question Rod Stewart on cheating on penny 20 years agoCamilla believes Prince Charles \u0027destiny\u0027 doesn\u0027t weigh on himMelbourne man \u0027sets fire to car and charges at police with knife\u0027Prince William and Harry watch Prince Charles 1970\u0027s speech on plasticMan is shot by Police on Bourke Street following attackBourke St attacker wields knife as man pushes trolley onto himMother prompts outrage by claiming measles isn\u0027t serious on GMBMan is arrested after fire and attack in Melbourne\u0027s Bourke StJo Johnson QUITS Government in protest at May’s Brexit planBritish bomb disposal expert\u0027s reunion with Syrian dog he rescuedPrince Charles on taking risks when it comes to charity work    Beaming Prince Charles received an early birthday treat yesterday – a compliment from a supermodel.

(Pictured, father and son at the Invictus Games in 2014)HANDS-ON GRANDFATHERAsked whether his father has \u0027time to be a grandfather on top of everything else\u0027, William answers carefully.In recent years, Charles is said to have privately expressed his frustration that he doesn\u0027t get to see as much of his grandchildren as the Middleton family, a claim his aides have always furiously dismissed.But his elder son makes clear that he would like to have more \u0027family time\u0027 with his hard-working father.William says: \u0027It\u0027s something I\u0027m working more heavily on, put it that way. I think he does have time for it, but I would like him to have more time with the children.          In recent years, Charles is said to have privately expressed his frustration that he doesn\u0027t get to see as much of his grandchildren as the Middleton family, a claim his aides have always furiously dismissed\u0027Now he\u0027s reached his 70th year it\u0027s a perfect time to consolidate a little bit because, as most families would do, you are worried about having them around and making sure their health\u0027s OK – and he\u0027s the fittest man I know but equally I want him to be fit until he\u0027s 95.\u0027So having more time with him at home would be lovely, and being able to play around with the grandchildren. \u0027Because when he\u0027s there, he\u0027s brilliant. But we need him there as much as possible.\u0027Camilla adds: \u0027He will get down on his knees and crawl about with them for hours, you know making funny noises and laughing, and my grandchildren adore him, absolutely adore him. He reads Harry Potter and he can do all the different voices and I think children really appreciate that.\u0027 Aides say Charles could not be prouder to be a grandfather.The prince happily shows the documentary crew an arboretum that he has planted for his eldest grandchild at Birkhall, his Scottish home, which he calls \u0027George\u0027s wood\u0027.LITTER PICKERReferring to his passion for the environment and life-long campaign to highlight the perils of climate change, Harry reveals his father still can\u0027t help \u0027banging the drum\u0027 even when he sits down with his sons to dinner.He tells his brother: \u0027You know how frustrated he gets.

You know it\u0027s dark\u0027.\u0027I go \u0027We only need one light, we don\u0027t need like six\u0027, and all of a sudden it becomes a habit and those small habit changes he\u0027s making, every single person can do. And I think that is one of the key lessons certainly that I felt that he taught us.\u0027William agrees, adding: \u0027I know I\u0027ve got serious OCD on light switches now which is terrible.\u0027He does life the way that he advocates. He did take to heart the criticism quite a lot when he was younger.\u0027247 WORKAHOLICIf there is one thing the prince\u0027s family is agreed on, it\u0027s their desire – not that he will ever listen – for him to slow down.Harry jokes: \u0027He does need to slow down, this is a man who has dinner ridiculously late at night.\u0027And then goes to his desk later that night and will fall asleep on his notes to the point of where he\u0027ll wake up with a piece of paper stuck to his face.\u0027William agrees, saying: \u0027He has amazing personal discipline. So, he has – and it\u0027s frustrated me in the past a lot – he has a routine.\u0027The only way to fit all this stuff in is things have to be compartmentalised. The man never stops.          If there is one thing the prince\u0027s family is agreed on, it\u0027s their desire – not that he will ever listen – for him to slow down\u0027I mean when we were kids there was bags and bags and bags of work that the office just sent to him. We could barely even get to his desk to say goodnight to him.\u0027The Duchess of Cornwall says she tried to encourage her husband to \u0027pace himself\u0027 but admits he is too driven to take any notice.She smiles ruefully: \u0027My father once said to me, \u0027As you get older, you\u0027ve got to do one thing and that is pace yourself\u0027. And I would love to tell him to pace himself, but I\u0027m afraid that\u0027s not going to happen.\u0027MAN OF DESTINYCharles neatly sums up the way his life has been mapped out before him, with astonishing matter of factness.He says: \u0027When my mama succeeded and became Queen when by grandfather died so young, aged 57, I ended up becoming heir to the throne at aged four.\u0027And yet his wife says it is a weight he bears lightly.Asked whether the crown is something he often thinks about, Camilla says: \u0027No, I don\u0027t. \u0027I think his destiny will come, he\u0027s always known it\u0027s going to come and I don\u0027t think it does weigh on his shoulders at all.\u0027When she is asked if it is something he talks about, the duchess replies: \u0027Not very much, no. It\u0027s just something that\u0027s going to happen.\u0027  The Queen and Prince Charles surrounded by guests on stage at the Royal Albert Hall in London during a star-studded concert to celebrate the Queen\u0027s 92nd birthday.

I would encourage him to remain optimistic because I think it can be very easy to become despondent and negative. \u0027But with hopefully his children and his grandchildren and hopefully more grandchildren to come, he can get energy from the family side and then carry on his leadership role.\u0027William adds: \u0027I\u0027m very pleased that he\u0027s made 70. You know if you ask him if the job\u0027s done, it\u0027s not.\u0027But more than anything I\u0027d like to see his passions and his interests and the things he\u0027s been campaigning for come to fruition completely for him. He hasn\u0027t even reached the point that his natural progression should do – i.e. being monarch. So, you know he\u0027s still got his job to do.\u0027      Do it like the Duchess of Sussex in a Goat dressStill available in blackMeghan Markle\u0026#39s Givenchy gown took the world\u0026#39s breath away when she walked down the aisle to meet her prince, and that Stella McCartney evening dress was just as beautiful.

He was 32 when he married for the first time, he romanced Mrs Camilla Parker Bowles more than 30 years before marrying her, and he has now waited until the eve of his 70th birthday before letting the world know what sort of king he will be.For many years, he has unburdened himself of his views on architecture, education, the environment, homeopathy and countless other subjects.He has shared his thoughts on faith, on duty and on his respect for tradition. But on kingship and the kind of monarch he sees himself as, he has largely been silent. In many ways, of course, it has been an entirely commendable position to adopt. Given the longevity of the Queen, to have done otherwise would have been not just discourteous to his mother, but potentially dangerous.However, the absence of any clear vision of what life under King Charles III will be like has led to a situation where his public interventions – notably those infamous \u0027black spider\u0027 memos to ministers – have seen him cast as a meddling monarch in waiting.Now, with one eye on the future and from the comfortable position of almost reaching his 70th – his birthday is next Wednesday – he has chosen to deal with these vital issues for the first time.Questioned in a TV documentary about those accusations and about his future role, his answers are both surprising and revealing.The film also sheds an intriguing light on his relationship with his sons William and Harry, and on his grandchildren. \u0027When he\u0027s there he\u0027s brilliant,\u0027 says William pointedly. \u0027But we need him there as much as possible.\u0027 What emerges from this 60-minute documentary is the most compelling – and intimate – picture of the Prince of Wales since the controversial Jonathan Dimbleby programme almost a quarter of a century ago.But while that film marked his anguish over his affair with Camilla, and hastened the final break-up of his marriage to Princess Diana, this one is likely to be remembered for him finally setting out how he will operate as king.Clearly irked by questions about his lobbying and the accusation of meddling, the prince says he is proud to have worried about inner cities and to have tackled other issues.Pressed about whether such campaigning will continue once he comes to the throne, he replies: \u0027I\u0027m not that stupid.\u0027Then, with one penetrating aside, he says: \u0027I think it\u0027s vital to remember there\u0027s only room for one sovereign at a time, not two. But the idea somehow that I\u0027m going to go on exactly the same way, if I have to succeed, is complete nonsense.\u0027Here, in a handful of words we get to the heart of Prince Charles. On the one hand he is explaining why he has said nothing about his future role. There is the deep respect and, yes, love, for his 92-year-old mother, and a refusal to take anything for granted. \u0027If I have to succeed\u0027 is a telling phrase in itself.But there is another message here, too. And this one is directed at Prince William, who will himself succeed to Prince of Wales when the time comes: who knows, it might even be a warning.Though even the most enthusiastic of William\u0027s supporters would admit that the 36-year-old heir in line is more likely to model himself on his inscrutable grandmother than on his outspoken father.Indeed, in a candid aside William, who has not always had an easy relationship with Charles, says: \u0027I want to be my own man and take my own style.\u0027As for the future, Charles is unequivocal. Without mentioning the word king, he says: \u0027Clearly I won\u0027t be able to do the same things I\u0027ve done as heir.\u0027He cites Shakespeare as illustration: \u0027You only have to look at Henry V or Henry IV Part I and 2 to see the change that can take place, because if you become the sovereign you play the role in the way that it is expected.\u0027Many will no doubt be reassured by such positivity from the prince, especially those alarmed that – on occasions – he does blunder into the political arena. The Queen, of course, has been nothing short of remarkable in observing the convention that royals do not express their views on any area of public life.What this film seems to suggest is that, as the moment of his elevation to the crown grows closer, he is taking these symbolic positions of the monarch more seriously and more thoughtfully.          Prince Charles never does things in haste. He was 32 when he married for the first time, he romanced Mrs Camilla Parker Bowles more than 30 years before marrying her, and he has now waited until the eve of his 70th birthday before letting the world know what sort of king he will beThe picture that also emerges is one of contentment. Only once, in a project which ned a year in the prince\u0027s life did I – a long-time observer of Charles\u0027s princely temperament – get a glimpse of the crotchety prince.It comes during a clip filmed a Birkhall, the prince\u0027s Scottish retreat which he inherited from the Queen Mother. In the gardens there he has planted an arboretum which he refers to as \u0027George\u0027s wood\u0027, because he began planting around the time of the birth of his first grandson.He is walking with Camilla in the gardens when she begins to reminisce about the prince\u0027s long-dead Jack Russell, Tigger. The dog was part of his life at the time his marriage to Diana was breaking up and, despite his second wife\u0027s endeavours, he clearly did not want to discuss the pet. All the same, the nervous tics, the fidgeting with cuffs and never knowing what to do with his hands, were largely absent from this warmest of portraits.The relationship with his sons, which has been troubled, seems to have much improved. They are generous in their praise of their father – especially Harry, who talks of the workaholic prince falling asleep at his desk.He mentions his gratitude to his father for walking Meghan down the aisle at his wedding in May. And in a nod to his American wife, not used to late dining, he suggests that in the future his father might eat dinner earlier in the evening.Camilla, of course, is ever present, saying on air the kind of supportive messages that have been such an integral part of their decades-long relationship.Significantly, she discloses that Charles does not fret about the future. Does his destiny weigh heavily on his shoulders, she is asked at one point? \u0027No,\u0027 she responds, \u0027his destiny will come, he\u0027s always known it\u0027s going to come. I don\u0027t think it does weigh on his shoulders at all.\u0027There is, naturally, no contribution from the Queen. But wouldn\u0027t it have been fascinating to have heard from Prince Philip?This was, in many ways, a clearing of the decks interview, not unlike the decision he took on another birthday a few years ago to correct some long-repeated misconceptions about him. He said it was untrue that he had seven boiled eggs presented to him for breakfast each day, and explained that Camilla still has her own home because she likes to spend time there with her children and grandchildren.This exercise is far more serious – and risky. Will his openness about how he will reign be believed? If he can succeed in persuading critics of that, then it will have been a gamble worth taking."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/11/07/22/05502C65000007D0-6364743-image-m-11_1541629248652.jpg","title":"Harry says proud Prince Charles stepped walk Meghan aisle","story":"Prince Harry says his father did not hesitate to step in after the Duchess of Sussex’s father pulled out of walking her down the aisle in May          Millions of viewers were left deeply moved as the prince turned to his father and said, ‘Thank you Pa’, as Charles completed the walk down St George’s Chapel at Windsor with Meghan on his arm          When it became clear that Meghan wouldn’t have her reclusive father to support her, Harry went to his‘For him that’s a fantastic opportunity to step up and be that support, and you know he’s our father so of course he’s going to be there for us.

He doesn\u0027t look his age. I told him that his spirit was young. He is such an example to me. His commitment to the Commonwealth, that\u0027s amazing. I\u0027m very grateful.\u0027Charles, who turns 70 next Wednesday, also viewed a giant bronze of the Queen, who sat for Nigerian sculptor Ben Enwonwu in the 1950s.          The pair – who have known each other for years – met at a reception in Nigeria, on the penultimate day of Charles\u0027s official visit to West Africa                                                      Charles works too hard – he should spend more time with his grandchildren (who he loves crawling around with) reveals Prince William Prince William wishes his workaholic father could spend more time with his grandchildren, the documentary to mark Charles\u0027 70th birthday reveals.The Prince of Wales is described as a \u0027brilliant\u0027 grandfather who will spend hours crawling on the floor and making silly noises with his little granddaughters and grandsons.But the prince can be distracted because he is so dedicated to his work – to the extent that his sons say he sometimes falls asleep with the documents he is reading stuck to his face.Asked whether his father has \u0027time to be a grandfather on top of everything else\u0027, William answers carefully.  The Prince of Wales is described as a \u0027brilliant\u0027 grandfather who will spend hours crawling on the floor and making silly noises with his little granddaughters and grandsonsIn recent years, Charles is said to have privately expressed his frustration that he doesn\u0027t get to see as much of his grandchildren as the Middleton family, a claim his aides have always furiously dismissed.But his elder son makes clear that he would like to have more \u0027family time\u0027 with his hard-working father.William says: \u0027It\u0027s something I\u0027m working more heavily on, put it that way. I think he does have time for it, but I would like him to have more time with the children.\u0027Now he\u0027s reached his 70th year it\u0027s a perfect time to consolidate a little bit because, as most families would do, you are worried about having them around and making sure their health\u0027s OK – and he\u0027s the fittest man I know but equally I want him to be fit until he\u0027s 95.\u0027So having more time with him at home would be lovely, and being able to play around with the grandchildren. \u0027Because when he\u0027s there, he\u0027s brilliant. But we need him there as much as possible.\u0027          If there is one thing the prince\u0027s family is agreed on, it\u0027s their desire – not that he will ever listen – for him to slow downCamilla adds: \u0027He will get down on his knees and crawl about with them for hours, you know making funny noises and laughing, and my grandchildren adore him, absolutely adore him. He reads Harry Potter and he can do all the different voices and I think children really appreciate that.\u0027 Aides say Charles could not be prouder to be a grandfather.The prince happily shows the documentary crew an arboretum that he has planted for his eldest grandchild at Birkhall, his Scottish home, which he calls \u0027George\u0027s wood\u0027.Referring to his passion for the environment and life-long campaign to highlight the perils of climate change, Harry reveals his father still can\u0027t help \u0027banging the drum\u0027 even when he sits down with his sons to dinner.He tells his brother: \u0027You know how frustrated he gets. But he\u0027s done an amazing job, and without telling us what he should be doing or the direction that we should go in, he\u0027s just let us learn from the nature of the job, learning from him, learning from Mummy.\u0027The programme reveals how Charles would take his sons litter picking when they were on holiday with him.Harry reveals: \u0027He\u0027s a stickler for turning lights off.\u0027And that\u0027s now something that I\u0027m obsessed with as well, which is insane because actually my wife certainly goes \u0027Well why turn the lights off? You know it\u0027s dark\u0027.\u0027I go \u0027We only need one light, we don\u0027t need like six\u0027, and all of a sudden it becomes a habit and those small habit changes he\u0027s making, every single person can do. And I think that is one of the key lessons certainly that I felt that he taught us.\u0027William agrees, adding: \u0027I know I\u0027ve got serious OCD on light switches now which is terrible.\u0027He does life the way that he advocates. He did take to heart the criticism quite a lot when he was younger.\u0027If there is one thing the prince\u0027s family is agreed on, it\u0027s their desire – not that he will ever listen – for him to slow down.Harry jokes: \u0027He does need to slow down, this is a man who has dinner ridiculously late at night.\u0027And then goes to his desk later that night and will fall asleep on his notes to the point of where he\u0027ll wake up with a piece of paper stuck to his face.\u0027  The Queen and Prince Charles surrounded by guests on stage at the Royal Albert Hall in London during a star-studded concert to celebrate the Queen\u0027s 92nd birthday. Camilla says: \u0027I think his destiny will come, he\u0027s always known it\u0027s going to come and I don\u0027t think it does weigh on his shoulders at all\u0027William agrees, saying: \u0027He has amazing personal discipline. So, he has – and it\u0027s frustrated me in the past a lot – he has a routine.\u0027The only way to fit all this stuff in is things have to be compartmentalised. The man never stops.\u0027I mean when we were kids there was bags and bags and bags of work that the office just sent to him. We could barely even get to his desk to say goodnight to him.\u0027The Duchess of Cornwall says she tried to encourage her husband to \u0027pace himself\u0027 but admits he is too driven to take any notice.She smiles ruefully: \u0027My father once said to me, \u0027As you get older, you\u0027ve got to do one thing and that is pace yourself\u0027. And I would love to tell him to pace himself, but I\u0027m afraid that\u0027s not going to happen.\u0027 Charles neatly sums up the way his life has been mapped out before him, with astonishing matter of factness.He says: \u0027When my mama succeeded and became Queen when by grandfather died so young, aged 57, I ended up becoming heir to the throne at aged four.\u0027And yet his wife says it is a weight he bears lightly.Asked whether the crown is something he often thinks about, Camilla says: \u0027No, I don\u0027t. \u0027I think his destiny will come, he\u0027s always known it\u0027s going to come and I don\u0027t think it does weigh on his shoulders at all.\u0027When she is asked if it is something he talks about, the duchess replies: \u0027Not very much, no. It\u0027s just something that\u0027s going to happen.\u0027Asked to give a message to the prince on his birthday, his sons are quick to reply.Harry laughs: \u0027Please have dinner earlier is my message to him! I would encourage him to remain optimistic because I think it can be very easy to become despondent and negative. \u0027But with hopefully his children and his grandchildren and hopefully more grandchildren to come, he can get energy from the family side and then carry on his leadership role.\u0027William adds: \u0027I\u0027m very pleased that he\u0027s made 70. You know if you ask him if the job\u0027s done, it\u0027s not.\u0027But more than anything I\u0027d like to see his passions and his interests and the things he\u0027s been campaigning for come to fruition completely for him. He hasn\u0027t even reached the point that his natural progression should do – i.e. being monarch. So, you know he\u0027s still got his job to do.\u0027  "},{"url":null,"title":"Queen words Harry difficult Meghans choice wedding tiara","story":"    The Queen had words with Prince Harry over his \u0027difficult\u0027 bride\u0027s choice of wedding tiara, it has been claimed          The diamond and platinum bandeau tiara worn by Meghan is on display at the A Royal Wedding exhibition at Windsor Castle, which a royal source claimed was not her preferred optionMeghan picked the tiara from the Queen\u0027s collection during a visit to Buckingham Palace with Prince Harry.And she gave no hint that it wasn\u0027t her first choice.She described her visit to see the Queen and choose a headpiece for her wedding as \u0027an incredibly surreal day\u0027.\u0027I will NOT be a meddling monarch...

I didn’t understand things like when elections are fought, for example, in Northern Ireland, people who are nationalists don’t vote for unionist parties and vice versa.” Northern Ireland secretary Karen Bradley, ladies and gentlemen, in a political magazine interview this September.Behold the government of all the talentless: a place where you don’t just think it, but you make extra sure to say it out loud and in public.

GIVE ME BACK THE FUCKING BLUE PILL.”I truly don’t want to know that anyone in the animal kingdom, let alone in the Department for Exiting the European Union, is not meaningfully aware that the UK is an island. Then again, I am somehow even more horrified by the news that on Friday morning allies of Raab – whose own officials call him Raab C Brexit – were taking the time to brief that he did actually know Britain was an islandarchipelago.I mean, once you’re calling journalists, on behalf of a secretary of state, and your tongue and your teeth and your lips are working together to form the statement, “Of course Dominic knew Britain was an island”, haven’t you gone way past your personal safe word? When you look in the bathroom mirror, is the face of your eight-year-old self not looking back at you and whispering, “Get out now!”? Or is it, in fact, even worse than that? Politically speaking, do you not at that point realise you’ve been dead the entire movie?At this moment in our national journey, the government makes much more sense when you realise it can only be a massive hidden-camera simulation designed solely to amuse the occupants of a distant planet. Clustered round a visual port somewhere in Andromeda galaxy, interconnected strings of aliens cry with laughter every week at top-rating series Big Brexit, in which the hapless denizens of a Truman-like shitshow fail to realise they are being taken for a ride by their competition-winner overlords.

Apparently he sees himself as a “young god” whom doctors have told has the body of a 45-year-old. “When I’m 49,” he reasoned, “with the face I have, I will be in a luxurious position.” I couldn’t help feeling there was a little something of Brexit UK to this gentleman: that sense that you’re a total swashbuckler who’s only being held back by imagined red tape, and that you’d get laid twice as much and twice as filthily under WTO rules.So there you go. Many of us who once thought the UK had been having its post-imperial hangover for a few decades now realise that, during that period, Britain was in fact still drunk. The real hangover, unfortunately, is only just about to kick in."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73368ba0071cb297d54054dda3421d8fc1201118/0_292_5241_3144/master/5241.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8b538a78a3b23205981d858c33b1c13","title":"kids started school class children parents","story":"Two and a half months ago, when my kids started school, I imagined the biggest challenge would be socialisation. At nursery they’d had “friends” in the way it might be imagined slow-moving animals in a field have friends – which is to say animals doing the same thing as them but several feet over there. At school, by contrast, they have to choose whom to sit with. And so the rigmarole of popularity begins. What I hadn’t realised was how much this process was going to involve me.The socialisation – or rather resocialisation of parents who experienced classroom politics approximately 300 years ago, and have to rapidly dust off the machinery – has been shocking. I am 42, and, like everyone else of that age, screen my calls, ignore my voicemail, use my children to get out of doing things I don’t want to do, and am extremely agile at avoiding those I dislike. Well, those days are over. In the interests of protecting my children’s social life, all of a sudden I have to play nice.And, my God, what a strain. Intellectually, I know that if a kid tells my kid she doesn’t want to play with her and, what’s more, Avery doesn’t want to play with her either, the correct response is not to pace the corridor outside the classroom muttering, “I’m going to rip her tossing head off.” The correct response is to have a quiet word with the teacher, who will then lead a class lecture on not being a jerk. Fine. The greater challenge is what to do when one’s own child is the aggressor. Suddenly the argument for less is more becomes strangely appealing.Like everything else at the moment, some of this agitation taps into broader culture-war stuff, specifically the presumed generational shortfalls detailed in The Coddling of the American Mind, Greg Lukianoff’s book of last summer, in which he argues that young people have become so accustomed to turning to adults to sort out their problems that they are growing up with impaired executive function.The word snowflake hovers unhelpfully over this debate, but Lukianoff is talking more about helicoptering: the habit of modern parents to wade in and resolve their child’s every passing dispute, which may mean her sense of autonomy can never take off.It is arguable that four-year-olds are too young for this to apply. But even if it does, a major difficulty remains: that most people are lunatics when it comes to their child. “I’m so sorry,” I say sweetly, when a mother complains that my child upset hers meanwhile the muttery part of my brain is scoffing: “Oh, please! Your kid is oversensitive. Plus, when you text you use too many emojis.” “If you could have a word,” she says pleasantly, with murder in her eyes.As it turns out, our kids resolve their dispute by the end of the day, while 48 hours later the other mother and I are still flapping in each other’s general direction. I guess there’s a lesson in that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d240df7c92d56aa0495bfe2274c7b9f4a7954f4d/109_0_3281_1970/master/3281.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d9f0062040c15eb3b7dd2190fb3fc14","title":"northern ireland secretary backstop peace process theresa may peter hain","story":"It comes as no surprise that the EU withdrawal negotiations are going to the wire on the Irish border. That’s because hardline Tories are actually demanding Theresa May ignore legal commitments she has already made – and that even they went along with. This issue has flared up again today because Democratic Unionist party leader Arlene Foster has claimed the prime minister is “wedded to a border down the Irish Sea”.Last December Britain and the European Union agreed an insurance policy (termed the “backstop”). This was backed by the DUP, it should be remembered, and was a mechanism to ensure that, in all circumstances, there would be full alignment on both sides of the border with those rules of the EU internal market and the customs union that support north-south cooperation, the all-island economy and the protection of the 1998 Good Friday agreement.In plain terms that means that whatever else happens over Brexit, the Irish border must remain as it is now and has been for quite a while: open, invisible and free of any tariffs, checks or security barriers, for people, livestock, trade or services. Which in turn means common regulations, common standards and upholding rules of origin to prevent smuggling of goods – the very EU requirements so hated by people such as Jacob Rees-Mogg because, they insist, these would still tie the UK to Europe.The problem, however, is that neither they nor the DUP have ever had a workable alternative plan for the Irish border. And meanwhile they have nodded through May’s deals as she has repeatedly postponed the crunch decision now confronting everyone.But what else do they think they all signed up for? In March, the prime minister wrote to the president of the European council, Donald Tusk, pledging that a legally operable version of the backstop would be agreed as part of the withdrawal agreement. And, at the same time, the British and EU negotiators published a joint document that indicated a backstop solution would apply “unless and until another solution is found”.Neither in the December nor the March texts are there any references to “time-limited” backstops now demanded by half of May’s cabinet, most of her MPs and the DUP. But since the backstop that the UK has already agreed to is designed to operate in all circumstances, how can it possibly be time-limited?Both the EU and Ireland have indicated there must be a legally sound backstop arrangement to be included in the withdrawal agreement. They are quite correct to insist it cannot be fudged nor temporary. It is not EU intransigence but London’s reluctance to abide by what it has already agreed with Brussels that is gridlocking the negotiations.And it is also what it has enshrined in legislation. Section 10 of this year’s European Union (Withdrawal) Act rules out measures that create border arrangements “which feature border infrastructure, including border posts, or checks or controls, that did not exist before exit day and are not in accordance with an agreement between the United Kingdom and the EU”.That part of the law now has to be fully delivered by the prime minister – or she would be acting illegally.For Boris Johnson, Rees-Mogg and their sizeable group, the Irish border is tiresomely frustrating. They have said publicly that it shouldn’t matter a fig and never be an obstacle to their obsession with a Brexit at any price. It frankly beggars belief that the DUP would hitch themselves to a wagon driven by Little Englanders who know little about issues on the island of Ireland and care even less.Surely, given recent history, nothing – nothing – is more important in all the government’s many duties and responsibilities than maintaining peace and continued progress on the island of Ireland? It was so hard won, over so many decades of tough negotiations plagued by successive crises.Yet now that Good Friday peace process is at risk from Brexit, compounded by the near two-year suspension of the Stormont legislature and assembly.Theresa May should reject factional party dogma, stick with what she has already agreed with the EU, and abide by legislation she enacted earlier this year to guarantee the current open border. Then a deal with the EU might follow, and stability on the island of Ireland can be maintained.• Labour peer Peter Hain is a former secretary of state for Northern Ireland"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5ae9d58811cd4c5b540b0ea782ee556631cf916/0_114_5496_3297/master/5496.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=929f60e05d4d371aadbe0fbee13e88ea","title":"the guardian view on mrs mays brexit blocked by naysayers","story":"It is an unwritten rule of politics in Northern Ireland that everything proceeds from the word “no”. The establishment of trust in the dialogue that led eventually to the Good Friday agreement was a slow and meticulous business. The Democratic Unionist party never endorsed that deal, which is relevant to the difficulty Theresa May now has in persuading parliament to vote for any Brexit plan she might agree in Brussels. At the heart of the impasse is a historical fact that the leave campaign shamefully belittled: the Good Friday agreement was possible because both the UK and the Republic of Ireland were EU members. Brexit picks at the seam of peace. Arlene Foster, DUP leader, is immune to appeals for compromise based on the sanctity of a treaty that her party rejected. Her concern is that the prime minister appears ready to concede customs checks between mainland Britain and the island of Ireland under “backstop” arrangements – the regime to operate in the absence of a comprehensive free-trade agreement. There is a legal duty to examine certain goods on their way into the single market once the UK is outside it. The prime minister asserts that this is academic because a future trade deal can be done in time. It is unclear whether she really believes this. No one else does, least of all the DUP, which acts as if the union cannot survive phytosanitary inspection at Irish Sea ports. In reality, the cause of preserving the union was best served by voting remain in 2016 and is best served now by implementing the softest possible Brexit – or aborting it altogether.The case for pressing ahead with Mrs May’s methods is crumbling. Jo Johnson, the transport minister, today resigned citing as his reason the prime minister’s determination to present parliament with an intolerable choice: a half-complete package, worse than EU membership, or the chaos of exit with no deal at all. Mr Johnson’s analysis on that point is right. His proposed remedy – inviting the public to revisit the 2016 referendum decision in the light of what has subsequently been learned – is also more honourable than the approach preferred by his elder brother Boris, who resigned earlier this year in pursuit of guerrilla attacks on the government’s plan with no hint of viable alternatives.Meanwhile, there are indications a complete draft of the withdrawal agreement will be put to the cabinet early next week. If Brussels can be persuaded it will work – a high hurdle – Mrs May needs 320 MPs to get it through the Commons. That is an even higher hurdle. If the DUP is against her, she cannot manage it even if every single Tory is on her side. A mystifying aspect of this is the half-hearted effort Mrs May has made to woo opponents. It has long been apparent that the path to a Brexit majority involves Labour MPs. Only a handful are staunch Eurosceptic but dozens feel duty bound to honour the referendum result or to satisfy pro-leave sentiment in their constituencies. At Labour conference this year, Jeremy Corbyn offered to support a “sensible deal” that included a customs union, no hard border in Ireland, plus environmental and worker protections. Mrs May no doubt suspects Mr Corbyn of playing politics, feinting bipartisanship, more interested in bringing government down than in bailing it out. That may be so, but Mrs May could also have dabbled in public bridge-building. Had she conspicuously taken the Labour leader up on his offer, would his bluff have been called? Many opposition MPs might have been tempted by the invitation to facilitate a softer Brexit if they felt Mrs May was offering serious partnership.But the prime minister has always lacked the strategic competence and imagination to assemble a parliamentary coalition more durable – and more democratically representative – than her fragile and brittle alliance with the DUP. As a result, it is hard for her to get Brexit through the Commons and almost impossible for her to do it with the kind of majority that bestows moral authority on the outcome. Mrs May has had many opportunities for conciliation with MPs who support a moderate Brexit path. Instead, she opted for the hard route and reliance on a party that always says “no”. It is a choice she might soon come to regret."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89d227ad6319e5d898469c45c8a0dbb8f68e37b9/0_128_3760_2256/master/3760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=457bdc5a15672502ad505ba0593a3eaa","title":"the lowdown on british columbia this canadian province is not to be missed","story":"With cosmopolitan cities nudging wide-open wilderness, spectacular wildlife and a superb culinary scene, British Columbia offers a host of amazing adventuresChefs around the world adore BC for its incredible produce, from sweet spot prawns, celebrated in a festival each year at Vancouver’s Fisherman’s Wharf, to the juicy Okanagan cherries and peaches, which locals devour by the crate.Start planning your trip by poring over online menus at stellar Vancouver restaurants such as chef Andrea Carlson’s Burdock \u0026amp Co Gastown go-to, French-influenced L’Abattoir or the upmarket west coast take at Botanist.

Check out kitsch memorabilia, clothing with Chinese motifs, and Hong Kong-made backpacks In the narrow, lantern-filled streets of Central and Tsim Sha Tsui (TST) – under looming mirrored skyscrapers and a hot tropical sun – Hong Kong becomes a city dedicated to eating and shopping. Visitors on a consumption high lurch from buzzing dim sum restaurants to bustling markets, gorging on truffle wontons and debating exactly how often they’d use a 10-part porcelain tea set back home. Of the hundreds of Cantonese restaurants, aromatic medicine shops and colourful boutiques stocked with local goods that line the city’s streets, the following examples in particular capture the essence of Hong Kong with aplomb.Ho Lee Fook Directly translating as “good fortune in your mouth” in English, the name of this colourful Cantonese restaurant sounds a lot like the exclamation diners make after tasting the tender roast wagyu short ribs with soy glaze, the Taiwanese chicken or the threadfin fish with Jamaican-Chinese jerk rub. The Hong Kong theme is strong throughout – think a giant shimmering bronze dragon covering one wall, while the steps leading down to the restaurant are lined with hundreds of golden toy cats raising a single paw in salute. It’s no reservations, so avoid prime time – or factor in a few strong cocktails at the bar while you wait.Jimmy’s KitchenIf only walls could talk. Jimmy’s Kitchen has been around since 1928 and has been serving western food to celebrities, politicians and particularly homesick expats for nearly a century. Today, this icon from the colonial era is packed every night with locals who come to immerse themselves in the nostalgic decor and delightfully old-fashioned attitude to food. Popular with megastars like Cary Grant and John Wayne back in the day, its menu has barely been updated since the 1950s – think steak and kidney pie and baked pork knuckle. And it is hard to imagine anywhere else in Asia where you can wallow in the past and order a steak diane, a baked alaska and white Russian for dinner.Goods of Desire With quirky bed linen, novelty stationery and posters big enough to jazz up entire rooms, Goods of Desire has been the go-to store for cool furniture and lifestyle items with a Hong Kong sense of humour since the days of the British. Launched by two architects aiming to repackage Hong Kong heritage brands into kitsch furniture, fun fashion, and quirky art for the younger generation, it has also been deliberately provocative over the years, with a number of slogans aimed at the city’s notorious Triad gangs. Today it’s beloved by tourists and the city’s legions of expats, who stock up on Hong Kong memorabilia before they head home. Try the PMQ (Police Married Quarters) branch for its tiny dim sum restaurant and potent drinks list.Vivienne TamShe designed her first womenswear collection in 1993 and over the past two and a half decades, Hong Kong-raised designer Vivienne Tam has become a household name. Today she’s the territory’s most famous fashion export, and has been credited with paving the way for Chinese designers in western fashion capitals. You’ll see why in her seven sleek emporiums that are dotted around the city. They’re filled with collections that highlight what Tam does best: interpret traditional Chinese motifs for an international audience. These include silk dresses covered in jagged mountain and swirling cloud motifs, and mesh skirts plastered in asymmetrical waterfalls.DoughnutTake the MTR at rush hour and you’ll probably have a Doughnut backpack pressed against you at some point during the journey. This hugely popular fashion accessories store was launched by two young designers in 2010. They wanted to create functional, high-quality bags that were made entirely in Hong Kong and fused fashion and functionality. Lightweight, durable and easy to use, they are ideal for big city life.

It’s not a question of sacrifice, but deliciousness“How does it taste?” says Dan Barber, regarding me expectantly in the garden of Blue Hill at Stone Barns, his restaurant in the Hudson Valley just north of New York. I am gnawing the crust of a large piece of bread that has been grown from Barber Wheat, a hybrid seed developed by Barber and his partners to be nutrient dense, high in yield and – a radical thought in seed breeding, apparently – full of flavour. (Whereas clapped out old seeds might yield 30 bushels an acre, Barber Wheat will stretch to 95). The bread is simultaneously light, and dense, and intricate in flavour in such a way that I can’t think of a single word to do it justice. Barber, who at 49 has the manic energy of someone for whom no plate of food will ever live up to the ideal in his head, looks at me gloomily. “That’s the whole problem with food writing,” he says.There are bigger problems in the food world. With the possible exception of “financial regulation”, there can be few more deadly phrases to the casual reader than “sustainable agriculture”, a heavy-weather issue most of us recognise as increasingly important but nonetheless killingly dull. This is where Barber, who set up his restaurant in 2004, is hugely persuasive, a charismatic leader who, if you talk to him for an hour while walking around the kitchen and bucolic surroundings of Stone Barns, will have you genuinely excited about crop rotation, and soil conditions, and the fact that the food industry is a dying behemoth reliant on low-yield, agronomically risky seeds that produce ever more tasteless and nutrition-less food.“There’s never been a time where there’s been such a wholesale decline in frozen processed food,” he says. “Ever. The only units of those companies that are actually increasing market share are prepared vegetables that are not processed.” Which isn’t to say we are all rushing into the open arms of the nearest farmer’s market, although it is Barber’s mission, through his restaurants, to change this.Blue Hill, often cited as Obama’s “favourite restaurant” and with a branch in Manhattan, serves audaciously un-gussied up food that relies almost entirely for its flavour on its extraordinary provenance, from seeds bred by Barber’s seed company, Row 7, or from nearby farms committed to the best soil practices. The phrase “farm-to-table” has become something of a target in the last few years, “dismissed as pretentious and idiotic” as Barber says, and redolent of smug city dwellers fawning over a tomato. The chef prefers the terms “local” – “you can’t co-opt ‘local’ I mean, someone will figure out how, but it’s pretty hard” – or “seed-to-table”, since if the seed is no good, he says, everything that follows will be compromisedThe problem for Barber is not one of product, but perception many of us expect healthy eating to entail a large dose of sacrifice. This is wrong, says Barber food grown in nutrient-dense soil simply tastes better. “The change agent is deliciousness and hedonism. In many ways I think that’s why the good food movement, or farm-to-table, has had such legs: it’s rooted in hedonism. What movement can you speak about where it asks you to be greedy? Look at the environmental movement: give up everything. Or religion. The food movement is about something that Americans are really good at.”Eating? “Well, pleasure. We’re actually really not good at eating. But to the extent to which we can change culture through hedonism, I think there’s a real art to that. It’s just hard for Americans who come from the puritan idea that everything that’s virtuous requires sacrifice. It’s hard to talk about these serious issues in the context of pleasure and delight.”The flip side of this is that when Americans find something they do like or believe to be good for them, they can have trouble organising a proportionate response. I tell Barber I went through a brief phase of believing that chia seeds would save me.“Me too,” he says. “I went through the chia phase.”I am currently in the sheets-of-seaweed phase, although I’ve read that in high volumes it might be carcinogenic. He rolls his eyes.The main advantage of US food culture is that it is extremely light on its feet. “Who else is nimble?” says Barber. “Japan, France? Italy?” He laughs. “To introduce a new idea in those cultures? It’s impossible. But we do this.”There are some startling examples of popular products that effectively took off overnight after having been introduced by chefs at the top. “Look at Greek yogurt,” says Barber. “That came from chefs who were looking for a richer taste. Or look at quinoa, or sushi. All of these things that have become mainstream, started up high. Twenty years from now you’re going to be eating fast food crickets, or whatever it is.”Or, says Barber, “think about coffee. Fresh milk coffee: when I was growing up, you had it in a can, you would never pay $6 for a cup of coffee. But that started with a delicious cup of coffee yes, there are a lot of other reasons for its success, but it was based on just the fact that once you tasted a deliciously fresh, brewed cup of coffee, no one would go back. And that happened overnight, and it’s the same with Greek yogurt.”One of the problems with this kind of rapid uptake in otherwise beneficial produce, is waste. The Greek yoghurt boom has created an effective whey lake, the yogurt by-product that “in large amounts becomes very toxic. What do you do with all this whey? If you were in a different culture, you didn’t waste the whey. You had your greek yogurt, marinated your lamb that used up the whey, and that’s the cuisine. But in America we don’t have that.”In the case of quinoa, “now indigenous farmers in South America can’t afford quinoa because the price has gone up so much. It has driven thousands of farmers off the land.”The organic food movement entails a lot of waste as farmers rotate crops to rejuvenate the soil, “but since there’s no market for the other crops, they throw it into bag feed and lose money. That’s insane. That’s why organic food is so expensive. If you want to democratise the food system, you should be eating the ersity – the lowly soil supporting crops that organic farmers are forced into buying.”It’s a question, says Barber, of “who’s advocating for the ryes and the barleys and the millets?” That is where the job of the chef comes in and much of Barber’s time is spent doing what feels like a series of maths problems: how to create delicious food from ostensible waste products that support the crop rotation necessary to rejuvenate the soil. Only the chef can do this, he says obviously the supermarkets won’t.“Restaurants can become these cathedrals of ideas. Back in the day, traditional cuisines did that for food. They figured it out and passed it on, so that you ate certain things at certain times of the year. We were just never forced into those negotiations, because we were so plentiful. We came over here and it was like the garden of Eden.”The point is, says Barber, that joining the dots between products is what he’s there to do, “and that’s where the pattern of cuisine becomes so instrumental. And who puts those pieces together? That’s when it comes back to the restaurants. At a restaurant you’re like a conductor in an orchestra. You’re putting the stuff together in ways that nobody else can, or will.”The night after our conversation and back in New York, I visit Barber’s city branch of Blue Hill and taste many of the things I saw him discussing with his kitchen staff the day before, using all the sustainable methods he spoke of: raw beets sliced wafer thin and marbled with purple veins spear-harvested black fish mushroom “nuggets” that taste better than chicken.

The company’s head of design, Katsuta-San, explains why it’s all we want to wear in winterAnother week, another designerhigh street collaboration – although this week there happened to be two.In one corner, there was the much-hyped Moschino collaboration with high street brand H\u0026ampM, which had a small but visible queue outside its flagship store on Thursday morning – the big sellers were gold logo earrings the size of a saucer.In the other corner was Uniqlo, the Japanese retail giant, who on the same day launched its HeatTech collaboration with the Chinese-American designer, Alexander Wang, to slightly less fanfare. Here, there were no scraps, no ticketed queuing systems and no draconian rules as to how much time you could spend inside or how many items you could buy, as has become the norm with designerhigh street collaborations. Instead, it was like any other day. Inside Uniqlo’s multi-level Oxford Street store in London, a small but substantial group of people buzzed around the underwear section. “It’s always like this,” explained Terry, a sales assistant, folding knits with scholarly discipline. “The minute it gets cold, this stuff flies.”Japan is not known for being especially cold, but Uniqlo has become known for its thermal credibility. They won’t reveal current sales figures but at the very start, at least, it’s thought they were selling more than 10m of these underwear garments a year. Wang or no Wang, come winter, it’s Uniqlo that keeps the world warm.Uniqlo in its modern form has been around since the mid-80s, and is owned by Tadashi Yanai, a billionaire who is the richest man in Japan, and president of Fast Retailing, which owns the brand. In 1984, Yanai opened Unique Clothing Warehouse in Hiroshima, although there are now more than 2,000 stores worldwide. Sweden, known for its challenging weather, is its latest market, although in Japan, Uniqlo is so common it has coined the expression unibare, which means: “We all know you’re wearing Uniqlo, and it’s really lame.”Collaborations have become Uniqlo’s bread and butter, choosing designers who fit their aesthetic (rather than the other way round). In the last few years, they have worked with Jil Sander and Tomas Maier. The aim is to harness some of their quiet minimalism, make it mass and translate it all into sales. Past collaborations haveUniqlo’s ascendancy really began 15 years ago with the launch of HeatTech. Thermal clothing didn’t really exist on the high street at least, not anything you would want to be seen in. Suddenly, layering from the inside out became a possibility. A second flourish came in 2009 with the introduction of the ultra light down jacket, another bafflingly thin garment that seems to do the impossible while scrunching into a fist-sized ball. Fashion, too, has had a hand, and the gradual move towards streetwear and anti-fast fashion helped – this stuff is anti-trend, so “designed to be worn year in year out,” explains Katsuta-San.Designed to be worn under clothes, the new collaboration includes 12 pieces in ribbed fabric, lots of black and some neon that adds a certain couch-to-club element. Some pieces are designed to be seen. “But I’m not going to show my underwear to anyone,” he says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4e2ebd34e1f289d8785429d61a783d387556376/0_179_3241_1945/master/3241.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14d40c3c0adb9d1da6d74989f3343f5d","title":"jose mourinho manchester united city derby toe to toe","story":"• Midfielder a doubt to face Manchester City on Sunday• Mourinho describes City’s football operation as ‘untouchable’Paul Pogba has handed Manchester United a major injury scare before Sunday’s derby clash at the Etihad Stadium.The midfielder has impressed for José Mourinho’s side in recent matches, the World Cup winner a key factor in United’s uplift in form.United and Pogba have won their last three matches, including Wednesday night’s impressive 2-1 victory at Juventus but the Frenchman was unable to take part in full training on Friday. Instead Pogba undertook an indoors session at United’s training complex due to what is understood to be a “small injury”.Mourinho’s squad have a final session on Saturday before the trip to City so the manager will hope Pogba can take part before any decision about his availability for the match is taken.The United manager, meanwhile, wants his side to take the fight to the Premier League leaders in the derby.United are nine points behind City after 11 matches as they travel to the Etihad but they are enjoying a fine week, having won at Bournemouth and Juventus, while last month they drew at Chelsea after leading until the closing moments.Mourinho, asked whether the wish was to go toe-to-toe with Pep Guardiola’s team, said: “We are going to try. I cannot say we are going to be successful in our motivations, in our desire, but we played two different matches away against two very good teams – Chelsea and Juventus – and we managed to get good results.“And even if the good results were not in our pockets the performances were there, the positive attitude was there so we are going to try but Manchester City are a very powerful team.”Mourinho refused to be drawn on the alleged breaches of FFP rules by City but did praise their football operation.“But what is behind I cannot say but in this moment I have only to think about football, and to think about football is to think about Manchester City as a football team there.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c31e00aff199c44b344a02497feca7d2b772702d/190_64_2888_1732/master/2888.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a0dc0f33da842ee28e75e02ee2155b4","title":"sheffield united v sheffield wednesday championship live","story":"44 mins: Pelupessy gets tired of Duffy’s trickery and hacks him down in the middle of the Wednesday half. He escapes a booking. One minute of added time.43 mins: Fletcher thunks the first corner away, but John Egan, United’s non-attacking defender, climbs to meet the next one. Tom Lees gets their first, but Wednesday are incorrectly awarded a goal kick.41 mins: Wednesday have been able to ease the pressure in the last five minutes, but United find a pocket of space and work it around the edge of the area. McGoldrick plays Stevens in with a lovely flick, but his near-post cross is cleared.40 mins: Reach picks up the ball on the edge of the United area, but is quickly closed down.38 mins: Another booming cross from O’Connell, but this one is overhit. I have a lot of time for Chris Wilder’s overlapping defenders, particularly with two lads who look like your traditional centre-backs.36 mins: Wednesday enjoy a rare spell of possession in the opposition half, and are met with hearty whistles from the home crowd. Penney looks for a free-kick in a dangerous spot down the right, but doesn’t get it.35 mins: Fleck bends another testing cross in, but Dawson is able to collect, the strikers still not quite picking their runs.32 mins: Thorniley does well to deal with another dangerous low cross from O’Connell. The visitors are at least standing firm against this relentless pressure.31 mins: Stevens is flagged offside down the left flank. With Duffy switching sides and O’Connell pushing forward, poor Ash Baker is a busy man on the right for Wednesday. 29 mins: Duffy drops his shoulder, motors into the box and curls an effort towards the far corner. May have been going wide, but Hector nods it behind, just to be on the safe side.26 mins: Norwood pings a superb diagonal ball to Basham, the other attacking centre-back. His cross is drilled towards Sharp, who doesn’t have time to steer an awkward header on target.25 mins: If United aren’t ahead by half-time, it’ll be a miracle.24 mins: Oliver Norwood, something of a promotion specialist after going up with Brighton and Fulham, takes a touch and steers a shot just beyond the top corner.23 mins: United ping the ball around before O’Connell, nominally a centre-back, overlaps down the left. His low ball is cleared nervously by Hector.20 mins: Mark Duffy cuts back to Stevens, who is closed down. The chances coming so often for the hosts just now, though. Wednesday belt the ball away and Steven Fletcher, canny as the day is long, draws some sting with a long wander upfield. He eventually crosses towards Penney, who goes down in a heap – but replays show O’Connell didn’t make contact.19 mins: United keep the pedal to the metal, the latest lightning move ending with Enda Stevens’ cross just failing to pick out Sharp.18 mins: Fleck barrels forward from midfield and shoots, but it drifts well wide.17 mins: United are trying their best not to let that miss affect them, still buzzing around midfield gamely.McGoldrick steps up and fires for the far corner - but Dawson gets down brilliantly to turn it around the post! Justice served – Duffy appeared to trip over his own feet.Oh dear – this looks pretty soft to me, Mark Duffy going down under Morgan Fox’s challenge in the box. But Andrew Madley points to the spot!12 mins: A spell of scrappy possession, not that it quiets the absolute din around Bramall Lane one decibel.Will it be The Look Of Love or a Poison Arrow for Fry tonight? I’m here all week.9 mins: ...and from the corner, the visitors really should score! The ball drops to Morgan Fox, charging in under pressure, but the full-back scoops the ball high over the bar!8 mins: Wednesday venture upfield and as Adam Reach toepokes a cross-shot across goal, Basham has to be alert to turn it behind... 6 mins: It’s been an ominous start for the blue half of Sheffield – their team are sitting deep and hoping for the best so far.4 mins: Woof! What a hit from Fleck, 25 yards out – it bends ever closer to Dawson’s left-hand post, but the keeper gets across to tip it away. From the corner, Basham heads over.3 mins: United stay on the front foot, and Wednesday centre-back Tom Lees has to be alert to cut out a cross swept in towards Sharp.1 min: The hosts link up nicely, Mark Duffy finding space and finding Sharp, who can’t pick a pass to McGoldrick.Here we go, then.Before kick-off, the raucous volume around Bramall Lane drops for a Remembrance Day minute’s silence.“Paul Heaton is in the red corner? Are you sure?” asks Peter Oh. “I know he sang ‘Old Red Eyes is Back’ but I thought he only has eyes for Inter Milan.”My sources (Wikipedia) tell me Heaton lived in Sheffield as a youngster, and supported United because his older brothers followed Wednesday. But I wouldn’t put money on it.Like many outside South Yorkshire, the mention of this game takes me straight back to the 1993 FA Cup semi-final. Wednesday won 2-1 in extra time, and went on to lose the final to Arsenal, who won a derby of their own against Spurs in their semi-final. The same two sides met in that year’s League Cup final, with the same result. But never mind that! Just look at this footage. Old Wembley! Balloons! Chris Waddle! Brian Deane! Laver! Sanderson! The way the winning goal doesn’t even ripple the net! This is the good stuff.Sheffield is a famously musical city, but Wednesday definitely win in the band-fan stakes. Def Lep singer Joe Elliott joins Paul Heaton and, weirdly, Flea in the red corner. The blue corner can boast Jarvis Cocker, Richard Hawley, Arctic Monkeys, half of the Human League and one-fifth of the Jackson Five (Jermaine, who also has a soft spot for QPR).From Der Klassiker to the Superclásico via the Manchester derby, it’s a red-letter weekend for those of us fortunate enough to like football. It’s starting early too, thanks to a Friday night Sheffield derby under the lights at Bramall Lane. But does it meet the six-step Proper Derby Test?1) Proximity Grounds less than five miles apart, in the same city. Next question.2) History These two first faced off in 1890 and have been battling for city-wide supremacy ever since. This will be their 143rd meeting.3) Competitiveness Second to none. United have won 49, Wednesday 48, with 45 draws. Both teams have bounced around the isions but these games are almost always close. The last proper thrashing belonged to Wednesday in 1979, while United’s 4-2 win last season was the biggest by either side in a decade.4) Colours Red and white, blue and white. Absolutely textbook.5) High stakes In the 21st century, only United have played top flight – and that was just one, Carlos Tevez-blighted season. Wednesday had seemed closer to the promised land in recent seasons but as they have dropped, United have climbed. They’ll go top with a win and condemn Wednesday to a fifth straight loss. All of which means defeat for either side is an even grimmer prospect than usual.6) The name Come on. The Steel City Derby. It sounds like a deleted scene from Mad Max. Who wants to miss that? Kick-off is at 7.45pm, GMT."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4b9c03017f37cf5ae4abb6e10f1b8b1883dbc9d/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=033fdcb54cea5cd77db99e2bbf13e4bb","title":"have you already finished your christmas shopping","story":"One in five people in the UK get their Christmas present shopping done before December starts.

The wraparound head-shield, which includes noise-cancelling headphones, is a sleek, contemporary way to prevent distractions from colleagues in open-plan offices – a result I’ve previously had to achieve by means of towering piles of books, bushy plants and an obnoxious personality. “Ever feel like you’re having too much fun in the office?” the tech website The Verge asked sarcastically. “Like your boss just isn’t getting enough value out of your life?” But the dystopian thing here isn’t the blinders – it’s open-plan offices. As you surely know by now, they’re demotivating, distracting and linked to higher stress and blood pressure. According to recent research, there isn’t even an upside in the form of more serendipitous face-to-face conversation in fact, they make people talk less. Of course, they do save money, which is the real reason they exist – though if they do that by making employees vastly less effective, you’ve got to wonder if it’s a viable long-term plan.There are echoes of the open-plan fiasco in another workplace phenomenon, highlighted on the Study Hacks blog: the way many people spend a big chunk of each week doing tasks that are, to put it bluntly, below their pay grade. In the 1980s, the economist Peter Sassone studied the impact of computer systems on American corporations, and found that senior executives spent “surprisingly large percentages of their time” on things support staff might previously have done. Because computers make it easier for managers to type their own memos, prepare graphics for presentations, schedule appointments and so on, support roles got phased out, to save money. But money wasn’t saved: Sassone estimated that a typical office could save thousands of dollars per employee per year by returning to a clearer delineation between the two kinds of job.The reasons aren’t mysterious. Like it or not, the people who spearhead a bank’s investment strategy or develop a software firm’s new products get paid more than those who do data entry or book venues for meetings. So if you make your investment expert do the data entry, you’re paying a huge premium for admin support – so huge, Sassone’s findings suggest, that you’d save money by employing more support staff. Moreover, good support staff have relevant skills for their jobs – unlike the better-paid senior manager who wastes 30 minutes peering in bafflement at the screen in an effort to turn off automatic bullet points in Microsoft Word.Yes, the idea of an office more clearly ided into executive and support staff feels anti-democratic, old-fashioned, a bit Mad Men – but in reality, a return to such delineations needn’t mean exploiting lower-paid workers, or giving the best-paid jobs disproportionately to men, or making it hard to get promoted from one layer to the other. Likewise, open-plan offices feel more in tune with modernity: “everyone all mucking in together” is a superficially appealing idea. But that hardly means it’s for the best. Mark Zuckerberg famously has an open-plan desk, like everyone at Facebook, and look how that’s working out for humanity. Nikil Saval’s 2014 book Cubed, a fascinating cultural history of the office, shows how the seemingly democratic innovation of the open-plan office actually helped consolidate the power of companies over their employees’ lives"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33f44941b6950583dcd6b7bf33559a6492251f4a/0_200_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2dcc3e37d346dd23e742a67fd00801ba","title":"taking on the eu podcast","story":"The former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis staked his political career on getting a deal with the European Union – and lost.

The cabinet will meet next week to agree its Brexit negotiating position. Theresa May told ministers on Tuesday to “stand by their diaries” and re-read their previous Brexit papers for the crunch meeting, which is expected to take place on either Monday or Tuesday. There is also likely be a warm-up conference call over the weekend for the prime minister to “sell progress” to colleagues in an attempt to sign them up to an agreed position.2. Resolving the Irish backstop is the critical question. The backstop was intended to be an insurance policy to avoid a hard border in Ireland if no long-term free trade agreement could be signed by the end of the transition period in 2020. May’s desired version has the UK agreeing to keeping the whole country in a customs union if needed. However, hard-Brexit Conservatives are concerned that without easy exit clauses, the temporary arrangement could become permanent.As a result, Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, and Sajid Javid, the home secretary, have all said they want the UK to be able to exit the backstop unilaterally.But Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, warned cabinet members on Tuesday that that may not be legally achievable, and he and Raab were tasked to draft a workable exit mechanism for the special cabinet next week.3. Ireland and the European Union will only accept a backstop that ends by mutual agreement. Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, told May in a phone call on Monday that “the outcome of any such review could not involve a unilateral decision to end the backstop”.The expectation is that Raab and Cox will produce a draft backstop with a mechanism that ends mutually for next week’s meeting.Michael Gove, the environment secretary, also demanded that cabinet see the accompanying legal advice in full not least because if ministers are to go along with a mutual exit mechanism they will need the advice as cover.4. The precise wording of the backstop will be intensely scrutinised. Political anxieties about the wording of the backstop intensified on Friday after the leak of a letter from May to the Democratic Unionist party, which said the EU still wanted an additional “backstop to the backstop”.This would tie Northern Ireland to the EU’s single market and customs union if the UK-wide customs arrangement failed, although May told the DUP in the letter, sent on Tuesday, she would never allow it to “come into force”. That implied it would still exist buried in the backstop text.The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, said this raised “alarm bells”. May needs the DUP’s 10 MPs to get her plan ratified in the Commons.5. There is a long way to go. If the cabinet is happy, the draft withdrawal agreement – including the backstop – could be published next week. It is expected to be accompanied by a draft political declaration, an aspirational document setting out the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU.The deal will then have to be signed off at an EU summit, ideally in late November, before being presented to MPs for ratification in December. Ministers hope there will be “a new dynamic” once the deal is public – there will be an intense lobbying campaign arguing that May’s deal is in the “national interest” and that the alternative – no deal – would be an economic disaster.However, there remains acute scepticism in Tory ranks as shown by the surprise resignation of the rail minister, Jo Johnson. Steve Baker, a key figure in the European Research Group, said his group was ready to vote down May’s deal if the political declaration did not allow the UK latitude to pursue an independent trading future from the EU. If MPs were to block May’s plan, it would provoke a “profound political crisis”, he added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d03dc0c0da433735ddb4fc2bc5af790229227a5a/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6a85c2b10da6dfe8ffb7c1a7a861130","title":"in the balance scientists vote on first change to kilogram in century","story":"The weight is defined by a lump of metal in a Paris vault - which could make Earth ‘laughing stock of universe’For the band of specialists in the much-overlooked arena of metrology, it will be the most profound moment in more than a century. Since 1889, one of the pillars of the science, the kilogram, has been defined by a lump of metal held in a triple-locked vault in a lab on the outskirts of Paris. It is the one true kilogram in the world.But not for much longer. Next week, leading figures in the field are set to make history. At the general conference on weights and measures in Versailles, representatives from 57 nations will vote for change. And so the kilogram, the only metric unit still based on a solitary object, will be reborn. Henceforth, the kilogram will be derived from a fundamental constant, a number that is woven into the fabric of the universe.The vote is essentially a done deal. The debates have been had, the solutions agreed. But even popular revolutions can be tense affairs. “It will be nerve-racking,” said Stephan Schlamminger, a physicist at the US National Institute of Standards and Technology, who will be in Versailles for the vote. “I’ve been thinking about this, or working on it, for as long as I have been a scientist. Sometimes I am in a state of disbelief. Is this really going to happen? Will I wake up and find this is all a dream?”Much of the week’s meeting will be devoted to routine affairs such as budgets and the like, with votes cast on the Friday. “It will be nice to know that the whole thing has been resolved,” said Stuart Davidson, the head of mass metrology at the national physical laboratory in Teddington. “We’ll know, at least, that no-one has stood up and said this is rubbish, we’re not going with it.”The roots of modern measurement can be traced back to the mid-18th century, when it became clear that nations might do well to share common units. With international trade on the up, it made no sense to price rolls of fabric, for example, according to the local duke’s shoe size. In the late 1700s King Louis XVI commissioned scientists to find a more sensible approach.The assembled group proposed a system inspired by the natural world, one intended “for all times, for all people”. A metre was defined as one ten-millionth of the distance from the North Pole to the equator. A kilogram was the mass of a litre of water. To make the units more practical, each was enshrined in a physical object, a metal bar for the metre, and a weight for the kilogram. In time, the scheme evolved into an international system of units (SI) with seven base units: the metre for distance, the second for time, the kilogram for mass, the mole for amount of substance, the ampere for electrical current, the kelvin for temperature, and the candela for luminosity.For the past 129 years, the world’s official unit of mass has been the international prototype kilogram, or IPK, a shiny cylinder of platinum-iridium stored under three sealed bell jars at the international bureau of weights and measures (BIPM) in Sèvres, west of Paris. National metrology labs hold copies of the IPK to calibrate measurements in their own countries. Every 40 years or so, the copies are returned to Paris for checks against the IPK, nicknamed Le Grand K.It is enough to irk metrologists. “If aliens ever visit Earth what else would we talk about other than physics?” said Schlamminger. “If we want to talk about physics we have to agree on a set of units, but if we say our unit of mass is based on a lump of metal we keep in Paris, we’ll be the laughing stock of the universe.”If the vote proceeds as expected, Earth will be spared such galactic shame. Since 1983, the metre has been derived from the speed of light in a vacuum. The kilogram makeover will derive mass from the Planck constant, a number deeply rooted in the quantum world. It describes the size of bundles of energy, known as quanta, which pour out of a hot oven, for example.The redefinition is easier said than done. Scientists first use a supremely sensitive piece of equipment called a Kibble balance to calculate Planck’s constant from a 1kg reference mass. The instrument is similar to a scales, but instead of counteracting one weight with another, the object being weighed is balanced by electromagnetic forces. Planck’s constant is proportional to the energy needed to balance the mass. Then, armed with a precise value for Planck’s constant, researchers can do the reverse, and use the balance to measure unknown masses.With a positive vote the new system of units, including updates to the mole, Kelvin and ampere, comes into effect on 20 May 2019. The revolution will hardly be felt beyond the world of metrology. No one will weigh their carrots any differently at the supermarket. But behind the scenes, a more elegant system will be at work.“The greatest satisfaction for me will be completing the historic arc that started with the French revolution,” said Schlamminger. “The idea was to have a measurement system for all times and for all people. They fell short on the kilogram. It has these problems with stability, so it is not for all times, and it is locked in a safe, so it is not for all people. Planck’s constant never changes, so it is the same for all time. And its value is woven into the fabric of the universe, so it is there for everyone.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef43b2c9392529607d474d59f61eef7be4951294/0_123_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=600758e2908ed90b3006d821c3e3c05b","title":"its unfair un envoy meets children living in poverty in scotland","story":"Philip Alston is on a tour of the UK and will report his findings into the causes and effects of poverty next weekThe United Nations rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights squeezed onto a school bench alongside a dozen children in one of Glasgow’s most deprived neighbourhoods and posed a question: “Who should help poor people?”“The rich people,” Soroush, one of the children, shot back. “It’s unfair to have people earning billions of pounds and have other people living on benefits.”It was perhaps the frankest answer Philip Alston received on a two-day visit to Scotland, where a million people live in relative poverty, including one in five children.The children were asked to jot down what being poor might mean for a person. John Adebola-Samuel, 12, quietly penned: “He cannot afford meals. He cannot buy trainers. He cannot watch TV.”John’s family relied on food banks for two years and for a long time he only took bread and butter to school for lunch.“I got hungry because I was smelling the other food,” he said. “I had to take my eyes away from it. The most unfair thing is the government knows families are going through hard times but they decide not to do anything about it.”Alston wants to know why that is. However, the Scottish leg of his UK tour, before he gives his verdict on how the UK government is handling poverty, was dominated by another big question: should poverty essentially be made illegal?Alston has campaigned for that approach for decades, so was heartened to meet the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, who plans to make adequate housing, food and welfare a legal human right in Scotland. That would mark a dramatic split from the UK government, which in 1976 signed a UN treaty agreeing to protect economic and social rights, but has proved hostile to enshrining it in law.Supporters of the idea argue that if breaches of economic and social rights were illegal the balance in society would change. Every branch of government would consider more carefully how it shared resources, and would ensure basic needs were always met, they argue. It already happens in Germany and Sweden.“When you see how austerity has panned out in this country and you see people in crisis far more often, that for me is a fundamental human rights issue,” said Judith Robertson, chair of the Scottish Human Rights Commission, who is backing a change in the law. “At this moment in the UK we have lost the idea that all human beings are equal and should be treated with dignity and respect.”Alex Thornburn, a disabled man who has lived in poverty, told Alston at a meeting in Edinburgh that austerity policies “have sanctioned, stigmatised and de-humanised millions”. Extending human rights protections to welfare could change that, its advocates hope. Objectors say it could give rise to costly new obligations, which would require big changes to public finances and that it would give sovereignty over key policy issues to an international body.Even if Scotland made the change, it might not relieve the deep, ingrained issues many are facing. .Bill Scott, the policy director for Inclusion Scotland, a group for disabled people, told him about a woman who had chronic physical and mental health problems who said she had sex for money after her benefit was stopped following a work capability assessment. She hadn’t eaten for nearly a week but was deeply ashamed. “She couldn’t live with herself,” he said.While Alston met Sturgeon, Karen Reid, 35, a single mother of four in the deprived Pilton neighbourhood - close to affluent Stockbridge and the elite Fettes College public school - told the  how she last worked nine years ago, struggled with depression and once drank so heavily she suffered permanent nerve damage to her hands and feet. Her disability allowance has been stopped, costing her family £600 a month.“Things are going wrong and they are getting worse,” she said.Aileen Campbell, the Scottish government communities secretary, said she was worried about the universal credits programme and feared it would deepen poverty unless Holyrood spent millions to offset the effects.Scotland has already started takings steps towards treating poverty differently, but many activists remain frustrated that the Holyrood government is not going fast or far enough.An act passed earlier this year recognised social security as a human right and attempted to address the hostile environment faced by welfare recipients. In Scotland universal credit payments can now be split to protect women’s financial autonomy, the private sector will not be allowed to carry out disability assessments and there will be no security guards in the new social security agency offices.Peter Kelly, of the Poverty Alliance, believes the Scottish government is serious. “Using the language of human rights is really important and we don’t think it’s just warm words,” he said.Alston is in Belfast on Saturday before finishing his tour in Essex and London. He will announce the conclusions of his investigation at a press conference on Friday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f67570497340f47f85adf8ec531adcb62c6a89bd/0_193_2992_1796/master/2992.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d7fb7e550a1394b819c321b4fc0f124","title":"tower recladding work to leave london residents in the cold grenfell","story":"Blocks near Grenfell Tower to be stripped of hazardous insulation over winterHundreds of residents in London homes close to Grenfell Tower are facing a cold Christmas after council chiefs told them the cladding on two tower blocks was a “substantial” fire hazard and must be removed without delay.Residents of Adair and Hazelwood Towers received letters from Kensington and Chelsea council on Thursday informing them that work to replace the insulation render on the outside of their blocks would start next week. Updated government advice on external cladding to tower blocks was issued last month.The insulation materials on those blocks are not the same as those used on Grenfell Tower. But the materials known as EPS (expanded polystyrene system) have now also been deemed a fire risk.The cladding on the blocks was installed in 1992 and 1993. The two 14-storey blocks were built in 1958 and contain 156 one- and two-bedroom flats. The removal of the cladding is so urgent that the council has waived tendering requirements and awarded a contract worth more than £500,000 to D\u0026ampB Facades UK.Residents said they were angry that the work, which is expected to take five to six months, would be carried out during the coldest months of the year in blocks they said were already cold. Council officials have said they are discussing measures to ameliorate the cold but have not detailed any plans.Darren Turner, a resident, said: “Living in buildings with no insulation for several months is going to be really intense and will affect a lot of people.”Concern about the fire risk is so great that council officials have moved 24-hour fire wardens into the blocks at a cost of £26,000 a week until the cladding materials have been removed.A spokesman for the council said it had started looking at fire safety issues after it took back responsibility for council housing in the borough from a tenants’ management organisation.Since the Grenfell Tower disaster there have been two fires in flats in Hazelwood. Both have been contained within the flats where they started.A fire risk assessment of the blocks was undertaken in July 2018 by independent specialists. While the rendered insulating system complied with regulations at the time of installation, concerns had been raised about its safety. Work on apparently defective doors and windows would take place at the same time as the recladding.“Residents will not be moved out while the work is done,” a council spokesman said. “Dirt and disruption will be kept to a minimum and we are setting up a working group to keep all informed as the work progresses. We will discuss with residents what additional assistance we can provide in relation to cold.”He said Kensington and Chelsea was not the only borough considering removing that particular insulation system from its tall blocks.Islington council is carrying out similar replacement of EPS cladding to its Fyfield block in Finsbury Park, north London."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16f3d0ee27545fae2e58c09f5998fac89c6b2a85/0_281_5642_3385/master/5642.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0e863192c005ac6d05b8405c8367df3","title":"brazilian grand prix lewis hamilton mercedes ferrari","story":"• Mercedes aim to complete double with F1 constructors’ title• Ferrari team principal admits they ‘lacked the habit of winning’With the drivers’ championship wrapped up by Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes, the Brazilian Grand Prix presents the chance for a final, definitive blow to Ferrari. If they take the constructors’ title at Interlagos it would be a fifth consecutive drivers’ and constructors’ double for Mercedes, equalling the record held by the Scuderia.It would be a remarkable achievement and noticeably one from which Ferrari intend to learn. This weekend represents a chance to begin building toward next season and their attitude seems to reflect an acknowledgment they must step up to match Mercedes and Hamilton.With a 55-point lead Mercedes will take the constructors’ championship and match the run Ferrari achieved with Michael Schumacher between 2000 and 2004 if Ferrari fail to outscore them by 13 points at Interlagos. It would be the successful culmination to a season that had looked to be Ferrari’s.The Scuderia started so strongly, with a car that matched their rivals and was, for a period, the best of the field. Certainly some exceptional performances by Hamilton would have been hard to beat under any circumstances but a combination of errors from Sebastian Vettel, team mistakes and a development dead end squandered their shot.It provoked some exceptionally honest remarks from the team principal, Maurizio Arrivabene, who this week admitted they “lacked the habit of winning”.Without a championship for 11 years Arrivabene conceded their failings. “We must be more aware of our means, and not be afraid of winning,” he said. “In tennis they call it il braccino – the fear of winning that comes when you are close to the goal. We must trust ourselves, and make winning a good habit.”At the Autódromo José Carlos Pace, proving they have understood and learned is paramount. Although Hamilton claimed the title at the last round in Mexico, Vettel was intent on taking what positives he could from finishing on a high. “I still have a mission here and I still want to win,” he said. “That hasn’t changed. The last race was a tough one to swallow and probably the winter will be as well. But giving up is not an option.”Work to do for the team then but also himself. In the three of his five titles that he clinched before the last race of the season, Hamilton has yet to go on and take a win in any of the remaining rounds, an anomaly he would doubtless like to dismiss in Brazil.There was little sign of it being an easy task for anyone however, with nothing to chose between the front runners in first practice. Less than one tenth of a second separated the Red Bull of Max Verstappen who was quickest from Vettel and Hamilton in second and third. The afternoon session was similarly tight with Valteri Bottas topping the timesheets, just three-thousandths in front of Hamilton, with Vettel seven-thousandths back in third."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba0c0efc9cecd6d2da148b76665efed23f9efc83/0_0_4045_2428/master/4045.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f787565f28a21d4a9622138771f4b82","title":"joe root first test win england sri lanka cricket ben foakes","story":"This was a new experience for Joe Root. He had never led England to victory overseas before. But he managed not to get too carried away after England’s emphatic win.“Hopefully this is not a one-off. We go to Kandy with a huge amount of confidence”, he said with a quiet smile on his face. “It is not just us it has become difficult across the board to win abroad so a win is sweeter when it happens in venues like this”. Just over three months ago Sri Lanka defeated South Africa by 278 runs in Galle. Now England had won by 211.It was a team effort with relatively unheralded cricketers, man of the match Ben Foakes, Keaton Jennings and Jack Leach coming to the fore while Stuart Broad and Jonny Bairstow were on the sidelines. Despite the victory there may be lengthy discussions about selection before the next Test at Pallekele on Wednesday. “I’m going to enjoy that difficult meeting”, said Root. “It is going to be tough. But that’s what you want. You want guys performing and to have to make those tough calls - whether that’s leaving someone out, keeping the same team or shuffling the pack slightly. We’ll have to wait and see”.No one did that better than man of the match, Ben Foakes. “As a debut it was all right wasn’t it?” said Root. “To come in and play with such maturity and understanding of his own game in a difficult position, not to get overawed and to be really calm and take every chance, well, it was great to see”.Foakes described his sudden elevation to Test cricket as “an unbelievable place to be”. He has not had time to let everything sink in. He was asked about Kandy. “Jonny will be fit potentially.” He kept thinking. “So I guess he’s the number one and if I play one game I’m quite happy with that one.” Somehow that is unlikely to be the case."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcfbb5e6f4f613097e61d3c079cc5e168bf8fa10/77_143_2048_1228/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b7f2c4e9e97d3372343db50998d9d6d","title":"sports quiz week manchester city united f1 wayne rooney","story":"Who scored?

It is the way the emotional Liverpudlian would want it, belligerently defiant all the way to the last bell, whenever it is rung, at 35.If “Bomber” conjures up a 34th win to round out a career that began 11 years ago on a Nottingham Saturday night on which Amir Khan and Kell Brook shared a dressing room but few pleasantries, he will surely leave to thundering applause from all around the Manchester Arena. If he loses, he will do so in a doomed blur of leather.Bellew – who came in less than a pound below the 14st 4lb limit on Friday, and a pound heavier than the champion – declared: “I feel fantastic. Fat boy is in shape. Usyk is in the deep end. There will be war. He’s a formidable champion, one of the pound-for-pound kings of the world. We’re going to create madness.”A Bellew victory is unlikely, whatever the enthusiasm of his British backers. Usyk, younger and frighteningly fresh, arrives with all four cruiserweight belts after wrenching the WBC and WBO versions from the grasp of the similarly awesome Murat Gassiev in August, which brought to a rousing conclusion the World Boxing Super Series tournament at the weight just below heavy – where Bellew made such a dramatic statement in two stoppage wins over David Haye, closing out his rival’s own excellent career.Now it is his turn. Can the British fighter who produces almost as many words as punches say goodbye in style? He expresses no doubts or apprehension. He is convinced he can do again in the ring what is least expected of him and live out another fairytale to go with the heroics he portrayed on his film debut two years ago in Creed. Bellew played the part of “Pretty” Ricky Conlan in that film, a source of much merriment (and no little pride) to his friends.But he is back in his serious job now. These punches are for real and Bellew, a canny boxer, will do well to stay out of the way of those thrown by a 31-year-old foe with few battle scars, a technician who has stopped 11 of his 15 opponents, with aggregated rather than lightning power. It could be a long night.When Bellew ventured to Quebec five years ago to confront a more established ring monster in Adonis Stevenson, he also made the requisite noises. He was going to destroy the knockout ogre they were calling Superman but whom Bellew preferred to characterise as “a small man with a huge ego”. Superman, the WBC’s and Ring magazine light-heavyweight champion, hardly lost an exchange or a round and dropped and stopped Bellew (dazed on his feet in a neutral corner) in round five.Bellew turned 31 on the night of his most crushing ring experience. Five Novembers later, he vows to make his farewell a night to remember.So, why? Because he can. He’s still fit, strong and, for one night at least, has the fire to compete. His best chance is an early stoppage.As for Stevenson, he is 41 and still knocking opponents out. And eerily, on 1 December in Quebec, he fights another 31-year-old, 15-0 Ukrainian called Oleksandr – Gvozdyk – in the 10th defence of the light-heavyweight title he put on the line against Bellew in the same city in 2013.Symmetry would suggest wins for the two older men might lead to a rematch. As far as Bellew is concerned, that will not happen. He says he is through with boxing after this and heading off to Hollywood again, for a less stressful but no doubt as colourful new life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b9139bb35f931bda5f28b4bb92a42db45f0c784/0_190_4627_2777/master/4627.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9fc077254585dddf59ca25340eea851","title":"magnus carlsen v fabiano caruana world chess championship game 1 live","story":"Spared a time crunch for the first time in hours, Caruana takes his time with 41.

For a moment there Carlsen was poised to become the first champion to win Game 1 of a world title match as black in 37 years, when Anatoly Karpov defeated Viktor Korchno in the opener of their rematch in Merano, Italy. Now a draw appears far more likely, but it won’t come quickly. Strap in as this could be a long endgame.What a turn of events! As time bears down on both players (38. c3 Be5 39. Kc2 Qg7), Caruana makes his 40th move (40. Nh2) with three seconds on the clock, giving him the desperately needed 50 minutes of extra time. But Carlsen’s response (40. ... Bxc3) lets his opponent off the hook! The look on the champion’s face says it all as he shakes his head in disappointment. Another flurry of moves with 34. Nh2 h5 35. Rf2 Qg1 36. Nf1 h4 37. Kd2 Kb7. Caruana comes dangerously close to losing on time (again) but comes up with 38. c3 to give himself a bit of breathing room. Only two more moves until the much-needed added time, but the time pressure has allowed Carlsen to open a significant positional advantage.The grandmaster Susan Polgar is no fan of 36. ... h4, calling it the sort of inaccuracy that Carlsen did not make when he was at his peak.Caruana goes with 33. Ke2 and Carlsen with 33. ... Qg5. The American is inside a minute ... 50 seconds ... 40 seconds ... 30 seconds ... 20 seconds ... 10 seconds! We’re on the edge of our seats! At last Caruana pulls a knight into retreat (34. Nh2), but it reeks of desperation. Carlsen with more than 17 minutes and content to take his time with his opponent in survival mode. The computer analysis shows a clear advantage for Carlsen. Barring a blunder, he’s going to win the opening game of the world championship as black. Squeaky-bum time for Caruana after another back-and-forth exchange (29. Nf2 Rg8 30. Ng4 Qe8 31. Qf3 Qxh5 32. Kf2).

Here’s a look at the board.The moves are coming more quickly (23. Nh5 Bxh5 24. gxh5 Nf4). A bit of a head-scratching sequence of moves for Carlsen, who appears to have let Caruana off the hook. According to the computer analysis it was 21. ... Nf8 where he surrendered his positional advantage, though the champion is still well ahead on time. Next Caruana takes Carlsen’s knight (25. Bxf4) and Carlsen takes a bishop right back (25. ... gxf4). The American then opts for 26. Rg2 and after the 30-second increment he’s working with just over seven minutes compared to about a half hour for Carlsen.The grandmaster Susan Polgar calls it a time-induced inaccuracy for the challenger.Caruana opts for 21.

Caruana goes with 20. b3 and Carlsen answers with 20. ... Bf7. The challenger, moving more quickly out of necessity, takes a bit of a gambit with 21. Nd1, which he hopes will force Carlen to think and cut into the time deficit. The American has a little over 16 minutes to make 19 moves before he gets more time, while the Norwegian champion is just inside the 40-minute mark as he ponders his 21st move.Caruana opts for 19. g4, stopping the clock with a little over 18 minutes (and 21 moves until the time control). Carlsen, with nearly a half-hour time advantage, has a long think before going with 19. ... f6. Here’s a look at the board.During the build-up there has been plenty of speculation about how Carlsen and Caruana have been training, and a particular focus on what openings they have been working on. According to rumors, Caruana may have been getting some extra help from a small US-based website called Chessable, which specializes in training chess openings.  approached Leon Watson from Chessable but he refused to give anything away. “Obviously we have to keep the names of our users very secret,” he said. “It is very important to all chess players, not just grandmasters, to keep secret what their opening choices are because they don’t want the opposition to be able to prepare for them. However, one thing I can say is that we do have players of every level using the site.”Caruana’s 17th move (17. Nf6) is a blunder. He’s now behind on position and on the clock and Magnus Carlsen is playing for a win as black before move 20 in Game 1 of the World Chess Championship. What a turn. Carlsen quickly responds with 17. ... Nd7. Caruana answers with 18. Nh5 and Carlsen wastes no time with 18. ... Be5, pressing his time advantage. Less than 22 minutes on Caruana’s clock with 22 moves before the time control, meaning Caruana will need to average a move a minute to stay above water. Not ideal. The American will have to play very well to avoid losing here.Caruana takes his time and proceeds with 15. Raf1 and Carlsen responds with 15. ... Qd6, opening the path for his king to hide on the queenside. The clock keeps ticking down on the American challenger, who has less than 32 minutes (and counting) to make 25 moves before the time control. He’s had his hands full with Carlsen’s aggression in this opening game (1. ... c5 and 14. ... g5, most notably).The American then goes with 16. Ng4 and Carlsen castles (16. ... O-O-O). Says Russian grandmaster Sasha Grischuk: “Sometimes Magnus can lose his sense of danger, but so far he’s playing this game brilliantly.”Carlsen delivers something of a crowd-pleaser with 14. ... g5. It’s an ambitious stroke that suggests he’s not simply content to get rid of a black game. Meanwhile, reports of frigid temperatures in the playing hall appear to be confirmed by Carlsen’s decision to put a coat on. Caruana goes with 14. Qd2 and Carlsen has plenty of time to ponder his response. Here’s a look at the board as it stands. The American challenger has a little over 46 minutes to make 26 more moves before the next time control. (Remember: the time control for each game is 100 minutes for the first 40 moves, 50 minutes for the next 20 moves and then 15 minutes for the rest of the game plus an additional 30 seconds per move starting from move 1.)After Carlsen responds with 13. ... h6, it’s Caruana eating up clock again. The position on the board is even, but the American is heading toward 46min remaining, which is a half hour behind Carlsen (1hr 16min 32sec). Just spoke to the British grandmaster and commentator Daniel King, who runs the popular PowerPlayChess channel on YouTube. He was intrigued by Caruana’s 10. Nh2, where Qd2 is the more common move, and says while he regards the position as level that ‘it is great for the match that the position is opening up so quickly, giving both sides a chance to attack’.Carlsen goes with 12. ... Be6 and Caruana responds with 13. Rf2. A fascinating psychological battle developing in the opener, certainly more engaging than Game 1 of the last world championship in New York, where Carlsen played the seldom-used Trompowsky Attack (which he’d later confess was at least partially inspired by the name of America’s newly minted president-elect) but Sergey Karjakin scratched back to force a mostly forgettable draw after 42 moves.Caruana’s time management has been called into question, but it can’t be said that Black is better at this point.Another lengthy wait for Caruana, who finally settles on 11. f4. Carlsen takes a pawn with 11. ... exf4, and the American takes one back with 12. Rxf4. Carlsen back on the clock (1hr 26min) with a more than 20-minute advantage over Caruana (1hr 5min 37sec). Caruana finally settles on 10. Nh2 and Carlsen responds with 10. ... Nf8. Here’s a look at the board after 10 moves. Carlsen has a 12-minute advantage on the clock with 30 moves left until the first time control.Carlsen (1hr 33min 7sec) is already 15 minutes ahead of Caruana (1hr 18min and counting). Not a critical development yet, but it does appear Magnus has surprised the American challenger with his opening choice.Caruana playing with the white pieces opens with 1. e4 while Carlsen surprises with a Sicilian Defence response (1. ... c5). The opening continues with 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 g6 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. d3 Bg7.As predicted Woody Harrelson made the ceremonial first move. But not without a bit of confusion.Good afternoon from a slightly chaotic media room in Holborn, which unsurprisingly, is dominated by Norwegian journalists. Just been speaking to Bernt Brennevann from the NTB agency, who tells me he is just one of 15 reporters from Norway here to cover the Carlsen match, which is being covered on the main TV channel in the country. Also quickly popped into the gift shop, which has some slightly risque offerings. Make a move, anyone?The press room is now so busy it’s standing room only. Meanwhile, the actor Woody Harrelson has headed into the building wearing a suit and a light blue beanie hat. If the rumors are correct he’ll be making the first move.Here’s a look at the format for the world championship match. It will consist of 12 classical games with each player awarded one point for a win and a half-point for a draw. Whoever reaches six and a half points first will be declared the champion.The time control for each game is 100 minutes for the first 40 moves, 50 minutes for the next 20 moves and then 15 minutes for the rest of the game plus an additional 30 seconds per move starting from move 1. Players cannot agree to a draw before Black’s 30th move. If the match is tied after 12 games, tie-breaks will be played on the final day in the following order:  • Best of four rapid games with 25 minutes for each player with an increment of 10 seconds after each move.  • If still tied, they will play up to five mini-matches of two blitz games (five minutes for each player with a three-second increment). • If all five mini-matches are drawn, one sudden-death ‘Armageddon’ match will be played where White receives five minutes and Black receives four minutes. Both players will receive a three-second increment after the 60th move. In the case of a draw, Black will be declared the winner.Our Sean Ingle was at yesterday’s press conference at the College in Holborn, which you can watch below. It was a mostly conciliatory affair, as these things tend to be, and there is a very real mutual respect between the contestants. Yet Carlsen, when asked if he saw himself as the underdog or the favorite, couldn’t help but reveal signs of the alpha dog within.“It has been a while since I have considered myself an underdog, to be honest,” he said. “If you have been the No 1 ranked player in the world for seven years and have won three world titles in a row, then there is something seriously wrong with your psyche, I think.”Carlsen, 27, has been ranked No 1 for eight straight years and was considered the world’s best player even before he defeated Viswanathan Anand for the title in 2013. Caruana, 26, is ranked No 2, having earned his place the table by winning the candidates tournament in March. No American-born player has won or even competed for the world title since Bobby Fischer in 1972. It marks the first title match between the world’s top two players since 1990, when Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov faced off for a fifth and final time.We’re a little more than a half hour away from the ceremonial first move. Plenty more to come.Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime here’s Sean Ingle’s lookahead to the next three weeks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf9f4580f52c8e2623b02472cb229a0324de1885/0_17_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4cf8d6c1d4ea2c13eb36a4a7d1f36d4c","title":"womens world t20 australia v pakistan live","story":"8th over: Australia 72-1 (Mooney 23) Aliya Riaz is invited to bowl the first over of pace and immediately she looks more dangerous than her slow-bowling colleagues. Healy is fortunate to survive two mishit cover drives, both lofted in the direction of cover but both somehow avoiding going to hand. As is her wont, Healy brushes off those errors with the presence of mind to alter her hitting zone, guiding Aliya down to third for a boundary. And then she’s out! Final delivery of the over, Healy goes downtown, but she sends straight down Nahida’s throat at long-on. The end of a powerful and enterprising innings from Australia’s opener, setting up her side perfectly. 7th over: Australia 64-0 (Healy 41, Mooney 22) Another let off for Mooney! Nida Dar is back and the first delivery of her second over finds Mooney’s leading edge but the ball loops agonisingly over the bowler and just out of reach of the incoming cover fielder. Mooney responds by dropping to one knee and slog-sweeping through midwicket for four. 6th over: Australia 58-0 (Healy 40, Mooney 17) Nashra Sandhu is the fourth Pakistan player to be thrown the ball but her first delivery is eased sumptuously through extra-cover by Mooney. Her left-arm darts then force Mooney and Healy to check their shots before the latter opens her shoulders, smacking first over mid-on, then mid-off, to send the scoreboard rocketing along. Australia re going to rack up a massive total. 5th over: Australia 43-0 (Healy 32, Mooney 10) Anam Amin is back for her second over of left-arm finger spin and she delivers the first over of the match without a boundary, thanks largely to variety of angles denying either Australian the opportunity to line her up. 4th over: Australia 40-0 (Healy 32, Mooney 7) More poor fielding from Pakistan, this time Nida Dar dropping a sitter in the covers to hand Beth Mooney a life after some lovely bowling from Mir. Both Australians shaped up aggressively to the experienced Pakistani but her control of pace and length gave them nothing to hit cleanly and should have earned her a wicket. 3rd over: Australia 33-0 (Healy 31, Mooney 1) Healy is on a mission. Another new bowler and another array of boundaries all around the Providence Stadium. A misfield gifts a four through mid-off, a powerful drive through cover earns one more, and then a delightful late glance engineers a third for the over through the vacant slip cordon. Nida Dar will have some thinking to do before her second effort. 2nd over: Australia 19-0 (Healy 17, Mooney 1) The experienced Sana Mir shares the new ball for Pakistan but Healy is once again on top early, working her second ball nonchalantly through the legside for a boundary then dancing down the pitch and lofting another four over extra-cover. Mir’s off-spinners from over the wicket not doing much off this Guyana surface.1st over: Australia 10-0 (Healy 8, Mooney 1) Bosh! Australia up and running with intent. Alyssa Healy only required a couple of sighters to take Anam downtown, lofting ball number five into the sightscreen. Around that it was tidy stuff from the left-arm orthodox, aiming for the toes of the right-handed Healy from around the wicket and floating the up outside off against the left-handed Mooney.Here we go, Anam Amin with the ball for Pakistan, Alyssa Healy on strike for Australia.The two sides are making their way out for the anthems, Australia in their familiar all-gold uniform, Pakistan top to toe in green. Australia’s women will be out to emulate their men’s team who completed an ODI victory over South Africa a few hours ago in Adelaide. Quite the act for Australia to follow. This is match number two at this WT20. In the opener, India stunned a heavily fancied New Zealand to throw the cat among the pigeons in Group B. Once again the star of the show was Harmanpreet Kaur, the Indian skipper hammering 103 from just 51 deliveries. Pakistan opting for four spinners and just the one quick on a slow surface they expect to take some turn.Australia go in as expected with Sophie Molineux retaining her place ahead of Jess Jonassen. It won’t be long until our first look at Australia’s impressive batting line-up with Meg Lanning winning the toss and deciding to post a score. Lisa Sthalekar believes Australia will be motivated to right the wrongs of 2016 and are hitting form just at the right time.Everything is aligning nicely for the Australians, at the right time too. History is on their side, they are heading to a place where they have enjoyed success before and most importantly, they might have cracked the formula for World Cup success. The trophy cabinet may not stay empty for much longer.If you need to get up to speed on all the sides in the West Indies ahead of this WT20, never fear, Adam Collins has your back.Providence Stadium, you say? Not yet seven o’clock on the eastern seaboard? Around 29 minutes to the first ball of the day? Godspeed You! Black Emperor.Hello everybody and welcome to live OBO coverage of the second match in the Women’s World T20, this one featuring perennial favourites Australia against Pakistan. The first ball at Guyana’s Providence Stadium will be bowled at 4pm local time (8pm GMT  7am AEDT).After conceding possession of the WT20 trophy in 2016 for the first time since 2010 Australia will be out to make amends in the West Indies. They enter the tournament sitting on top of the ICC standings and with an imposing squad featuring three batters and two bowlers in the top ten of the inidual rankings for each craft. Coach Matthew Mott described the motivation in the Australian camp as one of “taking care of unfinished business” in reference to Hayley Matthews’ incredible knock that saw the West Indies triumph in the 2016 final. For Pakistan the mission is to progress beyond the group phase for the first time in a World T20 but they face an uphill task in a pool featuring not only Australia but India and New Zealand. Ranked seventh in the world by the ICC, remaining competitive will be no mean feat.These sides met recently in Kuala Lumpur with Australia dominating the three-match ODI series and claiming each of the three T20s with plenty to spare. In those three matches Pakistan could only muster a top score of 131, and finding enough runs to put pressure on Australia’s formidable batting order looks to be their biggest challenge today. Feel free to join in the conversation as the game progresses.

How could a show about a thousand nights on the dancefloor do otherwise? The final song is as inevitable as the guests at a wedding reception getting on their feet to the rousing chords of Whitney Houston’s I Wanna Dance With Somebody, and as the unmarried women showing their ringless fingers at the first sound of Beyoncé’s Single Ladies. It’s just what happens.There’s another way the Dexys Midnight Runners hit is a perfect match for Anna Jordan’s two-hander. With its lines about Johnny Ray moving hearts in mono, Come On Eileen is a song about pop music as much as it is about romance. Elsewhere on the Too-Rye-Ay album, Kevin Rowland writes songs about writing songs (witness Let’s Make This Precious), about capturing the perfect musical moment, about, as he sang, “trying to get the feeling that I had in 1972”.Similarly, Jordan’s play – ostensibly a romp through three decades of floor-fillers as two former school adversaries catch up on their years apart – is a contemplation of the place pop music has in our lives. Does it offer inspiration or fill a void? Does it give us the aspirational values of the Spice Girls or the hedonistic vacancy of some club anthem? Does it encapsulate those formative turning points or simply offer an escape route? Could it be all of the above?With her high-density rhymes in James Grieve’s taut production for Paines Plough and Birmingham Rep, Jordan goes a long way to capturing the oblivion and the ecstasy, the lust and the camaraderie of the dancefloor. As she takes us from boy bands to girl power, Britpop to acid house, the mood of the music reflects the changing circumstances of her thirtysomething dancers.Ranging from the sour to the carefree, Katherine Kotz and Rakesh Boury understand the pull between being one of the crowd and feeling as though they’re special. Mass-market entertainment soundtracks what they thought were unique lives. For all their iniduality, there’s not a dance routine they don’t know. Funny and true, this is a crowd-pleasing play with troubling depths."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11eddaab612147cab3ed4ec6f7b9c7909de4b8ac/0_81_2250_1350/master/2250.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=410835a83bc0f58a85cd759daf5f4427","title":"ten of the best theatre shows for christmas 2018","story":"Musical improv elves, cabaret and interactive hijinks abound in these festive shows for familiesExpect toil and trouble for Mildred Hubble, hapless student at Miss Cackle’s Academy for Witches, in a world premiere based on Jill Murphy’s books that promises music, illusions and kitten puppets. Emma Reeves, lead writer on the CBBC adaptation, has written a new story for the over-sevens that also revisits moments from the novels. It’s staged by Theresa Heskins, who has bewitched audiences for years with festive shows, especially as artistic director at Newcastle-under-Lyme’s New Vic, where her Wind in the Willows runs this Christmas.If the odd festive game of charades isn’t enough for you, head for the gleaming Spiegeltent, where this offshoot of the Olivier award-winning sensation (aimed at the over-sixes) is setting up camp for December. A team of musical improv elves will be hard at work to bring to life the young audience’s Christmas wishes – providing they’re requesting silly stories and zany songs. A show that knows kids are really in control at Christmas.Le Gateau Chocolat is a treat year-round, but this is a good time to catch the extravagantly talented cabaret artist’s first show for children. Ruffling the feathers of Hans Christian Andersen’s well-worn Ugly Duckling, his version for over-threes adds songs from The Lion King and the Pussycat Dolls along with a show-stopping Pure Imagination from Willy Wonka \u0026amp the Chocolate Factory. The broodingly lit stage, littered with junk shop finds, is a world away from multicoloured panto-land.Katie Mitchell’s foray into kids theatre was inspired by reading Dr Seuss to her daughter. Almost 10 years after its premiere at the National, it’s still surprising to find the adaptation on her CV sandwiched between the Crimps and Strindbergs. Suba Das directs this new staging (for the over-fours), designed by Isla Shaw. Nana Amoo-Gottfried is the nattily dressed kitty unleashing havoc, accompanied by blue-haired mischief-makers Thing 1 and Thing 2.Few theatres look as effortlessly festive as the shiny, bright red auditorium of the Egg. And very few host such consistently cracking kids theatre. Pins and Needles new show is for children over six (or younger “if of a brave disposition”), and it gives the hoary Reign of Terror adventure what it’s always needed: a new plot about French poodles pining to escape to England.Writer and illustrator Laura Dockrill has already created a winning heroine in her series of books featuring springy-haired 10-year-old Darcy Burdock. Now she turns her attention to Nottinghamshire’s most famous son, reinventing him as a female outlaw played by musician and character comic Georgia Bruce. While you can find Robin Hood on home turf this year in Nottingham Playhouse’s panto, Dockrill’s forest adventure (for children aged four and up) will be a good fit for this picturesque rural playhouse.Nick Sharratt and Pippa Goodhart’s picture book You Choose is a bedtime classic crammed with so many ideas for kids to create their own adventure that you may never get them to sleep. Nonsense Room Productions, who have previously staged Sharratt’s Shark in the Park, present an hour-long interactive version full of games and challenges and aimed at children aged two to seven.Jackie Hagan is a working-class theatre-maker and amputee whose touring show This Is Not a Safe Space offers an unflinching, anarchic account of disability benefit cuts. For her rather wonderfully named family show, co-presented by Manchester’s theatre for young people, Contact, she takes a realistic scenario of domestic disruption and adds a blast of glitter and fantasy as Red runs away from home to bump into three bears (that’s Bear Minimum, Bear Hug and Bear Grills). There’s creative integration of British Sign Language at every performance. For ages five and up.To quote from one of their shows, Uchenna Dance hook audiences into a mighty groove and choreographer Vicki Igbokwe promises tasty beats in her version of the gingerbread-house caper. In this modern dance-theatre version for the over-fives – composed by Kweku Aacht and written by Gbolahan Obisesan – the heroes get lost in the city, not the woods. Many festive kids shows are billed as a celebration of the imagination but few will get their young audience waacking and voguing like this.BAC’s Christmas show is inspired by local hero Jeanie Nassau Senior, a 19th-century campaigner, social reformer and pioneering civil servant dubbed the “first woman in Whitehall”. Senior lived in Elm House which once stood on the site of the arts centre, where children (aged six and over) will be given full run of the building on an immersive quest in search of clues to bring back her story."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/027774668281b0d4310ac7f1e2b4602a9b55295a/0_138_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ad565ca06cdfd36df2aefd07aa2c1df","title":"send a tip on independent tour guides for a chance to win a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Tells us about engaging, amusing and knowledgeable tour guides the world over whose services you have enjoyedA good guide or local contact can make a crucial difference to your enjoyment of a trip, bringing a destination to life with their passion, storytelling and wit.

He may have lost his plucky bid to win the first statewide election in Texas as a Democrat since 1994, but he came so close that he thoroughly wiped the smirks off Republican faces.For O’Rourke it marks a phenomenal achievement. In just 19 months, almost unassisted, he took the Texan Democratic party from its virtually moribund condition, gave it a stiff dose of adrenalin, and brought it back to life.For Texas, and for the US, the fact that O’Rourke came within striking distance represents something even bigger – the hope that the second largest state in the union might finally be freeing itself from the iron grip of the Republican party.That in turn raises a tantalizing prospect for progressives everywhere – if O’Rourke could do it in Texas, a place synonymous with the modern hardline Republican party, what could he do in other parts of the US?“If you look at the top line and see O’Rourke losing, you’re missing the point,” said Bethany Albertson, associate professor at University of Texas at Austin. “No Democrat has come close in Texas in decades, voter turnout was way up, and young people who have never voted before were drawn for the first time into the democratic process.”That’s a formula that the Democratic party nationwide is desperate to replicate. But how did he do it? What was the secret of the Beto magic?When O’Rourke set out on his unlikely mission he did so with the contemporary equivalent of a horse and cart. As Rolling Stone has pointed out, at that point he had two aides, both of them old friends from El Paso, and a rented sedan.He put them to good use. By election day he had spawned a vast army of 25,000 volunteers and had raised $70m – all of it through small donations through the online portal ActBlue, not a penny through big corporate donors – more than any US Senate campaign in history.O’Rourke wore through a lot of shoe leather in the process. He crisscrossed a state that is larger than France – from his hometown of El Paso to the eastern border of Texas is 900 miles – visiting each of its 254 counties. His message was: “I wouldn’t vote for a politician I had never seen either.”Wherever he went, he sprinkled seeds of Democratic rebirth. Using digital apps, he empowered volunteers in each county to begin mobilizing their neighbors. It was entirely decentralised, with next to no quality control, which meant trusting volunteers implicitly – but it succeeded in unleashing huge reserves of untapped energy.Carrie Collier-Brown, a lawyer from the suburbs of south-west Austin, was one of the new Beto super-volunteers. She described what it has been like this year creating a team of about 150 volunteers in her area out of nothing.“We built the infrastructure out of scraps and with no instructions,” she said. “It feels like we’ve been flying by the seat of our pants all year.”Together with a “bunch of pissed-off suburban women”, as she puts it, she set up in January a group of volunteers which they called “Blue Action Democrats”. Every weekend they knocked on hundreds of doors, liaising closely with the local Beto O’Rourke campaign staff.In the final weeks of the election they were supported by “pop-up offices”, more than 700 of which mushroomed across Texas. The offices were improvised out of volunteers’ spare rooms, studies, garages, garden sheds – any space where the all-important get-out-the-vote drive could be spearheaded.The numbers tell the story. Sixty-eight percent of registered voters in Collier-Brown’s area turned out and cast their ballot – twice the proportion in the last midterm elections in 2014 and slightly more even than the 2016 presidential election.Collier-Brown said that there was a price to pay – “My kids are very close to calling me Aunty Carrie” – but the gains have been immense. “The Beto campaign has taught us an important lesson: that connecting with your neighbors is how to engage everyone, how to take back our democracy, and ultimately how to win elections.”Mark Jones, a professor of political science at Rice University, thinks that 10-point swing was partly explained by a female backlash to the vulgarity, aggressive posturing and sexual impropriety of Donald Trump. But that was not all.“Beto O’Rourke wasn’t just campaigning against Trump. He was campaigning for a different kind of politics that are optimistic, positive. He spoke to thousands of people who are upset about the isiveness in America today.”Soon after O’Rourke had conceded defeat on Tuesday night, he addressed thousands of his loyal supporters in a baseball stadium in El Paso. He told them: “We’re not about being against anybody. We are not going to define ourselves by who or what we are against, or what we are afraid of or scared about. We are great people.”That message also spoke to the second key group mobilized by his campaign – young people. Again, the numbers tell the story.Not only did he win over young people in far greater proportions, he also crucially managed to unlock a door that has been frustratingly closed to progressive causes in vast swaths of America for years. He persuaded young voters who usually overwhelmingly opt to stay at home in midterm elections to get off their couches, get over to the polling stations, and vote.Figures for overall Texas turnout have yet to be completed, but early voting data is again stunning. The number of 18 to 29-year-olds casting an early ballot this year was five times greater than in the 2014 midterms.He also speaks the language of the young. He is fluent in Instagram and Snapchat, and has a flair for producing viral videos, whether air-drumming to the Who or skateboarding through a Whataburger parking lot.When the  talked shortly before the election to Karl Rove, the ultimate political kingmaker in Texas who helped turn the state Republican in the 1990s, he was dismissive about O’Rourke’s most viral video. In it, the Democratic candidate defended NFL players who had taken the knee during the national anthem in protest at police brutality, saying there was “nothing more American” than that.For Rove, that video demonstrated that O’Rourke would never be able to win over the mainstream of the Texan electorate as he was too outspokenly liberal. What Rove may not have counted on, however, was how electrifying such a statement might have been for many younger Texans who are more receptive to new expressions of patriotism.O’Rourke amplified his natural affinity with younger voters through a heavy push on social media. Much of the $70m he raised through small online donations – twice the amount brought in by his opponent – went on digital advertising, especially on Facebook where ads were kept to six seconds or less and tightly targeted both geographically and on voters’ personal interests.According to the Texas Tribune, for much of 2018 his campaign invested more than any other political advertiser on Facebook. In the last six months more than $6m of O’Rourke ads on the site were viewed almost 20 million times.Young voters, white women, Latinos, online fundraising, digital advertising, social media, volunteering, shoe leather – the Beto O’Rourke campaign had it all in terms of modern electioneering. It may have been largely improvised, and there was no instruction manual, but it did the job.Not only did it bring O’Rourke within a whisker of pulling off the biggest political upset in decades, it also had a knock-on effect for other Democratic candidates lower down the ticket.The impact was even more pronounced in the state legislature where two Republican state senators were turfed out and at least 12 Texas House seats flipped from the Republicans to Democrats.In many ways the explosion of energy that O’Rourke has brought to the progressive movement in Texas bears comparison to the equally audacious campaign conjured up by Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential race.Both politicians are notable for their charisma and rhetorical skills, and for the skill in which they communicated through social media and in person.Which is why, perhaps inevitably, whispers of “Beto 2020” can already be heard floating in the Texas wind. “Beto has done the near impossible,” said Mark Jones. “If he wants to run for the White House, there’s definitely a lane open for him.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6072b59df68f83b5f9fbe3020304a82c31d9800/0_62_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c0e9e3d6c2f8d24d1d730e8194b694c","title":"florida georgia midterms recounts irregularities","story":"Florida and Georgia were preparing for ballot recounts on Friday, as contentious races for the US Senate and state governorships descended into controversy amid Republicans’ accusations of Democratic vote tampering, and counter-questions about potentially confusing ballot papers.The Florida candidates for Senate – current governor Rick Scott, a Republican, and Democrat Bill Nelson – were separated by just 15,000 votes on Friday morning, which could lead to a recount.The governors’ elections in Florida and Georgia were almost as close, raising the possibility of a further recount and a possible runoff election respectively.Florida’s Senate race was thrown into chaos on Thursday night when Scott, without providing evidence, accused “unethical liberals” of attempting to “steal this election”.Donald Trump weighed in in support of Scott on Friday, saying he would send lawyers to Florida to expose unspecified “fraud” and, apparently jokingly, suggested Russia may be to blame.In a press conference at the governor’s mansion Scott said he had filed two lawsuits against election supervisors in the traditionally Democratic-leaning Broward county and Palm Beach. Scott suggested election supervisors there may have been trying to inflate the Democratic vote.Nelson’s campaign has hired lawyer Marc Elias, who has previously worked for Hillary Clinton and former US senator Al Franken, to investigate whether all votes have been counted in Florida.Nelson’s campaign filed its own lawsuit to ask a federal judge to extend Saturday’s deadline for county supervisors to submit their tallies to the state, demanding extra time for every vote to be counted.Elias has suggested there may have been an error in counting some votes in Broward county and believes the gap between Scott and Nelson will continue to narrow.The appointment of Elias angered Trump.“As soon as Democrats sent their best Election stealing lawyer, Marc Elias, to Broward County they miraculously started finding Democrat votes. Don’t worry, Florida - I am sending much better lawyers to expose the FRAUD!” the president tweeted.“You mean they are just now finding votes in Florida and Georgia – but the Election was on Tuesday? Let’s blame the Russians and demand an immediate apology from President Putin!”As Scott announced his lawsuits, questions began to be asked about ballot papers which did not clearly indicate how to vote in the Senate election.CNN reported that nearly 25,000 voters in Broward county had cast a vote for governor but not for one of the Senate candidates – a discrepancy that CNN said was not matched in other counties.Photos shared on Twitter showed that on the ballot papers in Broward county the section where voters could opt for Scott or Nelson was located in the bottom left of the ballot, beneath instructions on how to vote. In other counties the section for Scott and Nelson was presented more prominently at the top of the ballot. Broward county leans heavily Democratic, meaning the different ballots could have resulted in fewer votes for Nelson.Election officials in Broward and Palm Beach, two of Florida’s most heavily populated counties, have insisted they were held up by a large number of early and mail-in ballots, with the Broward election supervisor’s website reporting Friday that only a number of early voting returns were still outstanding.Automatic statewide recounts in the senate and governor’s races are likely to be triggered at lunchtime Saturday, when unofficial returns from Florida’s 67 counties must be delivered to secretary of state Ken Detzner.Following the recounts, Florida’s elections canvassing committee meets on 20 November to make all the results official.“On Tuesday night, the Gillum for Governor campaign operated with the best information available about the number of outstanding ballots left to count. Since that time, it has become clear there are many more uncounted ballots than was originally reported,” Gillum’s campaign said. “We are committed to ensuring every single vote in Florida is counted.”In a tweet late Thursday, Gillum did not withdraw the concession, but hit back at Scott’s accusation that leftwing activists were at work. “Counting votes isn’t partisan – it’s democracy,” he wrote.Neither the Associated Press nor CNN have called the race.Meanwhile, in Arizona’s Senate race, Democrat Kyrsten Sinema took a minuscule lead of about 9,000 out of 1.9 million votes counted after trailing since Tuesday. The race remained too close to call with at least 400,000 ballots still uncounted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e959558579780fddb5257eae8eeec6b07a48d0f/812_197_3415_2049/master/3415.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6eac45de8280569c63b37b62c3806d51","title":"shes made us proud ilhan omars journey from somali refugee to us congresswoman","story":"Former neighbours of Ilhan Omar at the camp are celebrating the Somali’s election victoryFadumo Kuusow remembers a thin and shy girl who lived next door. Her memory is hazy as the girl left more than 20 years ago.Last week Kuusow organised a small celebration with friends in Ifo camp, one of a vast complex of refugee settlements on dry, scrubby plains around the remote Kenyan town of Dadaab. Eight thousand miles away that thin, shy girl – now 37 – had just become the member elect of the US House of Representatives for Minnesota’s fifth district.Ilhan Omar, a Democrat, will assume office in January, sharing the historic distinction with Rashida Tlaib of being the first  Muslim women elected to the US Congress.“The women here talked about her. I remember in the hot weather afternoon, Ilhan and I used to play jumping rope near our homes. My family lived in a tent and Ilhan’s family lived in a makeshift structure made of sticks and cloth,” she said when reached by telephone by the .Omar was born in the Somali capital, Mogadishu, but was raised in the inland town of Baidoa. She fled Somalia’s civil war with her parents at the age of eight and spent four years at what became known as the Dadaab camp in neighbouring Kenya.Now a vast, impoverished city with an estimated population of at least 250,000 people, conditions were rudimentary when Omar was a resident. Many refugees had arrived from Somalia with nothing more than they could carry.“We were neighbours in Ifo camp within Dadaab complex,” Kuusow, 40, said. “Life was very tough those days. That was soon after the civil war in Somalia and many people were coming to the camp. I remember in the beginning we did not get school here.“Camp security was a disaster. Girls and women were raped and we always feared about men. I can remember when it was evening my mother could not allow me to go outside because of the risk.”In 1995, Omar arrived in the US as a refugee, settling first in Arlington, Virginia, before moving to Minneapolis in 1997. She won a seat in the state’s legislature in 2016, becoming the first Somali-American lawmaker in the country. She had previously worked as a community organiser, a policy wonk for city leaders in Minneapolis, and as a leader in her local chapter of the African-American civil rights group the NAACP.“I saw her on the television last night when her election victory was projected. Well done I can say. She tried her best. Thank God she has won now,” said Kuusow.Abdullahi Osman Haji Adam came to Dadaab with his family in 1991 and he too remembers Omar in the refugee camp.“What I can tell about her is only her smile and how shy she was. She was eight years old. She did not talk much.“The camp had no hospital and no emergency service available. The only ambulance service we could find was one wheelbarrow which we used to carry sick people to a far away hospital. We had no school for two years.”On Friday, Adam, 46, attended morning prayers at the camp’s mosque where elders prayed for the new congresswoman.“We are glad that she won. She made us proud as refugees and Somalis. This shows that even if you are a refugee, you can still succeed. We pray for her and hope she will support the refugees. She must know that we are here in Dadaab,” he said.Two years ago Kenya’s government said it would close Dabaab. It has been unable to do so, but the threat of a new closure effort hangs over residents. Food rations are inadequate after cuts in funding to international agencies.Omar Sheikh Ahmed, 48, a cousin of Omar’s father, said the politician was “our star”.“Her voice in Congress represents the minorities and refugees are minorities. She knows that we in Dadaab have no good schools. We are facing a food ration shortage. We do not have freedom of movement. Our future is shattered.”For many in Dadaab, the US refugee resettlement programme was their principal hope of a better future. Since its creation in 1980, the programme has led to hundreds of thousands of people from around the world being admitted to the US.Last year, hundreds of Somali refugees in Kenya who were days from travelling to the US to start new lives under the programme were told they could not travel, after Donald Trump’s executive order banned migrants from seven Muslim-majority countries for three months.Since then, more stringent vetting and a review of procedures has led to a dramatic drop in refugees reaching the US.“Ilhan is a very special woman for refugees in Dadaab. She won at a time when refugees are facing challenges. Everyone says refugees are bad but she proved them wrong,” Adam, who is the current leader of Ifo camp, said.Kuusow had one urgent request for Omar: “I want to appeal to Ilhan: please come and visit us here in Dadaab. We’ll welcome you as our daughter.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d681bc4c7d2c7a56118738f791827237cb80982/0_97_2200_1319/master/2200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d954237d2bc946720ef03ba1439ee1db","title":"chile former army chief convicted pinochet regime","story":"He is the most senior figure to be held accountable for abuses committed during Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorshipA Chilean judge has convicted the country’s former army chief for complicity in the deaths of 15 people during the early days of Augusto Pinochet’s military regime.Juan Emilio Cheyre, 70, was sentenced to three years and a day under house arrest following an inquiry by an investigating magistrate.Cheyre is the most senior figure so far to be held accountable for abuses committed after Pinochet overthrew the former Chilean president Salvador Allende in a military coup in 1973.Cheyre became emblematic of the national transition from dictatorship to democracy that began in 1990. As commander-in-chief of the armed forces between 2002 and 2006, he was the first to ask forgiveness for the military’s past excesses.But his tenure was clouded by an investigation into his involvement with Chile’s notorious “Caravan of Death” military committee, which traversed the country in the months following the coup, killing and ordering the murder of leftists.Cheyre’s conviction follows those of more than 1,000 former agents, soldiers and collaborators of the Pinochet regime for human rights abuses despite an initial reticence on the part of the authorities to reopen old wounds.Pinochet himself died in 2006 without ever being convicted of human rights abuses.Mario Carroza, the investigating judge designed by Chile’s appeal court to lead the investigation, told reporters on Friday that the conviction of a former army chief illustrated the “egalitarian” justice system Chile now enjoys.“It has been an extensive and complex investigation, above all because we did not have the cooperation of those implicated,” he said.Following Allende’s overthrow, Cheyre served as adjutant to the commander of the infantry regiment for the coastal city of La Serena, 290 miles (470 km) north of Santiago. There he witnessed the murder of 15 people by fellow officers on the orders of the Caravan, which arrived in the city the month after the September 1973 coup.Ariosto Lapostol, the former commander of the Arica regiment stationed at La Serena, was on Friday ordered by the same court to serve 15 years in prison for the multiple murders.During Pinochet’s 1973-90 dictatorship, an estimated 3,200 people were murdered and an additional 28,000 tortured by the state."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/928f70babb3a4051d05b40df902b955da44521e9/0_32_5472_3284/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96b408fa88343451f50da06c25642f23","title":"russia hosts talks between taliban and afghan peace council","story":"Meeting furthers Kremlin’s drive to be seen as international broker of peace Russia has hosted talks with Taliban delegates and members of Afghanistan’s high peace council, as the Kremlin seeks a role as peace broker between Islamist rebels and the US-backed government in Kabul.The meeting on Friday demonstrated Moscow’s renewed aspirations in Afghanistan almost 30 years after the Soviet Union withdrew its battered forces.Russia’s foreign ministry touted the attendance of the Taliban, who sent a five-person delegation to Moscow from their political office in Doha, as unprecedented for an international conference aimed at peace in Afghanistan, although the meeting produced few concrete results.The Afghan government did not send direct representatives to Friday’s talks, electing instead to send members of the peace council “in its own capacity as a national but non-government institution”.The Afghan government and the Taliban both denied that the conference marked direct negotiations for peace. But Russia’s foreign ministry focused attention on the spectacle of delegates from both sides of the line in Afghanistan sitting together at Moscow’s President hotel, alongside representatives from Iran, China, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan.“Participation in today’s event should become an important contribution to the creation of favourable conditions for the launch of direct talks between the government, the Taliban movement and representatives of the wide range of the country’s social and political circles,” said the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, speaking during a short public introduction.Moscow has sought a greater role in international diplomacy in recent years, with efforts at settling conflicts that often give a junior role to the US. Russia also initiated talks on a Syrian peace process co-sponsored by regional powers Turkey and Iran.In both cases, the US has had an active military presence inside the countries. The US launched its intervention against Islamic State in Syria in 2014. US troops have been fighting in Afghanistan since the 2001 invasion that was launched to dismantle al-Qaida and topple the Taliban.Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanekzai, the head of the Taliban’s political wing which has headquarters in Qatar, said the group would not negotiate directly with Kabul and demanded that all foreign troops leave Afghanistan.The Taliban said they would continue direct negotiations with Washington, which have been spearheaded by the US diplomat Zalmay Khalilzad.“We do not recognise the incumbent government as legitimate,” Stanekzai said, according to remarks carried by Russian news agencies. “Therefore, we won’t hold negotiations with it. Kabul didn’t even send a representative to this conference.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c51c05a8d84b71fcae2848d1b3784a7bbfd79a0/385_128_3056_1834/master/3056.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38eb1cbf301c52c9ac73e54db265ca72","title":"sri lanka president dissolves parliament in bid to end power struggle","story":"The country has been engulfed by a political crisis over the ousting of its prime ministerSri Lanka’s president, Maithripala Sirisena, has dissolved the country’s parliament in a gamble that a new election will secure backing for his preferred candidate as prime minister over an ousted premier who has refused to leave. Sirisena signed a decree dismissing the island’s 225-member assembly just hours after his party admitted it did not have enough votes to support former president Mahinda Rajapakse against rival claimant Ranil Wickremesinghe.The two have been battling for the prime minister’s post for two weeks as international concern grows over the mounting turmoil.A minister, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the official notification would take effect at midnight on Friday. Before signing the order, Sirisena inducted more ministers into the cabinet headed by Rajapakse.“The election is likely to be held in early January,” the minister said. Normally an election would not be held until 2020.Sirisena sparked the crisis on 26 October by sacking Wickremesinghe and replacing him as prime minister with Rajapakse, the country’s authoritarian president from 2005 until 2015.Wickremesinghe has since refused to leave the premier’s official residence after the president suspended parliament to head off any revolt against his action.In the latest twist in the crisis, Sirisena’s United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) said ahead of the president’s stunning announcement they were at least eight legislators short of getting a majority for Rajapakse in the assembly.“At the moment we have 104 or 105 MPs,” UPFA’s spokesman Keheliya Rambukwella told reporters, adding that the Sirisena-Rajapakse group hoped to secure support from “crossover” legislators.Sirisena had claimed on Monday he had the support of 113 legislators when he sacked Wickremesinghe. But the admission of a lack of a majority had fuelled speculation that he might sack the legislature and go for a snap election.The leftist People’s Liberation Front (JVP), which regards the sacking of Wickremesinghe as unconstitutional, accused Sirisena of trying to consolidate his power grab.“Dissolving parliament at this time is illegal and goes against the constitution,” JVP’s general secretary, Tilvin Silva, told reporters.Sirisena suspended parliament to give himself more time to engineer defections, according to the opposition. Several legislators have said they were offered millions of dollars to switch allegiance and at least eight have already jumped to the president’s side.Wickremesinghe, who has not left the Temple Trees residence since his sacking, maintains that the action against him was unconstitutional and illegal, and insists his group can muster a majority.According to an AFP count, he and his allies have the support of 120 MPs while Rajapakse and Sirisena have 104. The speaker, the 225th member, is neutral.Under pressure from the UN, the US and the EU to allow a parliamentary vote, Sirisena agreed three times to lift the suspension but changed his mind each time.The EU said on Friday, before the dissolution, that the crisis had scarred the Indian Ocean island’s international reputation.The EU, in a joint statement with Norway and Switzerland, called for parliament to reconvene and hold an immediate vote.“Any further delay could damage Sri Lanka’s international reputation and deter investors,” the statement said.On Thursday Wickremesinghe thanked his supporters and urged them not to give up in the showdown.“In extraordinary numbers and with extraordinary courage you came out on to the streets, you spoke out,” Wickremesinghe said in a Facebook video.“You have not let this country be plunged into the darkness of dictatorship. For this inspiring effort, I want to thank everyone who has risen to fight for democracy and justice.”The power struggle on the island of 21 million people has paralysed much of the administration, according to legislators on both sides of the dispute."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fedbadad2f4cb0e61f2322420ea0d09670381d6/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c0efd9e9c6b5064772e89209238fd3d","title":"the secret lives of trees what to expect in autumn","story":"It’s the season to get lost in beautiful shades of reds, yellows and oranges – but do you know the science behind these vibrant displays, or the role fungi play in the season?“The trees are in their autumn beauty,” wrote the Irish poet William Butler Yeats. “The woodland paths are dry.” Immersed in rich colour and deliciously crunchy underfoot, a woodland walk in autumn is surely one of the most pleasurable and relaxing activities offered by the British countryside.Yet, those excursions are not always quite as straightforward as they appear. For one thing, British trees are rather complicated in their leaf-shedding habits and really vary according to location – autumn takes a while to arrive across the whole country.In the Scottish Highlands, for instance, the woods of the glens are already steeped in golden yellow as early as mid-September. Their canopies are also susceptible to immediate demolition should an early Atlantic storm pass through.In Derbyshire, many woods can often be cleared of vegetation by late October – yet, at the same date in Norfolk, which is more than 300 metres lower in altitude, there are oakwoods looking as emerald green as they did in midsummer. Come November, many trees seem to have barely cast a leaf.Another interesting thing about that leisurely autumn stroll is the environmental intensity that underpins it. Poet John Keats may have famously called it the “season of mists and mellow fruitfulness”, but it is anything but. What really drives those glorious colours in the trees is the stress of hard work.The element of almost all plants responsible for making summer so green is chlorophyll. But as well as being the miracle worker that turns sunlight to sugar during photosynthesis, chlorophyll is also a precious protein. Before they shed their leaves at the end of season, deciduous trees devote themselves to breaking it down and storing it away for another year.Sugar also plays a part in one of autumn’s most dramatic changes. It reacts with proteins in leaf cells to produce an antioxidant called anthocyanin. It is this red-pigmented agent that supplies the slow-burning glow of British woods. Ironically, the more stressed the trees are, the richer those reds seem to be. Autumn foliage is often more intense, for example, after sharp frosts.Of course, there’s more to the season’s full palate of colour. When you think of the lemon and burnt-biscuit fingers, say, of horse chestnuts, or the dull copper carpet that covers the floor of a December oakwood, those browns and yellows are what happens when a tree’s foliage loses all its chlorophyll.But what really makes autumn such a spectacle is that all these extraordinary colours occur together: so you might get the crimson of London planes colliding with the emerald of holly and ivy, or the scarlet berries of hawthorn and dog rose at the same time as the infinite earth tones of toadstools.Mushrooms may be the most modest player in this infinity of colour, but they supply the other great engine of autumnal change. It is the season when we get to see the extraordinary fruiting bodies, the so-called “toadstools” of fungi. It seems more than coincidence that these bizarre organisms are substantially made from the same stuff as insects – chitin – because, like insects, they have a gift for unexpected appearance. Suddenly they bulb up among tree roots, or emerge out of the heartwood like some chest-bursting creature from Ridley Scott’s Alien.These are the parts that digest the organism’s vegetable diet and then traffic it through the woodland floor. They also play a part in the development and maintenance of the canopy, because fungi in woods forge essential partnerships, whereby the roots of the trees interconnect with what are called mycorrhizal fungi. This link between trees and fungi enables them to share vital nutrients.In a single kilo of woodland soil there can be six miles of hyphae. Beneath an inidual wood, there will be many millions of miles of these fungal networks, and they are at the heart of the extraordinary demolition procedure that is at autumn.Without fungi, the world would be buried in this vegetable junk and life would stagnate for the lack of carbon dioxide.So next time you stroll along a woodland path in autumn with trees changing colour, remember that it’s these incredible underlying, unseen essentials that make everything around us possible."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3684184.1541167032!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"no more buck passing or dithering dublin needs a new boss","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIllustration: Fuchsia MacAreeThere’s a classic trope in horror films where the protagonist sets aside the norms of rational behaviour and goes down into an unlit cellar, or gets into a car with an obviously unhinged stranger, while the audience can see the terrible event about to unfold and are willing the victim to retreat.It’s a feeling that will be familiar to any long-time observer of Dublin local authority proceedings. Impending disaster is painfully apparent and yet, time and again, councillors willingly and wilfully hurl themselves lemming-like over cliffs to lose their limited powers in the ravine at the bottom.In 2001, councillors – all councillors not just Dublin ones – lost their powers over waste collection and disposal, following their failure to ratify plans for waste disposal facilities, or any form of waste charging. As a result this power was transferred to council management, hugely unpopular bin charges were introduced, and the Poolbeg incinerator, which all parties opposed, was built.More recently, the failure to agree a route for the Liffey cycle path, which had been six years in the planning, resulted in the scheme being removed from the control of Dublin City Council and handed over to the National Transport Authority.In this case it wasn’t just the councillors (who couldn’t agree traffic ersions past their constituents’ houses) who were to blame, but also council officials, who produced endless iterations of the scheme, one of which saw double-decker buses rerouted through an existing apartment block.The most recent, and one of the most damning failures or officialdom to get to grips with decision making, is the College Green plaza refusal farce. The council tip-toed around the issue for a decade, tinkering with selective traffic restrictions, musing over fountains and statuary, but never really grasping the problem, which required getting buy-in from Dublin Bus before the project went to An Bord Pleanála for approval – a step which itself should have been taken years before.Surely there’s a better way of getting things done in the city. Could this dithering, bottling, buck-passing and procrastination be solved by Dublin having a directly elected mayor?“The central power, the most important point, of having a directly elected mayor, is that they have a ‘bully pulpit’,” Dr Deiric Ó Broin, DIT academic and co-author of the upcoming book Mayoral Governance in Dublin, argues.“The elected role gives them the authority to argue for more investment in the city, for keeping a more appropriate share of the money generated in Dublin. And they have to deliver their job is on the line. If they don’t deliver they may not be re-elected. That concentrates minds.”However, the concept of a mayor is one thing, the reality of the role and its functions is quite another, Ó Broin says.“The big issue is what powers the mayor would have and where would they come from. There is no point if the mayor is just a lord mayor, as in they have significant ceremonial but minor functional role, but who lasts for a five-year term.”Dublin city chief executive Owen Keegan agrees. “If it is to be successful the directly elected mayor has to have real powers, but he or she can only have real powers where the powers are taken from somewhere else. This notion that there’s some unallocated power that you can give to the mayor has no basis in reality – all power is already allocated.”And there isn’t much power within the hands of the council to give to a new mayor, Keegan says. “Since local government is weak here, the power and functions would have to come from central government, and that is a real issue because if there’s a directly elected mayor who is responsible for energy, and communications and transport in Dublin it doesn’t leave very much for the central Government to do.”Another vexing issue is what physical area would be governed by the mayor. “Culturally and politically we are obsessed with counties and county boundaries. I could see an argument for a city-only directly elected mayor and that gets away from that problem, but I don’t see how a city-based mayor could have responsibility for transport in Dublin, which crosses local authority boundaries,” Ó Broin says.This issue of boundaries played a large part in the collapse of the last mayoral plan. In 2013, then minister for the environment Phil Hogan decided, despite there being no legal requirement, that the councillors in all four Dublin local authorities would have to be in favour before Dubliners would get a chance to vote in a plebiscite on whether or not to have a mayor.The following year Dublin City, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, and South Dublin voted overwhelmingly in favour of the proposal but it was vetoed by Fingal, whose councillors felt they would be the poor country cousins, largely ignored by a city-focused mayor who would only be after their airport.As Gerry McGuire, a Labour councillor at the time, said there would be “no chance of getting a pothole fixed in rural Fingal”.Hogan showing great fortitude in keeping a straight face said he was “disappointed” as he was “the greatest proponent of devolution probably in the history of the State”.Last year the Government revived the mayoral proposal, making provision for a plebiscite this year, but it has recently kicked the can down the road, and kicked it out of the capital, determining that regional cities would vote at next year’s local elections on whether to have a mayor, but in Dublin it would first be referred to a citizens’ assembly for the capital.It seems like another unnecessary hurdle given that a similar forum spent five months formulating proposals for the mayor’s role in 2013, and, at that time surveys showed public support for a Dublin mayor was up to 80 per cent.Even if Dublin does get a mayor, what the Government appears to be proposing is a toothless role, either a mayor with the same powers as the current lord mayor, except elected, or an “executive mayor” who would take on some of the functions of the council chief executive.A plebiscite to decide whether there should be a mayor is unnecessary, Lacey says. “If the Government is serious about making progress let them legislate for it now. There is no need for a plebiscite. Successive governments never sought permission as they systematically dismantled local government in the past, so let them just repair it.”However, Lacey does not believe it’s necessary that the mayor would be all-powerful from the outset. “Calling for the full range of powers to be set out in advance is misguided. This is a position and a role that needs to be established and then given space to evolve.”But he says he can see particular areas where a mayor could make achievements straight away which might seem minor, but would be significant.“A mayor could initially have responsibility for natural resources. For example there isn’t much point in Dublin City Council cleaning the river Dodder in Donnybrook, if it’s not being cleaned first in Tallaght. Or sports capital grants – it makes no sense for a civil servant sitting in an office in Kerry to decide what local sports organisation in Dublin gets a grant.”Then, he suggests, other powers could be added such as waste and traffic policy, which should be “brought back under control of the council anyway”, he said.Ó Broin cites the system in Copenhagen as one where the mayor having control of these services works well. “The mayor has responsibility for education, welfare, labour services, welfare, climate change and a range of municipal services – Denmark, and Scandinavian countries in general, have very good, empowered local government.”Further afield, Boston and Toronto are recognised as good examples of mayor-led cities, he says. While our nearest neighbours have had some successful mayors, in some British cities, including Stoke-on-Trent, they have scrapped the office.The London model, Lacey believes, is not the system that should be copied in Dublin. “I don’t think the London model is a good one, with an all powerful mayor and a fairly toothless assembly. I’d like to a see a mayor working in partnership with a much smaller council – 24 or even 18 councillors. We should reduce the four councils to a manageable size, and give them more responsibility.”Keegan thinks the London model has worked well, particularly in relation to the mayor’s transport and policing supervisory functions, but he is with Lacey on the reducing in numbers of councillors from the current 63 in the city.“I am impressed by cities that have a small number of full-time councillors. In many cases they have executive functions. I think these councils, with a large number of councillors, make everything very difficult. Dublin City Council is too large. We are twinned with San Jose, where there’s a mayor, and I think they have eight or nine council members.”Keegan, however, remains unconvinced of the merits of having a mayor in Dublin. “I am a little bit concerned that the next ‘big idea’ is the directly elected mayor, and we’ll all lorry into that with great enthusiasm, but I have seen very little convincing analysis as to why this is such a good idea.“It’s been presented as a panacea to everything that’s wrong in Dublin, that will automatically be made right the day after we have a directly elected mayor.”Dublin doesn’t get credit for its success he says. “I don’t accept the notion that Dublin is a basket case. On many parameters Dublin is a very successful city. A good litmus test is the multinationals. They come here because they can attract people to live here. Of course it has problems with transport, and housing but these are problems of success. There was no housing affordability problem when we were in the depths of recession.”The “mad rush” towards the directly elected mayor idea reminds him of the “mad rush” to set up Irish Water. “Water supply was and is a major challenge but there was a notion that if you set up a separate utility everything would be hunky dory, but its implementation left a lot to be desired.”If the implementation of the mayor is poor, Dublin could find itself losing more than it gains, Keegan says.“There are strong arguments for a directly elected mayor, and I’m not saying there isn’t scope for improvement in the city’s governance, but there is a danger if we rush into this it won’t achieve any of its objectives, we’ll lose the things that work, and we’ll be worse off.”Each of the proposals in this Capital Ideas series has been put to a group of three experts for an initial “back of an envelope” evaluation. They are: Frances Ruane, former director of the Economic and Social Research Institute Caroline Spillane, director general of Engineers Ireland and Cliff Taylor, economics columnist with The .Caroline Spillane I have reservations about this plan, particularly due to the size of Dublin relative to the country as a whole. One person would have responsibility for 40 per cent of our population. The powers of this office would need to be carefully defined.The proposed mayor would be in a position of power for only five years, which could lead to short-term thinking.Cliff Taylor This proposal has surfaced in various forms over the years and fits into a common theme that restructuring institutions or posts can fix problems. This could be a good idea, but the job spec, powers and budget are key. The benefit depends on how it is structured – and who is elected, of course.It is a useful proposal but to work it requires a new vision for local government, something talked about for years and years but never delivered.Frances Ruane Cities with elected mayors seem to work well. However, in Ireland, this would have to be set up as part of a rebalancing of central and local government, if it is to work. If the city itself does not have decision-making power, then adding a mayor will not solve the problem.Meanwhile, Dublin City Council should work on its governance and adopt an integrated problem-solving planning approach. This must involve all four authorities working together. That would involve no serious resource costs.How can we improve Dublin city\u0026rsquos infrastructure, services and daily life?

Whether all 27 states are prepared to go along, however, is not yet clear.This weekend, the Department of Justice (which has responsibility for everything to do with timekeeping) is announcing plans for its public consultation here on the proposal.A recent European Commission online public consultation across the EU found 84 per cent of citizens were in favour of ending the changing of clocks in spring and autumn.The commission trumpeted the fact that it had got 4.6 million responses, the highest number ever received in an exercise of this sort, and that 84 per cent of those backed the change to a single year-round time.Less loudly advertised was the fact that engagement varied significantly from country to country three million of those responses came from Germany, representing almost 4 per cent of that country’s population. In contrast, less than 0.25 per cent of Irish people bothered to respond.The question now is whether inidual member states will agree to proceed along the lines advocated by the commission, which has stated a preference for summer time to be applied universally. There is potential for chaos, with a patchwork of time zones emerging across continental Europe.Initial polling, for example, suggests people in the Netherlands and Denmark would prefer permanent winter time, while Germans want summer time.“We are not proposing that the whole EU either switches to summer or winter time,” said transport commissioner Violeta Bulc at a press conference last month. “All we are proposing is that we do it together.”But clock-switching on the Dutch-German border is hardly the desired outcome.An intriguing twist from the Irish perspective is whether the UK, at a moment of heightened political tension, will view this as a symbolic opportunity to flaunt its newly acquired independence.Brexiteers’ enthusiasm for such a stance may be dimmed when they realise it would mean Britain sharing a time zone with Brussels and Berlin for almost half the year.But understandably, media coverage here so far has focused on the prospect of travellers from Dundalk to Newry having to adjust their watches – or of people nipping across from Lifford to Strabane in search of an extra hour’s drinking time.For geographical and historical reasons, Ireland and the UK have been on the same clock since Dublin Time was abolished in the wake of the Rising in 1916.We moved in lockstep with the UK when it experimented with year-round summer time in the late 1960s, and any recent proposals for change, such as one mooted in a Private Members’ Bill rejected by then minister for justice Alan Shatter in 2013, have been contingent on decisions made at Westminster and, more recently, in Brussels.So what would the changes mean? If Ireland opts for year-round daylight-saving\u0026nbsptime, then dawn won’t break in the west of Ireland until almost 10am in mid-December. However, if “winter time” is maintained throughout the year, sunrise in Dublin will occur well before 4am in June, and the stretch in the evenings will be a lot less grand, with sunset happening before 9pm even in midsummer.Those are the extremes, but where permanent summer time offers real gains is in the “shoulder months” of November, February and March, when the majority of people will have much more daylight at the end of their school or working day without too much negative impact in the mornings.There has been a broad attempt across the world in recent decades to do away with annual time-shifts, based on data about their negative health effects and on a more general sense that an additional hour of daylight in the evening is more valuable than one in the morning.Meanwhile, the main rationale for the current system – reduced electricity usage – has been rendered less important by the introduction in recent years of energy-efficient electric lighting. Lifestyles have also changed enormously since the current system’s introduction a century ago, and even since the last experimental change 50 years ago.Flexible working time, increased leisure opportunities and longer retail opening hours all have an effect on how we spend our day.The main impediment to change, it seems, is institutional. In the US, legislators in California and other states are also pushing for year-round daylight-saving\u0026nbsptime, but they need to persuade the federal government before they can proceed. As in the EU, American legislation allows each state to decide its time zone but forbids inidual states from choosing when or if to change their seasonal clocks. Whether the gridlocked US political system can respond remains to be seen.Here, the Department of Justice’s public consultation asks three questions. Do you want to stop changing the clocks twice a year? If the clock changes stop, do you want to remain on summer time or winter time? Is staying on the same time as the UK more important than your choice of summertimewintertime?“It is very important that as many citizens as possible respond to this consultation and express their views so that the Government may take account of public opinion when considering this proposal by the EU,” says Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan, clearly implying that the Government will take account of public opinion without being bound by it.Ultimately the success or failure of the proposal may come to be seen as a test of the EU’s ability to act quickly and decisively on a simple issue which will have an almost immediate effect upon people’s lives. The process so far has been startlingly fast, but the national consultations may be a different matter, depending perhaps on the views of the people who get up early in the morning."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3691344.1541712776!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"how did the hse hire a doctor who did not know the basics","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSenior doctors have expressed concern about the Irish health system’s ever-increasing reliance on overseas doctors and the challenges of adjustment and integration this poses. Photograph: Andrew MatthewsPA WireThe extraordinary case of a clearly under-experienced doctor highlighted by Mr Justice Peter Kelly is far from an unusual occurrence in Irish hospitals.Indeed, the judge pointed out that the case was not isolated and he has come across others where registered doctors “with little knowledge of the basics of medicine” were recruited to work for the HSE.The Medical Council has also expressed concerns about the appointment of junior doctors with inadequate experience and qualifications to the HSE and medical recruitment companies.Privately, senior doctors are quick to express concern about the Irish health system’s ever increasing reliance on overseas doctors and the challenges of adjustment and integration this poses. The system’s equally heavy reliance on temporary, agency staff exacerbates the situation.In recent years, there has been a steady stream of fitness to practise cases from the Medical Council featuring overseas doctors alleged to have made errors while working in Irish hospitals. Doctors from non-EU countries are over-represented in complaints made to the Medical Council.In one case, it emerged the doctor before the inquiry had been hired following a single video-link interview between Ireland and an eastern European country. In other cases, questions were raised about the adequacy of checks on the qualifications of overseas applicants.One area of difficulty that has arisen relates to some doctors who trained in an EU country, often in eastern Europe, but are themselves from a non-EU state. They may have trained in one non-mother tongue and are now practising in Ireland, using a second language, raising challenges.In the most high-profile inquiry, a Sudanese doctor was found guilty on 28 counts of poor professional performance and six counts of professional misconduct after a Medical Council fitness to practise inquiry in 2016. The doctor, who mistook an ankle for an elbow in an X-ray, was taken off on-call duties because of concerns about his performance, but went on to be employed by three other public hospitals.A subsequent report commissioned by the Government identified serious flaws with medical recruitment procedures, including a failure by one hospital to seek references. The report pointed to a lack of centralised recruitment processes for doctors in service posts and the absence of a single human resources system across HSE hospitals.The HSE responded by saying it would establish a standardised policy to deal with references and Garda and medical registration checks prior to the appointment of junior doctors. An electronic personnel file for medical interns would also be rolled out, it was promised.One private sector recruiter told The  that hospitals seemed to prefer hiring short-term agency staff, despite the extra cost, to filling posts permanently. Some “turn a blind eye to English-language tests” and are stricter in vetting headhunted staff than direct hires, the source claimed.The HSE uses a mix of central and localised recruitment, the latter organised through HR units in hospitals. Hospitals also recruit their own junior doctors.Candidates are shortlisted if they meet standard eligibility criteria and are interviewed by a three-person board. Successful candidates are verified by screening their details, references and Garda vetting, the HSE says.A doctor cannot practise in Ireland unless he or she is on the register, but the Medical Council says this does not mean the person is “suitable for every role”.“It rests with employers to determine the suitability of a doctor to fulfil the requirements of a post, and to ensure that they are supported and appropriately supervised in their role,” according to a spokesman.Minister for Health Simon Harris was also quick to point out that recruitment is the responsibility of the HSE. Mr Harris says he wants the HSE to “progress expeditiously” the review of its recruitment processes already under way.Given the review has been under way since 2016, this seems like stating the obvious."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Friday alerts in place for counties in Leinster, Munster and ConnachtMan in late 20s currently serving five year term for serious road traffic incidentBritish and Irish leaders meet for Brexit-dominated summit on Isle of ManAcademics told that \u0026lsquoover-educated, over-bearing\u0026rsquo elites are key targetsWoman who gave the money hurt when she heard friend hired limousine for daughter\u0026rsquos debsHigh Court gives teacher permission to challenge finding of child sexual abuse against himContraband with estimated \u0026pound5m value seized at illicit tobacco factoryTony Walsh (64) pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting teenage boy in 1983According to NCBI, the closure of the D\u0026uacuten Laoghaire premises, which opened in 2004, has not been confirmedWoman tells High Court she was questioned about qualifications and not allowed represent client at Mental Health tribunalFacilities include double-skin doors, visitor boxes and a multipurpose roomPatient claimed she suffered delay in the diagnosis and treatment of her cancer and her life expectancy may have been reducedJudge said Mason Hayes Curran was entitled to judgment for fees plus costsJudge said it was \u0026lsquoquestionable\u0026rsquo whether pensioner \u0026lsquoshould have been driving\u0026rsquoNew \u0026euro2.7m specialist Portlaoise facility aims to help prisoners self-manage behaviourAlterations to routes on Maynooth, Drogheda, Sligo, and Rosslare linesFriends and family of victim raising money to repatriate remains of Limbani \u0026lsquoRobert\u0026rsquo MzomaYou have to be kitten me!

Photograph: Peter ByrnePA WireThe Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said a successful outcome to Brexit negotiations by Christmas is “more likely than not”. In one of his most confident assessments of the process to date, the Taoiseach spoke of a a deal being possible, but not guaranteed, in the next few weeks.Speaking at the British Irish Council meeting in the Isle of Man on Friday, Mr Varadkar also said that the views of all parties and interested organisations in the North should be considered, not just those of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). “And even when all that is done, then we begin talks on the future relationship. There’s no clean break here, this could go on for a very long time.”Speaking on the backstop, he said the most important objective was to give everyone in Northern Ireland and Ireland the assurance that a hard border will not develop.“The only thing I would say is it is very important we listen to the voice of Northern Ireland, we listen to all political parties, we should listen to farmers, fishermen, the business community, trade unions and civil society. If we do that and listen to the voice of Northern Ireland as a whole that will help us to come to an agreement.”Others present at the meeting were senior British cabinet member David Lidington MP Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon Carwyn Jones of the Welsh government, Guernsey deputy Gavin St Pier and senator John Le Fondré of Jersey.The summit came as Mrs May faced a potential rift with the DUP over the contents of a leaked letter that appears to suggest she would sign up to a ‘backstop to the backstop’ that would mean a border down the Irish Sea with Northern Ireland in the EU single market regulatory regime.DUP leader Arlene Foster said she will not support Mrs May’s decision to have a Northern Ireland specific backstop which will see a border down the Irish Sea. She told RTÉ news on Friday evening the DUP will not support that and will not be able to support it in the British parliament.“Our problem with the correspondence is that ... she’s confirmed that there’s going to be a Northern Ireland specific backstop and indeed that as regards her negotiating position, she’s going to have Chequers for the whole of the United Kingdom. In other words, we will have a different regulatory regime from the rest of the United Kingdom and essentially there is going to be a border down the Irish Sea and no unionist would be able to support that,” she said. “It is very clear to me that Theresa May will have a job of work to do if she is going to get this through Cabinet,” said Ms Foster. When asked if it the backstop is an insurance policy that may not ever be used, Ms Foster said: “Well if that’s the case, why have it there in the first place. Why risk the break up of the United Kingdom which she says she cares about very deeply,” she said. Asked whether the Northern Ireland backstop would or would not feature in any withdrawal agreement, Mr Lidington said: “We don’t comment on alleged leaked documents but the position remains as it has always been. We are working with the commission to deliver on the commitments made in the joint report in December 2017. That means all the various commitments made in that report.“And the Prime Minister has always been very clear that we won’t accept something that involves carving out Northern Ireland form the rest of the UK.”Asked if he though any deal could win a majority in the Commons, Mr Lidington said: “I think we remain very determined to get a good deal that works for every part of the UK and which we also think will work well for the EU27. They are after all going to remain our closet neighbours in the world.“In respect of the Irish border we remain committed to the approach set out in a very balanced way in the joint report of last December which in itself reflected the balance inherent in the Good Friday Agreement.”Ms Sturgeon said: “I think one of the issues that still dogs these talks is the UK government appears to still be in the process of negotiating among itself rather than presenting a coherent unified position to the European Union. ”She said the Brexit experience had exposed “real weaknesses” within the devolution settlement that will require to be worked through and resolved.She said: “There have been frustrations on the part of the Scottish government about lack of engagement and involvement. Obviously we’ve had quite heated debate and discussions about power grabs, the devolved parliaments and issues around the powers of the devolved administrations are respected. There is no point in not being upfront about that.”The DUP, which Mrs May relies upon for her Commons majority, earlier on Friday accused the prime minister of breaking a promise that she would never sign up to a deal that treated Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK.It has interpreted the letter, leaked to the Times, as meaning that Northern Ireland could have a different regulatory regime to the rest of the UK under the Irish backstop clause.The party has seized on a particular paragraph in which Mrs May said she could not allow circumstances or conditions that could break up the UK customs territory to “come into force”.The leak of the letter is seen by some observers, as well as the DUP, as part of a laying of the ground by the prime minister for a showdown with the party over checks in British ports, or factories in Northern Ireland or Great Britain.Under the EU proposals, UK officials would be “competent authorities” to conduct the checks, but to EU rules, something the DUP has said will cross its “red line”.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Charles McQuillanGettyWhy is the Irish Border such a big deal with Brexit? The 499-kilometre border running from Carlingford Lough to Lough Foyle will become the only land border between the UK and the European Union after Brexit.The 1998 Belfast Agreement brought peace to Northern Ireland and removed the need for border checks.It also established north-south rules and institutions that helped solidify the Peace Process. The border is currently invisible and neither side wants the return of infrastructure along the border or the creation of a hard border.So what exactly is a hard border? It is a frontier monitored and protected by customs officials and border inspectors, and potentially police or military personnel if there are security issues around the border.That could in turn lead to a police or military presence along the Border to protect check points. Customs and security posts along the Border were regular targets of republican paramilitaries during the 30-year Troubles.Why would there be a need for border checks? Different customs rules, regulations and standards will apply in Northern Ireland and the Republic if the UK is leaving the EU so the different rules could have to be enforced at a border.What do the EU and UK want along the Border? Neither party to the Brexit negotiations wants to see the return of a hard border but they cannot agree a plan on how to achieve this.So have they come up with anything to solve this problem? The EU and UK agreed in a political deal in December 2017 that a “backstop” was required in the withdrawal agreement – the orce deal – that would guarantee an invisible border in the event of no other solution to achieve this being found in a Brexit deal, either in a specific solution for Northern Ireland or in a broader EU-UK trade deal.The December 2017 agreement also aims to protect north-south cooperation, support the all-island economy and safeguards the 1998 Belfast Agreement. In March 2018 the two sides agreed that there had to be a legal text – not just a political declaration – around how this option would work in practice should no better option be found.What exactly is the backstop? It is an insurance policy written into the withdrawal agreement, or Brexit treaty, guaranteeing no harder border on the island of Ireland.It would only be used as a last resort or the default option if the EU and UK could not reach an overarching free trade deal that would make trade so frictionless that there would be no border between the EU and the UK, including on the frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic.What backstop has the EU proposed? Brussels believes a hard border can be avoided and the Belfast Agreement upheld if Northern Ireland remains fully aligned with the EU’s customs union and parts of the single market after Brexit.This would mean matching the rules north and south of the Border for customs, energy, environmental regulations and laws covering agriculture and fisheries.Northern Ireland would stick to EU rules covering state aid and would fall under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in applying those rules. The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier has insisted that this backstop can only apply to Northern Ireland.Does the UK like the EU’s proposed backstop? No. British prime minister Theresa May has said that no UK leader could agree to different rules applying to different parts of the UK that would separate Northern Ireland constitutionally and economically from the rest of the UK.London argues that if the backstop only applies to Northern Ireland, it would effectively create a customs and regulatory border in the Irish Sea.Does anyone else not like the EU plan? Yes, the Democratic Unionist Party, the largest part in Northern Ireland whose 10 MPs at Westminster prop up May’s minority Conservative government, and hardline Brexit supporters within her party.Both have said that Northern Ireland cannot be treated any differently from the rest of the UK after it leaves the EU in March 2019. They oppose any checks between Ireland and Britain and what they see as a border in the Irish Sea.DUP leader Arlene Foster has warned that its “red line” that there could be no Brexit deal that would ide Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom was “blood red”.The EU has since the summer been trying to devise a plan to “de-dramatise” its own backstop to make it more politically acceptable to the UK government and the DUP.What are the UK’s proposals for a wider EU-UK trade deal that might avoid a hard Irish border? May has said that under the UK government’s “Chequers plan” - the July 2018 proposal for an overarching trade agreement between the EU and the UK - the Border issue would be solved by effectively creating a free trade area for goods that would avoid the need for customs and regulatory checks between the EU and UK, including at the Border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.European Council president Donald Tusk has said that the Chequers proposals would not work.What backstop has the UK proposed? The UK government has suggested a backstop that would keep the whole of the UK aligned with EU customs union rules for a limited time after the post-Brexit transition period – a standstill period when current EU economic rules continue to apply over the UK – expires at the end of 2020.Can a compromise be reached on the backstop? The concept of a two-part backstop - also known as the backstop to the backstop has emerged in talks between the EU and UK in the so-called tunnel, the closed-door negotiating room in Brussels.This would involve a Northern Ireland-specific backstop that would effectively give way to a UK-wide customs-only backstop with additional measures applying to the Irish Border, including extra customs rules to ensure Northern Ireland’s regulations remain aligned with EU standards.That sounds like a way through this mess - is it? The EU has hinted that it would accept the whole of the UK temporarily staying in the customs union but there are still problems here.Hardline Brexiteers in May’s government are hostile to any backstop that could keep the UK or Northern Ireland subject to EU rules indefinitely and want the backstop to have an expiry date or release clause.Brussels and Dublin officials argue that this would not be a backstop it could not be an insurance policy if there was a way of backing out of it. It can be temporary “unless and until” a better solution is agreed but it cannot be time-limited or expire, they say.Is there a way around this? The UK’s Brexit secretary Dominic Raab has demanded a three-month time limit, saying that London and Dublin could accept a clause to allow the UK to withdraw from a UK-wide customs arrangement with three months’ notice.Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said that Ireland and the EU could never agree to a backstop that could be ended by the UK unilaterally and that these ideas “are not backstops at all and don’t deliver on previous UK commitments”.So is this proposal dead then? Not exactly. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said that a backstop with a three-month time limit would “not be worth the paper it is written on”, but has left the door slightly ajar for a potential solution.He has said that Ireland was also willing to consider proposals for a review clause on the backstop, drawing some criticism from opposition politicians at home.Where to next? In the UK, one way forward might come from May’s Eurosceptic attorney general Geoffrey Cox, who is being tipped as someone who could win the support of Brexiteers around the UK cabinet table.He is reportedly drawing up legal plans for a “review mechanism” that could resolve the Irish backstop issue.And what if he doesn’t and both sides cannot agree to a backstop? If there is no backstop, there will be no orce deal and no transition period. In other words, there would be a disorderly Brexit and the UK would crash out of the EU in March 2019.It is anyone’s guess how goods passing over the Irish Border would be treated in such a scenario but the UK’s chaotic departure from the EU could create all sorts of difficulties for cross-border trade and beyond.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: ReutersBritish prime minister Theresa May’s Brexit plans have come under fresh pressure after the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), upon whose support she relies, said a letter from her about Brexit “raises alarm bells”. The DUP accused the prime minister of breaking a promise that she would never sign up to a deal that treated Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK.The party has been angered by a letter in which Mrs May said EU negotiators were still pushing for Northern Ireland to remain in the single market and customs union if talks collapse.It has interpreted a promise made by Mrs May in the letter that she would never let a ision of the UK “to come into force” as an admission that such a clause is set to be included in a final deal, the London Times newspaper reported on Friday. The DUP has seized on a particular paragraph - seen by the Times - in which Mrs May said she could not accept circumstances or conditions that could break up the UK customs territory to come into force.DUP leader Arlene Foster, tweeted on Friday: “The PM’s letter raises alarm bells for those who value the integrity of our precious union \u0026amp for those who want a proper Brexit for the whole UK. From her letter, it appears the PM is wedded to the idea of a border down the Irish Sea with NI in the EU SM regulatory regime.”The leak of the letter is seen by some observers, as well as the DUP, as part of a laying of the ground by Mrs May for a showdown with the party over checks in British ports or factories in Northern Ireland or Britain.Under the EU proposals, UK officials would be “competent authorities” to conduct the checks, but to EU rules, something the DUP has said will cross its “red line”.He said the British government had to abide by the vote of the people, who had voted for Brexit. He went on to warn that a no deal scenario would be “extremely damaging” to the economy of the Republic of Ireland.Mr Wilson said he was concerned that once a legal backdrop is signed up to, “we know the direction that the EU will be heading in. They will veto it ever being removed.”“That’s the harsh reality. All the prime minister’s points (in the letter) are aspirational. The back stop will be legal.”The warning from the DUP underscores the travails Mrs May faces in getting any Brexit orce deal, which London and Brussels say is 95 per cent done, approved by both her fractious party and by the Northern Irish lawmakers who keep her in power.A Downing Street spokesman said: “The prime minister’s letter sets out her commitment, which she has been absolutely clear about on any number of occasions, to never accepting any circumstances in which the UK is ided into two customs territories. The government will not agree anything that brings about a hard border on the island of Ireland.”The EU has insisted on a Northern Ireland-only “backstop to the backstop” in case negotiations on a wider UK approach break down. It is designed to avoid the return of a hard border between the Republic and Northern Ireland. Any version of the backstop would apply unless and until a wider UK-EU deal on the future relationship solved the issue of how to avoid a hard border.Ever since Mrs May triggered formal orce talks in March 2017, negotiators have struggled to find a solution to the 400km land border on the island of Ireland.The current proposal would see the whole of the United Kingdom remain inside a temporary customs arrangement with the EU, though it is unclear for how long and what would happen after it exits that.The row comes as Brexit is expected to dominate the agenda of the British Irish Council on Friday, which will be attended by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, David Lidington, who is in effect Mrs May’s deputy, and the Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley. The summit on the Isle of Man will also be attended by the first ministers of Scotland and Wales, Nicola Sturgeon and Carwyn Jones.Brexit is also expected to be a focal point when Mrs May meets the French president for a working lunch after attending armistice commemorations in Belgium and France.Downing Street has played down suggestions that a Brexit deal is imminent, after the European council president, Donald Tusk, appeared to indicate a breakthrough could come within the next week.Meanwhile, Eurosceptic Conservative MPs have said they will still vote down the government’s Brexit deal, even if May negotiates an exit clause from the Irish backstop, according to the former minister Steve Baker.The cabinet has been locked in a bitter internal wrangle about whether, and how, the government could extricate itself from the backstop, with some ministers concerned May’s plans could leave the UK in a permanent limbo.Mr Wilson said another Brexit referendum would not solve the problem, people would have the same information and would make the same decision, he claimed. - PAAgencies Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: IstockIt is “absolutely essential” that foreign doctors working in Ireland have qualifications that are valid, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said.The High Court on Wednesday granted a suspension order sought by the Medical Council to prevent a junior doctor from practising in Irish hospitals. Senior colleagues had raised concern over the junior doctor, who they said appeared to lack basic medical competency. The doctor graduated from medical school in an east European country in 2015 and had never worked in any hospital in a paid capacity. Minister for Health Simon Harris is to seek a report on the case from the Health Service Executive (HSE). In his judgement, president of the High Court Mr Justice Peter Kelly raised concerns that “defective” recruitment procedures was leading to “wholly unsuitable” doctors working in Irish hospitals, which represented a danger to patients.The junior doctor, who was working in a hospital maternity unit, said he was never taught how to examine a pregnant woman, the court noted.Addressing the matter on Thursday, Mr Varadkar said he was “very concerned” about the health service recruiting potentially incompetent medics from abroad.Mr Varadkar said it did not matter if workers from overseas coming to Ireland were doctors, teachers, social workers, or drivers. “It is essential that their qualifications are actually valid and all employers have a responsibility to put the safety of patients and consumers first,” he said. Mr Varadkar was speaking in Helsinki, at the European People’s Party congress.Mr Harris said he was treating the concerns raised by Mr Justice Kelly very seriously. During an appearance on RTÉ’s Six One, he said he had written to the HSE requesting an urgent response to the matters raised by the judge.The Minister said this case proved that the State’s regulatory system worked and that regarding the almost 23,000 doctors registered in the State last year, there were about 350 complaints and just three doctors struck off.A spokeswoman for Mr Harris said a HSE review into the recruitment process was under way “with a view to introducing a revised model in 2019”.Mr Harris needed to investigate the issue “as a matter of priority” and come before the Dáil to answer questions on “these serious, and potentially life-threatening issues”, Mr Donnelly said.The Medical Council said it would not be commenting on the inidual case. The junior doctor will face a fitness to practise inquiry on foot of the complaints.In a statement the HSE said its recruitment process was based on principles of merit, conducted in an open and accountable manner, and applied with consistency. “Due the size and scale of the HSE its recruitment is conducted through a number of channels ... Recruitment of junior doctors is conducted through the hospitals.” "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

Anti-Marcos activists and human rights victims welcomed the conviction as long overdue.The court disqualified Marcos from holding public office, but she can remain a member of the powerful House of Representatives while appealing the decision. Her congressional term will end next year but she has registered to run to replace her daughter as governor of northern Ilocos Norte province.I was jumping up and down in joy in disbelief, said former Commission on Human Rights chairwoman Loretta Ann Rosales, who was among many activists locked up after Imelda\u0027s husband, former President Ferdinand Marcos, declared martial law in the Philippines in 1972.Rosales said the decision was a huge setback to efforts by the Marcos family to revise history by denying many of the atrocities under the dictatorship, and urged Filipinos to fight all threats against democracy and civil liberties.Former Sen. Aquilino Pimentel Jr., who was also jailed during the Marcos dictatorship, said it was up to voters in next year\u0027s May 13 local elections, where Marcos is a candidate, if they want somebody who has a bad name representing them, that\u0027s your call.Imelda Marcos\u0027 husband was ousted by an army-backed people power revolt in 1986. He died in self-exile in Hawaii in 1989 but his widow and children returned to the Philippines. Most have been elected to public offices in an impressive political comeback.Government prosecutor Ryan Quilala told reporters that Marcos and her husband opened and managed Swiss foundations in violation of the Philippine Constitution, using aliases in a bid to hide stolen funds. The Marcoses have been accused of plundering the government\u0027s coffers amid crushing poverty. They have denied any wrongdoing and have successfully fought many other corruption cases.Imelda Marcos was acquitted Friday in three other cases, which were filed in 1991 and took nearly three decades of trial by several judges and prosecutors. She was once convicted of a graft case in 1993, but the Supreme Court later cleared her of any wrongdoing.President Rodrigo Duterte, an ally of the Marcoses, said last year the Marcos family had indicated a willingness to return a still-unspecified amount of money and a few gold bars to help ease budget deficits. He indicated the family still denied that the assets had been stolen as alleged by political opponents.Ferdinand Marcos placed the Philippines under martial rule a year before his term was to expire. He padlocked Congress, ordered the arrest of political rivals and left-wing activists and ruled by decree. His family is said to have amassed an estimated $5 billion to $10 billion while he was in power.A Hawaii court found Marcos liable for human rights violations and awarded $2 billion from his estate to compensate more than 9,000 Filipinos who filed a lawsuit against him for torture, incarceration, extrajudicial killings and disappearances.Duterte has acknowledged that Imee Marcos, the couple\u0027s daughter and a provincial governor, backed his presidential candidacy. Please review our commenting policy\u0026#39I felt like I had failed\u0026#39: Michelle Obama reveals she had miscarriage and used IVF to conceive daughtersWildfires rage across California, killing at least five Jo Johnson resignation deals major blow to Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit hopesClassical musicians to break with tradition and speak to the audienceThousand Oaks shooting victim confirmed as survivor of America\u0026#39s worst ever mass shooting a year agoJeremy Vine says BBC should drop radio \u0026#39Drivetime\u0026#39 name as it encourages driving in \u0026#39post-car Britain\u0026#39Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright reveals his unusual way of de-stressing after workFour car bombs kill 20 in Mogadishu attackComment: Stormzy\u0026#39s Oxbridge offer might sound great, but it’s still \u2028just racial discriminationBrexit latest: Boris Johnson\u0026#39s brother Jo resigns over Theresa May\u0026#39s \u0026#39terrible\u0026#39 deal and demands a second referendumNHS tells staff to use WhatsApp to communicate during emergenciesShropshire Council becomes first in UK to force staff to work from home on Fridays to save money Robotic surgery is causing deaths heart surgeon warns - as he says he would opt for a traditional procedureAmerican huntress taunts critics with goat t-shirts Foreign Isil suspects executed after secret prisoner swap by UK\u0026#39s allies in SyriaNational service – should it be brought back?Underage driver doing \u0026#39doughnuts\u0026#39 sparks huge grass fire in Australia Dutch to prosecute doctor for euthanising elderly woman in first such case since legalisationClassically trained musician stuck on 40-minute call transcribes the entirety of HMRC\u0026#39s hold musicStudents \u0026#39less depressed and lonely\u0026#39 after cutting social media use to 10 minutes, study findsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/11/09/TELEMMGLPICT000178548611_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"shropshire council becomes first uk force staff work home fridays","story":"A view in ShropshireA cash-strapped council has announced “bizarre” plans to close its offices every Friday and make staff work from home, in an effort to stabilise finances.Conservative-run Shropshire Council hopes to save around £300,000 from the move, which will start on the last Friday of the month for the remainder of the year, before becoming weekly in January.From noon on the last working day of the week, the main council building will close, with staff expected to conduct their business remotely.Schools, museums, libraries and other amenities will not be affected by the shake-up. It is thought to be the first time a local authority has introduced such a policy, which has been met by bafflement from union officials. Shropshire Council believes that the weekly closure will minimise printing, heating and lighting costs.Leader Peter Nutting said a spending freeze had been agreed across the council because of the need to get this year\u0027s budget under control.He cited the estimated £15 million bill for social care over the next year as one example of “funding that we just don’t have”. The council chief said: We expect to get some additional funding but it isn\u0027t going to be anywhere near the additional £15 million cost for this year alone.Spending freezes delay expenditure on things like buying new equipment, where this can happen. We will of course try to minimise the impact on frontline services.”Encouraging staff to “work more flexibly” does not equate to the council being “closed for business”, he insisted, adding: “We will simply be working in a different way.The council will also keep a close eye on how much employees are printing, after costs reportedly exceeded £300,000. But the measure was described as a “lock out” for all workers by the Labour leader of the council, Alan Mosley.The GMB union said the planned shutdown had come out of the blue.An urgent meeting with the council has been requested by union bosses, who are keen to establish “what on earth they are doing here”.Please review our commenting policy\u0026#39I felt like I had failed\u0026#39: Michelle Obama reveals she had miscarriage and used IVF to conceive daughtersWildfires rage across California, killing at least five Jo Johnson resignation deals major blow to Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit hopesClassical musicians to break with tradition and speak to the audienceThousand Oaks shooting victim confirmed as survivor of America\u0026#39s worst ever mass shooting a year agoJeremy Vine says BBC should drop radio \u0026#39Drivetime\u0026#39 name as it encourages driving in \u0026#39post-car Britain\u0026#39Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright reveals his unusual way of de-stressing after workFour car bombs kill 20 in Mogadishu attackComment: Stormzy\u0026#39s Oxbridge offer might sound great, but it’s still \u2028just racial discriminationBrexit latest: Boris Johnson\u0026#39s brother Jo resigns over Theresa May\u0026#39s \u0026#39terrible\u0026#39 deal and demands a second referendumNHS tells staff to use WhatsApp to communicate during emergenciesRobotic surgery is causing deaths heart surgeon warns - as he says he would opt for a traditional procedureAmerican huntress taunts critics with goat t-shirts Foreign Isil suspects executed after secret prisoner swap by UK\u0026#39s allies in SyriaNational service – should it be brought back?Underage driver doing \u0026#39doughnuts\u0026#39 sparks huge grass fire in Australia Dutch to prosecute doctor for euthanising elderly woman in first such case since legalisationClassically trained musician stuck on 40-minute call transcribes the entirety of HMRC\u0026#39s hold musicStudents \u0026#39less depressed and lonely\u0026#39 after cutting social media use to 10 minutes, study findsDonald Trump says other reporters could lose White House credentials as he escalates Jim Acosta rowWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2017/09/14/13/saver.jpg","title":"bank branch closures investigation treasury committee elderly vulnerable atms fca","story":"Created with Sketch.Subscribe  registerSubscribeJoin us Subscribe  registerJoin us SubscribeLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentForgotten your password?Try Independent Minds free for 14 daysSee the optionsProbe to\u0026nbspexamine whether vulnerable consumers pay more for financial services productsClick to followThe IndependentMPs will also evaluate the impact of reducing the number of free-to-use ATMs on vulnerable consumersAn inquiry into consumers\u0027 access to financial services has been launched by MPs amid concerns some vulnerable customers are finding it increasingly difficult.The Treasury Committee will scrutinise whether certain groups of people are excluded from obtaining a basic level of service from providers.It will also examine whether vulnerable consumers pay more for financial services products.\u0027Almost everything has changed in banking since the financial crisis\u0027Nicky Morgan, who chairs the Treasury Committee, said: “Vulnerability, as defined by the FCA (Financial Conduct Authority), is where someone who, due to their personal circumstances, is especially susceptible to detriment, particularly when a firm is not acting with appropriate levels of care.“With customers expected to take more responsibility for their financial planning and resilience, bank branches closing and the number of free-to-use ATMs falling, it\u0027s becoming increasingly difficult for vulnerable customers to access certain financial services.“The committee will examine the practicality of the FCA\u0027s definition, the effectiveness of attempts by financial services providers to prevent increased financial exclusion and whether a premium is placed on products such as travel insurance for vulnerable consumers.“As part of this inquiry, we\u0027ll be holding sessions outside of Parliament to hear from vulnerable consumers who have interacted with financial services providers.”Bank branch closures reach ‘alarming’ rate of 60 per month Bank pairs bank branches with customer service.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearBitcoin has enjoyed the most sustained period of stability in its history, helping it address the issue of price volatility that some critics say makes it unsuitable as a form of mainstream payment.\u0026nbspGeneral consensus among market analysts is that this trend is likely to continue in the short term, barring any major news that could send the price shooting in either direction, such as a large-scale hack on a leading exchange, or positive regulation implemented by a financial body.Bitcoin price predictions made by 10 analysts for November\u0027s Finder\u0026nbspCryptocurrency Predictions Survey suggest that the world\u0027s leading digital currency will experience steady growth over the next year, though the upcoming months remain uncertain.Bitcoin wallet give away $125m of cryptocurrency to help growth“Some of our panellists believe external forces could shift the market greatly over the next month, and particularly for bitcoin, Jon Ostler, CEO of Finder, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbspThe upcoming decisions on a Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund being approved or not by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the US Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) deciding whether to accept the application by ICE backed cryptocurrency exchange, Bakkt, are expected before 1 December. So at this stage, it’s difficult to predict exactly what will happen.Looking longer term, Mr Ostler said bitcoin is expected to experience steady growth over the next year, with the panel of experts predicting an average\u0026nbspvalue of $16,732 by the end of 2019. “With bitcoin being very stable and within a range between $6,800 and $6,100, it is hard to suggest anything will change until it breaks this range, said cryptocurrency trader Craig Cobb, who forms part of the panel.leveled out in recent months (CoinMarketCap)But if it\u0027s not bitcoin, a\u0026nbsphint at what this next break-out cryptocurrency might be was given earlier this week by Blockchain, the world\u0027s most popular bitcoin wallet. On Tuesday, the company announced it would give away $125m-worth (£96m) of the Stellar cryptocurrency as part of a major initiative to encourage its use as a mainstream form of payment.Stellar is currently not even in the top five cryptocurrencies in terms of its total value, according to CoinMarketCap, but while it may be lesser-known, its backers say it is more technologically advanced and better suited to large-scale usage.\u0026nbspethereum cryptocurrency has a market cap of around $22\u0026nbspbillion (Getty Images)Another cryptocurrency that could see massive gains in the coming months, some experts say, is bitcoin\u0027s closest rival ethereum.

In the first half of 2018, 2,692 shops closed, while 1,569 opened – leading to a net loss of 1,123. The closures were mainly seen in the areas most affected by online shopping, such as fashion and electricals, while a shift to “in-home leisure” saw pubs taking a hit and 340 stores in the restaurant, catering and entertainment sector disappearing. Why the death of the high street is good for men – and bad for womenPhilip Hammond to announce £1.5bn plan to support high streetDebenhams to close 50 stores putting 4,000 jobs at riskAsos sales soar as online retailer leaves high street rivals behindSome of the UK’s biggest retail brands have been rocked by financial difficulties this year, with many forced to close branches. House of Fraser\u0026nbsprecently\u0026nbspcollapsed into administration after a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) aimed at cutting costs failed to impress creditors. The chain was subsequently bought by Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley, but he has been unable to save all stores. Meanwhile, Mothercare announced earlier this year that it would close 50 stores under a CVA, and Marks \u0026amp Spencer said it would close 100 shops over the next four years.Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC, said: “The continued rate of store closures reflects the new reality of that many of us prefer to shop online and increasingly eat, drink and entertain at home. The high street is adapting to an overcapacity in retail and leisure space resulting from these channel shifts.“Openings simply aren’t replacing the closures at a fast enough rate. Specifically, the openings across ‘experiential’ chains, such as ice cream parlours, beauty salons and vape shops, haven’t been enough to offset closures in the more traditional categories.”Ms Hooker warned that the turmoil facing the sector is “unlikely to abate”. “Store closures in H2 due to administrations and CVAs already announced will further intensify the situation,” she added. “The British high street is in urgent need of new ways of thinking and new forms of retail. Encouraging this should be a priority. “However, it remains to be seen if recent packages of support for the high street and reductions in business rates for smaller retailers will be sufficient to stimulate this.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The European Commission – the heart of the Brussels empire, the “EUSSR”, – was always going to project a weak economic future for the UK post-Brexit, wasn’t it?A\u0026nbspgroup led by the malevolent Jean-Claude Juncker was\u0026nbspalways going to show the remaining 27 nations of the EU prospering while Britain, out of the club, stumbles helplessly.Such is the conspiratorial temper of our times that such reactions to the latest forecasts from the commission, showing precisely that, are sadly inevitable.UK set for weakest growth in Europe, European Commission warnsBut it’s still a silly conspiracy. For the commission’s forecasts for the UK are not, in fact, wildly different from those of others.The commission sees UK growth in 2019 of a paltry 1.2 per cent. The most recent average forecast from a range of UK forecasters – UK banks and economic consultancies – is growth of 1.4 per cent.That would leave us with faster projected growth than Italy – but still below every other EU economy.It’s true that the Office for Budget Responsibility in last week’s Budget projected growth of 1.6 per cent next year. But this was mainly due to the boost to demand from the chancellor’s extra spending on the health services and his income tax cuts. The OBR expects growth to fall back in 2020 to 1.4 per cent.The idea that the commission has produced some ridiculously pessimistic outlier forecasts for the UK doesn’t stand up to scrutiny.The commission thinks growth in the eurozone and the EU will slow down too in 2019, but not to the extent that it will in the UK.There’s another vital piece of context. The commission’s forecasts – like those of the OBR – are based on the presumption of a smooth Brexit next year, where we secure a withdrawal agreement and remain in the single market and customs union until the end of 2020.The weakness in almost all forecasts essentially reflects assumptions that the UK economy is slowing due to weakening household demand, feeble business investment and lacklustre exports.That may, or may not, be borne out.But in a sense it’s a red herring when thinking about the economics of Brexit.The really important forecasts to bear in mind are those of a severe economic shock in the event of a no-deal Brexit and long-term damage to our potential growth rate as a result of a Brexit in which we leave the single market and customs union.On this credible economists and forecasters are united.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Shoppers are increasingly staying home and ordering online“Help,” cried the retail industry.No wonder. Ten years ago this month Woolworths went pop. Dark clouds seem to have been bubbling and spitting over the high street ever since. That was underlined by a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the professional services firm, showing that a net 1,123 stores vanished from Britain’s top 500 high streets in the first six months of this year.\u0026nbspThe numbers probably won’t surprise anyone given the high-pocalypse we’ve witnessed among some of retail’s biggest names this year, including the likes of Toys ‘R’Us, Maplin, Poundworld and House of Fraser.\u0026nbspBritish high street is losing 14 shops a day, new research showsTowns with ‘unhealthy’ high streets have lower life expectancyWhy the death of the high street is good for men – and bad for womenHowever, closures have actually been outstripping new openings since 2010, and the gap is widening.Of course, the British Retail Consortium steamed in with a call for the government to take urgent action on business rates, beyond the tinkering contained in the chancellor’s recent budget.\u0026nbspThe levy is linked to property values and so hits bricks and mortar operators a lot harder than online outfits, which run their operations from out of town in places where you can buy land for a handful of coppers and a Mars bar.\u0026nbspIt has become the industry’s bête noire, and the trade body wouldn’t be doing its job if it didn’t make a fuss about it. But even if you completely eliminated it, the trend would likely continue, albeit perhaps at a slower rate.Britain\u0026nbsphas\u0026nbspembraced internet shopping like almost no other nation, and that isn’t changing.\u0026nbspIt’s so much more convenient to have the retailer come to you\u0026nbspwhen the alternative is\u0026nbspslogging around the high street trailing children who’d rather be somewhere else and hoping you get finished\u0026nbspbefore the traffic wardens notice\u0026nbspyour car is illegally parked. Doubly so\u0026nbspif\u0026nbspyou’re time poor. Most Britons are. We\u0026nbspwork some of the longest hours in Europe.\u0026nbspPwC’s head of retail, Lisa Hooker, pointed out to me that 20 per cent of non food items are now bought online. The number is set to increase to 30 per cent by 2021. That says it all.So does this mean the high street is in terminal decline? Are the debates over its future worthless?\u0026nbspNot necessarily. Hooker made note of the fact that all the reliable surveys show that there is still a demand for bricks and mortar shops.\u0026nbspConsumers\u0026nbspjust use them less than they used to, and they want them to operate differently, alongside and as a complement\u0026nbspto their online excursions.\u0026nbspThat means the future will have to be made up of smaller premises that operate as mini showrooms, alongside “experience”\u0026nbspretailers such as vape shops and ice cream parlours, which have been doing well. As have\u0026nbsp(hooray!) book and record shops, which have been\u0026nbspmaking a come back.Encouraging short term “pop up”\u0026nbspstores to open temporarily\u0026nbspalongside them them could help\u0026nbspdraw people in.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

The truth is that ministers have dithered and delayed for far too long. We now need urgent action.”Nuclear waste could be buried underneath national parks, say MPsSue Ferns, senior deputy general secretary of Prospect union, called the decision “devastating”.“Government has ultimate responsibility for ensuring a secure and stable supply of energy throughout the UK,” she said.“The truth is that ministers have dithered and delayed for far too long. We now need urgent action.“Our analysis shows that if the Government were to take a 50 per cent\u0026nbspstake then there would be a net benefit to the public purse, so there really is no excuse not to.”Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey said Labour supports Moorside as they see nuclear as a key part of the UK’s energy mix, but said the government should have stepped in to support it.A Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesman said Toshiba’s withdrawal was “entirely a commercial decision”.“Nuclear has an important role to play as part of the UK’s erse energy mix as we transition to a low-carbon economy, but in each case projects must provide value for money for consumers and taxpayers,” they said.“This government remains committed to new nuclear through the Industrial Strategy Nuclear Sector Deal as well as consenting the first new nuclear power station in a generation at\u0026nbspHinkley Point C.”Critics of nuclear power said the government should see the new circumstances\u0026nbspas an opportunity to move away from nuclear to cheaper technologies such as wind and solar power.“Shifting away from expensive, complicated technology towards cheaper and easier-to-build renewables gives the UK the opportunity to build an electricity system that will keep bills for homes and businesses down for years to come,” said Dr Jonathan Marshall, head of analysis at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit.“Cancelling Moorside does leave a gap in the UK’s decarbonisation plans, but one that is more likely to be filled with the technologies of the future rather than the past.”Additional reporting by PA.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In the first half of 2018, 2,692 shops closed, while 1,569 opened – leading to a net loss of 1,123. The closures were mainly seen in the areas most affected by online shopping, such as fashion and electricals, while a shift to “in-home leisure” saw pubs taking a hit and 340 stores in the restaurant, catering and entertainment sector disappearing. Why the death of the high street is good for men – and bad for womenPhilip Hammond to announce £1.5bn plan to support high streetDebenhams to close 50 stores putting 4,000 jobs at riskAsos sales soar as online retailer leaves high street rivals behindSome of the UK’s biggest retail brands have been rocked by financial difficulties this year, with many forced to close branches. House of Fraser\u0026nbsprecently\u0026nbspcollapsed into administration after a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) aimed at cutting costs failed to impress creditors. The chain was subsequently bought by Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley, but he has been unable to save all stores. Meanwhile, Mothercare announced earlier this year that it would close 50 stores under a CVA, and Marks \u0026amp Spencer said it would close 100 shops over the next four years.Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC, said: “The continued rate of store closures reflects the new reality of that many of us prefer to shop online and increasingly eat, drink and entertain at home. The high street is adapting to an overcapacity in retail and leisure space resulting from these channel shifts.“Openings simply aren’t replacing the closures at a fast enough rate. Specifically, the openings across ‘experiential’ chains, such as ice cream parlours, beauty salons and vape shops, haven’t been enough to offset closures in the more traditional categories.”Ms Hooker warned that the turmoil facing the sector is “unlikely to abate”. “Store closures in H2 due to administrations and CVAs already announced will further intensify the situation,” she added. “The British high street is in urgent need of new ways of thinking and new forms of retail. Encouraging this should be a priority. “However, it remains to be seen if recent packages of support for the high street and reductions in business rates for smaller retailers will be sufficient to stimulate this.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Sterling dropped more than 0.3 per cent against the greenback to $1.3021, and fell 0.21 per cent against the euro to €1.1471.

While growth for the third quarter on the whole was lifted by 0.6 per cent - the fastest rate since 2016 - economists said this was likely to be a one-off. With “persistent Brexit uncertainty and the financial squeeze on consumers and businesses likely to weigh increasingly on economic activity in the coming quarters”, according to Suren Thiru of the British Chambers of Commerce. Meanwhile, Schroders senior European economist Azad Zangana said the economy is not forecast to pick up in the near term. “We expect UK fourth quarter growth to be very weak as Brexit paralysis truly takes hold,” he said. “Assuming the government can successfully negotiate the withdrawal agreement with Brussels and ratify it in Parliament, then we could see a rebound in growth early next year. “However, a failure to complete a deal which would mean a no-deal or cliff-edge Brexit, is likely to cause a further slowdown in activity, which could be enough to tip the UK into recession.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Construction grew 1.7 per cent\u0026nbspafter deep falls in output during the snowstorms early this year.But services, which make up the bulk of the UK economy, contracted 0.1 per cent during\u0026nbspthe month.In the third quarter, business investment fell 1.2 per cent, the worst three-month performance since early 2016.It was also the third quarter of contraction in a row – marking the worst run since the last recession.Surveys suggest Brexit-related uncertainty is causing firms to freeze spending.\u0026nbspWorst run in a decadeThe Bank of England expects growth in the final quarter to decelerate\u0026nbspto 0.3 per cent.However, there was slightly better news from the ONS on UK trade, with the statistics agency reporting\u0026nbspthe trade deficit fell to £2.9bn in the three months to September, down from £6.1bn.Export values were up 3.8 per cent in the period, outstripping import growth of 1.7 per cent.Net trade is therefore estimated to have provided a 0.8 percentage point boost to overall GDP growth in Q3, after dragging\u0026nbspin the second quarter.Chancellor\u0026nbspPhilip Hammond\u0026nbspsought to accentuate the positive elements in the data, arguing the quarterly growth rate was evidence of the “underlying strength in our economy”. Speaking on a visit to Fuller’s Brewery in London, Mr Hammond said: “We are building an economy that works for everyone, with 3.3 million more people in work, lower unemployment in every part of the country, and wages rising at their fastest pace in almost a decade. Now our focus is on locking in this progress and ensuring people’s wages can continue to rise.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We did so in full compliance with our legal obligations to preserve messages.Rumours the social network is working on rolling this feature out to all its users intensified last month, when a prototype of the unsend feature was spotted by Jane Wong, who shared screenshots of the feature on Twitter.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But for cash-strapped countries like Pakistan, there are few alternatives, as\u0026nbspKim Sengupta\u0026nbspexplainsClick to followThe IndependentThe Chinese state holds a 99-year lease on the Sri Lankan port of HambantotaAn international conference took place last week in Gwadar, a dusty Pakistani town perched on the edge of the Indian Ocean –\u0026nbspan unlikely place, one would have thought, for Imran Khan’s government to invite dignitaries from 26 countries. But the real aim was to display a vision of the future – a mighty port city and commercial centre for the region which would put Dubai and Bahrain in the shade.Not everything went according to plan. While the delegates were being shown around the site of this projected\u0026nbspmega city, gunmen on motorcycles shot dead three workers and injured five others constructing homes in the suburbs for future residents. It was the fourth fatal shooting in the area in recent months\u0026nbspmore than three dozen builders had died in a series of attacks, with the Baloch Liberation Front, a group seeking an independent Balochistan,\u0026nbspbeing\u0026nbspheld responsible.The development of Gwadar is a matter of vital importance for a Pakistani government trying to rescue an economy which is\u0026nbspin dire straits. It has\u0026nbsprepeatedly claimed that violence in the area has been brought under control. On a trip to the town two weeks ago, however, my colleagues and I were only allowed to move around under army escort.Huge protests in Pakistan after Christian woman on death row releasedBut separatist strife is not the only issue with\u0026nbspGwadar. The port\u0026nbspis a prominent part of the $60bn\u0026nbsp(£46bn) China-Pakistan Economic Corridor\u0026nbsp(CPRC), which in turn is part of Beijing’s global Belt and Road Initiative,\u0026nbspa massive and\u0026nbspcontroversial mission which has become a huge geopolitical talking point.To the Chinese government and its supporters, the Belt and Road\u0026nbspproject – set to be established in Asia, Africa and parts of Europe,\u0026nbspwith offshoots in Latin America –\u0026nbspis a purely strategic infrastructure programme which will spread trade and the benefit it brings across many lands.To its\u0026nbspgrowing number of detractors, the real aim is to spread Chinese\u0026nbsphegemony using commerce in tandem with the naval bases\u0026nbsp– the\u0026nbsp“String of Pearls”\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspBeijing is building on the Pacific and Indian Oceans. The covert motive, it is claimed, is to spread “debt-trap diplomacy”\u0026nbspby providing finance and then extracting advantage when debtor countries have difficulties paying back. The most notorious example of this so far is Sri Lanka ceding a port, Hambantota, in return for the waiver of $1bn on loans.This is a good time to ask the Saudis for favours, they wouldn’t want to turn anyone away with the bad publicity they are gettingChina is Islamabad’s long-term, staunch backer and is\u0026nbspincreasingly important – especially as a previous ally, the US, is now courting India, the country with which Pakistan has been locked in rivalry since both states became free from British colonial rule more than seven\u0026nbspdecades ago.There is also the crucial economic factor:\u0026nbspPakistan is greatly in need of money from its friends. Two weeks ago, the country’s new prime minister, Imran Khan told The Independent\u0026nbspin an interview about the stark reality of the financial situation. While many international political and business leaders had pulled out of an economic forum in Riyadh following the murder of\u0026nbspjournalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, he had to go because, he admitted,\u0026nbsp“We are desperate for money ... The reason I have to take this opportunity is because we are a country of 210 million people and we have the worst debt crisis in our history.” Without funding from abroad, he pointed out, “we actually won’t have in another three months enough foreign exchange to service our debts or pay for our imports.”Imran Khan (second right)\u0026nbspattends\u0026nbspthe opening ceremony of the Future Investment Initiative\u0026nbspin Riyadh last month (AFPGetty)Khan wanted to attract investors at the forum to Pakistan. But the main aim was to secure Saudi largesse. Failure to get funds from the kingdom as well as from China would mean turning to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for Pakistan’s 13th bailout – accompanied by\u0026nbspinevitably\u0026nbspharsh strictures on public spending, with the population already suffering from an austerity package.Khan secured a very welcome $6bn\u0026nbspfrom the Saudis after meeting the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, the man who has been accused of being complicit in Jamal Khashoggi’s death (though he denies any knowledge). “It sounds callous, I know,”\u0026nbspsaid a senior official in Islamabad, “but this is a good time to ask the Saudis for favours, they wouldn’t want to turn anyone away with all the bad publicity they are getting.”As well as the loan pledge, Pakistan got an agreement for Saudi Arabia to invest in a new oil refinery in Gwadar. A Saudi delegation visited the port and, according to petroleum minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan,\u0026nbsp“showed an interest to immediately invest in the refinery”. The agreement will be signed by the kingdom’s oil giant Aramco and the Pakistan State Oil company, but, he said, “we sat down and held discussions and it was principally decided by both sides that it will be a government to government agreement.”Gwadar can become a strategic port on the edge of the Indian Ocean (Amanda Coakley)This week Khan was on a trip to China during which he sought further funds to add to the $6bn Beijing has loaned Pakistan since last year to prop up its foreign exchange reserves. There were recriminations after Pakistan’s national television channel used a caption saying “begging” instead of “Beijing”. It was due to an unfortunate typographical error, the broadcaster said in its apology.Beijing is expected to acquiesce, but it has also repeated its call on Islamabad to carry out the type of structural reforms the IMF\u0026nbsphad also demanded in response to Pakistan’s latest appeal for help.There has also been annoyance in Beijing at criticism of the Belt and Road\u0026nbspfrom Pakistani officials, including Khan himself when he was in opposition, as well as two officials in his government. Abdul Razzak Dawood, an adviser to the prime minister on commerce, had held that some of the deals made were unfair to Pakistani companies. The railways minister, Sheikh Rashid, has wanted to cut the size of the Karachi-Peshawar rail line, saving $2bn from the $8bn budget.There are also claims, in Pakistan and abroad, that the Belt and Road\u0026nbspis one of the main contributors to Pakistan’s economic problems. Beijing has insisted that Pakistan buy Chinese equipment for projects, which has denuded foreign exchange reserves. Beijing has then extended loans to cover the purchases, which, in turn, has sent debt soaring further.AFPGetty)The IMF has insisted that any loan it gives to Pakistan is not used to pay off the China debt. The organisation’s managing director, Christine Lagarde,\u0026nbsphas stressed\u0026nbspthat there must be “absolute transparency” over this. The US, too, has demanded similar stipulations. Washington has long been hostile towards the Chinese project, charging that Beijing is using it to hold nations in thrall.Relations between the US and Islamabad are at a particularly low ebb\u0026nbspat present, in any case. Successive American presidents have threatened to cut aid to the Pakistani military unless action was taken against the Taliban and other violent Islamist groups which\u0026nbspthe west (and the Afghan government) claim are fed and watered in Pakistan and sent to carry out murderous attacks in Afghanistan. Pakistan has always denied the allegation.Donald Trump’s first tweet this year said that the US “has foolishly given Pakistan more than $33bn\u0026nbspin aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies \u0026amp deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools”. The US administration announced in September that it was cutting $300m in aid to Pakistan’s military.The Chinese are concerned by armed insurgency across the border in Balochistan where they have been in confidential negotiations with rebel groups for some time. However, with the Gwadar plan, it is the possibility of being drawn into a wider confrontation, if Saudi Arabian investment\u0026nbspin the port is confirmed,\u0026nbspwhich is a cause of unease.Created with Sketch.

This is especially of concern as China is a major importer of Iranian oil, and has\u0026nbspbegun to invest heavily in Iran –picking up contracts being left behind by western companies pulling out after the reimposition\u0026nbspof sanctions by the Trump administration.Iran has experienced a number of terrorist attacks claimed by Isis which Tehran has blamed, without offering evidence, on Saudi Arabia. The scope for sectarian trouble\u0026nbspspreading to Balochistan was illustrated last month when 14 Iranian border guards were abducted by an extremist Sunni group Jaish al-Adli. Pakistani security forces say they have failed to find the kidnapped men, leading to warnings of action being taken by the Iranians.The Pakistani government has stressed that the Saudi money did not come with political strings attached and, in his interview\u0026nbspbefore he went to Riyadh, Imran Khan spoke of his regret at Mr Trump tearing up the nuclear deal with Iran and pursuing punitive measures against the country.Gwadar is a prominent part of a $60bn\u0026nbspinfrastructure project between China and Pakistan (Amanda Coakley)The prime minister said that Pakistan\u0026nbspwould like to be an intermediary between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Yet the Saudi-led Sunni block were unhappy when the Pakistani parliament, under the previous government, refused to take part in the current war in Yemen. Islamabad was privately warned that it would have to choose sides sooner rather than later. There have long been reports that Saudi Arabia has “bought” a nuclear bomb from Pakistan to act as a counter against a “Shia bomb” produced by Iran – and the Islamic Military Counter Terrorism Coalition, set up by Riyadh and led by a Pakistani commander, General Raheel Sharif,\u0026nbspprimarily exists to counter Shia forces.According to Theodore Karasik, at Gulf State Analytics, a Washington consultancy firm, “Saudi moves and investments in Pakistan are a set and established policy that seeks to better integrate Islamabad into Riyadh’s camp.”Robert Emerson, a British security consultant, says:\u0026nbsp“China have invested heavily in Pakistan, but it is also engaging in a substantial way commercially with Iran. It is understandable that they do not want to see a Saudi presence imported into Gwadar, just over a 100km\u0026nbspfrom the Iranian border.“But China also now has problems with Belt and Road. There has been consistent opposition from the US, Japan, India and others and now we see some of those countries which were going to take part in it are having second thoughts.”China urged to close mass detention camps for Uighur MuslimsPakistan to plant 10 billion trees to combat decades of deforestationPakistan invites Saudi Arabia to join China’s Belt and Road corridorA number of states, including Malaysia, Nepal and Myanmar have pulled out of Chinese-financed programmes. Recent elections in the Males saw the defeat of the Beijing-backed President Abdulla Yameen under whose rule the nation has accrued $1.3bn debt to China, more than a quarter of its GDP. The opposition – whose candidate, Mohamed Solih, won at the polls\u0026nbsp– had warned of being sucked into a “serious debt trap”.In Colombia there has been widespread local opposition for eight years to the building of the $4bn Ituango dam, part funded by the Chinese, in an area with propensity for landslides. This year 26,000 people had to be evacuated after heavy rainfall led to a landslide environmentalists have been warning about.Saudi moves and investments in Pakistan are a set and established policy that seeks to better integrate Islamabad into Riyadh’s campIt has now been almost a decade since China overtook the US as Africa’s biggest trading partner. Nine countries have signed Belt and Road\u0026nbspagreements with Beijing and 20 others are engaged in talks to do so. The Chinese government pledged $60bn in preferential loans and investments at an economic forum for Africa three years ago.African countries, so far, have been readily receptive to the Chinese loans which have been pouring in. But concerns have been raised too,\u0026nbspwith the Centre for Global Development finding, for instance, that Djibouti, where the Chinese now have a military base, has seen its foreign debt swell from 50 per cent to 85 per cent of GDP with the largest amount by far owed to China. The Chinese company CMPort, the same one which built Hambantota in Sri Lanka, now under Chinese control, is building a port in the country at Doraleh.China also has aspirations for Europe to be the final destination for the land route of the Belt and Road, with the aim that every day trains from Chinese trading cities would arrive at distribution points in Duisburg, Madrid and London.But six months ago 27 out of 28 European Union ambassadors in Beijing\u0026nbspsigned off a report saying the project “runs counter to the European Union’s agenda for liberalising trade and pushes the balance of power in favour of subsidised Chinese companies”.In September, Brussels launched its response to the Belt and Road: the building of infrastructure across Europe and Asia with Federica Mogherini, the head of European Union foreign policy, describing it as the “European way” of connecting the two continents.But the European Union may not remain unified in its approach. The Hungarian ambassador did not sign the report in Beijing and now Britain appears to be keen for China deals. In December last year Philip Hammond, on a visit to Beijing, said, “I was privileged earlier this year to represent the UK\u0026nbspat the first Belt and Road forum and one of the things we will discuss is the opportunity for closer collaboration in delivering the ambitions of the Belt and Road programme.”Like Imran Khan’s Pakistan, Theresa May’s post-Brexit Britain cannot ignore Beijing at a time of economic hardship, however the true cost of this Chinese connection will\u0026nbspunfold in the future.belt and roadShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He spent his youth surfing on the margins of society, before floundering\u0026nbspon\u0026nbspthe seas\u0026nbspof a troubled marriage. Since then, he has taken up the only\u0026nbspsensible function now left open to him – to offer opinions on everything under the sun. By Andy MartinClick to followThe IndependentThe prince’s purpose flows from his inability to quite fit into time and spaceIt wasn’t quite a\u0026nbsproyal wave. More like a royal glance. To be honest,\u0026nbspI might have waved, or possibly saluted, or at least stood to attention. Not long ago, the Queen drove right past me in her Regal Roller on Lisson Grove. Lots of police outriders and suchlike. A chauffeur of course. But I saw her and she saw me. Then she took a right on Rossmore Road and she was gone. But she had bestowed upon me the royal gaze for a fleeting instant. So I know she’s real and, more importantly, so am I. There was a mutual confirmation of existence. Which was strangely reassuring.But where does Prince Charles fit into this great unreality show? The answer is that he doesn’t. Not really. He is, and always will be, the odd man out. And that may well be his saving grace. It is a little-known fact that the young Prince of Wales was once a surfer and a windsurfer.\u0026nbspA fugitive from landlocked society. But even right out on the margins he was always marginal. More of a wannabe.He definitely got wet a few times\u0026nbspand was to be seen, all too briefly, walking on water.\u0026nbspI know that for a while, back in the late 1970s, he was even president or patron of the British Surfing Association and held a reception for the British surfing team before they left to compete in South Africa. He made some remark about a lot of the surfers having abundant moustaches and were they for the purpose of keeping you warm in the water? Not exactly Oscar Wilde, but good try, your royal highness.We know that the heir apparent was no fan of the cold showers at Gordonstoun. Maybe he even started surfing in Scotland. But\u0026nbspit was at Cambridge that he attained the zenith of his theatrical career with brief appearances on stage as an eccentric prince of some kind. He was either in a dustbin or was wearing dustman’s kit. He always said his inspiration was the Goons (Spike Milligan, Peter Sellers, and Harry Secombe), and knew “The Ying Tong\u0026nbspSong” off by heart, but even the most benevolent reviewers of the period would have to conclude that he was a Goon manqué.It was while at university that the idea got about that he had several butlers constantly in attendance, one for the royal toothbrush, another for buttoning the royal waistcoat and what not. This still seems\u0026nbspunlikely, given the limited accommodation, even at Trinity College. I saw him wandering the streets with his security guy way back when. No sign of Jeeves plural then anyhow. The flunkeys story probably got mythified out of all proportion. Clearly he has them. Actual stats hard or futile to ascertain.1948 Charles is born.

Kim Jong-un takes over in North Korea2012 Evidence for the Higgs\u0026nbspboson is discovered2017 Inauguration of Donald Trump2018 The prince’s 70th birthdayMaybe he should have become a serious historian. He would almost have fitted in amid the aggressively non-conformist refuseniks of the Senior Common Room. But didn’t he get a lower second? I guess that ruled him out. Shame really.He had his military period, like his old dad, but he never really took to life on the ocean wave, any more than to surfing. His career as Top Gun ended when he crashed a plane and had to be grounded for his own safety. But he still looked good in a uniform. So he thought he’d give marriage a shot. It was always going to be on the agenda at some stage. Future king has to think of passing on the baton at some point, always assuming someone has passed the baton on to him of course.Diana: she looked the perfect fairytale bride. A match made for global television. The prince and the princess. Sometimes one regrets that life does not resemble a fairytale in almost any particular. Unless, that is, the phrase “living happily ever after” can be taken to include mutual indifference, rancour, animosity, affairs galore, escapades of all sorts, falsehoods and confessions. James Dean argued that it was necessary to live fast, die young and be a good-looking corpse. It’s more glamorous, more Hollywood. So it could be that Charles missed his shot there too.Perhaps he was just not that cut out for marriage after all. Not everyone is. Perhaps no one. Why should he be more than another? He had a go at lover. Tried his hand at the difficult genre of the erotic utterance. Maybe he should have revised his Liaisons dangereuses beforehand.Having spent a certain amount of time floundering in his sea of troubles, far from the shores of public affection, Charles paddled back in with a degree of enlightenment and therefore took up the only sensible function now left open to him, a job with no known required qualifications, that of philosopher royal. His task was to offer opinions on everything under the sun.He succeeded in demolishing – theoretically – most modern architecture, anything after about 1900, but especially tall buildings, of which there are quite a few these days. He had a good point of course. He often does. Glass carbuncles were never going to be that popular.In the letters that have come to be known as the “black spider memos” he offered his advice to any number of ministers about matters ranging from homeopathy to foreign affairs. Which, technically, he is entitled to do. The sad thing is that, so far as can be determined, no one took any notice of him. Or perhaps did the exact opposite.Inspired by his old mentor, Laurence van der Post, he became a farmer-ecologist-conservationist. To be honest,\u0026nbsp his produce in Waitrose\u0026nbspis very\u0026nbspgood. The organic pears taste\u0026nbsplike pears of yore. Crunchy yet juicy. The “Duchy” business model is probably about as relevant as Disneyland to the state of agriculture as a whole, because the finances are all out of whack. After all, to some extent we\u0027re\u0026nbsppaying for the pears twice (and they weren’t cheap anyway)\u0026nbspbecause we are\u0026nbspsupporting the royal family through\u0026nbsptaxes. In that sense, Prince Charles has given the idea of living off the land a whole new meaning.Created with Sketch.Royal wedding ceremonies: through the years in pictures Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.140 Royal Wedding - Harry and Meghan, 2018Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and his wife Meghan, Duchess of Sussex emerge from the West Door of St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor Castle after their wedding ceremony240 Royal Wedding - Edward and Alexandra, 1863Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward  VII), and his bride, Princess Alexandra of Denmark, after their wedding340 Royal Wedding - Princess Patricia and Commander Alexander Ramsay, 1919Princess Patricia of Connaught, driving from Westminster Abbey, with her husband Commander Alexander Ramsay, after their wedding ceremony440 Royal Wedding - Elizabeth and Albert,1923Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon (later to be Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother) and Prince Albert, Duke of York (later to be King George VI) on the balcony of Buckingham Palace after their wedding ceremony at Westminster Abbey540 Royal Wedding - Prince Henry and Lady Alice, 1935The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester on their wedding day.

Which would depend on the next generation moving out of the way. It’s not a good position to be in. It makes you think too much of those Snoopy cartoons where he is being a vulture in a tree, poised to swoop. It works in the cartoon though.Even if Charles is hemmed in by senior members of his family on one side and the upcoming juniors threatening to overtake him, I still have doubts as to whether Charles is that impatient to be king. Charles, as a historian, has read his Walter Bagehot, the great theorist of the British constitution (which does not in fact exist).Judi Dench, Tim Minchin, Harriet Walter, David Tennant and Paapa Essiedu\u0026nbspas part of a special production of Shakespeare Live! from the RSC in\u0026nbsp2016 (Getty)He knows that the role of the monarch is to be the “decorative” or “dignified” part of the constitution. I still can’t see that happening. According to Bagehot, the monarch enjoys three rights, “the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, the right to warn.” Charles will still stick his oar in, in other words, but the reality is that he will be more constrained as king than as prince. The Prince of Wales – and there is no shortage of precedent here – can get away with just about anything and he’s still prince. The prince is virtually obliged to misbehave. The king, on the other hand, is required to be kingly. He doesn’t get to write so many letters, erotic or otherwise. He would effectively have even less power than he has now.Is Charles up to the job? The job-that-is-not-a-job. Charles wants to be king but knows that he never quite can be, even if he is. What\u0026nbsphas proved to be endearing about Charles and strikes a universal note is that he is still looking for the thing he is really good at. He has had a go at just about everything and has succeeded brilliantly in the realm of failure. The philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre described a man as being someone who is not what he is and is what he is not. I’m still not sure what that means exactly but Prince Charles seems to exemplify this uncertain and paradoxical status to a high degree.\u0026nbspPrince Charles feels \u0027regret\u0027 at being \u0027deceived\u0027 by paedophile bishopBahraini royal sued for £35m in UK over deal to meet Bollywood starsJapan’s Princess Ayako gives up royal title as she marries ‘commoner’ He once – briefly – had a go at Hamlet, on stage, with the Royal Shakespeare Company. He\u0026nbsputtered probably the single most famous line in all tragedy:\u0026nbsp“To be or not to be, that is the question” – putting a crazy over-emphasis on the final word. And Charles himself is more of a question than an answer, an enigma inside an anomaly. King of infinite space or quintessence of dust?He is not too sure. Who are you?” a child once asked him. “I wish I knew,” he replies, in a Jonathan Dimbleby documentary.\u0026nbspA prince with a touch of imposter syndrome. He is, after all, only the “apparent” heir and fears that the real one may yet pop up and take his place. Charles makes me think of someone who is always a bit betwixt and between, a round peg in a square hole, neither one thing nor another, but still, all the same, continuing to give of his best and give it a decent shot anyway. He is, you have to say, a trier.The black spider letters were once memorably described as being “as controversial as back copies of the Beano” (credit to Stephen Glover in the Mail). I have to admit, though, to a sneaking affection for the Beano. And, similarly, for those great old double-breasted suits of his, and his archaic way of speaking, all of that, in a spirit of nostalgia. Which suggests why he was never really going to make it as a surfer – he prefers to swim against the prevailing current.The first Charles took that too far and ended up with his head on the block, but if you had to pinpoint a king who looks like some kind of plausible precursor, it would have to be King Canute, sticking his throne down in the sand and trying to hold back the tide.\u0026nbspWe know that he has passed on his board to Prince Harry, who once went surfing in Cornwall. Maybe he will take over as president of the British Surfing Association.Terry Eagleton once said of the Prince of Wales that “he wants the kind of change radical enough to do away with polluters and modernist architects, but not radical enough to do away with himself”. But what he wants or doesn’t want is not really the point. If modern capitalism is all about “creative destruction”, then the feudal principle (and primogeniture) he embodies stands as a kind of counterweight or counterpoint to transience, a symbol of persistence or resistance (even if manifestly unfair and absurd). In the age of information and Donald Trump, he looks like someone who wouldn’t be well-equipped to tweet in the middle of the night. On the other hand, he could probably speak up for Gaia and communing with trees in a way that the average world leader might well shy away from.The prince’s purpose flows from his inability to quite fit into time and space.\u0026nbspWhether willingly or not, he has become the representative of all those (which is everyone, at one time or another) who feel rejected or excluded or left out in the cold or just waiting for a door to open that remains stubbornly closed. His charitable endeavours, on behalf of refugees and other fugitives from fate, reflect this role. Prince he may be, but he is already king of an immense and populous realm, the great and lonely kingdom of outsiders.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It\u0027s very much a continuation of the styling OnePlus used on the OnePlus 6 earlier in the year. That was the first to break with the metal-back styling of phones since the OnePlus 3 and opt for a glass enclosure front and rear.\u0026nbspThis looks as smart and stylish as the last model – which is very stylish, by the way –\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspalthough it\u0027s a little thicker from front to back (8.2mm instead of the OnePlus 6\u0027s 7.8mm), it feels very comfortable in the hand, not least because it\u0027s narrower than the last model.Still, it squeezes in a bigger 6.4-inch display\u0026nbspbecause the screen proportions are different: This is a 19.5:9 ratio screen. There\u0027s a notch at the top, but it\u0027s pretty minimal, like a drop of water when it\u0027s just about to gain enough critical mass to drip from the bathroom tap, no bigger than that. It looks cute.This teardrop notch is one obvious change. The second comes when you flip the phone over. Unlike on the OnePlus 6, there\u0027s no fingerprint sensor just below the dual cameras.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 43Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Designed by Pierpaolo Lazzarini from Italian company Jet Capsule.

Pick up the phone and the fingerprint icon lights up on the dark screen. Touch it, and it responds with a neat animation, like a fizzing electrical sphere, and unlocks to the home screen. It feels like the future.Huawei has a similar technology, though a less glitzy special effect, on the Huawei Mate 20. Huawei\u0027s feels just that bit quicker, but this is far from slow. It\u0027s not as fast as a conventional fingerprint sensor, but at least there\u0027s the cute animation to entertain you –\u0026nbspand it\u0027s still only a fraction of a second.Also, it sits in just the perfect place, right at the bottom of the display, in the middle, while the Mate 20 Pro sensor is quite a bit higher.That other Chinese brand, Xiaomi, also has an in-screen fingerprint sensor on its new Mi 8 Pro handset, though that requires a little more pressure.Top tip: when you\u0027re enrolling your fingerprint, think about what angle you\u0027ll actually be unlocking it from. My vertical thumb print wasn\u0027t very effective. I registered it again coming at it from the angle that it turns out I would actually pick the phone up by and it worked like a dream.OnePlus has beaten smartphone heavyweights Apple and Samsung to introduce an in-screen fingerprint sensor (OnePlus)Overall, the fingerprint unlock is pretty reliable, though it doesn\u0027t work as consistently as, say, Face ID on the iPhone XS. But it does the job more than nine times out of ten, so enough to keep you coming back to it rather than turning to the other ways to unlock the phone, such as facial recognition (consistent but not as much fun) or tapping in a PIN code.When it unlocks, you get to see the display in all its glory. It covers 86 per cent of the front of the phone. You can even obscure the notch if you want, or at least set it so the display colours itself black on either side of it, so it blends in. But with such a pretty notch, why would you hide it? Well, only because it gives the screen a little more symmetry, near-matching bezels at top and bottom, it suddenly looks like.The 6.41-inch display on this phone is bright and colourful, looking eye-searingly vivid in some wallpapers (which I love the look of, by the way). The wallpapers even bear the OnePlus slogan of Never Settle, a reminder of the plucky Chinese brand\u0027s positive attitude.It\u0027s a pin-sharp OLED screen, with 401 pixels per inch, that\u0027s the same as the iPhone 8 Plus and rather more than the iPhone XR. And it has OnePlus specialities like reading mode which turns the screen monochrome as though it were a Kindle.\u0026nbspIt completely dominates the front of the phone and you\u0027ll be glad to know it\u0027s robust –\u0026nbspit\u0027s made of Gorilla Glass 6.OnePlus mobile phones are seen on display during a press briefing in Mumbai, India, July 31, 2018 (REUTERSFrancis Mascarenhas)As far as the rear of the phone is concerned, there are two finishes to choose from, Midnight Black (it means matte black) and Mirror Black (it means, oh, you can work it out). Both are attractive.One of the most interesting things about the design is what\u0027s not there:\u0026nbspThe headphone jack. OnePlus is hardly alone in dropping this connection but nonetheless it\u0027s something that many fans have not been happy about, not least because the company championed the headphone jack one the OnePlus 6. Mind you, it means the phone has a bigger battery than last time, which on balance, is a decent trade-off.OnePlus hasn\u0027t introduced waterproofing here, either, something which is a real boon in technology generally. So, don\u0027t drop it in the bath. And, be warned, this phone can feel slippy in the hand.Something else that\u0027s absent is wireless charging. Now, scores of phones have had this capability and until recently it\u0027s gone largely unused. But the truth is that wireless charging pads are an unsung hero of the tech world, providing a genuine improvement in convenience that, once used, is hard to give up on.Wireless charging is especially good at disguising limited battery life because the simplicity of putting it on a pad feels much less of a commitment than digging out the right cable and plugging it in.So, although the company hasn\u0027t ruled wireless charging out for future phones, it\u0027s a shame it\u0027s not here now. Especially as the rear of the phone is glass, not metal.\u0026nbspStill, OnePlus prides itself on charging the battery fast, and that\u0027s definitely the case with the OnePlus 6T, which quickly goes from empty to enough to get through a day in around half an hour. That\u0027s part of the argument against wireless charging, of course, that it\u0027s not as fast.Battery life is strong with a full charge leaving you with a third of a battery by the end of the day, often more. As mentioned, this battery is bigger than on the OnePlus 6.Performance is good, too, thanks to the fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 chip and plenty of RAM to keep everything speeding along. It has the latest version of Android on board, Android Pie 9.0. OnePlus uses its own Oxygen OS set-up which is accessible and attractive.The camera is a crucial element on every smartphone now and I found the OnePlus 6T camera to be a moderate improvement on the last model. The hardware is the same, but algorithms and software have been enhanced to better photograph faces, text, food and night scenes, OnePlus says.The front camera is high-resolution, 16MP, and has similarly had a software uptick to make selfies sharper.The rear camera hardware is good - a pair of sensors with 16MP and 20MP resolution respectively - but sometimes I found the images were low on detail in places. Low light was less of a problem than on many phones but I didn\u0027t feel the camera quite on the level of the best in the market, such as the Huawei Mate 20 Pro and iPhone XS. Then again, those phones cost a lot more.Which is a part of the story for OnePlus. Although the latest phone is not as super-cheap as its handsets were when it first arrived on the scene, the price ticket here, £499, is impressive. Especially since the storage on board is 128GB, where many rivals have 64GB as standard, still.Camera apart, there\u0027s not much you miss out on with this phone (well, wireless charging and a headphone jack but they aren\u0027t dealbreakers) and there are some elements, such as the in-screen fingerprint sensor, which hardly any other phones can match. Add to that the strong performance, great battery life and fast recharge, and the OnePlus 6T is a deeply appealing choice.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Sterling dropped more than 0.3 per cent against the greenback to $1.3021, and fell 0.21 per cent against the euro to €1.1471. Analysts put the dip partly down to the US federal reserve’s indication that it will hike rates in December, which strengthened the dollar. UK economy flatlines in September, official figures showEU heaps pressure on Theresa May ahead of crunch talksThe midterms have only given the US economy a short-term boostThe IFS is right – Philip Hammond took a big gamble with his BudgetHowever, UK economic data also had an impact, with the Office for National Statistics reporting that the economy stagnated in September. While growth for the third quarter on the whole was lifted by 0.6 per cent - the fastest rate since 2016 - economists said this was likely to be a one-off. With “persistent Brexit uncertainty and the financial squeeze on consumers and businesses likely to weigh increasingly on economic activity in the coming quarters”, according to Suren Thiru of the British Chambers of Commerce. Meanwhile, Schroders senior European economist Azad Zangana said the economy is not forecast to pick up in the near term. “We expect UK fourth quarter growth to be very weak as Brexit paralysis truly takes hold,” he said. “Assuming the government can successfully negotiate the withdrawal agreement with Brussels and ratify it in Parliament, then we could see a rebound in growth early next year. “However, a failure to complete a deal which would mean a no-deal or cliff-edge Brexit, is likely to cause a further slowdown in activity, which could be enough to tip the UK into recession.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Eventually we could even use the technology to navigate ourselves, as we\u0027re on a path towards miniaturising\u0026nbspit\u0026nbspto the point it could fit in a smartphone.minitiarisation has already begun that could eventually see one fit in a smartphone (Imperial College London)The device represents the UK\u0027s first commercially viable\u0026nbspquantum accelerometer, which is a far more advanced version of the sorts of accelerometers that currently exist in today\u0027s mobile phones and laptops.The idea of using accelerometers for navigating is not a new one – as they\u0026nbspmeasure\u0026nbsphow quickly the speed of an object is changing in time –\u0026nbspthough until now accelerometers have not been accurate enough to match other technologies like\u0026nbspGPS.The quantum accelerometer relies on the precision and accuracy made possible by measuring properties of super-cool atoms, which means any loss in accuracy is immeasurably small.Dr Joseph Cotter, from the Centre for Cold Matter at Imperial, said: “When the atoms are ultra-cold we have to use quantum mechanics to describe how they move, and this allows us to make what we call an atom interferometer.”CenterHandout via REUTERS)Real-world applications for the device could first be seen in the shipping industry, as it offers a solution to some of the issues presented by GPS\u0026nbspnavigation.We need new types of navigation because at the moment the world relies very heavily on the global network of satellites to tell everybody where they are, said Professor Ed Hinds, director of the Centre for Cold Matter at Imperial College London.Scientists teleport particle into space in major breakthroughIt\u0027s actually rather easy for that system to be emulated and in fact it\u0027s been estimated that the UK alone stands to lose about a billion pounds a day if the satellite navigation system were denied.GPS\u0026nbspemulation – or signal spoofing – can also put cargo ships at risk to piracy,\u0026nbspDr Malcolm said, with\u0026nbsppirates\u0026nbspknown to\u0026nbspspoof signals in order to lure high-value cargos to dangerous areas.This is just the start of the journey for quantum navigation, he said. Scientists like Heisenberg and Einstein described these quantum ideas in their theories, but it\u0027s taken until now to actually physically make them a reality.\u0026nbspThe step forward this kind of technology offers\u0026nbspis unbelievable.

But it then turned to the foldable phone, dimming the lights and giving a short demonstration of how it might work.Samsung has been teasing the development of the foldable phone for more than five years. It is far from the only company to be doing so, and its announcement looked to be overshadowed somewhat when another smaller firm called Royole announced that it would be releasing a foldable handset of its own.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Used for conditions such as myopia and cataracts.It was only after Professor Eske Willerslev of the University of Cambridge and his team conducted their genetic analysis that they were able to prove a connection with the modern tribe.“Spirit Cave and Lagoa Santa were very controversial because they were identified as so-called ‘Paleoamericans’\u0026nbspbased on craniometry\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspit was determined that the shape of their skulls was different to current day Native Americans,” said Professor Willerslev​.\u0026nbsp“Our study proves that Spirit Cave and Lagoa Santa were actually genetically closer to contemporary Native Americans than to any other ancient or contemporary group sequenced to date.”With the results confirmed, the remains were returned to the tribe in 2016, where they were given a private reburial.A statement from the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribe said they “had a lot of experience with members of the scientific community, mostly negative”.It added: “However, there are a handful of scientists that seemed to understand the tribe’s perspective and Eske Willerslev was one of them.\u0026nbspHis new study confirms what we have always known from our oral tradition and other evidence – that the man taken from his final resting place in Spirit Cave is our Native American ancestor.”By combining the wealth of evidence, the scientists revealed a story of ancient movement that ned millennia.European arrival in Americas wiped out native dogs alongside people“A striking thing about the analysis of Spirit Cave and Lagoa Santa is their close genetic similarity which implies their ancestral population travelled through the continent at astonishing speed,” said Dr David Meltzer from Southern Methodist University. “That’s something we’ve suspected due to the archaeological findings, but it’s fascinating to have it confirmed by the genetics.\u0026nbsp“These findings imply that the first peoples were highly skilled at moving rapidly across an utterly unfamiliar and empty landscape. They had a whole continent to themselves and they were travelling great distances at breath-taking speed.”The findings were published in the journal Science.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Used for conditions such as myopia and cataracts.By creating a “hybrid system”\u0026nbspthat encourages the mushrooms and bacteria to collaborate, the scientists think they have solved this problem.The systems were created by 3D printing an electronic ink containing strands of graphene, and then following this with a bio-ink containing the bacteria onto the cap of the mushroom.When light shone was on the mushroom, the bacteria began to photosynthesise and a tiny current of about 65 nanoamps passed into the network of graphene.While the scientists think an array of these mushrooms would be enough to power something like an LED light, they are still way off powering larger electronic devices.With this work, we can imagine enormous opportunities for next-generation bio-hybrid applications, said Professor Mannoor.\u0026nbspFor example, some bacteria can glow, while others sense toxins or produce fuel.\u0026nbsp“By seamlessly integrating these microbes with nanomaterials, we could potentially realise many other amazing designer bio-hybrids for the environment, defence, healthcare and many other fields.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I think we are at a sensitive point in the negotiations. A successful outcome is not guaranteed, but I think it is possible in the next couple of weeks and probably with that in mind the less said the better about the detail of that.”Despite the contents of Friday’s leaked letter, David Lidington, the cabinet minister attending the summit in Douglas for the UK, said Britain would not accept “carving out” Northern Ireland from the rest of the nation.Lidington\u0026nbspsays the UK would not agree to iding Northern Ireland from Great Britain (PA)“On the commitments that were made in the joint report of December 2017 and all the various commitments that were made in that report – the prime minister’s always been very clear, that we won’t accept something that involves sort of carving out Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom,” he said.The dispute centres around the Irish backstop, a legal mechanism to prevent a hard border from arising on the island of Ireland in order to preserve the Good Friday Agreement.Created with Sketch.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.John Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

How could it be implemented? And what would the impact be on the economy?\u0026nbspBen Chu\u0026nbspexplainsClick to followIndy PoliticsFrench lessons? France has a 35-hour working week, implemented in 2000Labour, under Jeremy Corbyn, has been making encouraging noises about the idea of a four-day working week for some months now.\u0026nbspAnd this week things seemed to move on a bit further for the opposition party as it was reported that the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has spoken to the cross-bench peer Lord Skidelsky about the possibility of an inquiry into the topic.\u0026nbspBut what’s the argument for such a reform? How could it be implemented? And what would the impact be on the economy?Why would we want to move to a four-day week?Many advocates cite greater work-life balance. Working one fewer day a week would free workers up to look after children, elderly parents or simply to have more leisure time.But Mr McDonnell has talked about the move in terms of productivity – or a worker’s output per hour.He argues that British workers work the longest hours in Europe and yet are among the least productive.Give workers four-day week and more pay, unions sayThe four-day week could transform our lives and our economy Schools consider four-day week in cost cutting driveThat’s\u0026nbspborne out by the data we have.The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development\u0026nbspestimates that UK workers put in an average of 1,681 hours a year in 2017. That compared\u0026nbspwith 1,514 in France and 1,356 in Germany.\u0026nbspYet the Office for National Statistics calculates that GDP per worker in the UK is lower than both those countries.Labour’s lesson seems to be that one way to boosting our weak national productivity is actually to give people less time in the workplace to encourage them to work more efficiently while they are there.\u0026nbspWhile this might sound fanciful it’s not totally outlandish. One recent study from New Zealand showed that when workers moved to a four-day week at one firm their per-hour productivity did indeed rise.The argument is that a better work-life balance makes people more motivated, perhaps by reducing productivity-sapping illness and stress.How could it be implemented?This is a key question. For whatever the theoretical merits of a four-day week for productivity, ordering the entire economy to shift immediately to such a radically different working time structure would clearly be massively disruptive.Angela Merkel’s economic success may be more about luck than strategyEmployers would have to reconfigure shift patterns dramatically, in some cases having to hire many more workers. Think in particular of public services like schools and the health services. Think of the retail and transport sectors.\u0026nbspAlso, around 15 per cent of the UK workforce is now self-employed. It’s hard to see how the state could practically compel those 5\u0026nbspmillion self-employed workers to limit their working week to four days.One policy possibility\u0026nbspa Labour inquiry might consider is whether\u0026nbspto offer tax breaks or other kinds of support to firms that offer four-day working to employees, hoping that this could\u0026nbspencourage the practice to spread.What would be the impact on the economy?That would depend to a large degree on those productivity effects.\u0026nbspThe size of the economy is the value of the output of goods and services produced over a certain period. Working fewer hours would, as a first order effect, seem likely to reduce the volume of those goods and services, thus contracting the economy.\u0026nbspBut if we could produce more of that output in a given period that negative impact would be mitigated, perhaps even wiped out altogether.And\u0026nbspeconomies are dynamic too.\u0026nbspIf we could increase our productivity\u0026nbspgrowth rate\u0026nbspthrough a shorter working week the economy could, theoretically, be larger over the long run.\u0026nbspCritics argue that the productivity impacts are unproven, and that France, with its 35-hour week, has higher unemployment and a more rigid labour market than the UK, something that seems to be particularly unfair on young people.Yet it’s also worth noting that in the late 1900s UK workers put in on average more than 2500 hours a year, almost 50 per cent more than today. But our economy is far larger than it was then due to productivity growth.\u0026nbspThe big-picture historical lesson is that it’s certainly not impossible for average living standards to rise even as average hours worked falls.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Construction grew 1.7 per cent\u0026nbspafter deep falls in output during the snowstorms early this year.But services, which make up the bulk of the UK economy, contracted 0.1 per cent during\u0026nbspthe month.In the third quarter, business investment fell 1.2 per cent, the worst three-month performance since early 2016.It was also the third quarter of contraction in a row – marking the worst run since the last recession.Surveys suggest Brexit-related uncertainty is causing firms to freeze spending.\u0026nbspWorst run in a decadeThe Bank of England expects growth in the final quarter to decelerate\u0026nbspto 0.3 per cent.However, there was slightly better news from the ONS on UK trade, with the statistics agency reporting\u0026nbspthe trade deficit fell to £2.9bn in the three months to September, down from £6.1bn.Export values were up 3.8 per cent in the period, outstripping import growth of 1.7 per cent.Net trade is therefore estimated to have provided a 0.8 percentage point boost to overall GDP growth in Q3, after dragging\u0026nbspin the second quarter.Chancellor\u0026nbspPhilip Hammond\u0026nbspsought to accentuate the positive elements in the data, arguing the quarterly growth rate was evidence of the “underlying strength in our economy”. Speaking on a visit to Fuller’s Brewery in London, Mr Hammond said: “We are building an economy that works for everyone, with 3.3 million more people in work, lower unemployment in every part of the country, and wages rising at their fastest pace in almost a decade. Now our focus is on locking in this progress and ensuring people’s wages can continue to rise.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The barriers are mostly focused on keeping out undocumented migrants and would-be refugees.The erection of the barriers has also coincided with the rise of xenophobic parties across the continent, with 10 out of 28 seeing such parties win more than half a million votes in elections since 2010.“Europe’s own history shows that building walls to resolve political or social issues comes at an unacceptable cost for liberty and human rights,” Nick Buxton, researcher at the Transnational Institute and editor of the report said.Men convicted of plotting to bomb Muslim refugees blame Trump, RussiaHow refugees in Paris have become the ‘perfect prey’ for drug dealers Calais child refugees refused by Home Office ‘being exploited in UK’“Ultimately it will also harm those who build them as it creates a fortress that no one wants to live in. Rather than building walls, Europe should be investing in stopping the wars and poverty that fuels migration.”Tens of thousands of people have died trying to migrate into Europe, with one estimate from June this year putting the figure at over 34,000 since the EU’s foundation in 1993. A total of 3,915 fatalities were recorded in 2017.The report also looked at eight EU maritime rescue operations launched by the bloc, seven of which were carried out specifically by the EU’s border agency Frontex.Created with Sketch.Refugee crisis - in pictures Show all 27Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A child looks through the fence at the Moria detention camp for migrants and refugees at the island of Lesbos on May 24, 2016.

The flow of migrants arriving in Passau has dropped to between 500 and 1,000 per day, down significantly from last November, when in the same region up to 6,000 migrants were arriving daily.The researchers found that none of the operations, all conducted in the Mediterranean, had the rescue of people as their principal goal – with all of them focused on “eliminating criminality in border areas and slowing down the arrival of displaced peoples”.Just one, Operation Mare Nostrum, which was carried out by the Italian government, included humanitarian organisations in its fleets. It has since been scrapped and replaced by Frontex’s Operation Triton, which has a smaller budget.“These measures lead to refugees and displaced peoples being treated like criminals,” Ainhoa Ruiz Benedicto, researcher for Delàs Center and co-author of the report said.At the June European Council, EU leaders were accused by NGOs of “deliberately condemning vulnerable people to be trapped in Libya, or die at sea”, after they backed the stance of Italy’s populist government and condemned rescue boats operating in the sea.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

During the Soviet period they were farmed in huge numbers and are still reared and slaughtered in parts of the world for the fur industry.Although they are found sporadically in the wild \u0026ndash the creature is the melanistic form of the well-known red fox \u0026ndash the one rescued by the RSPCA from a garden in Alsager, Cheshire, shows all the signs of being tame.The animal welfare charity is now looking after the fox, which has been nicknamed Shadow, at its Stapeley Grange Wildlife Centre in Nantwich.Fantastic silver fox at Stapeley Grange RSPCA centre (Image: RSPCA)Amanda Lovett, who worked for the RSPCA before setting up a cats\u0026rsquo boarding home, caught the fox after spotting its predicament on social media.The former RSPCA inspector explained today: \u0026ldquoI was alerted to a post on a local Facebook group and it would seem the fox had been in the garden for most of the day. It was on one of the biggest nights for fireworks, and we knew we had to get the fox to safety.\u0026ldquoI managed to safely catch the fox with a grasper and put him in a cat box before taking him to Stapeley Grange, who kindly stayed open later so he could be admitted. He was very quiet and seemed tame.The fox was not fitted with a microchip but is believed to have originated from captivity.\u0026ldquoIt is likely that Shadow has been kept as a pet and he has either escaped, in which case we need to find his owners, or he has been dumped by his owners, said Stapeley Grange manager Lee Stewart.\u0026ldquoHe was checked over by our team of vets and was found to be in good health, just a little overweight. He is eating fine and seems to be doing well.\u0026ldquoShadow is the first silver fox we have ever had here at Stapeley Grange, in nearly 25 years we have been open. He is an impressive-looking animal and it has been interesting to us all to have such a rare admission.Adapted for life in the cold. Silver fox picture in Canada. (Image: )Silver foxes are seen occasionally for sale online as exotic pets. The RSPCA says if Shadow\u0026rsquos owners cannot be traced he will be rehomed with an animal specialist.The charity is also warning that foxes are wild animals with specific needs and require expert care.\u0026ldquoEven the most experienced fox experts have had difficulty keeping adult foxes successfully, therefore, the RSPCA does not advise or condone keeping foxes as pets, says the charity.

Heres the latest.While a number of politicians and celebrities have added their voice to growing calls for a second referendum this has always been rejected by Downing Street.Earlier today, Jo Johnson resigned as rail minister and said the deal was substantially worse than staying in the EU, and it was imperative we go back to the people and check they still want to leave.Upon resigning, Johnson demanded a second referendum.His decision to resign came after the failure of Brexit negotiations to achieve what had been promised.In September  the mayor of Manchester Andy Burnham backed a second Brexit votethere was a no-deal scenario - but warned it could trigger social unrest.Theresa Mays official spokesman has said: The British people have voted to leave the EU and there is not going to be a second referendum under any circumstances.It could depend on how Brits perceive Parliamentary squabbles over Mrs Mays Chequers deal.Labour has been in a muddle over the issue too — with the leadership refusing to commit to a call for a second vote despite cries from centrist MPs and members.A sizeable section in the party want a second referendum and pressure is mounting on the left-wing leader.The GMB, one of the UKs biggest trade unions, called for a vote on the final Brexit deal.Later in September , Mayor of London Sadiq Khan dramatically called for another EU referendum — saying that people must be given the opportunity to reject Brexit.The Mayor of London, who is an avowed remainer, argued Britain is facing either a bad deal or “no deal” which he says will hit jobs and living standards.Referring to the worst case scenerios, Mr Khan said: “They are both incredibly risky and I don’t believe Theresa May has the mandate to gamble so flagrantly with the British economy and people’s livelihoods.”Labours official position is that it would vote against any deal struck by Theresa May with the aim of pushing for a General Election.Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said that a motion on the highly isive question that has dominated the event in Liverpool doesnt rule out Remain.He told Labours party conference: We want a General Election to sweep away this failed government.After the Peoples Vote rally in central London Keir Starmer reaffirmed the party have also not ruled out calling for a second Brexit referendumthey couldnt force and election.Speaking on the BBCs Andrew Marr, he said: “If there’s no deal brought back or the deal is voted down, then other options are on the table, one of which is a public vote.“And in that public vote no options are ruled out, including the option of remain.”Paddy Power has odds of   on another EU referendum before the end of .A poll carried out by NatCen and The UK in Changing Europe revealed  per cent of voters would now vote to remain in the EU, while  per cent would opt to leave.The author of the poll John Curtice urged caution over the finding.He said the interview  was skewed towards remain, and that some of the sht was among those who did not take part in the original Brexit referendum.On November  , it was reported that the majority of voters in all seats held by Labour support a second referendum on Brexit.The findings were according to an analysis released by the People’s Vote campaign from a YouGov poll of , people.A second referendum will not happen quickly and the first stage is for there to be an Act of Parliament.That will require the backing of a majority of MPs and it took seven months before Parliament signed off the previous referendum legislation in .Last time around there was a four-month period between the then Prime Minister David Cameron announcing the referendum in February , and the vote taking place on  June.But the Electoral Commission has said in future there should be at least a six-month gap allow enough time to register campaigns and put counting officers in place.There is also the question of what to do about Article .Britain could vote to remain in the EU, but have  already left by the time the vote was held.This could be avoidedthe EU agreed to extend the Article  deadline - but that would need to be unanimously agreed by all EU member states.Then there is the question of what to put on the ballot paper.If there are three questions for example accept a negotiated Brexit deal, stay in the EU, or leave with no deal then just  per cent could decide the winning option. The first referendum on EU membership took place in .Two-thirds of votersbacked the continued membership of the European Economic Community, which the UK had joined only two years before.Under Harold Wilsons leadership, the Labour Party was trying to present to the public a dferent version of EEC membership to get a better deal.The EEC was integrated into the European Union after it was created in .In the summer of , Britain voted to leave the EU after .million people backed Leave compared to .million Remain voters.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Robbie was meant to be Simon Cowell, but looked a lot more like Big Bob Joylove from Harry Enfield And Chums, and Cowell himself was swathed in bandages ashe’d fled the Cedars-Sinai clinic halfway through a facelt.However much the outfits managed expectations, though, nothing could quite prepare you for the contestants, who seem to spend at least as much time preparing their sob stories as their singing.Scarlett Lee should’ve had the head start on everyone here, of course, after her brother’s home was incinerated and she “burnt her eye” in a salvage attempt.But Danny Tetley, who can dissolve into a sobbing wreck at the mere mention of bereavement, is the one giving a lesson to everyone, especially -year-old Giovanni Spano,he thinks we’re going to buy his “chubby teenager” torment for a second.No matter how much they spin and sob, though, nothing can quite take the edge off the singing, where this week’s race to the bottom was won by United Vibe’s version of Bleeding Love. “You cut me open and I keep bleeding.” My ears keep bleeding.The great thing about this lot, though, was that everyone thought the real problem was their name and kept insisting “You need to change it”, to something more viewer-friendly, like The Tinnitus , Tone-Def, The Backstreet Abortions, Hamas, anything but United Vibe.That problem went away, obviously, when they were eliminated on Sunday.However, the only thing anyone will remember about last weekend’s X Factor is the technical gremlin that struck,  minutes into Saturday’s pre-record, and made Danny and Anthony Russell sound like they were singing through a Dalek filter.Personally, I didn’t think it harmed their performances one little bit, yet after two hours of wailing and sobbing, up popped the message: “Tonight’s vote is cancelled.”It’s the last thing the show needed, clearly, as it’s already holed below the waterline and everything’s now going down with the ship.Everything except perhaps the unsinkable ego of Robbie Williams, who was still busy assuring Scarlett Lee, “In five years’ time, we’ll be on the same Christmas show together”, where Robbie will be working as a stage-hand called “Esteban” on Feliz Navidad Paraguay.“We’ll have a cuddle,” and then Robbie will whisper in Scarlett’s ear “You don’t know me. We never met.”On ITV last Wednesday they padlocked and chained professional bone brain Joey Essex to the floor of a chamber and flooded it with , litres of water.Then ruined everything by getting a magician involved and letting him escape.A right old waste of time called Ben Hanlin Live And Deadly: Drowned.A one-off special filmed at “a top-secret location” that was too scary to name but, according to the end credits, was actually Fort Borstal in Kent, where, as far as I can tell, absolutely no one’s been murdered, least of all the  haunting souls ITV kept banging on about.Still, you expect this nonsense on Halloween. What I hadn’t bargained on was that Joey wouldn’t be the dimmest person on set.That honour went to host Vick Hope, off Strictly, who distinguished herself early on by asking magician Ben: “What is a lock pick ”“It’s a pick that picks locks,” dumbo.She also tried introducing Diags, off Towie, as the show’s resident doctor, Ed Hope, and had a way of killing the mystery and tension that was quite hypnotic: “They’ll have to pick locks like their lives depend on it . . . ’cos they do . . . well, they kind of do.”If there’s one thing I’ll take from this show, though, it’s Vick’s final health and safety disclaimer.“It goes without saying,” she said, “don’t lock your head in a box of water, don’t handcuff yourself and don’t throw yourself in a lake.”Although, rule out none of the aboveLive And Deadly: Drowned comes back this time next year.Martin Keown: “Gambling is a gamble.”Dion Dublin: “Neil Lennon’s no shrieking violet.”And Alan McInally: “An hour gone and Manchester United haven’t been anywhere near the pitch.”.In these tearful, snowflake-ridden times, the most important and le-affirming television of the week was Wednesday’s The One Show.Other guests were present but, like every single viewer, they will have been transfixed by the remarkable Doddie Weir, the former Scotland rugby lock, in the shortbread tin suit, who was diagnosed with motor neurone disease two years ago.Very calmly he explained exactly how this was in the process of killing him, before, with the classic understatement of a man from the Scottish Borders – an area not big on over-sharing – Doddie said: “It’s not the best disease to happen.”There were none of the tears we’ve all come to expect in these situations, though, or any sense of self pity, because big Doddie is too busy pushing back, organising his charity events and doing the most important thing of all in these or any other circumstances.Grabbing le by the throat and getting on with the simple joy of living. mynamedoddie.Sophie: “Popeye.”Bradley Walsh: “Witches are most often depicted flying on what object ”Keisha: “UFOs.”Tipping Point: “Found on boxes of cognac, the letters XO stand for Extra what ”Tracey: “Alcohol.”And Bradley Walsh: “What rock ’n’ roll star drove a truck for Crown Electric before he was famous ”Catherine: “Rock Hudson.”AND INTERRUPTION OF THE WEEK...Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Fixodent is an adhesive used to keep in place...”BZZZZZZ.

According to new polling by YouGov, only three per cent of us think we aren’t handing the taxman enough — and just  per cent that most people pay too little.It’s hardly surprising. For most, the biggest thing they want politicians to tackle in their own lives is the cost of living. The more the taxman takes, the harder it gets to cope.Yet when you talk to ordinary people about tax, you find out that it is not a financial issue. It’s a moral one.They’re not greedy. Or selfish. They know the NHS needs money. And the police.But they also know thatthe state takes too much of what you earn, you’re not going to bother earning it in the first place.So they think that you should always workyou can — but that it should always pay to work. Andthe Government is taking more than half, you’re working for them, not for you.That’s why our think tank, the Centre for Policy Studies, is urging ministers to embrace two vital principles, outlined in our latest report.First, you shouldn’t have to pay tax before you’ve earned the bare minimum. One of the best things the Conservatives have done — inspired by our think tank — was to raise the amount you can earn before you pay income tax. At the most recent Budget, Philip Hammond hiked it to £, a year — from just £, back in .But there’s a sting in the tail. People aren’t paying income tax — but they’re still paying National Insurance, which is income tax by another name. We estimate that .million people have been “taken out of tax” — but are actually still paying it.And there’s another problem — at least for the politicians. Raising the personal allowance has kept take-home pay above water since the financial crisis.But just nine per cent of those we and YouGov surveyed knew it had gone up by that much, and  per cent said they hadn’t noticed it in their pay packet.That may be why just  per cent told us the Tories were the party of low taxes.That’s why we suggest a new universal basic income, a new right, for every worker, that the first £, a month will be free of both income tax and National Insurance. That’s a £ tax cut, which takes those .million people out of tax completely. And it should be front-and-centre on every pay packet.The next idea is just as important. It is that the taxman should let you keep at least p of every extra £ you earn — a work guarantee.At the moment, our tax system is riddled with points where you suddenly face a great big spike in what you pay.For the rich, it happens when your salary hits £,, and your tax rate soars to  per cent as that personal allowance is clawed back.But the biggest victims are those trying to come off welfare into work. In some cases, they only get to keep p in every extra £. So it’s no wonder they’re tempted to give up.This happens because even as the tax system gives, the benefits system tries to claw it back. That’s why we’re asking the Government to cut the rate at which Universal Credit is withdrawn to p in the £, to ensure it always pays you to climb the income ladder.Of course, this kind of thing costs money. We don’t want to copy Labour and go back to borrowing billions that we can’t afford. Or to scrimp on the NHS.But given the Government is spending more than £BILLION a year, there’s certainly room for some savings.For example, we currently spend £billion a year trying to encourage people to chip into a pension — yet have the lowest savings rate since records began. And that cash is spent woefully inefficiently — because the relief is based on your original tax bill, the top one per cent get as much help as the bottom  per cent, even though they need much less incentive to save.Replacing the current pension with an ISA-style system, where you got an up-front bonus for saving, would be simpler and more effective — and save us billions that we could use to help people right now.Andthe Government doesn’t like that idea, we’ve got plenty more.A forthcoming report of ours identies a dozen ideas for saving public money, adding up to £billion a year — from pegging Whitehall’s admin costs to the private sector, to eliminating wasteful and economically distorting subsidies, to reducing duplication in local government.Eventhe Government thinks it can’t find the money now, it needs to put making work pay at the heart of its future decisions. Not least because it is wildly popular.The universal working income is backed by  per cent to nine per cent. The work guarantee by  per cent to  per cent. These aren’t Tory ideas, they’re backed overwhelmingly by voters across the board.Perhaps that’s because these ideas embody what we all know to be true. Everyone who can work, should work. But people will only workit pays them to do so.The job for the politicians is to make damn sure it does.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One female onlookershrieks, “Help me! Help me!” as the others laugh, while someone  boasts: “I made the burning people.”It’s not just that it’s shockingly distasteful, it’s the sheer callousness of it that renders one almost speechless with disbelief.Then there’s the group of lads in their late teens who thought it funny to spit at Janice Morris as she sat alone on a park bench, before later pelting her with flour and eggs.When police — who class her as vulnerable and with mental health issues — visited her Suffolk home later that day, they found her still covered in flour and with “smudged mascara down her face”.One of the gang — -year-old Cohan Semple — saw fit to take a photo of the attack and posted it on Snapchat.One recipient reposted it to Facebook, it went viral and, quite rightly, prompted widespread revulsion and a police investigation.All five have pleaded guilty to using threatening behaviour which caused harassment, alarm or distress and await sentencing.Meanwhile, it seems “dozens” of the Remembrance Day “Silent Silhouette” statues placed all over the country have been defaced or smashed up by mindless vandals. In Devon alone, one statue was snapped in half, another five vandalised and one stolen.Oh how we wish that,caught in the act, their punishment could be a few weeks on the frontline of a war zone. But don’t hold your breath.Instead, let’s focus on the good in society that, thankfully, still forms the majority. The thousands who expressed their abject disgust at the breathtakingly inhumane bonfire stunt, the horried locals in Bury St Edmunds who helped police locate Miss Morris and bring her tormentors to justice, and the noble volunteers who, seeing the damage to the Silent Silhouette statues, stepped in to repair them in time for this weekend’s Remembrance Sunday.Volunteers such as a group of teenagers in Axminster, Devon, who took a vandalised “Tommy” in to their school workshop and repaired him.Placing him back at the scene afterwards, they laid a wreath and declared: “We are here today to show you that we, as young people, do care.“We care about the sacrices made by the brave men and women who fought for our country.”So let’s take comfort that the true measure of British society lies in their actions and not those of a few morons.“Dry Martini service trolley”, anyone  Nope, me neither.As for the hand-stitched couture Valentino gown, the site describes it as “a dress that defies adjectives”.Oh, I don’t know. “Bloody expensive” comes to mind.MODEL and self-publicist extraordinaire Emily Ratajkowski has published this photo with the caption: “Laundry day.”Cripes.

A simple check that took just a few seconds and should have been made by the authorities before they placed him at the school.It seems wily teenagers aren’t anything like as daft as their supposed superiors.The nation clearly needs to get out more.WHILE his estranged we Lisa Armstrong was in court for the initial hearing of their orce, Ant McPartlin was strolling in a park with new love Anne-Marie Corbett and Labrador Hurley.In photos, the canoodling couple appear to be on their own, but in yesterday’s Sun it was reported that, at one stage, “an aide handed Ant a poo bag”. In the interests of clarity, one should perhaps point out the bag was for the dog, not Ant himself. But I digress.The aide’s role reminds me of the old joke about the circus worker whose job it was to clean up prolic amounts of elephant dung.When asked whether he’d ever considered another line of work, he replied: “What – and give up showbiz ”THIS photo of Tom Cruise reprising his role as Maverick for the Top Gun sequel suggests he hasn’t aged at all in the intervening -plus years.Or perhaps it’s simply the wonderfully flattering gravitational pull of a high-speed motorbike.YOU know you’re famous when your No fan is Adele.When she appeared on James Corden’s Carpool karaoke, she was word-perfect on the Spice Girls single Wannabe and said she dreamed of being Ginger Spice.And yesterday, when four of the ladiesannounced a reunion tour, the delightfully down-to-earth Ms Adkins posted a photo of herself, pictured, aged about seven, in front of her bedroom wall papered in their posters and with the caption: “I am ready.”For Adele’s now thirty-something generation, you can’t overestimate the effect of the Spice Girls when they burst on to the pop scene in  with Wannabe.Yes, the “girl power” mantra was a bit cheesy but the point is that for a while they defined the zeitgeist of social change for girls who saw these feisty, opinionated young women having fun primarily on their own terms – and aspired to do the same.They’ve all had their trials and tribulations in the ensuing years . . . but haven’t we all Most of all, the Spice Girls are a mirror of the enduring power of female friendship, with all its twists, turns, complexities, bickering, sniping Mel B and Victoria – who, by the way, are currently speaking and, ultimately, longevity.Welcome back ladies.

Buttheres No Deal, then things could get tricky.Ministers are still working on getting a crucial agreement signed soon, but they could have to implement emergency plans in just days time. What should you know about getting ready for your holidays As part of plans to get ready for No Deal, it was recommended that Brits with less than a year left on their passport get theirs renewed sooner rather than later.Ministers said British people will need to have a passport which is valid for at least six monthsthey want to visit the EU.After we quit the EU our passports will be a navy blue colour, not the current burgundy red.Gloomy Phil Hammond got the nation panicking when he said that under No Deal, planes could be grounded between Britain and the EU. Its a warning thats been repeated by countless politicians since, including the EUs Jean Claude Juncker.Britain would no longer be in the EUs single aviation market, and flights to other countries with which the EU has a deal would also be affected.New agreements can be negotiated, but they could take a while.Airlines are confident that flights will continue to take off regardless - EasyJet and British Airways have said an agreement will be put in place, but Ryanair has been a little more cautious and has begun warning passengers on tickets that it cant be guaranteed.Trains will still run after Brexit, of course. But there are no guarantees that Eurotunnel wont have any disruption next year.As part of a raft of No Deal notices last month, the Government said that companies such as Eurostar, which only holds a UK licence, could be affected unless inidual agreements are struck with the countries it goes to.It advises taking out insurance for Eurostar tickets that cover any Brexit disruption.Under No Deal, UK driving licences would no longer be valid in the EU so holidaymakers would need to buy an international driving permit, available at the Post Office for £..The Government said: You may be turned away at the border or face other enforcement action, for example fines,you don’t have the correct IDP.And you could need a Green card  too - a translation of your car insurance policy - which you can get from the Post Office.But providing ministers secure the -month transition period as planned, this should stay the same.Holidaymakers are delaying booking their ferry crossings for next summer because of Brexit fears, Brittany Ferries said earlier this week, with bookings down  per cent.Dover to Calais and other ferry routes could be impactedchecks have to be made at borders in the event of a No Deal Brexit.But there are unlikely to be any extra delays for tourists, as Brits already get their passports checked en route anyway.No changes should be needed for anyone booking a package deal - unless your booking is with an EU-based firm and made outside the UK, in which case you may not be protected.There was a drop in the pound after Britain voted to leave the EU, meaning Brits will have to stump up more money to get their euros when going abroad on the continent.Buttheres a Brexit deal signed in the next few weeks, the pounds value could increase and make next years a bit cheaper again. A No Deal could see it drop again, pushing up prices.Brits will be able to continue to enjoy free healthcare when travelling in Europe after Brexit, it was confirmed last year.As part of the Withdrawal Agreement, officials have negotiated to use the European Health Insurance Cardacross EU’s  remaining member states – not just the country they’re living in.Pet owners should speak to a vet as soon as possiblethey want to take their animals to Europe after Brexit, Britains top vet warned earlier this week.Brits will need to pay up to £ for the right to take pets on holidaywe leave the EU with No Deal.If we do get a deal in the next few weeks it should be able to continue as normal.Most UK networks say they have no plans to bring back roaming charges after we leave the EU.The bloc scrapped them last year, but there have been fears it could cost more to call and use the internet abroad in future.Ministers have said that any increases again would be limited.Brits could be forced to apply for US-style waivers after Brexit to go on their hols, Theresa May has admitted.Unveiling plans last month to pre-screen EU tourists as part of her new post-Brexit immigration policy, the Prime Minister conceded the arrangements were likely to have to be “reciprocal”.The US currently charges  for every ‘ESTA’ waiver form – raising the prospects Brits will be forced to shell out each time they want to fly to the Costa del Sol.The EU are set to decide within weeks whether the Brits will need a visa in the event of No Deal."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000447559815.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"bikelife bikestormz army gangs","story":"Bikestormz - a collection of thrill-seeking young cyclists up and down Britain - is fighting back with the motto BikesUpKnivesDown.Their intervention couldnt come at a more critical time. This week, a boy of  became Britains th stabbing victim this year - and the nations kne crime epidemic has stretched public faith to breaking point.With police and politicians seemingly at a loss with how to stem the flow of blood on Britains streets, the bike community is desperately trying to prove that you can get a bigger adrenaline rush from cycling than crime.Founded in  by Mac Ferrari, a reformed roadman - a young wannabe gangster - at Bikestormzs last London ride out in August police held up traffic, blocked junctions and even cycled alongside the ,-strong mob in an attempt to limit the chaos.Ferrari, a softly-spoken -year-old explains: I have lost too many people I grew up with to murder to prison, he says.Over nine years I lost  friends to gun and kne crime. My best friend was shot dead in a nightclub when I was standing next to him.Others were sent to jail for all kinds of stuff – murder, robbery, drugs. So I wanted to tell the kids to put the kne down and do something more positive.I was tired of people glamorising the lestyle of crime.I wanted to show them you don’t need to get the adrenaline rush from crime you can get the same buzz from riding your bike. Now Bikestormz is like our church.However, unlike kne-wielding, drug-fuelled gangs that force youngers to break the law to progress up a vicious pecking order, this new obsession is saving lives and keeping kids out of serious trouble, Ferrari claims.Anyone who can peddle hard enough to keep up is welcome – no matter their background. Respect is gained by a rider’s skill and range of cycling tricks, rather than their police record.Authority is established through a series of regular skill events. Fighting is not tolerated. Rude and aggressive behaviour is sanctioned... and already, thousands have been inspired to get off their backsides into the saddle.Incredibly, some riders even say that the bike group has brought peace to London estates which were previously at war with each other.Kizzy, an elite rider, , says Bikestormz has even brought peace to warring South London estates.I used to live in Peckham and there was no way I could go to Brixton without someone attacking me,’ he explains.But when you are on your bike there is no problem.When you are riding no one cares where you are from. We are all together. There is something really positive about  or  of us riding together.’Kizzy, a former Deliveroo rider from south London, says he never carried a kne but lots of kids around him did.When I was young I was a right little s**t – stealing bikes, getting into trouble with the police, bad stuff.But after I got into Bikestormz I wised up. And I know so many people who have put down their knives and got into riding. That’s what it’s all about – doing something positive.Founder Mac had already established a reputation as a stunt motorcycle rider when he got back onto his peddle bike and gained followers for the tricks he posted on Instagram.But he could never have expected to find  young riders raring to go when he organised his first ride out from Tower Bridge – an event now immortalised as Bikestormz.I expected about  kids to come together. When I got there, there were . And I was responsible for them all. It was terrying!I told themthere is any fighting there will not be a Bikestormz. And it all went off peacefully. Now we have grown into a massive family.It gives the kids something to occupy themselves. When they are not riding they are doing up and fixing their bikes.Some kids are rude to drivers and pedestrians when we are out but I tell them to stop it. I don’t put up with road rage.Bikestormz represents the UK version of the bike-riding craze known as #Bikele, which was born in the ghettos of Baltimore and Philadelphia.Now the Bikestormz movement has grown into a nationwide phenomenon with kids pulling wheelies and riding in groups up and down the country whenever they have free time.They gather in large groups in parks and quiet roads in industrial estates at weekends or ride around their local area like a mobile gang. Riders join the pack as they see it roll past.They can also be seen practicing tricks on their own or in groups after school wherever there is space.Riding down stairs – no matter how steep or long – is popular too.Meanwhile, bike trick competitions are held in the parks and waste ground in South London throughout the summer.The top riders are selected to join a select group called Street Elite. They are chosen their skills but also or their responsible attitude.To be selected for Street Elite you’ve got to show a good example to the other riders, explains Montana, an -year-old from Lewisham, south-east London.Bikestormz has been a good influence on me. It has kept me away from trouble.Where I live there is a lot of crime and drugs.But riding is a positive thing. Some days I ride from midday until ten o’clock at night. I love it.I first heard about Bikestormz after it started up. I went to a ride out and I haven’t looked back. It has helped me steer away from crime.Founder Mac and his elite riders attract tens of thousands of Instagram follower and get free bikes, trainers and other merch [merchandise] from sponsors.Kizzy added: Being in Street Elite gives us much more exposure.We get bikes from Mafiabikes, trainers from Nike and we have started music videos for London rappers like JME and Macstar.Wheelie Kay@wheelie_kay .k followersFrom the age of nine I started learning how to wheelie, but it was quite hard, so I left it at that. When I ride with my music it just gives me a lot of energy and people love that.Little Harry@littleharry .k followersAs I got older, around , I started watching loads of dferent people on the internet and realisedI keep on practicing I could be like them one day. For me it’s not a hobby, it’s a lestyle and I love what I do.Jake@jake .k followersI’m  and have been riding since I can remember, I’m filled with adrenaline by wheeling through the tightest gaps and going at high speed through traffic!It’s an amazing feeling being surrounded by hundreds of people how share the same passion as you.Ruby@_rubybailey .k followersI have been riding since [I was] two years old. I’m Street Elite’s first girl rider.Riding has become a massive part of my le and I can definitely see a future in it for me.StreeteliteridersThe London traffic will once again be brought to a standstill by teenagers cycling five abreast when the group go out on their next ride out on Christmas Eve.No one knows exactly how many young men and women will turn up at the Tower Bridge starting line at pm on th December.No route has been planned but the cycle caravan will certainly pass Buckingham Palace, go through Hyde Park, possibly down Oxford and even roll on into the City of London.

Should parents be worried  Absolutely, say the experts.The National Crime Agency estimates that about , people in the UK pose a threat of some kind to children online — and the number is rising all the time.It adds there has been a  per cent increase in the referrals it has received about people uploading images of child sexual abuse since .Just as alarming is the damaging effect that smartphones and social media have on children’s mental health.According to Jean Twenge, professor of psychology at San Diego State University, the number of US teens who took their own lives increased by  per cent between  and .And , like me, you have a teenage daughter there is even more reason to be worried.Compared to the early s, nearly twice as many American teenage girls now end their own lives. In the UK, a quarter of -year-old girls experienced signs of depression, according to a study of , young people.Overall, Professor Twenge found that the generation she calls “iGen” — those born after  — are much more likely  to suffer from mental health issues than their millennial predecessors.“What happened that so many more teens, in such a short period of time, would feel depressed, attempt ­suicide and commit suicide ” she asks. “The sudden rise of the smartphone.”If you’re not convinced by the advice of the experts, just look at the behaviour of the people who’ve made their fortunes from peddling this digital crack cocaine.Bill Gates, the billionaire founder of Microsoft, stopped his children from owning a phone until they were  and the late Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple, would not let his kids play on iPads — even though he invented them.Apple recently introduced a new update that tells you how much time you are spending on your screen each day.That’s a step in the right direction, but don’t expect the company to do too much more. Last year, Apple sold nearly a quarter of a billion iPhones, helping to make it the world’s most valuable brand.The leaders of the tech giants are enriching themselves beyond their ­wildest dreams — not just at our expense but at the expense of our children.So it’s pretty clear they won’t be doing anything to help.

The EU reckons Britain’s economic prospects are worse than those of anyone in its club.And its Remainer stooges pop up like automated bots to carp about their own country being “the sick man of Europe”.That’s the same Europe which has youth unemployment at ,  and . per cent in Spain, Italy and France, compared with our .. And overall unemployment in those countries of ,  and . per cent when ours is four.Of course, the EU’s  forecasters are hardly likely to talk up our prospects.But one thing is clear.

What about the post that was sent, the women who helped and the impact the war had - from pioneering plastic surgery to blood banks. Here are  facts about World War One that tell the story of what really happened.. When did WW begin  WW began on July ,  . Why did World War One start  It all began because of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. He was heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary. . Who were the two sides  The Triples Ententes - also known as The Allies, were the British, France, Ireland and Russia. The other side are known as The Central Powers, Germany and Austria-Hungary. . Did Italy change sides  Italy were originally on The Central Powers side, part of a Triple Alliance. They left the alliance when it was clear it was offensive rather than defensive. Italy left and joined The Triple Ententes and declared war on Austria-Hungary in May,  and Germany in August, . . World War One has many names The Great War, the World War, the War to End all Wars, World War , WW, and the War of the Nations are just a few.  . How many soldiers died  More than eight million soldiers died in WW, and another  million were injured. If youre wondering how many soldiers were mobilised, there were  million. . When did America join WW  April , . A German submarine sunk a British passenger ship called the Lusitania, killing , passengers -  of which were American. The US was outraged and pressured their government to declare war. Woodrow Wilson, the president at the time, wanted a peaceful route but the Germans said any ship that came near Britain would be sunk. Wilson agreed to enter the war to bring a peaceful end. They were only in combat for seven months, but around , soldiers were killed and , were injured. . Chemical weapons were first used in WW Poison gas was seen as war crime, but using tear gas wasnt seen in the same way. The Germans first used the lethal gas in a chlorine. . The German strike The Germans werent always on board with the war. In , the German citizens began striking and demonstrating against the war. They were starving, and their economy was collapsing as the ports were blocked.  . When did WW end  June ,  - five years after the assassination of Franz Ferdinand. The armistice on November ,  ended the fighting, but it took another six months to negotiate peace before the Treaty of Versailles was prepared. . What was the Treaty of Versailles  It was basically an agreement to agree to the end of the war, and peace. The Germans had to accept full responsibility for causing the war, and there were consequences for this. The Germans had to surrender some of its territories and colonies and limit the size of its military. . What was the League of Nations  It was formed to prevent future wars. Germans resented the conditions in the Treaty of Versailles, and Germany and Japan eventually withdrew from the LoN in . Italy withdrew in . In the end the LoN couldnt stop Germany, Italy or Japan expanding their power. They took over smaller countries, and many think this is why WW never really ended, but continued with WW. . How many survived  Nine out of  British soldiers survived in WW. . What did they do in the trenches  British soldiers were moved around the trench system and werent often in the direct firing line. It wouldve been boring in between, with soldiers carrying out routine jobs and duties. . Army generals were banned from going over the top So many wanted to fight they were actually banned from fighting. If they were killed then the experience they had would be lost.  . There was a blood bank When soldiers were injured they gave them blood transfusions - transferring blood from one soldier to another. US Army doctor Captain Oswald Johnson set up a blood bank on the Western Front in . Blood was kept on ice for up to  days using sodium citrate to prevent it from coagulating and becoming unusable. . How old was the youngest soldier  Just  years old. He was called Sidney Lewis. He lied about his age to get into the army. He was one of , underage soldiers. . Plastic surgery came about in WW Surgeon Harold Gillies helped shrapnel victims who had terrible facial injuries with plastic surgeries. Its one of the earliest examples. The metal caused horrible injuries that were worse than the straight bullets. .  million letters were delivered  million letters were delivered to the Front every week. It took two days to send a letter from Britain to France. A mail office was set up in Regents Park, London to send letters to the trenches.  billion letters and  million parcels were sent during the war. . An explosion in France was heard in London A group of miners dug tunnels up to ft underground, to plant and detonate mines behind enemy trenches. The biggest success with it was at Messines Ridge, Belgium, where over ,lbs of explosives were detonated at one of the  tunnels underground. A lot of the German front line was destroyed, and the blast was so big it was heard up to  miles way - even the British Prime Minster heard it in Downing Street.  . Journalists risked their lives Journalists risked their lives to report on the reality on the front line. The Government began to try and control what information got back from the trenches, and journalists were banned. If you reported on the conflict you were seen as essentially helping the enemy. If caught, you could even face the death penalty. . Wilfred Owen was unknown before the War Hes now one of the best known poets of WW, but when he died on the front line - a week before the war ended - he was still unknown. The way his words painted the imagery of war, one of pity, horror and terror, was actually a minority view. In the s a literary elite decided his poetry was a more authentic view and two key war poetry war anthologies were published featuring him heavily. WW pictures: Powerful images show full horror of le in the trenches . Womens skin turned yellow As the men headed off to war, women took their place. More than a million women joined the workforce. They worked in poor conditions with dangerous chemicals and long hours. They were often called canaries as when they worked with TNT they got toxic jaundice - their skin turned yellow. . WW nearly caused financial meltdown Britain was an economic superpower, but the war cost more than any ever before. Bullets fired in one  hour period in September  was nearly four million pounds. . WW ship camouflage Merchant ships had to be protected so Norman Wilkinson, an artist and Royal Navy volunteer, came up with the idea of covering ships in bold shapes and contrasting colours. It was nothing like camouflage people had seen before and it was more meant to confuse than conceal.

So imagine how tough it can be when youre serving  roast dinners in each of your restaurants every week and not just the extended family. Thats the task faced every week by the expert chefs of The Toby Carvery. Millions of families sit down to tuck into a delicious roast dinner every week - wherever they are in the world. So ahead of Remembrance Sunday - and in a bid to help readers who tackle the job of cooking the Sunday roast each week - weve brought The Toby Carvery together with the chefs of The Royal Navy to get their top tips in the above video. Toby Carvery - the Home of the Roast - has long been a supporter of the armed forces, offering free meals to troops on Armed Forces Day.  And in the above behind-the-scenes clip on board HMS Northumberland, Toby Carvery Chef Trainer James Smith joins forces with the Royal Navys Chef Mitchell to lt the lid on how best to cook meats, roast potatoes, Yorkshire puddings and even gravy. Toby Carvery Chef James hails The Royal Navy for creating that home-from-home roast dinner experience at sea in the clip, saying: For many families, roast dinners are that one time everybody gets around that dining table. A really good roast dinner is just like having a really big hug on a plate!  Meanwhile, The Royal Navys chef Mitchell explains how important the traditional meal is to troops across the world. He adds: Ive cooked for Royalty and some of the biggest dignitaries of the Armed Forces, but every Sunday - guaranteed - ships across the world are having a roast dinner. Below, weve shared the top tips from the guys on the key ingredients to help families across the country cooking up a roast. Meats  Toby Carverys Chef James says: One of the tricks we use at Toby is to bloom our meat for a minimum of four hours first of all. So we take them out of the packaging and that lets the joints re-oxigise. We then load them into ovens and cook them really slowly. Letting them rest at the end is a key step to getting perfect beef. Yorkshire puddings  Were famous for our seven centimetre Yorkshire Puddings at Toby Carvery, reveals chef James. The trick to Yorkshires is making sure youve got really hot oil. Then add your batter to the oil and get them in the oven as quickly as you can. Roast potatoes Its all about the ruffling, chef James says, shaking a tray of uncooked but peeled and chopped spuds.  You want to shake them up and make sure you break the edges of the potatoes up. Then that will give us a really nice, crisp roast potato. Gravy  Chef James says: Theres nothing worse than thin or lumpy gravy! Consider adding cranberry sauce, mustard or horseradish. Meanwhile, The Royal Navys Chef Mitchell adds: We always go for a nice smooth, thick gravy. We normally put in a bit of red wine to give it a dferent taste. Ive even put Marmite in!Find your nearest Toby Carvery at www.tobycarvery"},{"url":null,"title":"jealous girlfriend drove partners ex","story":"NewsJealous girlfriend drove partners ex to suicide bid by sharing intimate snaps of herRachel Dale, , discovered graphic pictures of the victim on her partners phone and shared them with her , Instagram followers, a court heardShareByAmy Walker:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsRachel Dale posted the explicit pictures on Instagram \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA jealous girlfriend drove her partners ex to a suicide bid after she shared explicit photos of her on Instagram. Rachel Dale, , from Tameside, Greater Manchester, discovered the graphic images on her partner’s phone on her birthday. She warned the victim they would be all over the Internet tomorrow before sharing them with her , Instagram followers. The pictures were deleted after eight minutes but had already been circulated on social media forums and ious online chatrooms. The unnamed victim was so devastated by the disclosure she tried to take her own le, reports the Manchester Evening News. She was treated in hospital before being allowed home.  At Tameside Magistrates Court in Greater Manchester, Dale, of Stalybridge wept as she admitted an offence of disclosing a private sexual photograph with intent to cause distress under ‘Revenge Porn laws.’ But she walked free with a suspended jail term after she claimed the offence occurred after she had been made redundant from another clothing firm where she had been a retail buyer. The court heard that Dales boyfriend had a brief relationship with the victim - several years ago, before he met Dale - and that she sent ious explicit pictures of herself to him. The woman had asked him to delete the images just a day after she sent them but the court heard the explicit pictures remained on his phone.  Prosecutor Ashley Seetal told JPs: “In October this year the defendant finds these pictures of the victim onphone before uploading them to Instagram, a popular social media site. “The Instagram account which the images were uploaded on was a joint Instagram account used by the defendant and . This had been set up and was used to promote the business which they worked together on. “The account had , followers. These pictures were uploaded and made public, this means that the images can be seen by all , followers. “Prior to uploading the images to Instagram, the defendant sent the victim a message and in that message she alluded to posting the pictures online and in one message she said: ‘They will be all over the Internet tomorrow.’  “The images being uploaded of a graphic and intimate area, were shared to a number of group chats and social media chats. “The victim did attempt to take her own le, this was a serious attempt and she was taken to hospital and received treatment. The images when posted onto Instagram, the popular social media site, were viewable to a number of followers and the wider public. There is evidence of serious distress and serious signicant psychological harm.” A probation report read to the court said Dale ‘accepts full responsibility’ and has ‘saidshe could turn back the clock she would.’She claimed to have been suffering from anxiety at the time - having been made redundant days earlier.  “She has been in this relationship for two and a half years. She says the relationship is good but she does have some concerns about the status of the relationship,” the report said. “She was working full time and working with her partner on the side on their own business, which she invested in financially, as well as investing her own time and effort. “She has not told her family in fear of their reaction. She has got a stable lestyle. She has concerns, she is not surethe relationship will continue long term. She still has to work things out with the business. “She is not sure how successful it is going to be. Whilst the victim had slept with her boyfriend, this hadn’t previously played on the mind of the defendant and the two parties have little to do with each other and were at an amicable level.  “But she went out celebrating the night before as it was her birthday and on finding the photo on the phone, she says she acted on impulse with intent of seeking revenge. She said she was quite distressed and said ‘there were no other options at the time.’ In mitigation, Dale’s defence lawyer Gavin Clarke said: “This is a lady who on October  this year was in a relationship with her partner for two and a half years. “They have a shared account due to their business together. At .am she has been awoken by a number of images sent from a third party, from the victim, sent to her partner at the time. “She sees these images, graphic and explicit images and she is devastated, she is mortied. She then texts the victim and pre warns her. Yes, she does upload those to an Instagram profile.  They are up there for - minutes. They are not up there for eight months, they are not put on a streaming site. “They are uploaded to an Instagram account with between , to , followers. It was posted for between  and  minutes at . in the morning. In terms of how many people who have viewed those, the numbers are going to be extremely limited. “The person who followed the account would have to be on that account at that time. They would have to be looking at that particular account. There is no preplanning, this is a spur of the moment. This young lady, as soon as she calmed down, she realised the error of her way and took it down, that’s the end of the story. “I accept there has been some humiliation but this is very dferent to revenge, this was a spur of the moment. She was going about her own business, finds this on her partners phone and reacts there and then. This was not out of revenge or some kind of hatred.  “This is a young lady of , who has never appeared before the courts before and I dare to say I don’t think she is ever likely to came back to this court again. This offence is something she genuinely regrets. Dale was sentenced to  weeks jail suspended for a year and was ordered to pay pound in costs and surcharges. She did not comment after the hearing.

Leanne Parrett, , was on her way to Gloucester Royal hospital to have her baby with husband Sam on October  when she had the urge to push. Sam pulled over in a lay-by off the M and called  when he realised that Leanne, from Yate near Bristol, was about to give birth in the back seat of their car, reports Somerset Live. Sam begins the call: We were driving to the hospital and its rush hour and shes screaming saying she needs to push and I cant see a head, but yeah. Screaming can then be heard in the background.  Sam then tells the call operator seconds later Ok, a babys here and a squealing newborn can be heard. The new dad continues: its out, its out followed by hello to his son. I wasnt expecting that, he adds. The couple then took it in turns to hold Sebastian, a healthy baby boy weighing lb oz. Leanne told Gloucestershire Live: Sam couldnt believe that I needed to start pushing, so was about to get onto the motorway at Junction  towards Gloucester, just past Tortworth. But he pulled over in the lay-by literally meters from the motorway turning.  He had a look and was like okay I need to ring . I was in agony. I was squatting in the back seat and I just needed to push, and within two pushes he was out and Sam grabbed him, and then hestarted to cry. And on Thursday at the North Bristol Operations Centre, Leanne and her family were reunited with the South Western Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust team who helped deliver her baby. Charles Passmore, Emergency Medical Dispatcherfor SWASFT, took Sam’s  call. “The call came to me and it was clear from the start this was going to be an emergency birth as they were still on the motorway, he said. “Pregnancy incidents are one of the most unpredictable calls we face as EMDs, as there are multiple scenarios that could change at any time so I knew I had to be fully focused.  “After I gathered the basic information about the scene and the patient details, the baby had already started to show, so time was of the essence. I began giving the instructions to the father to get the mother into the correct position, and to get some towels and other equipment ready for the baby’s delivery. “The baby was delivered in a short amount of time and after making sure that his airways were clear and that he was breathing effectively, it was then my job to make sure the new-born was warm enough. Then the priority was to check on the mother and make sure she was okay and not deteriorating in any way.”  Leanne said: “The call handler was amazing and stayed on the phone with Sam the whole timeuntil the ambulance arrived. They made sure Sam knew what to do immediately following the arrival of Sebastian.” The first SWASFT paramedic on scene was Scott King who got there on his motorbike. Soon after an ambulance arrived with paramedic Amy Johnson and emergency care assistant, Lloyd Easton. Leanne said: “Scott was first to arrive on the bike and offered me gas and air as I was still in pain. He put a hat and nappy on Sebastian and checked he was okay. “Then Amy and Lloyd arrived in the ambulance and Sam got to cut the cord and we went to hospital.  “I am so so thankful for everything the NHS has to offer and these wonderful people made a scary and stressful situation so calm and memorable.” Charles, EMD, added: “This was a brilliant call to be a part of and a wonderful moment that I will never forget and I wish them all the best of luck.” Lloyd, Emergency Care Assistant, said: “This was one of the best jobs I have ever been to. Although it was an incredibly stressful situation for Leanne and Sam to find themselves in, it had the best outcome anyone could have hoped for – a beautul healthy baby being brought into the world. “As a family they can cherish that terrying but incredible hour of their lives forever and I’m so glad we were able to be a part of it to make sure they were all safe and well.” Over the past  months ambulance teams have helped approximately  babies to be born in emergency births across the South West.

The Prime Minister has written to the Democratic Unionist Party, triggering fears she will cave into Brussels’ demands for a Northern Ireland-only “backstop to the backstop” in case of a no-deal exit. In the letter obtained by The Times, Mrs May said: “I am clear that I could not accept there being any circumstances or conditions in which that ‘backstop to the backstop’, which would break up the UK customs territory, could come into force.” The DUP fears the wording means the measure will be included in the Brexit orce deal - despite the PM’s insistence it will never come into effect. Any version of the backstop would apply unless and until a wider deal with Brussels on the future relationship solved the issue of how to avoid a hard border with Ireland.  Mrs May relies on the support of the DUP’s  MPs for her Commons majority - votes which will be crucial as she attempts to get a deal through Parliament. DUP leader Arlene Foster said: “The Prime Minister’s letter raises alarm bells for those who value the integrity of our precious union and for those who want a proper Brexit for the whole of the UK. “It appears the Prime Minister is wedded to the idea of a border down the Irish Sea with Northern Ireland in the EU single market regulatory regime.” Accusing Mrs May of a “total betrayal”, the DUP’s Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson said she had broken “promises she made”. The row unleashed frustration in Downing Street, with sources insisting Mrs May was not hiding behind “weasel words”. Her deputy, David Lidington, said: “The Prime Minister has always been very clear we won’t accept something that involves carving out Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK.”  A UK-EU deal would involve “compromises, give and take on all sides”, he admitted. But a “product on the table” in the form of an agreement backed by all  EU leaders could create a “new dynamic” in Westminster, he believed. Irish PM Leo Varadkar said “it is more likely than not that we will be able to conclude an agreement” in the coming weeks. But “lots of things can go wrong” - including having to get a pact through Westminster and the European Parliament. “Even when all of that is done, then we begin the talks on the future relationship,” Mr Varadkar said at a summit on the Isle of Man. “There is no clean break here, Brexit is going to go on for a very long time.” Meanwhile, the EU is set to demand ongoing access to UK fishing waters while Britain remains in the customs union as the price of a UK-wide backstop called for by the PM. One EU diplomat said: “It is paramount the UK gives assurances on the access of the European fleet to UK waters before the EU can agree to a UK-wide backstop.” Another told the : “There can be a customs union, but there must be rules to ensure that EU fishermen will be able to continue to fish in UK waters.” "},{"url":null,"title":"theresa says we remember them","story":"NewsWW: Theresa May says we will remember them as she visits battlefieldsThe Prime Minister was visiting the battlefields of Belgium and France to pay her respects to those who gave their livesShareCommentsByAndy Lines:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsPrime Minister Theresa May at the St Symphorien Military Cemetery in Mons \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAs she marked the centenary of the First World War armistice, shyTheresa May uttered these shypowerful but simple words: “We will remember them.” The Prime Minister was visiting the battlefields of Belgium and France to pay her respects to those who gave their lives during the Great War from  to .

Mrs May started her tour at St Symphorien Military Cemetery in Mons with her Belgian counterpart Charles Michel. She was sombre as she laid wreaths at the graves of the first and last British soldiers to be killed in the conflict. Private John Parr of the th Battalion Middlesex Regiment was killed on August , , while Private George Ellison, of the th Royal Irish Lancers, died on November , , at . am – before the Armistice came into effect at am.  In a note left at Private Parr’s resting place with a wreath of poppies, the PM quoted a line of wartime poetry from The Soldier written by Rupert Brooke. She wrote: “There is in that rich earth a richer dust concealed.” At the grave of Private Ellison, in blue pen on a headed Downing Street card, Mrs May wrote: “They were staunch to the end against odds uncounted ... We will remember them.” The quote is from another poem by Laurence Binyon and is often used in Remembrance services. During the visit, she and Mr Michel met British and Belgian serving members of the armed forces.  She then travelled to France and met President Emmanuel Macron in Albert, the town in the heart of the Somme region which suffered horric bombardment during the conflict. The leaders had a private meeting and a working lunch before they departed for a wreath-laying ceremony at nearby Thiepval Memorial. It bears the names of more than , members of the armed forces who died in battle and holds an annual commemoration for the “Missing of the Somme”. A wreath combining poppies and le bleuet, the two national emblems of remembrance for Britain and France, was made for the occasion. Mrs May said the visit was a chance to reflect on the time the countries spent fighting side by side in Europe but also to look ahead to a “shared future, built on peace, prosperity and friendship”.  Meanwhile, five British veterans received France’s highest military honour for their role in liberating the country during the Second World War. The four men and one woman, all aged in their s, include an Enigma codebreaker who operated Alan Turing’s machines, a soldier who once captured  Germans and a cameraman who filmed the landings at Normandy during D-Day.

Satanists object to scenes in teenage witch drama The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, which feature a monument similar to a controversial statue of a god named Baphomet. American organisation The Satanic Temple is suing for  million - the equivalent of pound million - claiming itshas been infringed and its reputation is being damaged damaged. Co-founder Lucien Greaves posted a picture of the statue used in the series alongside a snap of the temples own monument in Detroit.He told CNBC that the Baphomet statue is an icon that represents satanists. Mr Greaves said: “To have that all at once entirely eclipsed by some Netflix show by a production department who did a Google Image Search... A lot of people who haven’t heard of us first stand to just recognize that monument as the ‘Sabrina’ monument, which dilutes and denigrates the entire project. A lawsuit filed yesterday in New York claims satanists are presented in the series as evil antagonists.  It adds the Satanic Temple created its depiction of Baphomet in part to promote First Amendment values of separation of church and state and equal protection. Characters are shown worshipping Satan, murdering, torturing and engaging in cannabalism. But this is misleading, The Satanic Temple - which was founded in  - claims. Legal documents state: What makes this case particularly striking and signicant is that it arises in the context of Defendants who are highly sophisticated media production and distribution companies which blatantly misappropriated Plaintfs unique expression of an idea even though they have a long history of vigorously protecting their own intellectual property.  While the show presents satanists in a negative light, the organisation instead claims Satan is a rebel against Gods authority - and not an evil being. Mr Greaves added to CNBC: “We’re so inundated with this anti-Satan fiction that a lot of people think its superfluous to pursue to a claim like this at all.” He had earlier posted on Twitter: Yes, we are taking legal action regarding #TheChillingAdventuresofSabrina appropriating our ed monument design to promote their asinine Satanic Panic fiction. The show, which is available on Netflix, is about a half-human, half-witch teen called Sabrina Spellman.  It is inspired by a comic book which was also the basis for popular TV show Sabrina the Teenage Witch. The Baphomet monument was created to show the goat-like deity to contrast with a Ten Commandments monument in Oklahoma City. But plans to display it in public were met with huge opposition. Netflix and Warner Bros have both declined to comment while the case is ongoing.

After managing to lose a staggering st lb , Lexi Reed, , from Terre Haute, Indiana, USA, started struggling with the agonising soreness in her jaw, neck and back this year. Terre, who weighed  stone, had symptoms that left her helplessly crying in front of the mirror and baffled doctors who believed it to be sinus or root canal problems. It was only two months ago that husband Danny, , suggested her loose skin could be to blame. He held up the skin on her stomach and she felt relief from her pain for the first time in months. After consulting Dr. Joseph Michaels, it was recognised that the weight of the flab was pulling her body out of its natural posture.  She went under the kne for nine hours, having skin removed from her stomach, thighs and butt, and some of the excess fat taken out through liposuction was transferred to her buttocks. Now in recovery she will soon be free of pain, and while she was content with her loose skin previously, shes now relishing having a flat stomach for the first time in her le. Lexi said: I suffered months of pain, taking four or five antibiotics and was told it may even be a sinus infection.  But I knew my body and the way I felt wasnt normal, the bizarre symptoms werent adding up. A few times I wonderedI would wake up the next day as no one knew what was wrong with me. It wasnt until standing in front of the mirror that we figured it out, some days I would stand there crying to Danny not knowing what was wrong with me. Danny askedthe skin may be causing the problem because of how heavy it was on my new body.  He stood up behind me and lted my stomach from the front to see what it would look like without the skin and for the first time my neck didnt hurt. When he massaged my neck I instantly felt better, it was then that we came to the realisation that it was my skin that was causing me pain. When I reached out to Dr. Joseph Michaels, he told me that the excess skin can affect and throw-off your posture. My skin was pulling down my posture it may have caused me to become a hunchback but since surgery the pain hasnt been anywhere near as bad.  While Im still in pain from the surgery right now I dont have my stomach holding me back and the pain being gone from my neck will be a new le and make it worth it. Lexi started her weight loss journey three years ago, along with husband Danny who weighed stat the time, to help their chances of falling pregnant. At their heaviest they consumed up to , calories in a day and Lexi, the heavier of the two, had a BMI of . - a shockingly high figure compared the healthy range which is between . - . Between them they lost over  stoneand to celebrate their weight loss they embarked on a bucket list of challenges from theme park rides to travelling, kayaking, hiking and more.  Their journey, which was spurred on by regular chants of Baby Reed, left Lexi lean at st and Danny weighing st  . Despite Lexis surgery to remove her loose skin, she insists vanity played no part in her decision and she was in fact proud of her battle wounds. Lexi said: I weighed lb at my heaviest so I knew going into this I would have loose skin. I was determined it was not going to hold me back from doing things like rollercoasters, climbing stairs and being fatigued. I saw my skin as a battle wound, I knew my body didnt deserve to carry around the weight of all the excess skin.  I would have preferred to have ten times extra skin than be lb and on my death bed, theres so much more I can do now. I could fit in a airplane seat, go for walks and so many things, my skin never held me back before. People shouldnt be afraid of having loose skin, but instead worry about not living their best le. Lexi still has been left with other loose skin on her legs and arms, but doesnt see them as a problem. Despite this, looking at her new stomach was a moving moment having the , of skin removal surgeries to reduce and hopefully eradicate her pain. Lexi said: Seeing my stomach was emotional, I have never had a flat tummy in my entire le.  I always had rolls, stretch marks and never had a perfect body, so while this decision wasnt for vanity reasons its amazing to see the hard work over the past three years. Dr. Joseph Michaels who performed the surgeries over nine hours, says it was a privilege to help Lexi and he hopes this will start a new chapter in her le. He said: Excess skin can constantly pull on her skeleton and can cause pain in the back, neck and other areas. Its not just the sheer strain but the way it pulls the body and the problems that can cause. The skin can be an issue in terms of their hygiene and daily activities, fortunately Lexi is very mobile, but was being caused chronic pain. The surgery will not only help her contour but aids to relieve her body of a lot of excess skin. We removed seven pounds of excess skin, theof it was over ft wide and .ft tall, we would have taken more away but need it for her buttocks.  We dont want patients to look like a pancake on their buttock, we want good shape and good curves. Im very pleased with how the surgery came out and happy that she is reporting improvements with her muscular skeletal pain. The board-certied plastic surgeon who has a speciality in post-weight loss surgeries aided Lexi by removed skin from her stomach, thighs and buttocks. He also performed liposuction, transferring the fat into her butt cheeks. Dr Michaels said: Its really important for patients to know you cant exercise your skin and for a lot of patients the skin is not only a physical burden but a psychological one too. It can really prevent patients from realising the true extent of their weight loss accomplishments but once the skin is removed the physical and emotional improvement is very dramatic. Its a privilege for me to help patients on this last part of their journeys.

The technique has been seen before in these intelligent marine mammals, but it is rare to capture on film and at close range. The moment was caught by Berthold Hinrichs in the Norwegian Sea off Skjervoy, in the north of Norway this week. Fish are seen jumping from the water after being driven upwards by the group of whales. This is a classic technique for generating a bubble net used by hunting whales. Research into whales and dolphins has shown they can learn as iniduals and can pass on their knowledge to others. Inidual learning was previously believed to be an exclusively human trait.  However, other animals such as whales have shown examples of inidual and team learning, as opposed to a genetic hardwiring for displaying certain behaviours.  To communicate, whales touch fins with each other, vocalise and slap fins on the water. Humpback whales are famous for their song, with males producing a long series of calls that are normally heard during the winter breeding season. They may repeat the song for several hours. Despite increasing awareness of the threats to whales, the biggest issues to their numbers include being hunted by nations such as Japan, ship strikes, pollution, and entanglement in fishing gear.

Former inmates have spoken in horrying detail about the treatment they have endured after being rounded up and imprisoned in western China. Those arrested are from the Uighur community, a largely Muslim ethnic minority in the Xinjiang region, which borders Afghanistan and Mongolia. According to the Uighurs, staggering numbers of their own have been taken from their homes in the last two years, with the brutal crackdown going largely unnoticed and unchallenged. In August this year, a UN human rights committee made a bombshell claim - that up to million people could be being held in those buildings.  Chillingly, the committee said China had “turned the Uighur autonomous region into something that resembles a massive internment camp” under the guise of “combating religious extremism”. Their words echo those of an earlier US congressional committee on China, which warned that the round ups of Uighurs is “the largest mass incarceration of a minority population in the world today.” As more details emerged, as well as rare statements from survivors, the world has in recent weeks started to notice the plight of the Uighurs with a growing sense of alarm and horror. In some towns in the Xinjiang region, many Uighur towns and villages have been left virtually empty after huge numbers were taken away to the camps, according to witnesses. Chinese company forces employees to drink urine after they failed to meet sales targetsSpeaking anonymously, one official told a newspaper that nearly half of an entire village had been detained, with “only children and old people remaining”. Others claim they have not heard of anyone leaving the camps in the two years since Chinese police started rounding up members of the Muslim minority. Perhaps even more disturbing, the detentions are leaving countless children without their mother or father, with the government sending them to overcrowded orphanages thousands of miles away from their homes, according to reports. One orphanage worker in Xinjiang told Radio Free Asia last year that conditions in the state orphanages are “terrible”. “Because there are so many children, they are locked up like farm animals in a shed,” he said.  According to human rights groups, the most arbitrary of reasons are used to send people to the reeducation camps, from having an Arabic reader on their mobile phone, to growing a long beard or having contacted someone abroad via Whatsapp. Human Rights Watch claim anyone with relatives in  so-called “sensitive” countries like Indonesia, Kazakstan and Turkey have all been rounded up. Being born in the s and s can mean automatic detention - an official directive branded Uighurs from those decades as “members of an unreliable and untrustworthy generation” and targets them for reeducation because they are “susceptible” to be influenced by extremism. And those who haven’t yet been targeted are subject to intense surveillance - from facial recognition cameras to QR codes on people’s doors, so officials can check the codes to see who is inside at any point, according to observers. While China simply claims people in Xinjiang are just receiving “vocational training”, reports from inside the camps paint a very dferent picture - of ethnic cleansing and a campaign to obliterate the centuries-old Uighur culture and identity.  China has long feared that the Uighurs will try to rise up and establish their homeland in Uighurs, while some recent terrorist attacks involving a Muslim Uighur has helped justy the crackdown against extremism in the region. Rare statements from former inmates tell of how they were forced to eat pork and drink alcohol, which are forbidden to Muslims, renounce Islam and criticise their Islamic beliefs, and recite Communist Party propaganda songs for hours each day. In interviews with the BBC’s Newsnight programme, former prisoners who were able to leave for other countries told how they had been tortured in the camps. One man, Omir, said: “They wouldnt let me sleep, they would hang me up for hours and would beat me. “They had thick wooden and rubber batons, whips made from twisted wire, needles to pierce the skin, pliers for pulling out the nails. “All these tools were displayed on the table in front of me, ready to use at any time. And I could hear other people screaming as well.  And another told how the tactics leave inmates brainwashed: “It was dinner time. There were at least , people holding empty plastic bowls in their hands - they had to sing pro-Chinese songs to get fed. They were like robots. They seemed to have lost their souls. I knew many of them well - we used to sit and eat together, but now they behaved like they were not aware of what they were doing, like someone who had lost their memory after a car crash.” A Communist Party audio recording transmitted last year to Uighurs via social media  WeChat referred to the camps as “hospitals” where people who had been “infected by an ideological illness” could be treated. It said: “They have been infected with religious extremism and violent terrorist ideology, and therefore they must seek treatment from a hospital as an inpatient “If we do not eradicate religious extremism at its roots, the violent terrorist incidents will grow and spread all over like an incurable malignant tumor.”  In public, though, China has tried to show the centres in a very dferent light. Last month, the top official in Xinjiang said vocational education centres had been set up and were proving effective in staving off terrorism. Shohrat Zakir said classes were given on Chinese history, language and culture, adding that people in the centres were provided with nutritious, free diets. Few have been convinced by China’s explanations, which have not halted the growing international alarm at their treatment of the Uighurs. So far, however, no country has dared move from issuing critical statements to putting pressure on China by threatening punitive action such as sanctions. PM Theresa May only said the UK was “concerned” about the issue back in February during a visit to Beijing, while Donald Trump has ignored a congressional committee report urging place sanctions on officials and companies involved in the “ongoing human rights crisis.” Meanwhile, China’s brutal campaign against the Uighur continues unabated.

After details of the auction were reportedly shared on Facebook, pressure began mounting on the countrys government to shut it down.The practice is a gross human rights violation and violates the rights of a girl, Monica Adhiue, acting executive director for South Sudans National Alliance for Women Lawyers, said today. A shocking photo, apparently from a Facebook post about the auction, shows a tall, expressionless girl standing next to a shorter, smiling man.  Under a smiley face emoji, the post reads, Competition is perfectly allowed in Dinka Jieng culture. In a reference to the teenagers height, it says: The kids of the winner are guaranteed for NBA slots. It is reported that a man won the auction by offering  cars, three cars and the equivalent of around pound, to the teenagers own dad. Speaking to South Sudan in Focus, an Internet TV show, Ms Adhiue added: It does not only deprive the girl child from education and limit her future opportunities in her le, but also increases the risk of violence, jeopardizes her health, reduces the girl child to a property, and deprives her from the right to choose. Ms Adhiue alleged that government workers were among those bidding.  They need to be suspended from their office and this case to be investigated and, of course, whoever is involved in this auctioning also later needs to be properly investigated and held accountable because this is a violation of human rights, she said.The government has recently passed legislation protecting girls and women but Suzy Natana, a lawyer in the nation, believes more could be done. If they can see in educating a girl in doing away with harmful traditional cultures of early child marriage, then we can see change, she said. There has to be some form of regulation andit is just a token, then evenit is just one cow or two cows that is given out as a form of dowry, a token of appreciation, thats good enough but the moment we start attaching value to this token, then there comes a problem.

Initially things looked bleak for the -year-old pooch, who lay in the dirt for months behind a warehouse in Calornia, across the street from his former home. He had no food or water, relying on the good will of passing truck drivers to give him sustenance. But the landscape company who owned the building he slept behind had a duty to clear the area of trash, meaning his makesht water bowls would be taken away frequently. A delivery driver who noticed the dog had been there for a long time created an Instagram account in June and dedicated it to the poor old boy she would see on her route.  Every day I see him hungry and thirsty waiting for any truck driver with enough heart to give him something to eat or drink, she wrote. It breaks my heart and I wish I could help him but my situation simply will not allow me to bring him home. It’s hot so I poured my last bottle of water in a styrofoam hamburger container. I can go and get food and water he cannot. If you know anyone that can help him please tag them. The social media profile caught the attention of Love Leo Rescue, whose volunteers managed to coax the dog into their car and drive him two hours to the centre, the Dodo reports.  Rescuers, who named the dog Larry, noticed that despite his lack of food and water, his stomach was quite bloated. A trip to the vets revealed that Larry had Cushings disease and for a month and a half he lived at the vet clinic while getting used to his medication. In that time he was kind of sad, and a little depressed and reactive with other dogs, Sasha Abelson, president of the rescue centre, told the Dodo. As the medication began to work, Larrys personality was revealed and he became much happier - and was moved to a doggy day care centre.  Larrys health issues are now managed by monthly medication, which will cost his owner  a month. This has meant its proved more dficult than initially thought to find him a forever home - despite intense interest from the media and on the internet.

They dont treat me any dferently because of it. Its probably not the kind of thing parents would choose for their children but they still treat me well. His most popular request is the dinner date in which he gets to know clients with an evening meal, followed by a tailored and personal experience back at a hotel or apartment. Mr James charges ,for six hours of pampering and pleasure or ,for an overnight stay with breakfast in the morning.

I got a run of games without injuries.“I was playing first-team football against senior pros week-in, week-out.“Every week I was playing against good players with dferent qualities and I think that helped me massively.“Going from playing Under-s to first team can be a massive change.“It is a level up, it’s more physical and you learn much more playing with senior players.“It didn’t really go to plan in the Championship for Brechin, but I took the positives from it and came back a better player.“I feel I am seeing the benefits of that. I would put a lot of my improvement down to that spell.“I’m more confident and that has helped me and hopefully I can push on now.“There are a lot of young boys here trying to push on and make an impression here. We are pushing each other on every day in training and hopefully we can take our chance when it comes.”McLennan has been pleased with his contributions to the first team so far this campaign – the highlight of which was his stunning strike against St Mirren.He added: “I have been pleased with my impact, I’m pleased to be more in and around the first team this season.“I’ve had a lot of injuries over the last few years so I’m happy to be involved.“That goal was something you dream of as a kid to score on your first start for the club and you’re always wanting to make a good impression.“You want to take your chance when it comes and I hope I did that.“It is about trying to stay in the mix.

A win would take them level on points with Rangers in third.After the high of last week where the Dons beat the Gers in the League Cup semi-final and recorded wins against Hamilton and Kilmarnock in the league, McLennan is hoping they can keep the momentum going and make it four in a row.He said: “It will be a tough game and it always is against Hibs.“We’ve played them a couple of times this season and we know what they’re like.“If we could win it gets us up the table and that’s where we need to be.“We had a good week last week with three wins and it’s time for us to kick on.

It’s dficult to stop Hibs creating chances as they’re a very good team so it’s about getting the right balance.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/11/BON_ACCORD_CHRISTMAS_2017_066_RESIZED-1.jpg ","title":"stunning light display at aberdeens bon accord centre returns for christmas 2018","story":"The stunning festive light display at Bon Accord Centre has made a spectacularfor Christmas , following an overwhelming positive response last year.An array of festive lights arrived at the centre on Mondayincluding giant stars suspended from the upper mall, a huge Christmas tree, light-up reindeer and hanging fairy lights twinkling throughout the mall.As usual, there will be plenty photo opportunities for shoppers this year – including a Christmas pudding on the upper mall, so get posing with the pud!

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match.

The infamous #Jacobs Report# was published in , proposing six options, of which the government chose the cheapest for reasons of #cost-effectiveness#.The option selected would involve the installation of mitigation netting along with the upgrading of the old road at the foot of Glen Croe.Road closures, however, have continued as material has to be cleared and netting repaired after every major slip # adding to the cost each time.The ongoing work has failed to satisfy many people living locally, and following last months closure Jane Gauld, owner of the Slanj restaurant in Tarbet, launched an online petition to press for  a more permanent solution in the form of a bypass tunnel through the hills.Earlier this week more than , people had signed the petition.And, in a rare show of unity Argyll and Bute Council members last month voted unanimously to press for government action for a permanent solution the the Rest problem.One prominent campaigner for a permanent engineering solution at the Rest has been Inveraray hotelier Donald Clark, who said: # This should have been achieved many years ago. Mitigation lessens damage and closures but never guarantees full protection.#The choice of using the Old Military Road as a ersion route was the cheapest option in The Jacobs Report and was a flawed choice. It has over years led to months of both roads being closed, subjecting travellers to a detour of at least one hour # unacceptable in this day and age and would not be tolerated in the more populous areas of the central belt.#The A Task Force # made up of government officials, trunk road engineers, local business managers, councillors and other interested parties # was set up in  to oversee improvements to the route.The group#s next meeting will be held in Inveraray on Thursday November , with Transport Minister Michael Matheson in attendance.Ahead of that gathering, however, a meeting was arranged for anyone with an interest in the Rest on Friday November , at the Slanj restaurant, setting the scene for what could be a fiesty encounter in Inveraray six days later."},{"url":null,"title":"weather delayed a83 roadworks set for completion 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowWet weather has delayed resurfacing work on the A through Lochgilphead.The project, on Poltalloch Street through the town, began on Monday November  and was expected to be finished by Wednesday November .Daytime detours have been taking traffic through Lochgilphead town centre while the work has been going on.Trunk road management firm BEAR Scotland now says the project is due to be completed on Thursday November .A spokesperson for BEAR Scotland said on Thursday November : #The £, surfacing improvements on the A in Lochgilphead were postponed yesterday due to inclement weather preventing the works from continuing as planned.#Teams are continuing with the surfacing improvements today with the project due to be completed early evening.#We thank road users for their patience while teams work to complete these surfacing works.#"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13471434.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080918AyrCurrie_09JPG.jpg","title":"ayr rugby club near move","story":"NewsAyr Rugby Club near move to new town centre base at Dam Park as they prepare to sell Millbrae homeThe Millbrae men, who top the Tennents Premiership, are in advanced talks to sell their Millbrae home and move to Dam Park in Ayr town centre.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  OCT NewsDam Park could play host to Ayr Rugby Club as soon as  \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBooming Ayr Rugby Club are nearing a deal to sell their Millbrae home and move to the town centre. Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13549120.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS134733004.jpg","title":"ayrs station hotel cannot afford","story":"NewsAyrs Station Hotel cannot afford more delay, says MSP Brian WhittleOfficials have been urged to make a quick decision on the future of the Station Hotel, with some trains now running south of the town againShareByStuart Wilson:,  NOV NewsStation Hotel \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA decision on the future of Ayr’s Station Hotel must not be kicked down the road, insists an MSP. Brian Whittle says officials must act with more urgency than ever following the resumption of services south of the town. The surprise call to send trains back on the route to Stranraer was made by ScotRail bosses on Thursday. Their decision followed a morning test run on the track beneath the crumbling hotel. But South of Scotland member, Mr Whittle, warned: “Just because the trains are running again, no-one should feel we can put off making a decision about the Station Hotel’s future. “A general unwillingness by South Ayrshire Council and others to think about the future of the building were what got us into this mess and I’m not prepared to see action put off again. “The Station Hotel can’t be allowed to sit abandoned for a minute more than is necessary to make the decision. “People who rely on the railway can’t afford any more dithering and delay.”  Work to stabilise the B-Listed structure continues this week with a scaffolding being erected. One source close to the works said: “The roof is a big problem and is nowhere near being tackled yet. “It remains to be seen what the structural engineers will want to do but saving it is a very big job.” Limited services are now running to Stranraer for the first time since council chiefs threw up an exclusion zone in August.

Lieutenant Walter Tull, was Britain’s second black professional footballer who had signed up with Rangers, and trained as an officer cadet in Gailes, Ayrshire. Walter- along with millions of other soldiers- will be honoured on Sunday, November  in a nationwide gesture of remembrance. A large-scale portrait of Walter Tull designed by sand artists Sand In Your Eye, will be drawn into the sand on the beach and washed away as the tide comes in. And the public will be asked to join in by creating silhouettes of people in the sand, remembering the millions of lives lost or changed forever by the conflict. The project is the latest collaboration between the National Theatre of Scotland and - NOW, the UK’s arts programme for the World War  centenary, and will use  beaches all around the UK as their canvasses for the mass art-work. Each of the beaches taking part in the project will commemorate a dferent WW casualty.  Walter Tull was born to Alice Elizabeth Palmer, from Kent, and Daniel Tull from Barbados, the son of a slave, on April , . After the death of his parents he and his brother Edward were placed in a children’s home in Bethnal Green. Edward was later adopted and it is believed that he went on to be Britain’s first black dentist after taking over his father’s practice on St Vincent Street in Glasgow. Walter, however, began playing football with Tottenham Hotspur in , and after touring South America with them he was offered a contract, making him the second black professional footballer in Britain. When playing for Tottenham and later Northampton Town he faced a lot of racial abuse and prejudice, yet he went on to have a successful football career. In , Northampton Town began negotiations to transfer Tull to Glasgow Rangers. However, the First World War broke out before Tull could play a game for Rangers. He enlisted as a private in the Footballers’ Battalion of the British Army, where he was quickly promoted to be a sergeant. He took part in and survived the Battle of the Somme, after which he was sent to England to recover from illness. He then went to train as an officer cadet in Gailes, Ayrshire. Although black officers were not allowed in the British Army at this time, he was commissioned in May , thus becoming the first black combat officer in the British Army. He died in battle in France in , during the last major German offensive. His body was never found.

Depute council leader Brian McGinley said: “Across the world China is a huge player in the economic infrastructure.” The Scotland-China Innovation and Technology Association have spotted similarities between South Ayrshire and Liaocheng.

The incident along with other concerns has sparked a proposed shake-up of taxi and private hire rules. The middle seat in the front could be ditched from fleets of larger vehicles following a public consultation. The public are going to be askedpeople should still be allowed to sit in the front of vehicles. The consultation will also questionthe number of passengers sitting up front should be reduced to one. South Ayrshire Council’s Leadership Panel heard last week how the middle passenger was seated too close to drivers. A report presented to councillors said the close proximity left drivers open to accusations of “inappropriate conduct. Explaining one incident reported to the council,licensing team leader Morag Douglas said: “There were concerns that a driver was threatened by young girls who booked a private hire. “They left without paying and stated thatthe driver took any action the driver would be reported to the police for inappropriate conduct.” She said the council received other gripes from drivers about what a tight squeeze it is with two passengers in the front. Ms Douglas told how drivers said having “two larger people in the front seats” meant it is dficult to control the car without touching middle seat passengers. All eight seater vehicles licensed by the council have two passenger seats in the front and six in the back. Depute council leader Brian McGinley said: “It is as much about protecting the drivers as the passengers.” He added: “We need to be cautious and make sure that whatever we come up with doesn’t have unintended consequences.” Glasgow and Edinburgh City Councils don’t permit passengers in the front seats of taxis. Feedback from South Ayrshire Taxi and Private Hire Operators’ Forum members suggested the inidual drivers should decidethey want passengers up front. The members also told the council there should still be an option to have two passengers seated in the front. There are  licensed taxis and  private hire vehicles in South Ayrshire. The specicationsapproved would only apply to newly licenced vehicles.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilGlasgowAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13556455.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS69111168.jpg","title":"tributes paid ayr united legend","story":"NewsTributes paid to Ayr United legend Johnny Graham, who dies aged The Somerset Park legend died last week, aged , and tributes have been led by former teammate Jim McSherry.ShareByMike Wilson:,  NOV NewsJohnny Graham at a packed Somerset Park\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWarm tributes are being paid to Johnny Graham, the skipper who led Ayr United into the first ever Premier League.

Former team-mate Jim McSherry said Graham was one of the best players he ever shared a dressing room with. McSherry, now an Ayr publican, said: “Johnny, who had long hair like one of the Beatles, was one of my heroes when I was starting out as a player. “When I joined the club in , Johnny and his we were so welcoming to me. I remember when Ayr beat Rangers - that first season all the headlines went to Johnny Doyle but Graham gave a masterclass in midfield. He was a terric player and a leader.” Terracing fans posted emotional messages on Facebook as they mourned the loss of the Somerset Park legend. Honest Man veteran Lawrence Grace wrote: “RIP to one of the greatest players to wear an Ayr strip.” Ronnie Hainey added: “One of my favourite players and one of the best.” Robert Somerville said: “Sad news. True Ayr legend, penalty king and all round great.” Allan Durward recalled: “I’ve great memories of the ‘s as a boy, Johnny Graham, Ingram, Doyle, McCulloch, etc. RIP.”  Johnny began his career with Strathclyde Juniors before going on to play for Third Lanark, Dundee United, Falkirk and Hibs. He joined Ayr for pound, in  and went on to score  goals in  games. In October of his first season, he scored all four as Ayr came from - down to beat Airdrie - at Broomfield.

Ally handed him the captaincy in - and great times continued as Ayr beat Dunfermline - in April  – player of the year Johnny scored twice – to secure a place in the inaugural Premier League. Graham twice played for the Scottish Football League XI. He ed to Falkirk at the start of season - but within two years came back to Ayr as reserve team coach.

They will both have entrances facing out over the car park beside Boots and have attracted seven objections. Landowner Red Button is already quids in after getting permission to reduce the size of the car park and build a Costa coffee unit. But planners say only two car parking spaces will be lost in this application. Originally it was planned to build just one larger store on the loading area but permission has now lapsed. A report before next Thursday’s South Ayrshire Council planning committee says: “It’s considered the proposal will not have an adverse impact on the residential character or amenity of the locality. “Accordingly, the application is recommended for approval.” Objectors in Academy Street and Academy Court have hit out over traffic concerns, the impact on local homes, of servicing the other units and why the town needs more retail space when some units are empty. Resident Mark Inglis called for the entrance into the entire precinct to be shted to Portland Street. He said: “There are around  children who are being dropped off and picked up or making their own way to school or nursery and the additional traffic will increase the risk of signicant harm to children. “There is also a sheltered housing complex directly opposite the proposed development with some infirm and elderly people within, the additional traffic on Academy Street I believe will also pose a risk to them and their well being, and increased risk of accident and perhaps fatality.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilTroonAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"black-friday-beauty-deals-you-cant-miss-out","story":"How many Christmas parties, nights out and family events do you have lined up  We bet itrsquos a fair few!

Lover Man - a sultry nocturne followed made famous by pianist and composer Ram Ramirez.Then it was time for another of Dicks own compositions on the bass clarinet.In Blues for Jimmy the scene was set in the deep South of America from around  with the deep tones of the bass clarinet echoing the African American blues.A tongue in cheek Stranger on the Shore came next complete with seagulls. Acker Bilk originally composed it as a lullaby for his daughter before being tempted commercially to change its name.My personal highlight of the evening was Lady be Good by George Gershwin - Anne on piano and Dick on clarinet played with verve and swing.Body and Soul by Green and made famous by Colman Hawkins was just that! Jumpinrsquo at the Woodside by Count Basie did indeed jump!The final treat of the evening was Henry Mancinirsquos Pink Panther.Dick wondered whether there was any need for him to work again after composing this particular piece.Next months concert is on Sunday, November  at . pm.

Itrsquos not been explicitly the case. People could have come in from outside.ldquoThe fact that we are actually providing a vehicle for continuity of community is very satisfying. But we wouldnrsquot want to exclude other people who are in need.More than  people from the local area applied for the homes before they had even been advertised, but Mr Robertson was keen to point out that the need for affordable housing was not desperate.ldquoI donrsquot think therersquos a desperate need but itrsquos an expanding local authority economy, he said.ldquoTo call it a desperate demand may be slightly overstating it.

This is a very concerning piece of news, especially given the fact that the Tesco bus also serves the health centre.ldquoIt comes at a time when we are being told that we need to use public transport more because of dire warnings about the impact of climate change and when massive house building will lead to gridlock unless newcomers can be persuaded onto buses.Mr Turner added: ldquoEast Lothian generally, and Musselburgh in particular, is now renowned for its excellent bus services so this announcement comes as a blow and runs counter to all that has been achieved on the public transport front in the last few of years.ldquoLetrsquos hope that the council, working with the operators, can come up with a proposal to replace the extremely useful Tesco bus, and in doing so letrsquos try to serve some places that are currently remote from buses ndash Edenhall Road and the Muckletts, for example, both had buses until a few years ago and theirwould, I am sure, be welcomed by elderly residents.ldquoI think the Tesco bus should be replaced by something very similar, perhaps marketed as the Musselburgh community bus. It should not just parallel other bus routes, which is what the Tesco bus does, but should serve some of the residential areas that are cut off from buses. Goose Green is another area remote from a bus route.A Tesco spokesperson said: ldquoWe have made the dficult decision to stop the provision of the T and T bus services to and from our Musselburgh Extra store.ldquoUnfortunately the services make a loss, which means we are no longer able to provide them.ldquoWe have worked with local bus providers to ensure that all affected areas will continue to have a bus link that connects them to our store, including a newly introduced  bus from Longniddry to Fort Kinnaird.ldquoOur priority now is to ensure our customers who use the bus are aware of our decision and of all these alternative routes so that they are able to plan their journeys.ldquoWe apologise for any inconvenience this causes.A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: ldquoEast Lothian Council was notied of Tescorsquos intention to withdraw the T and T services in September and we are fully aware of the impact this may have on the local community. We actively engaged with local providers and Prentice coaches are implementing changes to the  service, which will start on October  from Longniddry to Fort Kinnaird via the Tesco turning area and will now mirror the times of the T T to allow connection from other services.ldquoOperators looked at the T  service the general conclusion was that a straight like-for-like service was not commercially viable due to the numbers using the service.ldquoThe council is not licensed to operate the running of service work and our own fleet is at full capacity however, we will continue to discuss options, which will include community buses as a way to support residents who are affected.Ross Prentice, managing director of Prentice Coaches Ltd, said: ldquoWe are starting a new bus service, the , on Monday. It will run from Longniddry to Fort Kinnaird via Port Seton and Prestonpans.ldquoOnce it gets to The Loan in Wallyford it will replace the Tesco T bus by going down Macbeth Moir Road and Pinkie Road, then into Tesco before continuing to Fort Kinnaird.We will evaluate passenger use after a few weeks and hope to be able to expand the route in the new year.ldquoWe also currently run two routes into Tesco, the  and , and, from October , the  will make that three routes which will give a pretty good coverage of the Musselburgh area to and from the store.Iain Clark, chairman of Musselburgh Area Partnership, said: ldquoThe area partnership has recently been presented with the findings of our lsquowhat matters to yoursquo questionnaire, which highlights a number of areas that would make a dference to the daily live of the senior members of our community.

He published his opinion on the matter in The Waste of Daylight. Willett was angry at the ldquowaste of useful daylight first thing in the morning during the summer months.Willett died in  and, less than a year later, Germany became the first to adopt DST in April . Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Turkey, and Tasmania also immediately followed suit.Three weeks later in the UK, an Act of Parliamentdecreed that, for a certain period during the year, the official time should be one hour in advance of GMT. The United States followed in .Between  and the Second World War, the clocks were put forward by one hour in the UK in spring.During the Second World War, British double summer timewas temporarily introduced. Throughout the winter months, the clocks were kept one hour forward of GMT to increase productivity.After the war ended, Britain ed to British summer timeas it was prior to .In , permanent BST was trialled but it was deemed unsuccessful and abandoned in .In , the duration of BST was changed to bring it into line with the rest of the European community.In , campaigners attempted toto British double summer time or a permanent BST in order to save energy and increase the time available for leisure in the evenings. Backbench MPs tried to change BST, but the The Daylight Saving Bill - failed in the House of Commons.Over the years, the effectiveness of DST has been the topic of much debate.

She is originally from another European country but has made Haddington her home, with her husband and two wonderful children.Her explorations of nearby woods led her to discover an unusual grave amongst the trees. It is a grave of a horse, buried in the th century. It was this grave she had offered to show me. To get there we had a beautul walk along a secluded section of the banks of the Tyne. It was the trees I noticed first, of course, which were dotted along the banks of the river.Autumn was just then beginning to brush the trees with its colour, and it was one of those evenings when the setting sun seemed to take its time, bathing the land in bright streaks of orange light. Along the way, Marije paused and said: ldquoThis is my tree.It was a beech tree of signicant age, its branches arching over the Tyne, asfishing. She showed me her sitting place, underneath its embracing canopy. Here the roots curved to make a natural seat. Her older son spoke of seeing kingfishers, and sure enough, this was a perfect place to absorb the majesty of the Tyne as it flowed towards Haddington. Another beech of similar age grew close by. Their branches entwined, making it look like they were sisters holding hands.But I sensed then there was more to Marijersquos connection to this place, although I then had no idea just how powerful her story was.When we finally got to our destination in the woods further upriver, the light was too weak to penetrate the trees. The old grave of the horse was shrouded in darkness.Yet with the help of mobile torches we could view it, and for sure the grave was interesting and worth a story in its own right. I vowed to find out more about its background as we headed back to Marijersquos house in the dying embers of a sunset.When we reached her house we were treated to wonderful hospitality. It was then that Marije told her story of the beech tree.Not long ago she had been diagnosed with cancer. She faced the possibility of being taken by this cruel disease. Numbness and disbelief at first overcame her, then there was the realisation that le might be very short and she would have to leave her two young children.She walked to the beech tree soon after her diagnosis and sat cradled by its roots. Despite having family and friends whose love and support was invaluable, Marije explained it can also be a desperately lonely feeling. ldquoWe all know we canrsquot live forever, she told me, ldquobut to face the reality of my end at such a young age and with children was unbearable.ldquoI went on that walk to the tree in the most dire situation, she told me. ldquoI felt a connection as I sat under the tree, I really felt her old wisdom and energy.Her love for her young children is what gave her strength in the worst of times. The tree seemed to symbolise this powerful bond, its roots deeply holding it safe.ldquoPeople talk about mother nature, Marije said, ldquoand I understand why. When my hair fell out, I lsquogave it backrsquo to nature, underneath the beech. I know it makes me sound weird, but it really helped me.It is not weird, of course. Trees are full of wisdom, not in the sense of actual words but in the spiritual sense. Beech is said to be the matriarch of the wood, sometimes called the mother of the forest. It is a good listener. Our best ideas and inner reflections can come when we sit under the embrace of an old tree even science tells us this now.Sadly not everyone wins the fight against cancer, but thankfully Marije recovered after treatment. The experience has left her treasuring every single day and taking no sunrise for granted. And she is thankful to her beech tree, which was her companion and confidant in those times of emotional agony. It remains for her a place of contemplation and peace, where she can give thanks and absorb the joy of being alive.ldquoI cherish every day now in ways I didnrsquot before, she told me. ldquoI think it is important to allow our kids to feel the connection with nature. That means being in nature, and respecting it. After all, we are all part of it.This was the real story of that walk on that day a story of incredible bravery, pain, love and determination by a young mum I now have the privilege to call a friend."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-ties-bring-meeting-to-a-halt","story":"Prestonpans businessman Ferhan Ashiq had applied to increase the size of an alcohol display ndashand for a name change ndash at one of his stores.But Councillor Jim Goodfellowimmediately recused himself from the application because of his friendship with Mr Ashiq, who is a member of East Lothian Labour Party.After a short adjournment, Councillor Fiona Dugdale , convenor, also declared an interest.Remaining Labour councillor John McMillan, however, said he did not believe his relationship with Mr Ashiq, who has shops in Musselburgh and Prestonpans, could have an impact on his ability to make a decision, while Conservative councillor Jane Henderson said she did not know him.The boardrsquos legal adviser described the situation as ldquounusual but said the board was no longer quorate and Mr Ashiqrsquos application would have to be continued to the next licensing board for a decision.But a bemused Mr Ashiq noted: ldquoWhen it comes to the next meeting I will know most of the board members there.Legal adviser Carlo Grilli advised Mr Ashiq to send his father, whose name was on the application, and an agent instead.The application was to change the name of Mr Ashiqrsquos Prestonpans store on Redburn Road from Day-Today to Day Todayand increase the alcohol display from . square metres to . square metres."},{"url":null,"title":"rare-bottle-of-whisky-to-be-auctioned-for-combat-stress-charity","story":"It is one of only , matured in an American bourbon barrel for eight years, with a cask strength of  per cent alcohol.The auction is part of a fundraiser for Combat Stress, the veteransrsquo mental health charity, and is being organised by the music group the Flying Aspidistras ahead of their concert of remembrance, Now the Guns are Silent, at Gosford House on Sunday.The occasion will be a reflection on the harsh reality of war and the suffering felt beyond the battlefield.Kilchoman distillery on Islay has bottled this special single cask to coincide with the centenary of the end of the First World War.More poignantly, it is also to commemorate the sinking of two troopships, the SS Tuscania and the HMS Otranto, with the loss of nearly  men, in the waters around Islay in .Ailsa Fortune, the events organiser, said: \"The war affected every community in Scotland, from Islay to East Lothian.\"The end of any war leaves many broken lives.

network was a ldquodirect result of cuts to local authority funding by the Scottish Government.He said: ldquoThe condition of roads is a problem across Scotland. This is a direct result of the Scottish Government slashing council funding over this period, with East Lothian Council having suffered cuts of around pound million in the last five years.ldquoEast Lothian Council has done its utmost to protect the budget.ldquoThe Scottish Government needs to recognise the impact its cuts are having and give local authorities the funding they need to protect services, including road maintenance.The county is currently covered by km of roads, ranging from class A routes to unclassied lanes.And an Annual Status and Options Report, produced on behalf of East Lothian Council, has revealed that  per cent are currently in need of repair.The report, which looks at the impact of future funding on network maintenance in the long term, warns that the current level of investment of pound.million a year will mean that more than  per cent of the roads will be in a state of disrepair in  yearsrsquo time.And it reveals that, as an asset, East Lothian Councilrsquos carriageways depreciate in value by poundmillion every year.It also found that nearly km of rural public roads in the county were in poor condition and needed immediate investigation and possible treatment.The report said: ldquoThe level of investment on public roads in East Lothian has not been sufficient to limit the decline in the overall condition of the network.It revealed that additional investment of pound.million over the next  years could signicantlyimprove the state of the roads, with fewer than  per cent likely to need repairs by the end of the decade.Peter Forsyth, asset manager for East Lothian Council, said that the recommendation for operating the carriageways following the report was to continue with the current level of investment.In a report to the councilrsquos policy and performance review committee, he said the costs of corrective treatments, in particular carriageway reconstruction, were ldquoprohibitive and a preventative treatment approach should ldquomitigate the need to invest signicantly.But he warned: ldquoShort-term under-investment could result in major long-term expenditure necessary to recty major defects which could have been addressed earlier.Councillor Jane Henderson , leader of the opposition, said: ldquoOur road infrastructure assets are vital and dficult decisions will need to be made.ldquoWithout investment now the amount of money needed in the future will be a greater problem the old expression of lsquoa stitch in time saves ninersquo was never so apt.ldquoThe decision on how much to spend on roads now will inevitably mean choices.

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned. David calls himself a jazz film-maker and doesnt really like to spend too much time planning it all out. Its very much part of his style.\"Jims mother, Beryl, still lives in Thurso and said she is \"immensely proud\" of her sons achievements.Friday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118144.jpg","title":"Writings on the wall for Graffito","story":"THURSO has embraced an artistic legacy stretching back to the s with a vibrant mural in the town centre created last Wednesday by an artist from the Black Isle.Unlike the earlier work on Tollemache House by Polish artist Caziel Zielenkiewicz ndash a student of Picasso ndash the latest piece of public art has so far achieved great praise from the majority of people commenting on social media.The Facebook page for Caithness Horizons Museum and Art Galleryndash who commissioned the work by Marc Delaye ndash has attracted many comments about the colourful artwork gracing a wall of their carpark.Lora Dillon said: \"Went down to see it today. We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Friday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : pmOrkney Football Club#s first home match in two months is scheduled to take place this weekend, facing in-form Alness United.

The project is supported by Orkney Islands Council’s Arts Development team.It will run on a loop eight times from pm each evening between now and Remembrance Day on November .At around .pm each night it will come to a rest on the final image — a tree, made up of the names of Orcadians who died in WWI, in a field of poppies.Glasgow-based specialists Playdead were engaged to create the film and pupils from Glaitness Primary and Kirkwall Grammar schools were involved in the creation of the work.Kevin McCrae, creative director and founder of Playdead, said: “After speaking to local people and school children about what they’d like to see and seeing what we could draw on from archives as well, we thought it would be good to develop a series of sequences which looked at the war and its impacts in Orkney from a range of angles.“Spectators will see snippets of what soldiers would have experienced, but also there are scenes which explore how farmers and school children would have been affected, as well as a look at what propaganda people here would have seen, and images from after the war of how the end of the conflict was celebrated and how it was commemorated.“There are some big technical challenges associated with projecting onto a surface like the St Magnus Cathedral. It’s such an iconic building in the heart of Kirkwall and we wanted to do justice to it # so we have done a lot of work to take into account the uneven surfaces and to choose a colour palette that would really work with the beautul red stone.The Great War: An Orkney Memorial Experience will run for the final time between pm and pm on Remembrance Day,  November.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Will the Chief Secretary work with the Secretary of State for Business to develop that proposal and work with the Business Department and the developers to see the fruition of what could be a very important part of the Government’s industrial strategy.”Responding to Mr Carmichael, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, the Rt. Hon. Liz Truss MP, said: “As part of the spending review we will be looking at the most efficient way we can achieve our carbon targets, and I am working closely with the Department of Business Energy and Industrial Strategy to do.”Commenting after the exchange, Mr Carmichael added: “The Minister’s response will do little to assure the industry that they are a priority for the Government. There was nothing in the Budget for this industry, and the Government have been working closely across departments for some time now. It is disappointing that little progress appears to be being made.“Wave and tidal power generation and new and innovative forms of producing green energy. The ambition of the industry however has not been matched by the policy framework, which continues to prevent this sector from reaching the point where it becomes commercially viable.“Renewable energy generation, particularly wave and tidal stream power are areas at which the Northern Isles is at the very forefront, and the creation of these Innovative Power Purchase Agreements would make great strides towards helping these innovative industries continue to flourish. The Minister should stop dragging her feet and start delivering for the industry.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

She said: \"Our children are subject to appalling conditions. Only today my daughter had to sit in her classroom with her coat and hat on as it was so cold. A classroom that incorporates the staff toilet and staff room. To avoid the staff room, children are having to go in and out of the classroom via outdoors.\"Dingwall and Seaforth ward councillor Angela MacLean invited childrenrsquos minister Maree Todd and the arearsquos MSP, Kate Forbes, to support a push for funding for a replacement. Ms MacLean said: \"I think the staff do a fantastic job and it is incumbent on us to try and get a solution and all work together. Having it on the capital programme with a reduced capital budget has been dficult but everyone who has seen it knows it is badly needing replaced. Whether it be Scottish Government or Highland Council we all have to work together. Given the children that go to St Clementrsquos, it does make it more urgent because they are our most vulnerable young people.\"Mrs Todd, a Ross-shire-based Highlands and Islands MSP, declared the school not fit for purpose when she visited this year.She said shersquod be \"more than happy\" to meet local councillors but added: \"As a member of the ruling administration, Ms MacLean will know that St Clementrsquos had not previously been prioritised by Highland Council in their capital spending plans.\"Since my visit to St Clementrsquos this year Highland Council has now prioritised it. Should they require my support in making further progress, I am happy to help.\"Dingwall-based MSP Kate Forbes previously described the school \"as like something out of Oliver Twist\".She said: \"Highland Councilrsquos plans for school buildings seem to be entirely reliant on additional Scottish Government funding when it is the council who has statutory responsibility for school buildings and their annual budget settlement recognises that.\"Shesaid Highland Council had been the second highest beneficiary of the Scottish Governmentrsquos Schools for the Future funding scheme, receiving poundmillion. The next school buildings funding programme is expected by the end of the year.Renewing an appeal for progress, Ms Ferguson warned of \"promises broken and deadlines long passed\" and accused the council of breaking the law over conditions.

We should have something similar around the Firth. You see people driving past Kirkmichael slowing down to take a look because it looks interesting. People are drawn in and genuinely interested by what they see.\"Irsquom not really all that comfortable with heritage being competitive but this does mean the community, which has been supporting this for close on  years, can be recognised. Five years ago we were at the point of giving up when the roof literally fell in. We had a meeting with the community and they urged us to push on.\"The Federation of Small Businessesrsquo Highlands and Islands development manager, David Richardson, hailed the Trust for \"working wonders\" on the kirk, graveyards and mediaeval stones.\"Visiting old graveyards is not just of interest to locals and those with ancestors buried in them it is also very popular with many visitors interested in soaking up more of the local atmosphere and history and in reading the stories written on the older the stones.\"Including interpretive  that explain more of the history and expand on these stories makes the whole experience even more powerful.\"Dr Mackayrsquos suggestion that a Highland graveyard heritage trail should be created is excellent surely an idea whose time has come  Itrsquos certainly well worth further exploration and discussion.\"Kate Forbes MSP, whose constituency takes in the Black Isle, said: \"I love what the Kirkmichael Trust has done to repair the graveyard and draw in locals and visitors.

We have a whole plan of engagement throughout the year that will do that, starting later this week.\"And at the same time to listen to the public and to hear the views of what the council is doing really well, what everyone believes the council could be doing better in terms of delivering services and the important part of that is that we go across the Highlands to hear those views.\"The first thing is about listening to people, the second most important thing is about going back and saying to people lsquoyou said and we willrsquo or lsquowe are not able to becausersquo.\"The councilis due tostart a \"public budget engagement process\" tomorrow, designed to help the local authority make decisions to balance its books.\"It is really important that we listen throughout the month of November,\" Mrs Manson said. \"Then we will go back and give feedback on what the suggestions are.\"Mrs Manson was upbeat about the local authorityrsquos financial woes that have seen it stumble from one unpopular cutback to another over several months amid a flurry of resignation threats from within the administration.\"I am quite positive about our budget situation here in the Highlands ndash I think we are in a fair place,\" she said. \"There are places where we will be able to make efficiencies and our officer team and our members are working on that all the time, day-in, day-out behind the scenes.\"However, Mrs Manson did accept that \"there are some challenging areas in there, such as what our priorities for resource and for spend are, and I think it is very important to take a transparent approach so that when we do take decisions in February [when the council budget is decided] we can actually evidence it comes after listening to people.\"One of the answers to those challenges, according to the chief executive, is to rely on the \"many talented staff who believe in the values of public service and that we are here to make a dference\" and to capitalise on an upsurge in community involvement.\"I genuinely believe that many, many people that I have been speaking to over the last few months in dferent parts of the Highlands have really good ideas,\" she said. \"They see where the council can become more efficient.\"But equally so, I think that people can be more understanding of the challenges that we face.\"The local authority has made pound. million of savings since  and raised council tax by three per cent in each of the last two years.Budget leader Alister Mackinnon said: \"We have to do more with less money and our costs are rising for things like fuel, pay and cost of living.\"We are working with services to produce comprehensive information on our current spending profiles, to identy where there are opportunities for efficiencies and any commercial opportunities. Our focus will be on directing our resources to those areas which will give us the best outcomes and deliver value for money.\"Depute budget leader Matthew Reiss said: \"It will not be easy to find more savings on top of those we have already made. Income generation, commercialisation and efficiencies become even more vital in this context in order to protect essential services and we do not have the luxury of the signicant reserves we once had to give us any room for manoeuvre.\"It is undoubtedly the case that there will be very hard decisions to make and we will begin a process of engagement to help us make the right decisions and do the best we can.\"Friday  Nov  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

In a bright apricot top and carefully made up, she’s surrounded by our favourite foodies as she presents another serving of The Great British Bake Off: An Extra Slice, the spin off from the ratings busting TV show. She couldn’t be more rehabilitated from the days of her vilication as the man-hating, acerbic lesbian stand-up she never actually was, to the favourite aunty now welcomed into the nation’s sitting rooms to serve up their feelgood comfort food TV. “I think I’m seen as a bit more fluffy now,” says the -year-old in her pleasantly dry laconic drawl. “A lot of the press thought when I got married, ‘oh she can’t be a man hating lesbian after all’”, she says, sounding asshe’s scuffing the toes of her Docs on the ground as she drags herself all the way to double home economics. As for the sartorial makeover, Brand is happy to ditch her matching black T-shirt and leggings for pastels on TV because “they make me. No, they don’t, but my thing is to fight bigger battles. I wouldn’t select colour for myself butsomeone  does, I’ll wear it. And they do your make-up too,” she says, sounding pleased, as she loves a bit of lippy, and an aubergine tint in her hair. Because despite the rebranding, Brand has retained her ability to subvert expectations, as well as her feminist or left-wing principles, along with her talent for devastating one-liners. She’s been making us laugh for  years, since Channel ’s late night comedy show Saturday Live in the late s, after she’d already made her name as the heckle-proof deadpan ‘Sea Monster’ on London’s comedy circuit. Her own shows Jo Brand’s Big Splash and Jo Brand Through The Cakehole followed and she became a regular list on Have I Got News For You, QI, Would I Lie To You and Countdown. Moving into writing, she penned and starred in NHS comedy Getting On, for which she won a Bafta to add to her four British Comedy Awards and most recently, social services satire Damned. Her several books include an autobiography and novels, one of which she adapted into this year’s film The More You Ignore Me, starring Sheridan Smith. And there’s her latest book, the amusingly useful le guide, Born Lippy: How to Do Female. All of which amounts to the sort of career that leads to you being called ‘national treasure’, so how does she feel about that  “It’s not my favourite thing because it limits your behaviour. I don’t hate it, it’s quite funny, but I would reserve judgement because I don’t want to behave like a national treasure for the rest of my le. I might want to do things that don’t fit into that category…”Such as… back in the Extra Slice studio it’s dessert week and Jo is revisiting the contestant’s chocolate spheres. The trick is to pour hot chocolate sauce over and watch it melt daintily, but an impatient Brand speeds things along with a tenderising mallet, inadvertently also smashing the white china plate underneath. “Sorry,” she says, unconvincingly, as the guests and studio audience cheer her on. This national treasure still has an irreverent bite.Brand loves presenting Bake Off: An Extra Slice despite admitting thatwe shouted ‘Show Us Your Bakes!’ at her, she’d come up with... “not much – a very plain sponge or a rhubarb crumble. The problem I have is making it look nice and Bake Off is as much about art as baking.” Did she take the hosting gig for the comic potential of soggy bottoms, cracks and buns then “To be honest, I did it because they asked me, and I love its happy audience, funny  and – unintentionally terrying sometimes – audience baking. And I liked the format. It’s a bit like Have I Got News For You, presenting, with a  of funny people and an audience.“I’m doing another HIGNFY soon, hosting this time, and it’s like promotion, being a grown up,” she says.The  show allowed Brand to demonstrate her more reasonable than raging approach to feminism when she calmly reprimanded a dismissive Ian Hislop and the all-male  for downplaying sexual harassment in the House of Commons, by saying, “For women,you’re constantly being harassed, that builds up and wears you down.”“I really like Ian a lot and have known him for years and I was really surprised, but I felt I had to say something. Because it’s a creeping thing, a collective set of experiences that wear you down. It’s not a one off touching your bum, or ‘you look gorgeous’, it builds up.” As the mother of teenage daughters, Maisie and Eliza, Brand is used to being uncool, but for once they were impressed. “They loved it because I was trending on Twitter for three months. And I’m pleased it got the attention it did. My instinct was to speak quietly because it’s such a cliché about feminists, that they’re just a load of shouty women with no sense of humour.” At which point it seems apposite to insert one of the jokes from Born Lippy: How many Feminists Does it Take to Change a Lightbulb Do it yourself, you lazy bastard.Things have changed for women in comedy too, for the better according to Brand as attitudes have moved on. “For a long time male comedy was described as being lots of dferent styles – Eddie Izzard did surreal, others did puns – and women were just ‘women doing comedy’, but these days women are allowed to have all kinds of dferent personalities and styles.” Away from the telly, Brand is back on stage and heading for Edinburgh, with Birmingham Repertory Theatre’s Nativity! The Musical. Thanks to Maisie and Eliza, she has been to her share of nativity plays and is a big fan of the Nativity! films. “What you do is totally focus on what your child is playing, eventhey’re a rock or sheep, and for my money, the more mistakes the better.“I’m playing a newspaper critic who starts off cynical and is swept away with the show because the kids are so great.” Being self-deprecating, Brand is downplaying her own starring role in a school nativity, when she played not ‘Bethlehem’, as she’s claimed, but Mary. “Well, I remember virtually nothing about it, apart from wearing a white head thing and a blue dress. It was the s and traditional – no space ships – they didn’t give Mary an awful lot to say. Mary doesn’t say a word in the Bible, it’s all Joseph. And she was very pregnant, wasn’t she, so she’d probably just have said ‘My God I’m tired.’”Born in South London in July  to an engineer and social worker, with an older and younger brother, Josephine Grace Brand grew up in Kent then moved schools at , hated it and started to skive, smoke and drink. In Born Lippy she doesn’t hold back describing her headstrong teen years with stories of the time her dad punched her heroin addict boyfriend, or when he threw all her clothes on a bonfire after he and her mother caught underage Brand coming out of Emmanuelle, stoned, accompanying seven men, the incident that prompted her leaving the family home. Moving in with her posh heroin addict boyfriend, she went on the pill and put on four stone, becoming the spiky haired, thick-skinned ‘Sea Monster’, an alternative comedian who faced down the hecklers with her deadpan drawl. Ask Brandshe regrets leaving home as a teenager, she demurs.“No… I would say I probably did the right thing actually because I don’t think things would have been any better at home and to some extent, my leaving added to the weight that made my father get some help. I needed to get out just because we were in one of those awful relationships where you can’t work it out and be calm.” While honing her comedy she trained as a psychiatric nurse and worked at an emergency department where knives, guns and abuse were a reality and made the clubs look tame. “When you’re a stand-up comedian and people are off their heads, you get a lot of abuse. But the manic phase of bipolar disorder is way more eloquent than the average drunk bellowing ‘f*** off you fat cow’”. Brand’s ten years working as a psychiatric nurse provided her with background for her sitcoms satirising le at the sharp end of the caring professions and she acknowledges that her father’s struggle with depression may have influenced her original choice of career.Set in a geriatric ward the BBC Four series Getting On, which she co-wrote and co-starred in three series of, was directed by Peter Capaldi and did for the NHS what The Thick Of It did for politics, as well as winning her a Bafta in  for Best TV Comedy Performance. Meanwhile Damned, the second series of which screened this year on Channel  is set in a social services office, and stars Brand, and her friends Alan Davies and co-writer Morwenna Banks.“They say write about what you know then you don’t have to spend a lot of time researching to make it relevant. That’s why I haven’t done any dramas about scaffolding. I stick to stuff I do know about, mental health, nursing, social work, and not many people are doing stuff about that. I have experienced a lot of le. My favourite comedy is the kind where you see that, where people have had proper jobs before they came into it. It adds something.” Mental illnessis also dealt with in The More You Ignore Me, a novel she turned into a film, set in s rural England. Starring Sheridan Smith as Gina, a schizophrenic mum who is hospitalised after becoming obsessed with a local weatherman, it also features Mark Addy, Sheila Hancock, Ricky Tomlinson and Brand herself.“The central thing is how unglamorous it is to be ill like that, and its impact on the family. In the s it was something that was kept private, shameful. My dad suffered depression from his teenage years and didn’t seek help until his mid-fties. It’s unrecognisable now in comparison, and the power of the person seeking help has risen exponentially. “A few of my friends who are psychiatric nurses saw it and they’re hard-bitten cynical people, so to make them cry and laugh too, I was satisfied. I couldn’t believe I had the power to move people with something I’d written.” Her latest book Born Lippy: How to Do Female is moving too, as well as funny, and most of all useful. A collection of all the things Brand wishes she’d known, things she’s learnt, and things she hopes for the future, among the chapters are, How to Manage a Bully, Your Family And How To Survive It, Having Fun, Not Having Fun, How Not to Fall in Love, Feminism, a Rebranding and Staying Sane.There’s also handy practical advice for you to try. Can’t get on with your toxic family  Lower your expectations. People making you unhappy  Ultimately, you can walk away. Nervous at parties  Try some ice-breakers: “What’s the most violent incident you’ve ever witnessed ” Or “What’s the worst lie you’ve ever told ” Find yourself confronted with a flasher  Shout “That looks like a penis only smaller,” and for women faced with that old favourite: “You obviously hate men,” try “No I don’t, it’s just you”, while “You need a good shag”, can be dispensed with “I’ll look where then.”Hitchhiking alone at night, falling in love with a heroin addict or smashing up an abusive driver’s windscreen when you have PMT  Read Brand’s own experience and it might put you off. Although she’s conflicted about that last one. “I’m not advocating violence,” she says, “butyou do suffer from PMT be aware you might go there one day. I used to control it  per cent of the time, and when I didn’t, I tried to appreciate it. And it was always towards things, never people, and that’s not quite so bad.“The book is all stuff that was familiar to me, that happened to me or was interesting to me. Hence the lack of a chapter on motor mechanics. I wrote it for my daughters in a way.“If you’re a comedian rule number one is ‘be funny’. There are serious bits but a lot of it is tongue in cheek. I don’t like to give advice and I think the best way is to tell people stories about what went wrong for you and say,you can avoid doing that you’ll be better off.” Brand is keen to write more novels – “so I don’t have to get dressed” – but hasn’t lost her love of stand-up. The problem is being away too much from the South London home she shares with husband of  years, Bernie Bourke, a psychiatric nurse, her daughters and cats Louis and Dotty. Script-writing and TV work suit her at the moment, but she’s never been one for five or ten year plans. “As things come up I think do I want to do it or not ” she says.And she decided she did want to do the Edinburgh and London legs of the Nativity! The Musical tour as she “likes Scotland”. Speaking of which, Brand was one of the  celebrities who signed an open letter in theto the people of Scotland urging them to stay in the UK in . Does she still think that, in the light of the Brexit vote “Well, I think so, just because I like Scotland,” she says. “But to be honest, I don’t blame you for wanting to leave because I wouldI was in Scotland. You have policies that are good on health, such as free care for the elderly, and it’s more caring. “As for Brexit, I would support another referendum because I think we are much better suited being in Europe than on our own, but it looks asaround half of the people are delighted by Brexit, and that’s quite a dficult thing to live with. “A bit of me thinks ‘you’ve made your bed, see what happens when you haven’t got enough people for the health service, doctors, teachers…’ Let’s see what happens. I think we are in the last chance saloon andwe do leave, I’m not sure how it’s going to be,” she says, sounding resigned. Butanyone should be tempted to say to her, “Cheer up love, it may never happen!” I refer you to one of her handy general purpose put-downs, “Keep talking and it will.”@JanetChristieJo Brand will appear in Nativity!

From  to , Mr Cooke provided weekly updates on America from America. His BBC Radion  show, aptly titled Letter from America, was great to tune into. I actually quite miss his wit and humour and the lens he used to consider what was taking place across the Atlantic. And as I sit here in Austin, Texas this morning, having spent a week in the Lone Star state, it makes me think about what I would tell you in my own notes on what is happening here in the USA. Let’s give it a try...One could be forgiven for thinking that I had arrived in the wrong country as I landed at Austin International airport. The usual ‘Welcome to America’ posters were positioned above the customs hall. But, all along the concourse and flying outside was the Lone Star flag. This official flag of Texas symbolises much more than simply being a state flag.It lets the rest of America know that Texas is dferent – very dferent in fact. Texas and many Texans see themselves as a separate country, detached from the main USA, and they are sometimes a little bit snfy about it. From car bumper stickers to T-shirts to Christmas tree ornaments to flags on the front lawn, Texans make it clear that they have their own identity. A bit like the UK and its relationship with the EU. Who knows, maybe one day Texas will indeed produce its own Nigel Farage.I asked the concierge at my apartment block where a good place to eat would be downtown. I like that America still has the concierge concept at so many places. It gives me that sense of security and local knowledge that an App sometimes does not convey.I was told that Easy Tiger was a great place to eat with freshly baked in-house artisanal bread. “That’s where I go sir” she stated proudly. How could I not go there now  While providing me with directions, she commented “then you will go past a bunch of homeless, but don’t worry they’re harmless...”. And, as it happened, on the -yard walk to the diner, I did pass a bunch of homeless people. About  souls, a mixture of white and black Americans. None begged or harassed me, but it made me think about the land of the free.: Jim Duffy: I’d prefer my own ‘moon flag’ to a Scottish saltireSuffice to say that Easy Tiger on th Street was awesome. The smoked turkey sandwich with Austin draft India Pale Ale was tasty and wholesome. I noted two things when I was there.The first was that the menu showed no big brewery beers – Coors, Bud etc. It was all local micro-brewery stuff. I asked the waitress, an Australian girl who settled in Texas, why this was. She said that there was a backlash against big corporations and that Austinites preferred to buy local, eat local, and support local. They loved their startups and put their money where their mouths were when it came to food and drink. The second thing I noticed was how tipping had progressed in the USA. Tipping is a big part of American culture. I had always through - per cent was a decent tip. Not any more. The screen I was presented with when paying my bill offered me ,  or  per cent or no tip. My enquiries with my lovely Aussie waitress revealed that her hourly rate was a measly .an hour. Her aim was too make .an hour with tips. Well done Tony Blair and Gordon Brown for bringing in the UK minimum wage, I thought. If I gave her  per cent, it meant I was not happy with the service,  per cent she had done just fine and  per cent she had surpassed my expectations. It felt personal. And it was replicated everywhere I went. I had four options and as I looked at the person waiting on me, how could I not tip - per cent knowing what they earned hourly.My Australian friend in Austin told me that there where some great election parties to attend that night in the local bars. From pm, Happy Hours would start and,I had my “I voted” pin with me, I could get  per cent off food and drink.: Jim Duffy: Why I’ll never be a sperm donorI opted for a bar across the street from my apartment. It was called Hen. Sitting at the bar, it was showing two big TV screen. One was showing CNN. The other Fox News.I ordered another IPA, which of course was local – IPA, denoting the area dialling code. I would have more of this IPA as it was hugely flavoursome. The bar tender was very excited about the elections. In a column in The Scotsman I would not be allowed to print the expletives that emanated from his voice box when I asked about Donald Trump. You get the point ... He was excited because this could be the night that Ted Cruz was upended and the progressive liberal Democratic candidate Beto O’Rourke had a great chance of getting in. As it happened, a few beers later it was neck and neck. The whole bar was ecstatic.When I awoke in the morning, the euphoria had been short lived. Cruz had retained his seat in the US Senate. I felt a little deflated, but Texas was no longer red . It was now a ‘purple’ state indicating that things were changing.I went to an east-side honky-tonk later that night where I loved the cowboys dancing in their hats to live country music. Only in America ... I’m off to Calornia for a few days at the weekend. And as I turned the TV on this morning, I see another mass shooting has taken place in the USA, this time in Calornia.

Despite improvements, Glasgow’s buses are still way behind Edinburgh’s, albeit with signs of improvement.: ‘Best railway Scotland’s ever had’ delayed by wrong type of threadFor my purposes, driving is not much less problematic. In theory, it should be the easiest and most convenient, although also the unhealthiest and likely least green way of travelling.For me, there’s uncertainty over journey times and parking, but by far the biggest drawback is that it is “dead time”, where it is not safe or legal to do much more than listen to the radio.I find air travel, unavoidable for the longest trips, the next most tedious. Not the flying experience, which can be amazing, such as unexpected view of the snow-capped coastal mountains of Greenland while crossing the Atlantic last month, but the stop-start nature of the process. It’s all about queues: to drop-off bags, get through security, board the plane – and then the reverse after landing.Trains are better, with the railways a discrete travel system, so you know exactly where you are going. It is also relatively easy to work en route, although there are limitations on what you can expect from free wi-fi, especially when carriages are busy.Yes, they can be subject to horrendous disruption, and trains have far fewer ersion options than on the roads. But luckily, with four routes across the Central Belt between Edinburgh and Glasgow, where I do most of my travelling, there is often an alternative when something goes wrong on one.: Alastair Dalton: The ‘electric-bike smile’ is now officialTaking a taxi is perhaps the most effortless way to travel,you can afford it, and Uber-style apps even eliminate the uncertainties over waiting times.Walking, where it’s feasible, I find to be an even better option – getting those steps in as part of the working day. With the right online map, it also provides, uniquely, journey-time certainty – so long as you can be sure of the suitability and desirability of the route being offered by often car-orientated algorithms.And the best way to travel  Well, I think cycling is the most fun for the freedom it gives. It’s true, there is the hassle of getting kitted up against the rain, there’s a limit to how much you can carry, and the risk of a slightly dishevelled appearance on arrival.But evenyou don’t have your own bike, the growing spread of cycle-hire schemes within towns and cities make this an increasingly viable option. I just can’t wait for electric bikes to be added to the fleets, which are on their way in Stirling, Edinburgh, Glasgow and where. They could make it first choice for short trips every time.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4826778.1541749233!/image/image.jpg","title":"theresa may promising all things to all people on brexit nicola sturgeon","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Nicola Sturgeon has said the UK Government is risking a disastrous Brexit by promising all things to all people.Scotland’s First Minister claimed Theresa May is not constructing a lasting deal and is trying to dupe people and hide the damage leaving the EU will cause.Speaking ahead of a meeting of the British-Irish Council on the Isle of Man, which will be also be attended by her counterpart in Wales as well as Ireland’s Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington MP and representatives of the governments of Guernsey, Jersey and the host island, Ms Sturgeon said it is time for the UK Government to be “straight with people”.She said: “The Prime Minister isn’t putting together a deal that will last.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that.

not the pound.m which Councillor Bruce has claimed.\"HIE also acquired pound.m in preference shares.\"However, due in large part to delay, obfuscation and obstruction by the previous administration of Highland Council, planning permissions were still not able to be delivered after  frustrating years of trying.\"As a result, and to the intense dismay and signicant financial cost of the three partners involved, the scheme, which would have created hundreds of much-needed jobs locally in an area of the country which desperately needed them, was forced into administration.\"This obviously meant the loss of pound.m of public money, which was utterly lamentable and deeply regrettable, as well as millions of pounds of losses to the three partners involved, but it also delayed huge investment in the local economy.\"It was only because Macdonald Hotels had a rock-solid commitment to regenerating the resort that we reached an agreement with the administrators in June  which prevented it from closing down completely for a second time.\"Ironically, it was only after the administration process that Highland Council granted the planning permission which had been applied for  years previously and which two previous owners had walked away from during that time.\"There was nothing controversial within that planning permission and itrsquos no more than the design of the resort as it is today.\"Since then we have invested pound.m in transforming the infrastructure at Aviemore and are now the largest private-sector employer in the area, with hundreds of full and part time staff employed there and an annual wage bill of pound.m.\"\"Indeed, we estimate that the resort will have hosted over , overnight stays, including several international conferences ndash some of them with up to  delegates -

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service. That support is urgently required."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-mod-gold-medals-e1539885405814.jpg","title":"thursday at the mod skye and lochalsh gold medal","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere was a Skye and Lochalsh double in the premier singing competition at this year’s National Mòd in Dunoon.In Wednesday night’s final Ceitidh Campbell from Kyle of Lochalsh won the women’s Gold Medal, while the men’s medal went to Ruairidh Cormack from Portree.Both singers are following in family footsteps in landing the prestigious honour, which is presented by Mòd organisers An Comunn Gàidhealach.Ceitidh’s mother, Barbara Smith, won the Gold Medal when the Mòd was held in Skye in .

November, in which Councillor Ian Cockburn put forward a motion whereby the local authority would determinefunds were available for design work to begin on replacement options to the bypass. This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry.

For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time.

They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future. It is time to lay the foundations for reconciliation andhealing, and to open up a new phase of the peace process. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27486  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National Chairperson“The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway. Author of short stories, plays, poems and a novel, The Weaver’s Grave which was his masterpiece, O’Kelly’s le was cut short because of his commitment to Irish freedom. The O’Kelly family of Loughrea were flour millers and merchants and Seumas received a good education. He was a fellow student of James Joyce in University College Dublin. There is a remarkable photograph of the BA degree class of  including Joyce, O’Kelly and George Clancy. Like O’Kelly, George Clancy, a close friend of Joyce, was to die a tragic death. He was Sinn Féin Mayor of Limerick when on  March  he was murdered in his home by the Black and Tans, on the same night as former Mayor Michael O’Callaghan. Seumas O’Kelly was a committed republican from an early age. He is recorded as one of those to the fore in the centenary commemorations of the  Rising in . He was writing for Arthur Grfith’s Irish Republican Brotherhood-funded newspaper The United Irishman from  and for its successor Sinn Féin from . While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year. Several of his plays were produced at the Abbey Theatre. Constantly busy with literary and journalistic work, O’Kelly was subject to poor health. He joined Óglaigh na hÉireann when they were founded in  but was unable to play an active military role. His brother was a Volunteer and was jailed in England after the  Rising. The paper Nationality, edited by Grfith, was established in  and O’Kelly was one of its writers. It was the main organ of Sinn Féin during the  and  by-elections. In May  Grfith was arrested and jailed in England and O’Kelly took over as editor of Nationality. Following the  November  Armistice which ended the First World War, British soldiers and loyalists ran riot through the streets of Dublin, attacking suspected Sinn Féin supporters. On the night of  November a crowd of drunken soldiers invaded the Sinn Féin Ard Oig at  Harcourt Street . Seumas O’Kelly was at his desk in the Nationality office and tried to defend himself with his walking stick. The office was wrecked and O’Kelly collapsed.

In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8695614.1541521803!/image/image.jpg","title":"irish language group funding snub claim rejected by dup","story":"A DUP councillor has rejected claims that unionists #snubbed# a request to fund an Irish language event.Irish language group Conradh na Gaeilge submitted a request to Mid and East Antrim Council to fund an event as part of Seachtain na Gaeilge , which takes place each March.Sinn Fein councillor Patrice Hardy claimed unionist councillors had “refused to even countenance” the request, adding: “Seachtain na Gaeilge is a hugely positive, global event which this council should be supporting rather than snubbing. “The Irish language community aren’t seeking special treatment, they are only seeking equality.”Last year, Ms Hardy accused the council of being “anti-Irish to the core”, after a move to have the local authority participate in Irish Language Week was rejected following a vote by members. In a statement yesterday, she added: “Despite all the controversy over the previous refusal to fund Seachtain na Gaeilge or even to engage with the Irish language community to discuss this, it appears that some members of the council have learned nothing.”But DUP Councillor Gregg McKeen said Conradh na Gaelige had been treated “the same as any other group” who had made a funding request, by pointing them towards the council’s grants programme.He told the News Letter: “They will be assessed under the same criteria as everyone . It is not that they are being refused funding, but they need to go through the same process as everyone . We don’t want to set them on a pedestal above other groups.”Earlier this year, an Irish language event hosted by then DUP Mayor of Mid and East Antrim was commended by Irish language groups.Mid and East Antrim prepares to remember the fallenPolice linking town incidents and appeal for witnesses Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"try catch "},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8698670.1541697964!/image/image.jpg","title":"local charities urge readers to show support for vital change the future campaign","story":"Will to Give is a group of  Northern Ireland cherished charities who have come together with one aim - to increase awareness of how important gts in wills are to the causes we all care dearly for.November  -  is Will to Give week, and local charities are asking our readers across Northern Ireland to help Change the Future for the charities you care for by leaving a gt in your willWith this in mind, Will to Give is dedicating this weekto encourage readers across the province to think about making their will and perhaps consider leaving a charitable gt to their favourite cause with their Change the Future campaign.A Will to Give spokesperson said: Every day right here in Northern Ireland lives are transformed thanks to the generosity of gts left in Wills by local people.These gts make a huge contribution to our work and typically fund le-changing research projects and services which can impact on thousands of local lives and change the future for many.Your will tells the people you leave behind, about the person you are.

Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre. The project is part funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth  Jobs Northern IrelandProgramme.I used to be a childminder and had two young children and didnrsquot think it was possible for me to get into the beauty business - but then I went back to college and studied beauty at the Roberta Mechan College, she said.I have a real interest in health and well-being and wanted to offer these services to others. I opened in April this year and I currently offer specialist skincare, nails, massage and waxing.Helen turned her dream into a reality after taking part in the Go For It Programme which is delivered free of charge by a team of experienced business mentors through Northern Irelandrsquos wide network of enterprise agencies.It provides expert advice and help with developing a robust business plan to help turn ideas into a commercial enterprise.Commenting on the success of the programme, Helen said: Often it is hard to know where to start that was my experience before starting the Go For It Programme. The support and guidance offered through it helped me fine tune my business idea from concept to working reality.They helped me with practical things in the early stages like setting out a business plan and doing a detailed analysis. It was great for helping me to budget and forward plan.ldquoI would urge anyone who has ever had the idea of starting up their own business, or evenyou have just started operating your own business to apply for a place on the Go For It Programme. The skills and knowledge imparted is beyond the realms of what you could achieve on your own.Melanie Christie Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre, on behalf of Mid and East Antrim and Borough Council, added: ldquoHelen joined the Go For It Programme driven by a desire to launch her very own beauty business, driven by a passion to help women improve their skin and help them feel good about themselves.Helen undertook an intensive beauty course under tutelage of an industry expert with a clear vision and motivation to open her own salon as soon as she completed her examinations.We worked with Helen to develop a business plan, focusing on key areas such as defining her service provision, marketing and financial forecasting, as well as helping her secure commercial premises at Ballee and Harryville Community Enterprise Centre.It is great to see how Helen has progressed her business in such as short space of time, building a loyal customer base and a excellent reputation for her quality customer service and using only the very best range of products.If you have a business idea yoursquod like to develop oryou are thinking about starting a business call    or visit: visit www.goforitni.

It is very unfortunate that there are no representatives here today from Northern Ireland, due to the lack of a ing Northern Executive.— Leo VaradkarNovember , A major theme at the meeting focused on east-west trade between the island of Ireland and the UK, with Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones warning a no-deal Brexit could be hugely expensive to Wales because of potential disruption to sea links with Ireland.Mr Varadkar warned that Irish freight heading for the continent may have to switch to sea routes to French, Dutch and Belgian ports rather than taking the quicker “land-bridge” via Britain to Calais. Brexit highlights UK’s devolution weaknesses, Nicola Sturgeon says The impact of Brexit on trade was high on the agenda at the British-Irish Council summit on the Isle of Man, with the UK’s de facto deputy prime minister David Lidington noting that East-West commerce across the Irish Sea was economically far more important than the more high-profile North-South movements between Northern Ireland and the Republic.Mr Jones said that % of trade between Great Britain and Ireland passed through Welsh ports like Holyhead.“The last thing I would like to see is a hard border between Ireland and Wales,” he said at a press conference at the conclusion of the summit.“If there is extra bureaucracy, extra checks at Welsh ports, that will have an effect on the ports themselves and the road infrastructure leading into the ports, both of which are devolved.“We run the ports and the roads.“There is a danger,we have a hard Brexit with no deal, that we end up having to pay a huge amount of money on the port and on the roads in order to accommodate the traffic that would be delayed there as a result of an imposition of extra controls.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Taoiseach Leo Varadkar warned of the danger of disruption to trade across the Irish Sea from Brexit Mr Varadkar said that his objective on trade was to “avoid the emergence of any new borders”.A “huge” amount of Ireland’s trade with continental Europe passes through Welsh ports and across Britain on its way to Calais, while much of Northern Ireland’s trade with the British mainland goes via Dublin port, he said.Alternative routes existed by boat to Rotterdam, Antwerp and French ports but were “much slower”, he said.“My objective when it comes to trade is to do everything we can to avoid the emergence of any new borders among any of us,” said Mr Varadkar.“That’s what the European Union gave us, border-free trade between Britain and Ireland and all the EU.“The fact that Brexit is happening makes that dficult to replicate, but our objective as an Irish Government is to do that to the extent that we can, in order to allow people to travel freely as they have done for so long now, but also to allow trade toas it does now.”The Chief Minister @HowardQuayleMHK welcomed member administrations of the British-Irish Council this morning ahead of today’s Summit. pic UsPAUFXD— Isle of Man GovernmentNovember , Mr Lidington said that while trade across the Irish border had “massive political and symbolic signicance”, the routes over the Irish Sea were more economically important.“It is in the interests of everybody within these islands that we get both an agreement on the withdrawal deal which gives the certainty of the implementation period and at the same time a declaration about a future partnership where the EU and the UK accept and work towards the objective of frictionless trade between our respective jurisdictions,” he said.“That is the thing that will work best for businesses, living standards, prosperity in every part of the island of Ireland, every part of the United Kingdom and the Crown Dependencies as well.”Mr Jones said that automotive business Schaeffler had made clear that uncertainty due to Brexit was a key factor in its decision to close a plant in Llanelli with the loss of  jobs.“We all understand that business needs certainty more than anything  and I hope over the next few weeks we will get that certainty, so businesses feel they are now operating in a situation where they can see the future,” he said.“At the moment, it is very dficult for them. Since the summer, they have become concerned that there might be a no deal and as a result of that they have started taking decisions that are not good decisions as far as we are concerned. Schaeffler is an example of that.”But Mr Lidington played down the signicance of Brexit to Schaeffler’s decision: “Dferent companies at dferent times find that market conditions are affecting them.“A number of automotive companies at the moment are finding that sales and demand in the market is not what they had expected it to be.”He added: “In the last year, we were still attracting more third-country inward investment in the UK than any other member state of the EU. The track record shows our attractiveness as a destination for third-country investment remains very powerful indeed.“I’m absolutely convinced that one of the benefits of a successful outcome to the current negotiations would be a reinforcement of that position.”Also attending the twice-yearly summit were Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley and representatives of the governments of Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man"},{"url":null,"title":"pm set to agree irish sea border theresa may letter rings alarm bells says foster","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Government will not agree anything that brings about a hard border on the island of Ireland.\""},{"url":null,"title":"10 incredibly childish things people do even thought","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Those responsible have branded by the local politician as ldquogrossly irresponsible.Cllr Curran described those who engage in such behaviour as ldquoselfless, reminding them that they are guilty of an environmental crime by dumping their waste in unauthorised areas.There are a number of illegal dumping hot spots across the district with the Downpatrick councillor suggesting the mentality of those responsible is particularly dficult to fathom.ldquoI cannot understand why people do not make use of household waste centres in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch, declared Cllr Curran.ldquoThe mentality of those who dump waste along rural roads is beyond me. What puzzles me most is that people who engage in this activity end up paying for its removal through their rates bills. They are literally costing themselves money, but that does not appear to register with them.Cllr Curran said there was no excuse for illegal dumping as there were so many ways for people to dispose of their waste legally and safely.ldquoFly tipping and illegal dumping results in a blot on the landscape and is an image no one wants to see. I firmly believe that those responsible for despicable behaviour should feel the full force of the law, otherwise this activity will continue, he warned.ldquoIllegal waste can range from bin bags dumped at the side of the road to old household furniture, rubble or old trees. For a modest fee, bulk waste can be collected outside peoplersquos homes.ldquoFor the le of me I do not understand why people are prepared to load up their vehicles and drive to secluded, rural areas to get rid of household waste. Why not just drive to one of the three household centres in our district Cllr Curran said local council officials were placing increasing emphasis on promoting the district as a major tourist destination and the last thing they wanted to see was roads littered with waste.He added: ldquoThe message must go out that illegal dumping is unacceptable and that the countryside and indeed town centres must be respected, not used as open air dumps by people who should know better.ldquoWe are fortunate to live in a stunningly beautul area which should not be blighted by the reprehensible actions of a mindless few. Our rural areas in particular must be respected, not used as open air dumping grounds..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballycran have it all to do in final  ","story":"BALLYCRANrsquoS hurlers are hoping that history repeats itself at the Athletic Grounds in Armagh on Sunday when they take on Cushendall in the Ulster Club Hurling Championship final.Itrsquos  years since the McKenna Park side last lted the Four Seasons Cup. That was in Cushendall are the aristocrats of the competition and while Ballycran have lost all three final appearances since their historic win in , the Ruairi Ogs have been crowned undisputed Ulster champions on no less than five occasions.Ballycran booked their place in this yearrsquos showdown after a sizzling display of open hurling, blasted holders and hot favourites Slaughtneil out of the competition.Gary Savagersquos boys were rated as   outsiders against the defending champions, but they left Slaughtneil in tatters with an impressive display.Savage was part of the team that lted the trophy in  and in addition to now managing the side, his two sons, Liam and Phelim, help control matters on the field of play.Both boys are certainly chips off the old block and Phelim, despite still being a minor player this season, is showing his true pedigree by dominating games from the centre half back berth and midfield.He is surrounded by a host of top class hurlers with Michael Hughes Stephen Keith, Scott and Brett Nicholson, Conor Woods, James Coyle and Colm McManus to feed off.Ballycran lost both their Antrim League games against Cushendall by signicant margins, but championship finals are a dferent animal and Gary Savage will have his side in a voracious frame of mind for Sunday. Cushendall are expected to lt the Ulster crown for a record-breaking th time. They have an abundance of experienced players in Carl Carson, Sean Delargy, Neil McManus, Eoghan Campbell, Ryan McCambridge, Donal Naughton and Paddy McGill, but they know they are in for one heck of a scrap on Sunday.If Ballycran can come up with a plan for depriving Carson, McManus, Campbell, Naughton and McGill of the sliothar, then they are in with a shout, but that is easier said than done, given the experience in the Cushendall set-up.One thing that is certain is that Ballycran will give it their all, but some times that is just not enough.Meanwhile, Burrenrsquos bid to recapture their glory days in Ulster is over for another year following their - to - defeat to Scotstown in their provincial SFC quarter-final in Newry on Sunday.Burren trailed - to - at the break, but a stirring second half display saw them give the Monaghan kingpins a run for their money. However, it was Scotstown who had a sting in their tail and they held on for victory.It was a similar story for Bredagh in their Ulster Club IFC quarter-final in Cootehill on Saturday where they were beaten - to - by Cavan champions Mullahoran. Jody Gormleyrsquos charges were desperately unlucky not to progress and were pipped at the post by a goal in the last minute of added time.Elsewhere, Downpatrick beat An Riocht - to - in the ACFL Division  relegation play-off at St Patrickrsquos Park, Newcastle.The Hoops just about held on in dficult playing conditions as An Riocht refused to go go down without a fight.St Johnrsquos got the better of Ballymartin in their ACFL Division  relegation play-off and their - to - win was just reward for a determined display.The only negative thing for St Johnrsquos was the news that manager Benny Corrigan stood down after the game..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch bypass scheme edges closer  ","story":"THE planned Ballynahinch bypass scheme is moving into the contract stage, Sinn Feacuteinrsquos Cathy Mason has confirmed.The partyrsquos Slieve Croob spokesperson has received confirmation from the Department for Infrastructure that work has commenced on drawing up contract documentation for the scheme.She said: ldquoFollowing the decision by the then Infrastructure Minister Chris Hazzard to commence work on the Ballynahinch bypass in December , officials from DfI have been working diligently through the ious legal stages to ensure the long awaited bypass scheme can commence as soon as possible.ldquoA programme of geotechnical investigation works on lands along theof the scheme was completed in  with advanced archeological investigation works completed earlier this year.Ms Mason added: ldquoThis has allowed the Department to now move ahead with preparation of the contract documentation in readiness of funding becoming available to construct the scheme..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Charles sends his gratitude and appreciation for the generosity  ","story":"A RECENT fundraising event in aid of Zambian businessman Charles Mwanda has raised pound,.The St Patrick Centre in Downpatrick was the venue in September for a night of musical entertainment organised by Sr Mary Delargy, a missionary sister from the town who has helped dozens of African children out of poverty and into professions over recent years.When Sr Mary worked in Zambia, Charles was her administrative assistant and she says the fundraising concert was not about giving him a hand out, but a hand up to continue with his business and employ a number of local people.The key reason for the September fundraiser was to generate enough money to allow Charles to purchase a generator so he could power his car wash business.Sr Mary worked in Zambia and during this period Charles was her assistant, helping her with the young people she was working with aged between  and .She had helped Charles get his business going through donations but there was a problemwith the power supply which is intermittent. To help keep the business going, he required a generator which is now in place.Sr Mary explained that due to regular power outages, electricity is only available from pm to am, therefore no business can operate during daylight hours.She said the recent concert at the St Patrick Centre raised pound, with an additional pound raised via subsequent donations.ldquoThe generator has been bought and installed and is making real dference to the business, a delighted Sr Mary confirmed this week.ldquoCharles sends his gratitude and appreciation for the generosity of people he will never meet. He now employs five young men and sustains his own family with the proceeds of the business.Sr Mary has thanked everyone who made the recent concert such a success, in particular, the Director and staff at the St Patrickrsquos Centre and the talented Stephen Smyth and his band who provided the the entertainment.Thanks were also extended to Frenchrsquos for providing the delicious supper, Downe Travel, Connollyrsquos and the Knights of St Columbanus for sponsorship.St Mary added: ldquoThank you to all those who attended the .

Each agency mobilises its own teams for its own land which is complicated for someone on the ground like me.ldquoI have to work out which bit of land is owned by seven dferent agencies in the area and then try to track down the manager concerned to get it dealt with.Cllr Enright believed some of the material was transported in a white coloured Vauxhall Insignia car.He added: ldquoI am offering a pound reward for anyone who can help me identy this vehicle and fill out a statement for environmental enforcement officers to issue proceedings which could lead to a prosecution..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Doors close for final time at old leisure complex  ","story":"LAST Saturday marked the end of an era when the Down Leisure Centre closed its doors to the public for the final time, ahead of the formal opening of its poundm replacement at the end of this month.The doors of the old centre closed at pm and there will be no indoor leisure provision at Market Street until the doors of the ultra-modern, multi-million pound replacement open at .am on Monday, November .Last Saturday was also the final session in the centrersquos swimming pool for the Downpatrick School of Lesaving.The organisation has held weekly lesaving sessions since the old centre opened, with all those associated with the School of Lesaving enjoying a positive rapport with both leisure staff and management.Everyone associated with the lesaving school is looking forward to continuing the good relationship in the ultra-modern new leisure centre when it opens.Last weekend, School of Lesaving principal Donny Maguire blew the whistle for the last time, with everyone eagerly looking forward to the opening of the new pool in the poundm leisure centre.The stunning three-storey facility boasts a range of facilities which would rival any of those more commonly found in leisure complexes attached to five star hotels.Facilities include an  station wellness gymnasium featuring the latest equipment, a  station spin studio,  metre six lane swimming pool, luxury vitality health suite including a sauna, steam room and vitality pool.There are sports halls and multi-purpose space and a teaching pool with moveable floor. The fantastic health suite also comes with its own dedicated relaxation area.While the formal opening of the new centre has been pencilled in for November , there will be a special launch weekend over the previous two days to provide the public with a sneak peak of the new , square metre, futuristic facility.During the transition from the old centre to its modern replacement, Newry, Mourne and Down Council officials are asking the public to use the local authorityrsquos nearby facilities at the Ballymote Health and Well-Being Centre in Downpatrick.Council officials are delighted with the new centre, in particular, the new teaching pool which will allow the new centre to provide a lot more swimming classes and education training for teachers, allowing full access to the main pool for other swimmers.Over recent years, there has been increasing pressure on swimming classes at the Down Leisure Centre which council officials are confident will soon ease.Mains gas has been connected to the new multi-million pound building which also boasts a combined heat and power source, helping minimise its carbon footprint, while photovoltaic cells fitted on the roof of the building will help heat the water in the pools and shower systems across a number of changing room areas.In addition, air source heat pumps sucks in cold air from the outside and turns into warm air, while ocalux glass allows natural light to stream into the building on the ground floor, while there are miles of pipework and electric cables within the plant room, the new leisure complexrsquos nerve centre.Now that the old leisure centre has been officially closed to the public, work will start over the coming weeks to bulldoze the building and remove the rubble from the site, paving the way for the provision of a major new car park..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Double for Danny boy  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK teenager was the talk of the racing world at the weekend.Seventeen year-old Daniel McMenamin, who is attached to the Nicky Richards stable at Greystoke, in Cumbria, lit up the Ayr meeting in Scotland with a fantastic double.Ayr is definitely a happy hunting ground for the young jockey as he rode his first winner under rules there in March, also for Richards.McMenamin, who hails from a famous sporting family, won the fourth race on the card, the Schweppes  handicap hurdle over three miles, on the   shot Taking Risks.He then guided Ribble Valley, the   favourite, to victory in the Coke Zero Maiden NH flat race for conditional jockeys and amateur riders over two miles mdash helping himself to a first ever double.The young jockey rode numerous winners on the pony racing circuit in Ireland and on the point-to-point scene with Ballynoersquos Brian Hamilton before trying his luck across the waterHe has been at the Richards yard for just over a year now and is determined to make his mark in an extremely competitive sport..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Downpatrick hang on for priceless win  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK will be playing their football in the top flight again next year after a nervy win over an Riocht at St Patrickrsquos Park, Newcastle, on Saturday afternoon.The Hoops were given a torrid examination in the second half as a game An Riocht threw everything into their bid to remain in Division , but the Hoops just about held on in testing conditions.Early points against the wind from Michael Magee and Tim Prenter had Downpatrick supporters beaming, but a free from Ronan McAlinden had An Riocht quickly on the RGUrsquos tail.A sublime free from Jarlath Branagan was negated by An Riochtrsquos Noel McArdle who brought the sides level with two accurate conversions.Branagan restored Downpatrickrsquos lead midway through the half as the Hoops continued to play the ball at speed and they struck the jackpot just before the break when a speculative pointed-effort from Conor McGrady did a bit of ducking and ing before ending up in the back of the net.Downpatrick looked firmly in control with a - to - lead, but Deaglan Morgan, who was not letting his sidego down without a fight, left three points in at the break with another good score.The wind and rain that Downpatrick hoped would be in their backs in the second half and despite Sean Bell extending their lead to four points, it was An Riocht who seized the initiative.McArdle really was in inspirational form and as well as firing over three frees, he still had time to ruffle a few feathers with his never-say-die attitude and desire to rattle several Downpatrick cages.A sensational point from Branagan and a McGrady free seemed to knock the stuffing out of An Riocht, as they made it a - to - game, but the Hoops hadnrsquot reckoned on McArdle.The livewire half forward took the bull by the horns and two more frees had Downpatrick quaking in their boots.

But late yesterday it seemed certain to pass without a deal on the UKrsquos withdrawal.Speaking after being briefed by the EUrsquos chief negotiator Michel Barnier, Mr. Tusksaid he saw ldquono grounds for optimism ahead of the European Council summit.ldquoAs I see it, the only source of hope for a deal for now is the goodwill and determination on both sides, Mr. Tusk told a Brussels press conference.ldquoHowever, for a breakthrough to take place, besides goodwill we need new facts.Mr. Tusk said he would ask Mrs. May whether she had concrete proposals on how to break the impasse saying that only such proposals can determinea breakthrough is possible.Reports from Brussels suggested senior European Commission officials were casting doubt on the prospect of a special Brexit summit being declared for Novemberthere is no movement on the key issue of the Border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.Mrs. May won strong support from Cabinet colleagues on Tuesday as she set out two key ldquosticking points preventing the conclusion of a withdrawal agreement.The issues relate to the ldquobackstop agreement demanded by the EU to avoid a hard Border by keeping Northern Ireland within the European customs area.Mrs. May has countered by offering to keep the whole UK in a customs union, but only for a temporary period.She issued a plea for unity as she said she remained determined to secure a Brexit that would respect the result of the  referendum, protect jobs and security and preserve the Union.ldquoIrsquom convinced thatwe as a Government stand together and stand firm, we can achieve this, she said.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Projected as three-screens, the film was cleverly edited to juxtapose the ying yellow line constructions, from the scouts lining up their yellow kayaks to the farmers forming their line of yellow bales.With the use of dramatic aerial shots, the formation of the yellow lines could be seen clearly as they cut through the landscape, representing both the Border and itrsquos people. The film received great response from the audience participants as they witnessed the powerful result of their involvement.With lsquoAcross and In-Between,rsquo Suzanne Lacy highlights the wit and cleverness of Border le in the face of political pressures, focusing on the power of play in creatively responding to complex issues.Suzanne commented: ldquoOur project draws those who live along the often-invisible boundaries between countries into a conversationmdashmetaphoric and literal ndash on personal and symbolic meanings of this border and by extension all such borders drawn by political forces.ldquoThe artwork explores inverse paradigms: visible and invisible, official and unofficial, rural and urban, the real border and imagined ones. For a brief time, we suggest there is a unique in-between identity for those situated between two countries ndash a Border people ndash and through playful acts we explore this liminal identity.lsquoAcross and In-Betweenrsquo was co-commissioned by - NOW, the UKrsquos arts programme for the First World War centenary, and Belfast International Arts Festival, with the support of the Government of Irelandrsquos Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade .Across and In Between was co-created with Cian Smyth, Helen Sharp, Mark Thomas of Soup Co, Pedro Rebelo, Conan McIvor, Helen Sloan, Eva Grosman, Garrett Carr and people in Pettigo, Tullyhommon, Castlesaunderson, Magheraveely, Newtownbutler, Cuilcagh Mountain, Counties Fermanagh, Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

If they succeed, this would automatically mean more barriers to trade with the EU, including across the Irish border, she stated.Dr Hayward agreed that the Mrs Fosterrsquos argument against any sort of backstop was ldquoperfectly reasonable as it is not ldquothe intended destination. But she still argues that it is of ldquocritical importance.. It is the issue over which the whole Withdrawal Agreement could collapse, leaving all of us in the mire of a lsquoNo Dealrsquo outcome.ldquoIt is therefore very important that all judgements of the backstop are based on a clear and accurate understanding of what it actually means, unclouded by hyperbole.And it is in relation to the backstop where Dr Hayward, who is a Fellow in the Senator George J. Mitchell Institute for Global Peace, Security and Justice, took most issue with Mrs Foster analysis:ldquoFoster claims that Northern Irelandrsquos access to the UK single market would be restricted. In actual fact this is entirely in the hands of the British government ndash it is a domestic issue unrelated to UK-EU negotiations, the Queens Reader asserted, before adding:ldquoSecondly, Foster says that lsquoEU access, comes with the requirement for Northern Ireland to fully adopt and implement EU regulations with no changesrsquo. But it is not necessary to have full regulatory alignment with the EU in order to have tarf free access to its market. That would be like saying wed have to have all our laws imposed by Beijingwe are to get tarf-free access to China.Dr Hayward does however admit that major ergence would require an operational backstop:ldquoThat said,the UK erges widely from the lsquocommon rulebookrsquo of the EUrsquos single market, it would not be possible for goods produced in Northern Ireland to have free movement around the single market as is currently the case. It would be in just such an instance that the backstop could come into play. This would not mean that all EU laws would apply in Northern Ireland but rather that goods produced here could be considered to be of EU standardcertain procedures are followed.In her opinion piece last week Mrs Foster stated that:ldquoFree Trade Agreements donrsquot just cover regulation but tarfs too. This would require not just being in the single market but in the customs union. In other words, a total sea Border descending between Northern Ireland and its largest market, Great Britain.Dr Hayward does not agree however and says ldquothere is absolutely no prospect of a total sea border under any scenario.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When we do we’ll be able to discuss it.“There is no doubt we have understood the concern the DUP and others have expressed about a hard border down the Irish Sea, we share it, and we will not accept a deal that involves that component.”Mr Wright’s remarks came after his interview was paused as DUP Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson was on the phone.Mr Wilson said the DUP has “a number of concerns” and accused Downing Street of leaking the letter sent to DUP leader Arlene Foster, telling the same programme: “I assume it’s part of the process of trying to get into the public domain what will finally be agreed.”Mr Wilson also said: “In that letter it makes it quite clear the government has accepted there will be a Northern Ireland-only backstop, that backstop will require specic alignment for regulations, a solution which does that, and the scope of that will be carefully subscribed.“Thirdly, the promise which was made in the agreement in December thatthere was to be any regulatory alignment then Northern Ireland would have a say on that - that seems to have been removed as well, which would mean regulations which would apply to Northern Ireland would not be decided at Westminster, would have no input from Northern Ireland and would come only from the EU.“That, to us, is a breach of the promise which has been made that we would not be cut off from the rest of the United Kingdom.”Askedhe accepted Theresa May’s pledge of no border in the Irish Sea, Mr Wilson replied: “We want to trust the Prime Minister because she has said so many times that that is the case, but you have to judge any promise by what is actually delivered in an agreement.“From what we can see in the letter which has been sent to Arlene and Nigel , it is quite clear some of the promises made do not conform to some of the content of the letter.”Referring to calls for the government to publish the legal advice it has been given on the Irish border issue, Mr Wright said it is “certainly possible” to release legal advice given to the government.Weather warning: Heavy rain and strong winds expected to batter Northern Ireland later today Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"But he told the BBC: “We don’t do it because it’s important the legal advice government gets is frank, is honest and,it’s something the giver of that advice thinks might appear on the front page of a newspaper, there is no guarantee it will be phrased in a way that is most helpful to the government decision-making process.”Mr Wright added: “summaries are sometimes set out” to help MPs understand issues, noting: “It will be up to the government as a whole to decide whether that’s the appropriate course here.”Mr Wilson said he understood the points raised, but added that Irish border Brexit advice should be published.He told the BBC: “I think it is important that, for the sake of clarity and so everyone knows what they’re signing up to, that the convention is breached in this case and the legal advice be made available.”try catch     .               ..

Itrsquos about the people you love and the things you care about. Your will helps pass on your principles and the values that matter to you. A gt in your will can ensure that your most loved charities can continue to make a dference for many years to come.Will to Give member USPCA We believe our success in preventing animal cruelty and the relief of suffering is an enduring tribute to those absent friends who shared our valuesEimear McCooey, Will to Give Chair, agreed: ldquoWe plan for lersquos major milestones births, weddings, anniversaries but most of us shy away from talking about and planning for death - yet it is the one thing that is guaranteed to happen to us all!I strongly believe that talking openly about the future can help ensure we have a better experience when it eventually does happen, and one of the things we can plan for is the legacy we want to leave behind.Making a will is important because it gives you the peace of mind of knowing that your wishes will be respected and the ones you love are looked after, whether that be family, friends or even a well-loved charity. I am leaving a small gt to the charities I care for in my will.Will to Give member the USPCA added its appreciation of the value of legacy gts with Brendan Mullan, Chief Executive, explaining:ldquoThe USPCA was established in  and since then the activities of the USPCA have evolved to meet the ever-changing needs of animals.By deciding to leave us a gt in your will you are helping us protect all animals across Northern Ireland.Legacies are extremely important to the USPCA and without these the charity would not be able to deliver our vital services to animals. We believe our success in preventing animal cruelty and the relief of suffering is an enduring tribute to those absent friends who shared our values.Will to Give added: Anyone can leave a gt in their will. It really doesnrsquot matter what size ndash small or large, every gt is greatly received.It is very easy to leave a gt in yourwill to charity ndash in fact, hundreds of people do it every year in Northern Ireland. We will always advise you to speak with your solicitor to have your will drafted correctly. Your solicitor should be familiar with how to write such a gt into your will.Further informationWill to Give is a charity dedicated to promoting charitable gts in Wills in Northern Ireland.

As citizens, we have built the UK together. We have traded together. We have fought together and we have built our lives together. Four years ago, I fought head, heart, body and soul to save our precious Union and helped to stop the SNP from breaking it apart. It is the UK that is a member of the EU, it is the whole of the UK that will leave and it is the UK that must now form a new relationship with the EU. Likewise, it will be the UK that is then free to set its own independent trade policy, its own trade tarfs, sign trade deals with countries such as the US, China and India – and also join Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and others in the Trans Pacic Partnership. And when it comes to negotiating the new relationship between the UK and the EU, it must be done for the whole of the UK. As a Scottish unionist I believe there can be no border down the Irish Sea splitting off Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. Not only would the application of dferent trading laws and taxes mean that over time Northern Ireland would erge unconsciously from the United Kingdom against the expressed will of its people – it would also feed Scottish nationalist demands that a similar ergent arrangement be made for Scotland. It is no wonder that the SNP are so keen on it.I welcomed the recent intervention of the Secretary of State for Scotland, David Mundell, and the Scottish Conservative leader, Ruth Davidson, in writing a letter to the prime minister making it clear that their blood red line is the integrity of the UK. Unionists across the House of Commons, whether from Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England have been completely and consistently clear that there is either a UK-wide deal or no deal at all.  Not a ‘great victory’ but hope of second term for Trump Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The EU has sought to use Northern Ireland to take control of Brexit, and to prevent us from leaving. They have had the audacity to put forward a crude plan that both violates the Good Friday Agreement and would hive off Northern Ireland from the UK. Despite all the scaremongering about a hard Checkpoint Charlie-style border, there is a very clear and logical solution. But the fact that the EU does not seem willing to discuss it raises questions about its motives.The European Research Group of backbench Conservative MPs has published a detailed paper, written jointly by two former Secretaries of State for Northern Ireland and an architect of the Good Friday Agreement Lord Trimble, that explains the iety of technical solutions available to ensure that border checks are not necessary. Both the UK and Irish governments have said they will not erect a physical border. In answer to a question in the Dail in Dublin, the EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker asserted the EU will not force a physical border on the Republic of Ireland. Revenue and customs officials from the UK and the Republic of Ireland have said they neither need, nor have plans for, new physical infrastructure at borders. With such overwhelming agreement, why is there a problem If the EU can accept that technical solutions for the movement of goods are possible for an imaginary border down the Irish Sea, then those applications can surely be possible between the two jurisdictions in Ireland too. Borders are borders. Whether or not the border is a line in the ground or in the sea there will be a place where the jurisdiction changes. That’s all it is, a change in the laws and who has the authority to enforce them.This used to take place with goods in transit being stopped and clarication sought that the consignments comply with the dferent laws. The perception is that this always takes place when the border is crossed, but that’s not how it happens anymore – technology has changed all that.When Guinness leaves Dublin to go to Belfast, Glasgow or Liverpool the necessary paperwork is completed electronically, taking account of the dfering duties, taxes and regulations so that it complies and any dues are paid to the correct authority. The beer truck is not stopped at the border. Only random checks are necessary and these are conducted anywhere on the journey by officials from any of the jurisdictions involved. There is no fuss made about this either.The idea that there will be a need for border checkpoints holding up traffic, asking for bills of lading [details of a cargo consignment] is a mendacious invention by the EU to keep the UK in its single market and customs union – or ide our country.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

The project is part funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth  Jobs Northern IrelandProgramme.I used to be a childminder and had two young children and didnrsquot think it was possible for me to get into the beauty business - but then I went back to college and studied beauty at the Roberta Mechan College, she said.I have a real interest in health and well-being and wanted to offer these services to others. I opened in April this year and I currently offer specialist skincare, nails, massage and waxing.Helen turned her dream into a reality after taking part in the Go For It Programme which is delivered free of charge by a team of experienced business mentors through Northern Irelandrsquos wide network of enterprise agencies.It provides expert advice and help with developing a robust business plan to help turn ideas into a commercial enterprise.Commenting on the success of the programme, Helen said: Often it is hard to know where to start that was my experience before starting the Go For It Programme. The support and guidance offered through it helped me fine tune my business idea from concept to working reality.They helped me with practical things in the early stages like setting out a business plan and doing a detailed analysis. It was great for helping me to budget and forward plan.ldquoI would urge anyone who has ever had the idea of starting up their own business, or evenyou have just started operating your own business to apply for a place on the Go For It Programme. The skills and knowledge imparted is beyond the realms of what you could achieve on your own.Melanie Christie Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre, on behalf of Mid and East Antrim and Borough Council, added: ldquoHelen joined the Go For It Programme driven by a desire to launch her very own beauty business, driven by a passion to help women improve their skin and help them feel good about themselves.Helen undertook an intensive beauty course under tutelage of an industry expert with a clear vision and motivation to open her own salon as soon as she completed her examinations.We worked with Helen to develop a business plan, focusing on key areas such as defining her service provision, marketing and financial forecasting, as well as helping her secure commercial premises at Ballee and Harryville Community Enterprise Centre.It is great to see how Helen has progressed her business in such as short space of time, building a loyal customer base and a excellent reputation for her quality customer service and using only the very best range of products.If you have a business idea yoursquod like to develop oryou are thinking about starting a business call    or visit: visit www.goforitni. try catch     .               ..

Staff morale is very low. Many staff doing the same jobs are on dferent pay scales and people are confused about who to contact about issues.“I along with Cllr Margaret Tinsley have raised this issue since the council began and to date we still do not have a final council structure.“I understand that every other council in Northern Ireland has long since completed this task and we are still dithering. “Indeed, some councils are reviewing their original structure and doing this for the second time and we haven’t even got it done once.“I again raised these issues at every committee and at full council in May June. It has gotten to the stage that our party is very concerned that the lack of structure is having a detrimental impact on the council’s ability to provide a quality service for our rate payers. “By not having this task completed council’s ability to be proactive and respond \u2028to local needs is being hampered.“The responsibility for the implementation of these structures lies with the most senior officials within the Council and it is about time it was sorted once and for all.“I am calling on the Council to implement a realistic time line for completion of this task to move immediately to ensure every possible effort is made to give our employees and rate payers assurances that this is being taken seriously.“We must ensure our employees know they are valued and appreciated and that any inequalities are immediately corrected.Morale must be boosted and creating the new structure will go some way to helping with that.”A Council spokesperson said: “The Council is going through a period of unprecedented change, the biggest change in Local Government in  years.Raw sewage bubbles up into City Park Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“With three large Councils coming together as one - making the second largest Council in NI - we are working through a number of complex HRissues so that our staff are treated fairly and equitably and structures are fit for purpose, providing the services local people need - whilst providing the best value for ratepayers. “We continue to work in partnership with our Trade Unions and staff to implement a structure that will support our community into the future.

That includes Crescent Link Retail Park in Derry, on sale for £.m, Antrim Business Park for £.m and The Boat building in Belfast city centre – on the market for £.m.According to CBRE, there were  major commercial lettings in the third quarter of the year, across , sq ft of space.That included Firstsource, which is taking almost , sq ft of space at - Fountain Street, which had been home to Concentrix.Meanwhile, construction workloads edged upwards in the third quarter of the year, despite a “marked decline in infrastructure and public sector work”.That’s according to the latest survey from RICSand Tughans.Jim Sammon, RICS Northern Ireland construction spokesman, said: “While it is encouraging that we are seeing rises in the private housing, private commercial sector and public housing subsectors, the picture across other areas, particularly infrastructure, continues to cause concern.“The fact that infrastructure and public non housing workloads are in decline gives an indication of the impact the lack of decision-making in government is having on the ground.And Michael McCord, head of construction, Tughans, said: “In some respects it appears that there is a two-tier construction market at present, with some private sector activity forging ahead, while surveyors report declines in infrastructure and other publicly-funded activity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Brian-1121.jpg","title":"brian mcgrath we were swept up in a national brexit debate which wasnt relevant for us","story":"Posted on Friday November  by Ulster Business John Mulgrew speaks to Foyle Port chief executive Brian McGrath about sharing UK and Irish waters, the burden of increased bureaucracy but looking at a potential Brexit silver-lining coming down the line There’s a surprising air of optimism surrounding Brian McGrath when it comes to the UK’s exit from the EU.While the Foyle Port chief believes the £m business – which handles around £.bn in commodities each year – could feel the bureaucratic hand of a post-Brexit environment, such as delays, paperwork and a potential “logjam”, that it’s in a unique position, sharing both UK and Irish waters.But he believes the Irish border was a mere “second thought” when Brexit campaigning was at its height – instead, focused around an emotional argument around immigration. A national debate which “we have been swept up in”, he says.While he says there remain serious issues which leave his business, and the rest of Northern Ireland, in the dark, far from seeing the port’s proximity with the border – in fact much of the mass of water is in the Republic – as a negative, Brian believes it could positively position it following Brexit.“We are unique as we are both a UK and European port, which is a fantastic opportunity with Brexit coming up.“We are talking to the City Deal people, the UK and Irish governments along with Donegal.“I think we, along with others, particularly, have an opportunity… there are dficulties we could face, especially with a no deal. We are pleased we can articulate our concerns and still hopefully have practical solutions.“Even in a ‘no deal’ scenario, where we are located, there will need to be good relations. Around %commute from Donegal. They will still need to do that.“In a paradox, it does bring some benefits. We have benefits with this Atlantic gateway – it is under-used, and can be utilised in a way to straddle the border. We are speaking about how we can join the dots.”Brian says the port has been working with Donegal County Council, over plans for its new cruise ship terminal at Greencastle. “We have the ability to import materials into the Irish side in the case of a hard Brexit. It wouldn’t take a huge amount of investment to make that happen.“There’s another dimensioninfrastructure capacity. We have a lot of things in place which is strong.“We have deep water available, and have access to probably the biggest land bank in the British Isles.“Project Kelvin  – the high-speed trans-Atlantic fibre-optic cable connection – runs right past our offices. We have over MW of power right beside us. In terms of the building blocks for basic industrial development, they are all in place.“In effect, a ‘no deal’ hard Brexit would be the ultimate impact… it means additional bureaucracy, would cost our port customers time and money, and might make them look at alternative ports to bring material in.“We are not insulated form the operational side of things. Materials coming in from the rest of the world. What could be an extreme in this, ultimately, it might mean, bringing in two million tonnes a year, % from Europe – that % could be subject to tarfs, or a lot of bureaucracy.”Laying it all out, the key concern ishuge bulk cargo – such as grain or animal feed – has to be ‘unitised’ into separate lorry loads, which require single certication each time.“It could create a fairly substantial bureaucracy around the logistics. That’s the very worst situation.”But business is good. Brian says the port employs  staff directly, but around , indirectly.“The numbers we put out in turnover are really strong, but they are modest in a sense that they don’t reflect the impact of what we do,” he says.“Percentage-wise, it’s mostly about the job creation that comes into the regional economy. “We have reinvested £m in the last few years, have a £m asset base and handle about £.bn in commodities a year.”In the other corner, Brian’s closely involved in Derry’s bid for a City Deal, similar to that submitted by six councils, including Belfast, last month.“We are working really closely with the infrastructure around the City Deal. There are two strands – there is the innovation, which is being led by Ulster University, and there is the infrastructure, which we will be playing a fairly central role in.”So, back to Brexit. What will Brian and his team be doing on the morning of March   “As much as you can do, we will continue as normal,” he said.“We have a number of preparedness scenarios. We are as prepared as I think we can be.“We could be prepared, but log jamsare beyond our control. “I don’t hear anyone talking up, or looking for a no deal outcome. I think Northern Ireland businesses have articulated itvery well, and we are punching above our weight.”The biggest issue is whereby a customer could look to moving where, thus moving trade away from the north west, Brian says.Looking back almost two and half years ago, and examining the current landscape today – whereby the UK is set to leave both the customs union and single market – Brian says: “I would have stayed in the customs union and single market. Our strategy has been to defend and grow – why would anyone want to turn away from the biggest customer base “I am not critical of people who wanted to leave the EU – but the way it has been done has not exactly been helpful. “What we see, in my own personal interpretation, when we talk to politicians, particularly from the UK, that the decision to leave the EU was made onof immigration.“That is what took us on the path. There’s then the second thought of the Irish question. If you can solve the issue for Derry, you can solve it for Dover. I don’t think that was considered when the case for leaving on immigration.“We have been swept up in an alternative, national debate – not something relevant for us.”And what’s next for the port  Brian says it’s been through three successful strategies, so far, in terms of expanding the growth.“It’s about leveraging in the coreand selling out the additional capacity to other capacities.“For example, in our marine, we invested in vessels – dredgers. When not used for our work, we go around the UK and Ireland, and offering expertise to other ports.“The key things we are doing is the strategic aims, to defend and grow – maintaining our core business, with core customers, and then looking to developing the industrial land bank and tourist product.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Danske-cover.jpg","title":"danske bank leading the tech and digital charge","story":"Posted on Monday November  by Ulster Business Danske Bank has taken another leap forward in its support for nurturing and helping to get businesses off the ground. Ulster Business chats to Danske Bank’s Vicky Davies and Richard Caldwell about the bank’s new Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub and ‘Making more possible’ for Northern Ireland businesses When you are already leading the technology and digital race in Northern Ireland banking, where do you go from there  For Danske Bank, its sights were set on something hugely ambitious, and something philanthropic which it believes can help cultivate, boost and grow the next generation of technology and fintech business start-ups in Northern Ireland. Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, run in partnership with Catalyst Inc, is a stunning, modern incubator and hub which will see dozens of entrepreneurs and start-up businesses shape and craft their ideas in the heart of Danske Bank’s own Belfast city centre headquarters. The partnership with Catalyst Inc makes a lot of sense, as it already plays host to dozens of knowledge-based businesses across  acres in the Titanic Quarter, and the Innovation Centre in Londonderry. Vicky Davies is managing director of strategy and corporate development at Danske Bank. “We have a clear ambition to be the best bank in Northern Ireland, and we plan to do that by making more possible for our customers, employees, stakeholders and society”, she says. It’s that message, ‘Making more possible’, that adorns the wall of one of the main meeting rooms in the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. “Banking is changing so fast. It’s relentless in terms of new entrants, innovation and the level of new fintech money coming into the industry.” “We know we need to change at pace, or face being left behind.” “We needed a partner in this venture, and we were looking for someone with reach and expertise,” she said. Following an initial meeting last year with senior management at Catalyst Inc, Vicky says there was an immediate mutual connection, and they went from there. “They have the expertise in running a space like this, and we have access to banking and business expertise – with both of us having great experience in helping businesses to grow. So, every dimension we looked at – it was a really good fit.” The hub is an impressive space, awash with splashes of colour, connectivity, co-working spaces and meeting rooms – including a nod to Princess Leia with an image on a wall – and it is able to play host to around - entrepreneurs and business start-up professionals, with top end cable and fibre internet connections. It’s further evidence of Danske Bank ensuring it’s well ahead of the pack and out in front. It’s about bringing a business from an embryonic start-up, to a thriving company, helping lead the way in its sector. But for Danske, this isn’t all about the bottom line. It’s about creating a thriving hub for the future stars of Northern Ireland’s burgeoning tech sector. And it’s a two-way street – with the bank aiming to learn as much from the start-up businesses nestled in the top-end spacious ground-floor hub, as the other way around. So, what does this mean for Danske Bank in terms of business banking and as an institution further bolstering its credentials in the digital space. Richard Caldwell is managing director of personal banking and small business. “We want to be part of the local fintech journey. We want to help influence and develop ideas,” he says. “There are more than , businesses in Northern Ireland, and we want to continue to support start-ups in general – by putting expertise and support into this partnership, we will help this particular set of small businesses to grow in what is a burgeoning sector.” “Ultimately, real success for us would be seeing products brought to market, and helping businesses grow from an embryonic idea, through to start-up, growth and expansion. With the business maybe ending up as one of our loyal corporate customers in the future.” Richard says research showed that many of Danske Bank’s existing bigger business customers wanted the bank to provide “something more tangible” for start-ups, to grow companies for the future. Although tenants in the new fintech space don’t necessarily have to bank with Danske, the Bank does offer banking support, including everything from a current account, to receiving assistance from a growth adviser to support them with their banking needs. gt “This is a major investment for us,” Richard says. “This is one of the most expensive ground-floor retail premises in Belfast, and we have devoted it to this hub. This is front and centre in the heart of Belfast.” The location of the new hub couldn’t be better – with the new Glider bus linking the hub to Catalyst Inc headquarters in Titanic Quarter. And, as modern tech businesses evolve and reach out to new markets and time zones across the globe, there is also  hour access to the Fintech Hub. The hub has a team of four, two from Danske Bank and two newly recruited by Catalyst Inc. Together Danske Bank and Catalyst Inc have also launched a new online  to help the wider growing number of start-up businesses across Northern Ireland to connect with investors, peers and potential new recruits across Europe - thehub.io helps connect start-ups to relevant resources, such as talent, networks, financing, tools and advice from experts which will help them overcome some of the challenges of scaling up. It is clear that strategically this is a big push by both organisations to play a key supporting role through the provision of both physical and online resources. Digitalisation Richard is keen to point out support for the hubs is just part of a bank-wide digital transformation agenda at Danske. “For example, we want to change the nature of traditional relationship management at the Bank. In addition to managing traditional banking needs as we have always done so well, we are now moving into the added value space. As well as the human touch, customers increasingly want top notch digital solutions to make their lives easier, to give them ease of access and quicker credit decisions.” The digitally-savvy way of thinking is giving Danske Bank competitive advantage, and that is from an already well-established position in the market. Last year they appointed a chief digital officer, who is a member of the Bank’s executive committee. “Our people are still our best asset and will remain so,” Richard said. “We have great people. And customers still highly value that human touch and expert advice. But what the journey looks like for transactions, well we have digital solutions for everything. For your payments, wages, drawing direct debits or paying suppliers. “Right now we are piloting and rolling out digital credit decisions for business customers. This is transforming the credit journey for both our customers and our business relationship managers. For example, one customer recently applied for an overdraft through the digital credit solution and got approval and the funds in their account in  minutes.” Danske Bank was the first of the local Northern Ireland banks to bring in app banking, and solutions such as Samsung Pay, Fitbit Pay and Garmin Pay. And this new Fintech Hub is very much another stride forward. The bank is also leading the pack when it comes to customer satisfaction, right across businesses of all shapes and sizes. “For some time now we have been the market leader in business banking. Research continues to show that our customer satisfaction scores are first for large business, and first for small business,” Richard said. Both Vicky and Richard are keen to see what they predict will be short and long-term benefits from the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. There’s an organic osmosis, allowing ideas to flow freely between the Danske Bank people visiting from upstairs and those entrepreneurs which it hosts on the ground floor. “The entrepreneurs in the hub bring a fresh mindset, one we can learn from as we continue our own digital journey throughout the bank,” Vicky says. Richard added: “The fintech sector is seen in many quarters as a challenger to traditional banks, but we are embracing it and feel we can grow with it, to the benefit of our customers.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Riccc.jpg","title":"ni house prices outpace uk market","story":"Posted on Wednesday November  by John Mulgrew RICS residential property spokesman, Samuel Dickey Northern Ireland homes have avoided a UK-wide dip in prices, according to a new survey. The latest RICS and Ulster Bank Residential Market Survey shows a larger proportion of surveyors pointing to a rise in the average cost of a home. That was a higher level than anywhere  in the UK, during October. It says that “Northern Ireland surveyors are also the most optimistic, looking forward. A net balance of % expects prices to rise in the three months ahead, while a net balance of % expects the number of sales to increase in the same timeframe. Most other regions expect prices and sales activity to fall or be broadly flat in the final quarter”. In terms of supply, the survey pointed to a slight rise in properties coming onto the market in Northern Ireland for the first time in five months. RICS residential property spokesman, Samuel Dickey said: “Interest from first time buyers and a strong rental have been two of the factors driving the Northern Ireland housing market, with first time buyers and investors both very active this year. “Surveyors remain confident about the market, despite political and economic uncertainty, and  is shaping up to have been a more positive picture for the housing market than perhaps was initially anticipated.” Terry Robb, head of personal banking at Ulster Bank, said: “As the survey indicates, demand remains relatively strong and we continue to see a good-pipeline of mortgage applications. “Our new paperless mortgage process has generated interest but more fundamentally, interest in the market remains firm from a broad range of mortgage purchasers including first time buyers, home movers and those remortgaging.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
