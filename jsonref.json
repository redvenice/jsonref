A country must stand on its own feet.\u0027Khan, 65, a former cricket legend, was sworn in as prime minister on Saturday after his party swept to power in last month\u0027s election.A firebrand populist, Khan\u0027s appeal has soared in recent years on the back of his anti-corruption drive, which has resonated with young voters and the expanding middle class in the mainly-Muslim nation of 208 million people.But Khan has inherited a host of problems at home and abroad, including a brewing currency crisis and fraying relations with Pakistan\u0027s historic ally, the United States.Imran Khan is sworn in as Pakistan\u0027s new Prime Minister...Imran Khan is elected Pakistan\u0027s new Prime Minister three...Share this articleKhan did not shed any light on policy plans to deal with the currency woes that analysts expect will force Pakistan to seek another International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout. Instead, Khan focused on debt and said former central bank governor Ishrat Husain would lead a task-force to drive austerity.Criticizing what he called the colonial-era mindset and lavish lifestyles of Pakistan\u0027s ruling elite, Khan announced he would live in a small three-bedroom house instead of the palatial prime minister\u0027s residence.Khan plans to have only two servants instead of 524 reserved for a sitting premier. He also announced plans to sell a fleet of bullet-proof vehicles to help Treasury shortfalls, a bold move in a country where Islamist militants still pose a threat.\u0027I want to tell my people, I will live a simple life, I will save your money,\u0027 he said.          The former cricket star called for the rich to start paying taxes and said Pakistan will begin an austerity drive to reduce debtKhan appealed to overseas Pakistanis to invest in the country and urged the wealthy to start paying taxes, a perennial problem in a nation famous for tax dodging and where less than 1 percent of the population files income tax.\u0027It is your responsibility to pay taxes,\u0027 said Khan. \u0027Think of this as a struggle, that you need to pay tax for the betterment of your country.\u0027Khan said Pakistan was in grave danger from the effects of climate change and promised to reduce some of the world\u0027s highest maternal death rates and infant mortality rates.He also spoke passionately about the need to help 22.8 million out-of-school Pakistani children in a nation where the literacy rate hovers above 40 percent.Khan, who has never held a government position, named his 21-person cabinet over the weekend, opting mostly for experienced politicians.Opponents criticised the choices, saying about half of the cabinet had served under the former military dictator Pervez Musharraf and were part of the old guard. On Sunday, Khan announced he will oversee the interior ministry.A former playboy of the London social scene who has since adopted a pious persona, Khan said he wants Pakistan to build a welfare state akin to some found in the West, which he said are modelled on the ideas first voiced by Prophet Mohammad in the holy city of Medina.\u0027I will spend money on those who God has not given enough to,\u0027 he said.

Muslims in Western nations sometimes will instead purchase a whole carcass from a butcher to be ided among themselves or buy large amounts of meat for a communal meal among friends, neighbors and relatives.In addition, many Muslims around the world attend mosques, wear new clothes and visit with friends and relatives. Around Eid al-Adha, many Muslims also travel to Mecca in Saudi Arabia as part of the Hajj pilgrimage, considered one of the Five Pillars of Islam alongside the declaration of faith, prayer, charity and fasting.Ismat Chughtai: Google Doodle remembers the Indian authorLa Tomatina 2018: Spain\u0027s tomato festival is coming to LondonDoctor Who season 11: Everything we know about the new BBC seriesWho is Ryan Thomas?

Bennett, now 22, played Argento\u0027s son in The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things in 2004 when he was just seven years old (pictured together in the movie)           Argento and Bennett often referred to each other as mother and son on social media after they appeared in the movie together (pictured Agento, with Bennett  (center) and Dylan and Cole Sprouse in 2004) Bennett responded: \u0027I\u0027m almost there!:)\u0027It was during that reunion, in her room at a Ritz-Carlton in Marina del Rey, California on May 9, that the assault is alleged to have occurred.According to the notice to sue, Bennett had been taken to the hotel by a family member, but Argento asked them to leave so she could be alone with him.She then allegedly gave the young actor alcohol and began kissing him. Bennett claims she pushed him onto the bed, removed his pants and performed oral sex on him. She climbed on top of the 17-year-old and the pair had sex, according to the notice of intent.The age of consent in California is 18. The document, according to the Times, also included three photos apparently taken by Bennett during the encounter which showed him and Argento, both half naked, in bed together, although only one of the photos showed their faces.Argento later posted on Instagram that she\u0027d had the: \u0027Happiest day of my life reunion with @jimmymbennett xox.\u0027 \u0027Jimmy is going to be in my next movie and that is a fact, dig that jack,\u0027 she added.She shared several more pictures of herself and the teen on that day, including a photo of herself hugging the teen in what appears to be the dining room of the hotel. She captioned it: \u0027My son my love until I will live @jimmymbennett marina del ray 05.2013.\u0027Bennett said that as he headed back to his parents\u0027 house in Orange County he felt \u0027extremely confused, mortified, and disgusted.\u0027Yet a month later, he sent Argento a tweet which read: \u0027Miss you momma!!!!\u0027 along with a photo of an engraved bracelet she had given him to commemorate the movie.           Bennett was just 17 when he claim that Argento performed oral sex on him and slept with him in her California hotel room in 2013.

The pair would often refer to each other as mother and son          Argento and Bennett kept in touch over social media for years after the movie. Bennett appears to have suspended his social media accounts In November 2017, Bennett\u0027s attorneys sent the notice to sue arguing that the former child actor, who starred in Firewall across from Harrison Ford, had his earning power  diminished by the alleged assault because of the psychological damage he\u0027s been left with. It states he earned more than $2.7 million in the five years before the 2013 encounter, but his income has since dropped to around $60,000 a year.In recent years, he has had smaller roles on TV and on the big screen, with his most recent credit playing Dustin in 2017 movie Heartthrob. Bennett, who reportedly lives with his parents and sister in Huntington Beach, California, also plays guitar and sings on his YouTube channel.Argento\u0027s lawyer Carrie Goldberg sent a letter Argento in April setting out the final details of the settlement, she appeared to console the actress. \u0027We hope nothing like this ever happens to you again,\u0027 Goldberg wrote. \u0027You are a powerful and inspiring creator and it is a miserable condition of life that you live among shitty iniduals who\u0027ve preyed on both your strengths and your weaknesses.\u0027A month prior to Bennett\u0027s notice, The New Yorker published its bombshell expose featuring 13 women who accused Weinstein of harassment and rape.Among those 13 was Argento.The Italian star  told the New Yorker that Weinstein raped her in 1997 at a party hosted by Miramax at the Hotel Du Cap-Eden-Roc. She claims the mogul led her to an empty room and asked her to give him a massage.          Argento posted multiple photos of Bennett, and the two of them together on the day of the alleged assault, with fawning captions where she refers to him as her \u0027son\u0027  Bennett (pictured in recent Instagram photos) claimed his career as an actor had been stymied by the emotional distress he suffered           Argento was dating celebrity chef and writer Anthony Bourdain until his suicide in June (pictured together in September last year)\u0027When I see him, it makes me feel little and stupid and weak,\u0027 said Argento. \u0027After the rape, he won.\u0027In total, 13 women told the New Yorker that they were sexually harassed or assaulted by Weinstein and three said that they were raped.The explosive expose empowered dozens more women to come forward and share their allegations of assault, rape and harassment against Weinstein.The film producer, who was fired from Miramax in the wake of the allegations, turned himself into police in May on multiple rape charges.\u0027Today Harvey Weinstein will take his first step on his inevitable descent to hell. We, the women, finally have real hope for justice,\u0027 Argento tweeted as Weinstein turned himself in.  Weinstein has \u0027unequivocally denied\u0027 all allegations of non-consensual sex. The 66-year-old disgraced movie mogul was arrested, processed and booked for the alleged sexual assault of two women who previously shared their stories with the New Yorker back in October.in June, he plead not guilty to charges of sexual assault and rape.Argento\u0027s boyfriend Bourdain had been very supportive and was full of praise for the actress for initially going on record about her Weinstein rape allegations. \u0027When you went on record, @AsiaArgento you were sure this day would never come, that you would be crushed, that you were alone. And yet you did it anyway. #perpwalk,\u0027 he tweeted in May.Bourdain, 61, and Argento met during the filming of his travel show Parts Unknown in 2016 and began dating a year later. Shortly before he was found hanged in his French hotel room, a paparazzi caught Argento dancing in a Roman restaurant with French reporter Hugo Clément. They were also pictured holding hands and hugging on the streets of Rome.Bourdain committed suicide on June 8, five days after the photos first appeared online. Argento\u0027s friend and fellow Weinstein accuser, Rose McGowan, released a statement after his death, saying that the couple were in a \u0027free relationship\u0027 and \u0027loved without the borders of traditional relationships.\u0027Argento was devastated by Bourdain\u0027s death and released a heartbreaking statement following his suicide, where she described him as \u0027my love, my rock, my protector.\u0027\u0027I am beyond devastated. Anthony gave all of himself in everything that he did,\u0027 she wrote on Twitter. \u0027His brilliant, fearless spirit touched and inspired so many, and his generosity knew no bounds.\u0027  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/20/18/4F3CDC3F00000578-0-image-m-11_1534785208851.jpg","title":"Iconic 60s vehicle ridiculed adored owners making comeback","story":"    Oliver (left) and his brother Merlin Ouboter (right) designed the latest electric bubble car - the MicrolinoBut while the size and performance may be positively bonsai, demand for this bubble car is booming. The brothers initially planned a reservation list of only 500 orders, but they have already received a whopping 7,200 and are hoping to hit an annual output of 10,000 cars.At £10,770, the Microlino certainly doesn’t have a titchy price tag, costing about the same as a Vauxhall Corsa, which has three doors rather than just one. But while the Vauxhall will take just short of £60 to fill, the Microlino can be powered for a pittance — £1.35.Undocumented immigrant and father-of-two, who was caught by...Novichok victim Charlie Rowley is rushed to hospital after...Share this articleOf course, this number crunching rather misses the point of the Microlino. Its allure lies more in a nostalgia for the comic charm of the bubble car.Those with long memories will recognise that the Microlino looks very similar to one of the first bubble cars — the iconic Isetta, which sold a staggering 162,000 worldwide.Designed in 1953 by Italian Renzo Rivolta, whose company made fridges, the Isetta was a response to the public’s desire for an affordable vehicle, as well as one that could negotiate the narrow streets in Italian towns.It was also a hit in West Germany, where an ailing BMW was looking for a car to turn its fortunes around.          The car (pictured) boasts a 20-horsepower motor copied from a small forklift, and reaches a top speed of 56 mphThe Isetta did just that, and motorists marvelled at the fact that it could accommodate a family of three — just — and still park facing the pavement.In Britain, the Isetta was manufactured by a former pilot called R. J. Ashley.But there was a technical hitch with the British version. Because it needed to have right-hand drive, the driver sat on the same side as the engine, which meant all the weight was on one side of the car — risking it toppling over. The solution was simple: a chunky lead weight was embedded in the other side to balance it out.The Isetta’s basic build meant it could be easily adapted. One of the most extraordinary examples was that driven by Horst Breistoffer, who gutted his 1964 model. But his modifications were for a serious purpose — to smuggle refugees through the Berlin Wall from East to West Berlin.Breistoffer’s logic was an impeccable piece of bluff, as he guessed the guards would not bother searching such a small vehicle.On nine occasions, he was proved right. But unfortunately, on the tenth escape attempt, a guard spotted some movement in the back of the car and he and the refugee were arrested.The car is now on display at the Checkpoint Charlie museum in Berlin.Also cramming people into his Isetta at the same time was the actor Ian Ogilvy, who bought a bright yellow version when he was a drama student in London.          The brothers planned a reservation list of just 500 , but they have already received 7,200 orders and are hoping to hit an annual output of 10,000 cars‘One day I happened to mention my holiday plan to drive all the way to Scotland and back in my tiny Isetta bubble car to visit a relative,’ the former star of The Saint recalled recently.‘My friend Gemma Jones asked if she and her boyfriend could come too. I reminded her that with three of us somehow crammed on to the bench seat there would be room — as far as luggage was concerned — for only a toothbrush and a clean pair of knickers. Gemma insisted that it would still be fun.‘So we went to Scotland and back, the three of us, squashed together inside a small yellow metal ball on three diminutive wheels. Top speed was reduced to 40 mph. We even slept in the thing one night. Gemma was right — it was fun.’Germany’s relationship with the bubble car is enshrined in another iconic example of micro-motoring. While for most the name ‘Messerschmitt’ is associated with World War II fighter aircraft, the company also produced a bubble car in the Fifties and Sixties that went through various versions, until it was called the KR200.It was the brainchild of German war veteran Fritz Fend who had lost both his legs and developed vehicles for the disabled.Fend produced a design classic, even if the driving experience left a little to be desired. Not only was the car noisy, but the canopy made it extremely hot.          The new Microlino is very similar to one of the very first bubble cars – the iconic Isetta (pictured), which sold 162,000 units worldwideHowever, it’s the British who can claim the record for creating, according to Guinness World Records, the smallest production car ever made — the Peel P50.The Peel, which was made on the Isle of Man in the Sixties, really was absurdly small, measuring just 4 ft 5 in long and 3 ft 2 in wide. Naturally, as it was little bigger than the average armchair, there was room only for one person, and the whole vehicle weighed just 9 st 6 lb. It even had only one headlight.The car may have had a three-speed gearbox, but what that gearbox lacked was a reverse.To park it, the driver simply got out, lifted the back of the car with a handle and rolled it into position.By the end of the Sixties, the fashion for bubble cars had burst. People wanted bigger, more practical vehicles. But they are still proving to be collectors’ items and can fetch high prices.A 1959 BMW Isetta is currently for sale on eBay for £13,000, while an immaculate 1957 Heinkel Kabine will set you back £25,000.          The Heinkel Cabin car (pictured) was another of the microcars to grow in popularity during the 1950s and 60sPerhaps the most expensive bubble car sold was a 1958 FMR Tg500, auctioned in the U.S. for £252,000 in 2013.Surprisingly, not all bubble car enthusiasts are as diminutive as the vehicles. Take Jim Jamieson, the former owner of a 1960 Isetta, who measures 6 ft 8 in and weighs 25 st — around one third the weight of the car itself.‘I bought the car out of bloody-mindedness and my stupid sense of humour,’ Mr Jamieson says.‘But despite my size, it was absolutely fine. It was used as the Isetta owned by the landlord’s daughter in the TV series Heartbeat, and she would have to drive it in a very spirited way, sometimes just tipping on to two wheels.‘However, the stunt men refused to touch it, saying that the car didn’t have enough wheels! So I had to drive it, all 25 st of me, and wearing a wig, and sitting as low as possible.’Many bubble cars have ended up in garages, forlornly left to rust. But with those rising fuel prices, it is certainly likely they will become more common again.The Microlino is not the only new bubble car on the roads. An electric Peel P50 closely modelled on the original can also be spotted. And look out for the Corbin Sparrow in the U.S., which costs around £23,500.At prices like that, some bubble cars are still not a realistic option for most.But if the Microlino catches on, and gets a little cheaper, there’s a good chance the bubble car industry will once more inflate."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/15/23/4EF8983E00000578-0-image-m-17_1534372080125.jpg","title":"BBC Today programme losing thousands listeners rival Radio 3","story":"    John Humphrys presenting the Today programme on Radio 4, which is losing thousands of listenersBreakfast presenter Petroc Trelawny claims his show is attracting listeners who can no longer face the ‘difficult and bleak’ news offered on Radio 4.He told the Radio Times: ‘The Today programme is clearly the benchmark for morning news programmes.

Today, she struggles to make ends meet.To help pay her way she spends almost every waking hour using scrap paper to hand-make table decorations for Greek weddings. The burden of work means that she is only able to visit her ageing parents, some four hours travel time from Athens, two or three times a year.A hospital doctor among our acquaintances has seen his monthly pay cut to €1,200 (£1,071). It is only his social conscience and love of his country that has kept him in Athens.          The country’s once elegant capital has become one of the most depressing and untidiest cities in Western Europe Some 70,000 highly skilled professionals including doctors, dentists and pharmacists have left the country as part of a broader Grexodus of 500,000 people.The best way for any country to emerge from financial crisis is to increase its national income so that tax revenues rise and global debts can be paid off. But during the last eight years, Greece has moved in precisely the opposite direction. National output has slumped by an astonishing 25 per cent. The result is adult unemployment of 20 per cent. Even more shocking and socially disruptive, some 40 per cent of 18 to 25-year olds are out of work.Without any income for the young, it is now commonplace for three generations of the same family to be forced to live cheek by jowl in the same crowded apartment. The fact is that the austerity imposed by the eurocrats has ruined Greece and done nothing to relieve it of its monstrous level of debt.It has snuffed out entrepreneurship, as well as created a poisonous political legacy where a far-Left Marxist party headed by Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras rules with the support of fanatical politicians on the populist Right.The end of the EU’s bailout programme may technically mean that Greece can return to the international markets to borrow again, but any notion that the world’s commercial bankers and financiers will be queuing at Athens’ overcrowded and dilapidated airport to lend – and pour good money after bad – is a fantasy.          Shops on boulevards are shuttered and cranes stand idle over the shells of unfinished buildings (pictured, Greek riot police dodge a petrol bomb thrown by protesters during clash  over tax reforms in 2016) After all, the country is still sitting on a debt pile of €289billion (£258billion) which the International Monetary Fund puts at 191 per cent, or almost twice the nation’s total annual output.To place that in context, it is more than two times the ratio of Britain’s national debt to output, which after a decade of UK cuts to public services and surging tax incomes as the economy has grown is now, thankfully, on a downward path.Not only that, Greece’s stricken financial system is currently being kept afloat by short-term cash assistance of some €40billion (£35.6billion) per month from the Frankfurt-based European Central Bank. Without this help, which is akin to that provided by the Bank of England to the British banks at the height of the financial crisis a decade ago, the four biggest Greek lenders would be effectively bankrupt.Together the bad loans on the books of these banks – Piraeus, Alpha, Euro Bank and National Bank of Greece – amount to €101billion (£90billion) or 50 per cent of the total, the highest level of any country in the European Union. Indeed the banks, the lifeblood of any Western economy, are so indebted they cannot lend any more.Which means the small and medium-sized enterprises that are the country’s business bedrock cannot get the finance they need to carry on and invest. Nor do ordinary consumers find it possible to obtain credit.This desolate financial scenario is a direct result of the austerity conditions demanded by Brussels eurocrats and German central bankers.Over the last eight years successive Greek governments have been forced to attend no fewer than 95 meetings at which the most stringent measures have been imposed on them.The results for the Greek people have been nothing short of catastrophic.Yet in their determination to preserve the greater political project of the eurozone and the EU, and to keep Greece as their client state, Brussels and German politicians have been utterly ruthless.In spite of personal appeals from the International Monetary Fund’s euro-supporting managing director Christine Lagarde to forgive Greece its debt burden and allow the country to be given a fresh start, the eurofanatics have been unrelenting in their determination to keep the debt anvil hanging around its neck.Greece is in an armlock it cannot escape because of a combination of its debt burden and the fact that its membership of the eurozone means it can no longer devalue its currency. And the EU and Germans are determined to keep it that way to save their precious euro.So despite the joyous news bulletins about the bailout yesterday morning, be in no doubt that this Greek tragedy is very far from over."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/20/00/4F2C016100000578-0-image-m-4_1534719633251.jpg","title":"GCSE science exam pupils saved moving grade boundaries","story":"    Ofqual said some youngsters who would have picked up a U on results day this Thursday will now get their results bumped up to a pass as grade boundaries changeOfqual lowered the safety net after a larger than expected number of pupils looked set for a U – which stands for unclassified. The move comes amid a row over grade boundaries being set low in the new reformed exams, with some critics warning it is a continuation of a \u0027prizes for all\u0027 culture.Thousands more pupils \u0027to clinch top GCSE grades needed for...Markers grading this year\u0027s GCSE and A-Level exams will be...Share this articleOfqual announced the move yesterday in a blog about the combined science paper, where students are examined in three sciences but it counts as two GCSEs. The new qualification is tiered, meaning teachers have to choose whether to enter children for the higher tier paper or easier foundation tier.The watchdog has refused to disclose how many pupils have been affected, the Times Educational Supplement reported. In a blog post, Cath Jadhav, of Ofqual, said: \u0027For some students... receiving an unclassified result because they had been entered for higher tier would have misrepresented their ability.\u0027           The move comes amid a row over grade boundaries being set low in the new reformed exams, with some critics warning it is a continuation of a \u0027prizes for all\u0027 culture"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/21/01/4F3E77C100000578-6080893-image-a-13_1534810933407.jpg","title":"Get Knitted Artist creates lifelike sculptures people recreates scenes using just just wool","story":"Seeing double: The artist creates life-like life-sized replicas of people from wool           Double take: Liisa exhibits her art in everyday settings such as cafes, causing people to look twice          Liisa Hietanen, 36, from Hämeenkyrö, Finland pictures knitting in a cafe.

Her case in many ways mirrors the larger conflict in Egypt. The country has been polarized since a popular uprising in 2011 toppled autocrat Hosni Mubarak, ushering in a period of political domination by the Muslim Brotherhood, which won a series of elections - including the presidency.Cairo looks to curb street sheep slaughter for Eid holidayEgyptian accused of hijacking plane extradited from CyprusIn Pictures: Muslims across the world mark Eid-al-Adha...Share this articleThe generals ousted Islamist President Mohammed Morsi in 2013 after massive protests over his isive rule and cracked down against the Brotherhood, outlawing it as a terrorist group. Under President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, the military-backed government has little or no tolerance for political Islam.It is against this backdrop that the status of women is among the most debated aspects of Islam in Egypt, with the question of how they appear in public getting special attention.Shiha, often cast in dreamy, romantic roles, sought to distance herself from the often- acrimonious argument over her decision to take off the hijab and seek a more secular lifestyle.\u0027I never meant to insult or offend anyone,\u0027 she told The Associated Press in a telephone interview. \u0027Just because I took off my hijab, doesn\u0027t mean I am against it. Not at all.\u0027  Back in the days: A photo of Ms Shiha from 2004 shows her at the height of her acting career\u0027At the end, this is a personal decision and it\u0027s my choice. I am an actress and I don\u0027t want to be dragged into any political conflicts,\u0027 she said. She cited \u0027personal reasons\u0027 for her decisions - both to quit acting the first time and to resume her career - and didn\u0027t elaborate on what was behind them.But a recent video posted on Instagram may have made things worse for the Islamists. It showed her flashing a broad smile and telling a hairdresser at a salon: \u0027I came here to change my hair color a bit. I hope it turns out well. I am sure it will be surprising.\u0027According to her father and sister, she only recently opened an Instagram account, with about 149,000 followers. In none of her photos is she wearing a hijab.Since her decision, Islamists have been saying she has disappointed women and girls who had looked to her as a role model.\u0027There were many girls that trusted her as a virtuous sister,\u0027 ultraconservative preacher Sameh Abdel-Hameed told a private TV talk show. \u0027But now she failed a large audience of young girls who followed her.\u0027Other Islamists appeared incredulous over her decision. But Shiha told the AP that she had no links to Islamist groups while she embraced a religious lifestyle.Khadija Khairat el-Shatter, daughter of a jailed Muslim Brotherhood leader, wrote a long post on Facebook urging Shiha - \u0027my soul twin\u0027 - to prove everyone wrong and appear in public wearing the veil again.  Starting over: Ms Shiha is now hoping to relaunch her acting career in Egypt\u0027Today, the rumors that you took off your hijab had slaughtered me with a blunt knife,\u0027 she wrote.Mohammed el-Sawy, another ultraconservative, or Salafist, preacher, posted a video of himself in tears. In a quavering voice, he implored Shiha to repent. He also sought to belittle her decision, labeling it a \u0027relapse\u0027 and blaming it on \u0027worldly temptations.\u0027In contrast, prominent film critic Tarek al-Shennawy commended her for showing courage in the face of what he described as a \u0027difficult society.\u0027One recently rekindled debate is whether wearing the hijab or the niqab is a religious duty or simply an option. Another is whether Islam\u0027s strict dress code for women shields them from being objectified by men in a country where sexual harassment on the street is widespread.Those who oppose the hijab maintain that Egyptian women are sexually harassed whether they are in tight jeans, a miniskirt or a niqab. Others say that peer pressure plays a role, with young women wearing the hijab to win acceptance in their communities while adopting nothing else from Islam\u0027s prescribed modesty.\u0027There has long been a conflict between liberals and Islamists with the status of women always the battlefield,\u0027 said political analyst Saeed Sadeq. \u0027It is often a question of veil or no veil.\u0027Shiha remains unmoved by how her personal decision not to wear a hijab has turned into a national debate with political undertones.\u0027I am just at a different phase in my life now,\u0027 she told the AP. \u0027And I am happy that I am going back to acting.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/21/08/4F431EAF00000578-6081701-image-a-9_1534838011442.jpg","title":"Youngest face transplant Katie Stubblefield Good Morning Britain","story":"    Katie Stubblefield, from Cleveland, USA, attempted to end her life with her brother\u0027s hunting rifle at the age of 18.

In a two-bed, four-person home there is no space to be on your own except in the lavatory.

He studied photography at Ealing Technical College before becoming a freelance photographer for black British newspapers like West Indian World          Untitled, from the series The Black House, 1973-1976, by Colin Jones. Jones photographed these men as part of a project on the Harambee project in Islington. The housing project for young black people was located in north London, on the Holloway Road. Many of the young men who lived in the house were said to be fascinated by the Black Power movement, with Jones trying to create intimate portraits of the iniduals          Untitled, from the series The Black House, 1973-1976, by Colin Jones. Jones was commissioned in 1973 by the Sunday Times  to produce illustrations for an article by the journalist Peter Gillman on the Harambee project in Islington, titled ‘On the Edge of the Ghetto.’ The hostel was a government-funded housing project which aimed to provide support for disillusioned black adolescents who experienced prejudice, unemployment and problems with the law          Young Gun, Hackney, London, 1969, by Dennis Morris.  This striking image was taken by the Jamacan-born photographer when he was just nine years old. He learnt about photography in North London at a club run by Donald Paterson, a wealthy and philanthropic man, and most of the people who appear in his pictures came from the same area.  Morris is also known for his music photography including pictures taken of the Sex Pistols          Fashion Shoot, Brixton Market, London, 1973, by Armet Francis. Armet Francis was born in Jamaica in 1945 and was ten years old when he left for Britain. After leaving school at 14 he started to work as a freelance fashion and advertising photographer at the height of the swinging 60s, and towards the end of the decade he started to chronicle London’s black communities          Carnival Sound System, London, by Armet Francis. Francis was interested in representations of the black Diaspora on a global scale, and returned to Jamaica in 1969 to start a cross-cultural project entitled The Black Triangle, photographing black communities in Britain, Africa, and the Caribbean. His work is shown at the Tate, Museum of London and Victoria \u0026amp Albert Museum          Untitled, from the series The Black House, 1973-1976, by Colin Jones. In the early 1970s the name ‘Black House’ became associated in the public consciousness as the lair of infamous con artist and murderer Michael de Freitas (also known as ‘Michael X’). Though not connected to de Freitas’ former home, the Harambee project was located less than a mile from it          Untitled, from the series The Black House, 1973-1976, by Colin Jones. Colin Jones, who was born in London in 1936, followed an unorthodox trajectory to become one of the most celebrated photographers of post-war Britain. He spent his childhood in the working class areas of East London while dancing for the English National Ballet. Jones bought his first camera running an errand for ballerina Dame Margot Fonteyn in Japan          Untitled, East End, London, 1970s, by Tex Ajetunmobi. Bandele Ajetunmobi – known as ‘Tex’ –was  born in Nigeria in 1921. In 1947, at the age of twenty-six, he stowed away on a boat from Nigeria where he was an outcast on account of  having polio as a child.

Today, she struggles to make ends meet.To help pay her way she spends almost every waking hour using scrap paper to hand-make table decorations for Greek weddings. The burden of work means that she is only able to visit her ageing parents, some four hours travel time from Athens, two or three times a year.A hospital doctor among our acquaintances has seen his monthly pay cut to €1,200 (£1,071). It is only his social conscience and love of his country that has kept him in Athens.          The country’s once elegant capital has become one of the most depressing and untidiest cities in Western Europe Some 70,000 highly skilled professionals including doctors, dentists and pharmacists have left the country as part of a broader Grexodus of 500,000 people.The best way for any country to emerge from financial crisis is to increase its national income so that tax revenues rise and global debts can be paid off. But during the last eight years, Greece has moved in precisely the opposite direction. National output has slumped by an astonishing 25 per cent. The result is adult unemployment of 20 per cent. Even more shocking and socially disruptive, some 40 per cent of 18 to 25-year olds are out of work.Without any income for the young, it is now commonplace for three generations of the same family to be forced to live cheek by jowl in the same crowded apartment. The fact is that the austerity imposed by the eurocrats has ruined Greece and done nothing to relieve it of its monstrous level of debt.It has snuffed out entrepreneurship, as well as created a poisonous political legacy where a far-Left Marxist party headed by Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras rules with the support of fanatical politicians on the populist Right.The end of the EU’s bailout programme may technically mean that Greece can return to the international markets to borrow again, but any notion that the world’s commercial bankers and financiers will be queuing at Athens’ overcrowded and dilapidated airport to lend – and pour good money after bad – is a fantasy.          Shops on boulevards are shuttered and cranes stand idle over the shells of unfinished buildings (pictured, Greek riot police dodge a petrol bomb thrown by protesters during clash  over tax reforms in 2016) After all, the country is still sitting on a debt pile of €289billion (£258billion) which the International Monetary Fund puts at 191 per cent, or almost twice the nation’s total annual output.To place that in context, it is more than two times the ratio of Britain’s national debt to output, which after a decade of UK cuts to public services and surging tax incomes as the economy has grown is now, thankfully, on a downward path.Not only that, Greece’s stricken financial system is currently being kept afloat by short-term cash assistance of some €40billion (£35.6billion) per month from the Frankfurt-based European Central Bank. Without this help, which is akin to that provided by the Bank of England to the British banks at the height of the financial crisis a decade ago, the four biggest Greek lenders would be effectively bankrupt.Together the bad loans on the books of these banks – Piraeus, Alpha, Euro Bank and National Bank of Greece – amount to €101billion (£90billion) or 50 per cent of the total, the highest level of any country in the European Union. Indeed the banks, the lifeblood of any Western economy, are so indebted they cannot lend any more.Which means the small and medium-sized enterprises that are the country’s business bedrock cannot get the finance they need to carry on and invest. Nor do ordinary consumers find it possible to obtain credit.This desolate financial scenario is a direct result of the austerity conditions demanded by Brussels eurocrats and German central bankers.Over the last eight years successive Greek governments have been forced to attend no fewer than 95 meetings at which the most stringent measures have been imposed on them.The results for the Greek people have been nothing short of catastrophic.Yet in their determination to preserve the greater political project of the eurozone and the EU, and to keep Greece as their client state, Brussels and German politicians have been utterly ruthless.In spite of personal appeals from the International Monetary Fund’s euro-supporting managing director Christine Lagarde to forgive Greece its debt burden and allow the country to be given a fresh start, the eurofanatics have been unrelenting in their determination to keep the debt anvil hanging around its neck.Greece is in an armlock it cannot escape because of a combination of its debt burden and the fact that its membership of the eurozone means it can no longer devalue its currency. And the EU and Germans are determined to keep it that way to save their precious euro.So despite the joyous news bulletins about the bailout yesterday morning, be in no doubt that this Greek tragedy is very far from over."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/21/01/4F3D423600000578-6080947-image-a-19_1534812431813.jpg","title":"Get Knitted Artist creates lifelike sculptures people recreates scenes using just just wool","story":"Seeing double: The artist creates life-like life-sized replicas of people from wool           Double take: Liisa exhibits her art in everyday settings such as cafes, causing people to look twice          Liisa Hietanen, 36, from Hämeenkyrö, Finland pictures knitting in a cafe.

However, the figures showed strong seasonal inflows of income tax receipts.The government has committed to find ways to finance a £20bn-a-year injection of extra cash into the NHS by 2023-24, with taxpayers expected to face increases when the chancellor delivers his budget. But despite the latest improvement in the public finances, which could help minimise the tax increases, Hammond has committed to delivering a zero annual deficit by the middle of the next decade.The latest figures from the ONS showed total borrowing for the financial year so far, beginning in April, was the lowest for 16 years. The government deficit stood at £12.8bn, which is £8.5bn less than in the same period a year ago.Ruth Gregory, a senior economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said that if the reduction in borrowing was sustained throughout this year, the deficit would undershoot the target set by the Office for Budget Responsibility by about £13bn.“As things stand, the chancellor should have some extra money to play with in the autumn budget ... He should be able to deliver the extra funds for the NHS without compromising his fiscal target or having to find savings elsewhere,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbc83018be130f6aeaf3813a00461e22a4b860aa/0_65_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12ca29dfe9dc96df8f874a311dc5fe74","title":"turbo island is a space left over after planning and bristolians want it back gentrification","story":"Rapid development has transformed the Stokes Croft area, but amid flats and trendy bars is a scrubby plot of land the community is fighting to reclaimIt is Monday morning and commuters are walking through the fast-gentrifying Stokes Croft area of Bristol on their way to work. Not far from the city centre they pass a sorry-looking patch of land, its fire-scorched earth strewn with empty spirit bottles and cans of strong cider, discarded clothing and used drug baggies.The scene is similar to what you might find under a highway overpass on the outskirts of town, but Turbo Island isn’t tucked away – it’s wedged between the A38 and the B4051, smack in the centre of one of the busiest parts of the city. You might expect passersby to stop and wonder what happened there over the weekend, but they don’t. It’s like this every day.In a part of Bristol that is being rapidly redeveloped against the wishes of some locals, this scrap of abandoned land is a complex example of clashing public and private interests. It’s a story that involves air raids, sell-offs, squatters, gentrification, activism and dereliction. At the heart of it all is an important question: if private owners allow land bought from the council to fall into ruin, does the community have the right to step in and fix it?The Stokes Croft area was bombed heavily during the second world war. The patch of land now known as Turbo Island used to be the site of a shoe shop, until it was destroyed one night in 1940.After the bombing, the council decided that a new building in that location would obstruct drivers’ views of other vehicles as they approached the Jamaica Street-Stokes Croft junction. So the stretch of land became what is known in town planning circles as a “sloap” – space left over after planning.It was an area with no immediate use and little scope for development. In the 1950s, an advertising hoarding was installed. In 1985, five years after Stokes Croft was declared a conservation area, the council sold the plot to Insite Poster Properties. The scrap of land below the billboard was of no interest to the company and fell into ruin.The billboard is a hot topic for the community. Local grassroots art cooperative, the People’s Republic of Stokes Croft (PRSC) – which is responsible for the conservation of a lot of the street art and, as a result, much of the area’s cultural capital – launched a failed campaign in 2008 to buy Turbo Island on behalf of the community.But over the years, the PRSC and its associates have redecorated Turbo Island, creating murals and holding events such as art classes for the street drinkers who gather there, or helping to conduct an archaeological dig on the site.“In a perfect world,” says Chris Chalkley, chairman of the PRSC, “we, the community, would buy it back. It could be under the Land Trust so that it could become a communal area. And the corporate advertising space, particularly in Stokes Croft, could be used for the arts and become part of the draw to the area.”There are a number of theories for how the plot of land got its name. One local suggested it was after the uppers that got bought, sold and consumed there. Chalkley gives perhaps the most credible explanation – that Turbo Island was named after a bygone brand of cider, Turbo, which was a hit with street drinkers in the 1980s.One thing for sure is that the name has stuck – it is even on Google Maps. And Turbo Island remains close to the community’s heart – there used to be a sign there that read: “Turbo Island, the heart of Stokes Croft.” There’s also a collection of prints and T-shirts by a local illustrator named after it. It says something about the resolutely contrarian vibe of this part of the city that an area best known for all-hours public drinking isn’t a gripe, but a treasured landmark.Perhaps the most remarkable thing about Turbo Island is that it still exists. After the war, a lack of investment in the area kept property prices low, attracting a mix of artists, bohemians, squatters, punks and other creatives. It’s a familiar prelude to a story of gentrification that plays out in cities across Britain and the rest of the world.The change has been stark. The graffiti remains, as do some of the clubs and bars that provide the late-night rowdiness the area is known for. By day, though, the vibe is increasingly urbane.Stand on Turbo Island and to the west you see Poco, “a global tapas bar”. To the east you have Hamilton House, a community hub that earlier this year evicted a third of its tenants ahead of a planned redevelopment into flats. To the north are the long-abandoned Carriageworks – a Grade II-listed factory once described as a masterpiece of Victorian commercial architecture – which has been derelict for 31 years and is slated for a £20m redevelopment into luxury flats. Beyond that is Bishopston, home of Gloucester Road, which was named by the Times as one of the best places to live in the UK in 2018.Asked what he thinks of the changes, Chalkley pauses. “That’s quite complex,” he says. “Stokes Croft has been an extraordinary place for a long time. It was very down at heel. Most of the positive change was through direct affirmative action from local artists and community groups … but all of the extraordinary artwork and cool activity that has taken place here has benefited the landlords. There is no way of harvesting that back for the people who have been instrumental in making this place a success.”Far from being recompensed, local artists are now likely to be pushed out. Earlier this year, a group of artists whose studios used to be in Hamilton House created a public project to highlight the exodus of artists from the area – 1,000 bright orange figurines streamed out of the doors and into the street. They appeared in groups, lining the pavements and window ledges, heading out of Stokes Croft in the direction of the city centre. “Artists are leaving the neighbourhood,” Alice Tatton-Brown, one of the artists behind the project, told the Bristol Post. “People here have been silently leaving since last June – and not just leaving the building, leaving Bristol … They can’t deal with the precariousness of the situation.”The community and the council have been at odds for a number of years. In 2011, tensions ignited following the opening of a Tesco and the raiding of a well-known local squat, Telepathic Heights. The Stokes Croft riots made national news but did little to slow the process of gentrification. The squat closed, the Tesco remained.In 2016, Bristol’s longest-running squat, The Magpie, a two-minute walk from Turbo Island, was shut down. The vacant plot of land was sold to Australian businessman Jonathan Dalton for £300,000, who said he planned to lease the building to two local businesses, a bakery and a farm shop. “This is not gentrification,” he told local magazine Bristol247. “Somebody has to get things moving.”Things are certainly moving. What makes Turbo Island remarkable is that it seems to be going in the opposite direction.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d1a793aeb66e912d8cd7cf0f984014ad4a304c6/0_147_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf378aaffa0b25cc2ed3f195fe58b0e0","title":"greece europe eu austerity","story":"Even without its lending arrangements in place, Greece is not totally free from the creditors – a series of audits will ensure that the continuing reforms will go ahead to ensure a “healthy” economy.For those who supported the anti-austerity Syriza government during negotiations with the EU, the signing of the third memorandum on 12 July 2015 to guarantee continued financial support, was a moment of moral and political shock that went beyond the effects of the financial crisis. It was the point that Greece and the rest of the world realised that our European partners had no intention of breaking with the imposed austerity policies, despite the huge cost in human lives. It also showed that they would not cease demanding neoliberal structural adjustments – including privatisations of national assets – that had never previously been imposed on European countries. It was the moment when the “patient” realised that the “doctor” had forgotten their medical oath: in this case, to act in the interest of the people of Europe rather than in the interest of a flawed economic system.So, the Greek patient cannot really celebrate the all clear just yet.But what have we learned from this ordeal? What can Greece and even the EU expect in the future?The end of the bailout may allow the Syriza government more room for manoeuvre. First, it seems that in the immediate future, the current budget surpluses may allow the distribution of some idend to the most vulnerable people. Second, the government could potentially cut down on taxation while increasing social spending. Finally, there could be a further negotiation with the auditors, which, if successful, could stop the scheduled cuts in pensions in 2019.What is less certain, however, is whether the EU has learned anything from the past eight years. A year ago, the European commissioner for economic affairs, Pierre Moscovici, admitted that the decisions made behind closed doors regarding the Greek bailout were a scandal of democratic process.The lack of transparency and the imposition of austerity as the only solution for the southern European countries hit by the financial crisis since 2008, at a time when other countries like Germany continued to prosper, has cast doubts on the entire European project. Ever since then, Euroscepticism has been spreading and can be seen as a contributing factor behind Brexit and the rapid ascendency to power of a number of nationalistic, xenophobic far-right parties across the continent.For those of us who still believe in a social Europe, the real patient is the EU and the eurozone – a new treatment is urgently needed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b36536df3953b767ab42780f10333b03d62e47d/0_20_960_576/master/960.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6eec154b6612b1becaadd3ec07c5f0b","title":"rose of tralee beauty pageant irish women ireland","story":"The Rose of Tralee was always a grim prospect. Growing up in County Cork in the 1980s, surer than blackberries and hay bales, the annual pageant signified the end of the summer: back-to-school was surely around the corner. We would huddle around the telly watching this “celebration” of Irish roots and female comeliness, brought to us by the only channel we had, RTÉ.The national broadcaster had us exactly where it wanted us. And where it wanted us, it seemed, was in the 1950s. The Rose of Tralee contest is a festival of wholesomeness, the competitive search for a woman as “lovely and fair” as Mary, the woman in the song from which it takes its title. This week, just as they have done every August since 1959, young women of Irish ancestry from all around the world line up on a stage to proclaim just how Irish they are, how pure, in dresses at which even the most loyal of bridesmaids would turn up her nose and say, “No. It’s just too pouffy.” There is no swimsuit section, but a lot of terrible poems are read.The pagaent, which is still screened live by the national broadcaster, was anachronistic even in my 1980s schooldays. Inconvenient women were still being shut away in Magdalene laundries (the last closed in 1996) and the amendment banning abortion had just been inserted into the Irish constitution. Yet even then, the Rose’s whitewashed version of womanhood seemed of another time. Ireland was changing. Quietly pushing back against the constraints of the Catholic church, demanding contraception and orce, Irish women were tough – fighters who were dragging Ireland into a more modern age despite systemic shame and stigma.But none of that was in evidence from the festival dome in Tralee, County Kerry, where women who must have been getting it on with their tuxedoed male “escorts” had to pretend to giggle when the host would look knowingly to camera as he bent to remove their strappy stilettoes, the better for them to jig or reel about the stage for the obligatory turn. “Ankles!” his face seemed to say. A capable lawyer from Boston would then have to dutifully blush. Her fourth-gen Irish parents were in the audience, after all. Competitors who ran farms, who could deliver a calf with their bare hands, would join in on this outdated non-joke. The whole spectacle was cosy and non-threatening and an utter lie.But there were blips jarring moments when roses (as the contestants are known) did not comply, which became national scandals. Actually, they didn’t, neatly illustrating how out of touch the competition has become. When Maria Walsh from Philadelphia revealed she was gay after her 2014 win, much of the country cheered: it was just a year before Ireland overwhelmingly voted for marriage equality. If the Rose of Tralee wasn’t ready, we the voters certainly were. And when, in 2016, Sydney entrant Brianna Parkins advocated the repeal of the constitutional ban on abortion from the stage, the organisers almost fainted: the festival was no place for politics, they said. But it turns out that Ireland was ready for that, too, as evidenced by this year’s landslide referendum to update our abortion laws.Of course, there are bigger fish to fry: an out of control housing crisis, Ireland’s shocking treatment of asylum seekers, the pope’s upcoming visit after decades of church cover-ups of sexual abuse.But in the era of #MeToo and standing up to sexism, should Irish feminism have this throwback (which has taken until 2018 to let a single mother get to the final) in its sights? There’s a line in the original Rose of Tralee song that is its real point: it speaks of “the truth in her eyes ever dawning, that made me love Mary, the Rose of Tralee”.If people want a fantasy Ireland that never really existed, let them have their Rosy fun. But truth is what the rest of us are after.• Tara Flynn is a comedian and the author of Rage-In: Trolls and Tribulations of Modern Life"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ffdd0ec9a77e404fa79be98c39713e19c4428c9/0_6_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5856535534c6994dcc0f9f54511afe7","title":"best standup comedy richard pryor tig notaro hannah gadsby","story":"With the Edinburgh fringe in full flow, here are the five standup sets that catapulted their creators to fameThese days, as BBC comedy controller Shane Allen recently confirmed, “Oxbridge white blokes” are out of comedy fashion. Time was they were the cutting edge, as when Messrs Cook, Miller, Moore and Bennett were cherrypicked to create Beyond the Fringe. A modest success at the Edinburgh festival in August 1960, it then made a huge splash in the West End. Here, as never before, the sacred cows of postwar Britain (the political class the royal family the military) were led to the satirical slaughter. Kenneth Tynan’s Observer review set the agenda: this was “the moment,” he wrote, “when English comedy took its first decisive step into the second half of the 20th century.” By design or otherwise, Beyond the Fringe punched a hole through English deference and launched the 60s satire boom. Without it, would we ever have had the Establishment Club and TW3, Monty Python and Private Eye?How much game-changing do you want from one performance? Before Pryor’s Long Beach, California show in December 1978, no standup gig had ever been given a cinema release. Before Pryor became comedy’s most fearless truth-teller, mainstream US comedy remained largely the preserve of your Bill Cosbys and Bob Hopes – aspirational types loathe to affront middle-class morality. That had started to change a decade earlier, when Pryor walked offstage mid-show in Vegas, muttering to himself: “What the fuck am I doing here?” But the deal was sealed by Live in Concert, a excoriating set in which race, his bleak childhood, his arrest for shooting up his wife’s friends’ car and his recent heart attack were all fair game. This was the set that popularised standup on-screen and shifted the goalposts for how uncompromising comedy could be. In the words of Pryor’s most direct inheritor, Chris Rock: “Every comedian will tell you that it is, by far, the greatest piece of standup ever done.”May 1979, and a new comedy venue opens above a Soho strip club. An advert is placed in Private Eye for wannabe comics. Among the applicants is former art student and part-time drama teacher Alexei Sayle, who – after performing his “thug who got into violent philosophical disputes in a cake shop” routine at audition – is recruited by founders Don Ward and Peter Rosengard to be the opening night MC. It was an evening that changed Sayle’s life for ever. “Truthfully nothing during that week was real,” Sayle wrote in his memoir, “until with a rushing sound I am standing on the tiny stage and there are 150 baying, drunken punters in front of me and I am yelling and swearing and sweating and then I’m bringing on the first act and everyone hates them … ” So, UK audiences were introduced to New Model Comedy: aggressive, freeform, wildly creative and hostile to the casual chauvinism that characterised much prior British humour. So too was space created onstage for Rik Mayall, French and Saunders and “alternative comedy”, as standup’s punk generation emerged yelling and screaming and sweating into life.Summer 2012 was a tough one for comedian Tig Notaro. She caught pneumonia. Her beloved mother died. Her relationship ended. And then, four days before she was due to perform at the Largo in Los Angeles, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. What happened next is the stuff of comedy legend. Aware this might be her last ever gig, Notaro shelved her planned set and greeted her audience with a surprise announcement. “Thank you, thank you, I have cancer, thank you, I have cancer, really, thank you.” There followed an extraordinary half-hour – one of “a handful of truly great, masterful standup sets” Louis CK had ever seen, tweeted the comic – in which Notaro extemporised cathartic, funny-sad and red-raw comedy for her astonished audience. While she wasn’t the first to address her cancer in comedy, it had never been done four days after diagnosis. Notaro raised the bar for how intimate standup could be, how entwined with life as it’s being lived. To this gig can be traced the many emotionally naked comedy shows we’ve seen since.It won the Barry award in Australia. It won the Edinburgh comedy award, and was the talking point of the 2017 festival. It sold out multiple London runs – and now it’s the buzziest Netflix comedy special for years. With her blistering anti-comedy show Nanette, Hannah Gadsby calls out comedy. The art form is lying to us, she says: simplifying the truth for easy laughs making things seem funny that aren’t. And encouraging the abused to participate in their own subjugation. The response has been overwhelming. Gadsby’s show has been hailed not only as comedy for the #MeToo generation, but as an end-of-the-road for the whole idea of “humour as truth-telling”. We elevated comedians once because they told us what we needed to hear. But at a time when a resurgent “alt-right” cloaks itself in irony, and when stellar comedians (Louis CK, Bill Cosby) stand revealed as liars and abusers, Gadsby demands we reconsider comedy’s supposed authority. It has been hailed as a game-changer, so now let’s see how the game will change …"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d63b8a7b8a2b7ba126ac9996d35255de87b223f4/0_0_5115_3069/master/5115.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6dad029c012ab3c3150e8520d5969435","title":"2018 bird photographer of the year in pictures","story":"Pedro Jarque Krebs from Peru scoops the top prize of £5,000 for his vibrant image of American Flamingos preening"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c4100a3c37723a7ecbe5128a6491d984f976114/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ffd61b69bd30e717b2c4d39dfab65ef","title":"style clash how matchy mismatchy became the new matchy matchy","story":"In 2018, it is far more fashionable to flout style rules than follow them. You know the rules we mean: don’t wear navy blue and black together never wear more than three colours at once, don’t wear black or white as a wedding guest, don’t wear cream and white, ever try to match your shoes to your handbag. In the past five years, we have had wilfully clashing colour-blocking. A fuchsia pink shirt and red trousers is now a classic colour combination for fashion editors, as acceptable as wearing black and white. We have had monotone dressing – the Kim Kardashian-approved way of wearing one very specific shade, typically matching your skintone, head-to-toe. Then there is no-holds-barred clashing, with four different prints in the same outfit on purpose. Best saved for days without a hangover, when you are hoping to be snapped by a street-style photographer, or at least post a particularly memorable selfie. But the newest take on no-rules dressing? That would be matchy-mismatchy.It might be a mouthful but the concept is quite simple. You’re grouping items in a similar print or colour and wearing them together, in a way that would really annoy pedantic colour theorists. Wear red but feel free to mix a tomato blouse with crimson trousers and wine-coloured trainers. Or try checks – a kilt worn with a lumberjack shirt, a Prince of Wales blazer over a gingham dress. Leopard – speeding ahead as the print of the year – is the kill-two-birds choice. Make like Beyoncé on her On the Run II tour, in various shades of leopard, or influencers such as Kat Farmer (@doesmybumlook40), who posted an image of herself in two different takes on leopard – one on a dress and another on her handbag.The matchy-mismatchy trend feels right for now – it is considered and curated enough to make its wearer look creative and playful, but has a devil-may-care nonchalance that is always going to score points on social media. Think of it as dressing for the multi-screen generation – it is a look that allows the wearer to do everything at the same time and use the term “disruptor” when referring to their outfit.Matchy-mismatchy has been growing as an idea for a while. It was on the spring catwalk in Phoebe Philo’s penultimate collection for Céline, where several shades of beige were spliced together, and at Maxmara for autumn, where multiple leopard print was worn by a Bardot-ish Gigi Hadid. It is on celebrities beyond Beyoncé including Cardi B, who went matchy-mismatchy with scarf prints earlier this year, and Millie Mackintosh, who very subtly broke all the rules by wearing ivory and white to her own wedding.But this is a trend that has really gained traction in street style images, and those posted on Instagram. Matchy-mismatchy was a consistent trend at both Oslo and Copenhagen fashion weeks earlier this month, and is worn by Farfetch’s Yasmin Sewell and Susie Lau from Stylebubble – women who are regularly snapped at the most high-fashion events wearing clothes that could, at least in part, feasibly translate to less glamorous occasions, such as shopping for dinner at Tesco on a Tuesday.Because, really, matchy-mismatchy is more wearable than you might think. Think of it a bit like a software update on your phone. It might take a bit of getting used to, but your eyes will adjust to the newness in no time. After all, with more and more of us wearing colour on a regular basis, you can shop your own wardrobe and make those pieces work harder. Spend an afternoon grouping your clothes into genres or themes. That canary yellow sweatshirt now works with a lemon-coloured skirt. Or a floral dress might be given new life paired with the hothouse flowered bomber jacket you had forgotten about.Of course, as with everything in fashion, there are rules to no-rules dressing – or let’s call them guidelines. If you are doing matchy-mismatchy with clothes and bag, shoes might be a stretch. Also, it is probably best to keep makeup to a minimum (after you have taken your selfie). And – this is a big one – remember to be nice. Matchy-mismatchy is a conversational trend if ever there was one. When you are breaking the rules with what you wear, people will want to want to know why."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1a1c124d2fbb7ed6e352ae0062d0131439ed67d/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3a2ed157681c360bbd736dd2c0f7bdb","title":"totes chic eight of the best second bags to buy now","story":"The tote has graduated from afterthought to considered outfit addition. From groceries to gym kits, choose a style that will keep you organised in styleIt used to be called the “overspill” bag.

The catwalk has taken note, with Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana, Balenciaga and Gucci all putting shopper-style bags on their recent runways on the high street there are options everywhere from Zara to Cos. This new breed is designed to be worn proudly on your shoulder, not screwed up at the bottom of your handbag for “just in case” moments. It should be big enough to fit at least one basket full of shopping, which doesn’t lend itself to finding your front door keys in a hurry, hence why some call it a “second bag” (you’ll need a smaller bag for your valuables, too). Given that we are collectively ditching single-use plastic, it stands to reason that the Tote 2.0 has become a style statement of its own.

Place 400g of small peppers, 250g of cherry tomatoes and 400g of small aubergines in a roasting tin. Tuck 6 fat garlic cloves, still in their skins, and 3 large sprigs of rosemary among the vegetables, then spoon over 5 tbsp of olive oil. Let the vegetables roast in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes, until they are approaching softness, then push them to one side of the tin and tip a 650g jar (or 2 x 400g cans) of butter beans into the tin. Stir the beans to coat them in oil and roasting juices, then return to the oven and cook for a further 20 minutes until all is soft and golden.Remove the garlic from the roasting tin and squeeze each clove from its skin into the bowl of a food processor. Tip in the warm beans and process to a thick, fluffy purée. Check the seasoning then pile the purée on to a serving plate and place the vegetables on top. Spoon over any juices.If you can track down the large, flat Judion beans in jars then I recommend them for this. They are particularly soft and buttery, and produce a cloud-like mash. Canned butter beans work well enough, are cheap as chips and easier to locate. You may like to add a thick slice of butter as you mash them. The vegetables can be roasted ahead of time and served warm or even cold, but the beans must be mashed while they are still warm, if you are to achieve a smooth finish.Once the weather cools and summer slides towards autumn, you could roast slices of orange-fleshed squash instead of the aubergines, or use parsnips in place of the butter beans. The real point of the dish is the sweet, herb-infused roasting juices trickling into the cloud of mash."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd96cea90f6ae6f65069a173d231e3c6f00b88a9/0_172_3640_2184/master/3640.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fac81545ae377a6cb41669bdbad3d93a","title":"england steph houghton world cup qualifier wales kazakhstan","story":"The England captain, Steph Houghton, has recovered from knee surgery in time to return to Phil Neville’s squad for the vital World Cup qualifiers away to Wales and Kazakhstan.Neville has opted to rely on experience as his side head for Newport’s Rodney Parade on Friday week, when a Wales win would mean Jayne Ludlow’s predominantly part-time side have qualified for next summer’s finals in France.That would leave England hoping to enter the play-offs as one of the best four of the seven group runners-up. Such a scenario could well entail Neville’s players finding themselves facing a semi-final and final against some formidable opponents potentially including Germany, Denmark and Norway for the one remaining European place at France 2019.The Lionesses are currently a point behind Wales but have a game in hand on Ludlow’s team.While victory in front of an expected record Welsh crowd at Newport will guarantee Neville’s players automatic qualification, a draw offers them the opportunity to end up topping the group courtesy of a victory in Kazakhstan on Tuesday 4 September.Houghton’s return means that Demi Stokes, England’s first choice, but currently injured, left-back is the only key omission. She could be replaced by Manchester United’s Alex Greenwood, who is included despite her decision to drop into the second tier of England’s domestic game and leave Liverpool for Casey Stoney’s newly formed Championship side.Siobhan Chamberlain, the Manchester United goalkeeper, misses out though, with her place in the squad going to the Wolfsburg keeper Mary Earps. Everton’s Gabby George is the only player in the 23-strong squad still to win a senior cap.Wales have still to concede a goal during World Cup qualifying and to Neville’s considerable dismay, held England to a draw at Southampton this year. “We are looking forward to the Wales game and know we have to be ready for the challenge,” said England’s coach. “They will be determined to make the most of home advantage and their crowd will be expecting a victory.“Wales are top of the group and deserve total respect. We will have to be at our very best to get the result we need and no one in our squad is looking beyond this match. I know my players are up for it and will be fully focused on the job they have to do.”The forthcoming qualifiers will be the first involving Neville’s re-vamped backroom staff featuring Bev Priestman as his new No 2.

Pogba is the captain.In two tweets on Tuesday morning Raiola responded: “Some people need to talk for fear of being forgotten. Paul Scholes wouldn’t recognize a leader if he was in front of Sir Winston Churchill. Paul Scholes should become sports director and advise Woodward to sell Pogba. Would be sleepless nights to find Pogba a new club.”Pogba is known to be unhappy at United and favours a move to Barcelona before the Spanish window closes at the end of the month, so Raiola’s last comment may be a reference to this.Gary Neville, a former team-mate of Scholes, verbally attacked Woodward for failing to give José Mourinho carte blanche in the summer transfer window. Woodward refused to sign off the manager’s wish to purchase a top-class centre-back, with Leicester’s Harry Maguire, Jérôme Boateng of Bayern Munich and Atlético Madrid’s Diego Godín among the manager’s targets.“He is in his third season and I think he will feel extremely disappointed that he wasn’t supported in the transfer market,” Neville said on Sky Sports. “You can’t leave a house three-quarters built.

It follows the successful roll-out of streaming services for international fans in 2017-18. The new era begins on Tuesday night, featuring 24 of the 26 matches taking place across the three isions, and to sign up you just need to click here.Sounds too good to be true! What do I have to pay?Inidual match passes cost £10 – or less than half the cost of a typical matchday ticket.Does this apply to any EFL fixture, then?Not quite. To start with, a number of clubs have not opted in to iFollow. Accrington Stanley, Aston Villa, Birmingham City, Bristol City, Charlton Athletic, Derby County, Hull City, Forest Green Rovers, Middlesbrough, Queens Park Rangers, Stoke City, Swansea City or Sunderland are the outliers although they are still allowed to stream games via their own websites and digital services. QPR and Bristol City will do exactly that tonight.What about Saturday 3pm kick-offs? Surely they’re still sacrosanct?That remains the case. The hours of 2.45pm to 5.15pm on a Saturday remain a no-go zone for televised broadcasts in the UK and there is no appetite among the authorities for that to change at any time soon – although evidence gleaned elsewhere suggests storm clouds may be gathering. So, for the foreseeable future, your best bets are midweek games and weekend fixtures shown at lunchtime or teatime. As long as it’s not a featured game on one of Sky’s flagship channels, iFollow should have it. Funny you mentioned Sky – doesn’t it have something new up its sleeve too?It has a new offering specifically for Championship fans – and that also begins on Tuesday night. While one of its main channels shows Swansea v Leeds, the evening’s other three fixtures (QPR v Bristol City, Derby v Ipswich and Rotherham v Hull) can be watched via the red button. A similar setup will apply on Wednesday, when Aston Villa v Brentford is shown on Sky Sports Football and five other games can be access using the red button. This will remain the case during all midweek rounds.Are there any discernible differences between the iFollow and Sky services?iFollow proudly claims to have four cameras in situ, whereas the red button games have one. Otherwise, it just depends on how you cost it: if you have Sky’s sport channels, you don’t need to pay anything extra. Just be mindful that the red button is not available if you are watching online via Sky Go.This extra access is all well and good – but isn’t there an obvious danger that fans will be deterred from attending games? Who’d travel to watch Exeter at Cambridge on a Tuesday when they can watch at home with a beer?Nobody can really assess the new service’s impact until it has had time. The EFL treats iFollow as an alternative to matchgoing rather than a replacement, and maintains that the best experiences are to be had when watching in the flesh. If crowds, particularly away attendances, began to drop in the long run then presumably a conversation would need to be had.That bridge would need crossing. The NFL used to run home-city – or local market – blackouts if a certain number of tickets had not been sold before a game. Could something like that really be workable now, though?Finally, what about the financial impact on my club?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b905c8a1cad922ec794a1fd7690dc481dcbacae2/1073_1929_917_550/master/917.jpg?w=1200\u0026amp;h=630\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026amp;bm=normal\u0026amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly9hc3NldHMuZ3VpbS5jby51ay9pbWFnZXMvb3ZlcmxheXMvZDM1ODZhNWVmNTc4MTc1NmQyMWEzYjYzNWU1MTcxNDEvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026amp;s=c6999a4147d43918d45a6d73a014210c","title":"becoming mother in 50s number births soaring","story":"The number of births to women aged over 50 is soaring. But what’s the real story behind the rise? Three mothers talk about the joy of finally having a baby long after it would once have been possibleTo celebrate reaching half a century, Gemma Barnes wrote a list of the 50 things she hoped to achieve. Topping it was an ambition that a few years ago would have seemed absurd: she wanted to have a baby. But two years on, Barnes is cuddling her eight-month-old daughter, and while that means most of the other 49 ambitions will have to wait, she is delighted to be a mother.Barnes’s situation is unusual, but she is certainly not alone. In June data published by the Office for National Statistics showed the number of births to 50-plus women has quadrupled over the last two decades, up from 55 in 2001 to 238 in 2016. During that period there were 1,859 births in the UK to women over 50, and 153 to women over 55. Flying the flag for older motherhood have been a host of celebrities, most recently actor Brigitte Nielsen who was 54 when her fifth child, a daughter named Frida, arrived this summer. US singer Janet Jackson gave birth in January, aged 50, to son Eissa. Perhaps most visible of all has been US Senator Tammy Duckworth, an Iraq veteran who lost both legs when her helicopter was shot down in 2004. She gave birth earlier this year, also aged 50, and was photographed soon afterwards, protesting against Trump’s immigration policies while holding newborn Maile on her lap.At first, Barnes wasn’t sure whether she wanted to go down that route. “You want your baby to be yours. I was thinking, would she look like me? Would she have my nose? My hair colour? But the doctor started talking about how when you carry a baby you shape so much about his or her personality and behaviour during the pregnancy. I started to think that was right, and that carrying the child was very important.”Having made the decision to go ahead, there was an egg donor as well as a sperm donor to choose. “You do it all online and it seems a bit surreal, and yes, you do think you’re playing God. These two people will never meet, never know one another, and together their cells will create a baby – your baby. It felt a huge responsibility, especially as I was making decisions all on my own.”Philippa Hodgson, who is 58 and the mother of a four-year-old, was similarly unsure at first about whether to use an egg donor, but like Barnes went ahead when she realised it would give her the best chance of a baby. She had met her husband when she was 45 her daughter Roxanne was conceived using his sperm and a donor egg. “I was very shocked at first by the idea that we could use another woman’s egg,” she says. “I felt my child wouldn’t really be my own. But now she’s here I couldn’t love her more. Occasionally she does something that I don’t recognise as being connected to either my husband or myself and I think, how beautiful – that must be because of something in her genes from the donor.”Despite being reconciled to using a donated egg, though, neither Barnes nor Hodgson has told everyone in their lives about that element of their story, and nor has the third mother I spoke to, Carol, who is 61 and has children aged 13 and 10. (Barnes and Hodgson are pseudonyms Carol is happy to use her first name.) Carol’s feeling is that her decision to use an egg donor is not secret information, but it is private – and it would invade her children’s privacy to broadcast it to the world. All three women, incidentally, are entirely committed to telling their children how they were conceived. Hodgson says she talked to her little girl recently about it: “I told her that a kind lady gave me an egg because mummy couldn’t use her own eggs. And she replied, ‘You are my only mummy.’ I was gobsmacked.”All the same, some professionals working in the field of later-life pregnancy are concerned about what Nina Barnsley, director of the Donor Conception Network, which supports families with children born as a result of donated gametes, describes as a “fog” around the subject, because so few women feel able to be open about egg donation: “It’s still a taboo. Many older mothers feel they are up against it enough in terms of other people’s views, and being open about this would be something else to criticise them for.” Celebrities, meanwhile, are often coy about the precise details of how they conceived, giving rise to the misconception that young people can postpone pregnancy until their sixth decade. “As a society we need to have a proper conversation,” says Barnsley. “The technology means it’s possible to have babies until we’re 75 – but is that what we want?”Adam Balen, professor of reproductive medicine at Leeds University and fertility spokesperson for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, shares Barnsley’s concerns. “We’re not very good in the west at preventative medicine, and in the world of infertility we are treating lots of things that could have been prevented,” he says. If IVF has the reputation for being a panacea then that, he stresses, is misplaced. “IVF doesn’t work for everyone, and it’s not available on the NHS for everyone.” As well as being expensive (some of the women I spoke to have spent upwards of £20,000 on their quest for a baby, and anecdotally others have spent far more), late pregnancy carries risks, says Balen. Miscarriage and pre-eclampsia, in particular, are more likely and the use of donated gametes increases those risks. Stresses around assisted conception can also affect a relationship.Both Carol and Hodgson have been mistaken for their child’s grandmother but all three women say they look a lot younger than their years and that few other mothers seem to clock that there is anything unusual about their family. Perhaps, Barnes muses, it takes a woman who feels younger than she is to e into late motherhood.For Gemma, being older didn’t mean biting her nails with worry through the pregnancy. “Because the egg was from a younger donor, the risks aren’t so great. I felt fantastic throughout. I concentrated on staying calm, on connecting with the baby growing inside me.” Most older mothers are advised, as she was, to have a caesarean. “It was a very easy birth: it took 10 minutes to get her out, and half an hour to stitch me up. And of course meeting her was so wonderful – I’d waited a long time for that moment.”For Carol, though, pregnancy was a scary time. “I had miscarried in the past and knew I had a higher chance of miscarrying because of my age. I felt I had so much to lose – it was never going to be a question of ‘you can give it another shot’ the way it would be for a younger woman,” she says. She developed pre-eclampsia towards the end of her first pregnancy and both her babies were born by caesarean. Unlike Barnes, she found that a “very peculiar” experience. Once her babies had arrived, though, she loved the early weeks and months with them. “I felt I appreciated them in a way that you perhaps only do with something that hasn’t been easy,” she says. She struggles to think of any way being older has disadvantaged her children.“I know plenty of people much younger than me who don’t seem to have much energy,” she says. “I think I do as much with my children as the other mothers I know – I only recently stopped bouncing on the trampoline with them. I don’t feel significantly different from when I was younger.” And then, she says, there are the advantages. “I stopped working by the time I had children, so I’ve been able to put all my time and energy into their lives.” Barnes works part-time, but feels she is able to devote more of her time to her daughter Hannah (not her real name) than she could have done when she was younger. “I’m in a much better place now than I was 20 years ago,” she says. “I’m very settled in myself, very content. I’m fitter than I’ve ever been, I’ve got enough money to be comfortably off and to provide for her. Hannah is everything to me and I don’t have to prove myself.”Understandably, the women who are making it work want to concentrate on the positives they bat off any suggestions that there might be disadvantages. “I don’t feel different from anyone else at mother and baby groups because, quite simply, no one has any idea I’m older,” says Barnes. “Having a baby is a great leveller. When you’re mixing with other parents it’s all about them, how they’re sleeping and feeding and so on. No one asks you how old you are.” Carol is more selfconscious about her age, perhaps because she is now in her 60s and has a child still at primary school. “Telling people how old I am is always a bit scary: you think, will people see me in a different light? I’m very careful about who I share it with. I don’t mind telling friends who have got to know me, but people I don’t know are more likely to judge me in a negative way.”She has also found her own needs squeezed between those of her children and her parents. “I had a very difficult stage where every time the phone rang I didn’t know whether it would be someone calling from school to say my son needed me or someone calling to say one of my frail parents had fallen down the stairs.” And if her own parents have had their experience of grandparenting curtailed, she knows that is likely to be repeated. “Will I ever be a grandmother? I do wonder about that.” Meanwhile, she says, some of her friends are already grandparents. “It does seem a bit strange, that we’re the same age but in such different situations,” she says.Barnsley has some concerns about the trend. “Fiftysomething motherhood will only ever be a choice for the well-off,” she says. “And some women will spend a lot of money on something that doesn’t, in the end, work out. Imagine borrowing £50,000 and then being unsuccessful.” She also wonders where the child’s perspective is in the debate. “I’m thinking of 21-year-olds who instead of travelling the world will be looking after a parent with Alzheimer’s,” she says. “They run the risk of being out of sync with their peers, and that might not be easy.” (This is also, of course, the case for men who have children in their 50s and over, although that is less rarely raised as an issue.)Barnes believes later-life motherhood will become much more common and she welcomes it. “The only two disadvantages, as I see it, are genetics – ie your child doesn’t share your genes – and the risk of dying while your children are still young.” Like Hodgson, she found the genetic issues faded into the background once her baby appeared, although she does sometimes worry about Hannah’s medical history, and what she might not know about it. In the future, she thinks young women will be encouraged to freeze their eggs for later use, as is currently being debated but at present in the UK human eggs can usually only be frozen for a decade, and fertility specialists say eggs from a woman’s 20s and early 30s would give her the best chance of a child in her 50s. So for egg freezing to be useful, the law would have to change – and some fertility clinics would like to see that happen. Other countries have different guidelines and legislation around fertility, and some British women travel to Spain, Cyprus and India in the hope of making it easier for themselves.One thing everyone seems to be in agreement on is that it would be better for young people in particular, and the whole population in general, to know more about fertility. Hodgson wishes she had learned more about it at school. In his role as chair of the British Fertility Society, Balen has called for the curriculum to be widened to teach young people about how to achieve pregnancy, as well as how to avoid it. And yet, one major reason women are tending to leave pregnancy until their 30s is for economic reasons: most twentysomethings can barely afford to pay the rent, let alone provide for a family. Workplace pressures on thirtysomethings to get promoted and zip up the career ladder is another factor weighing against younger motherhood and however well-informed teenagers become about fertility, there is no guarantee they will meet the person they want to raise a child with before the age of 35.Kamal Ahuja, scientific director of the London Women’s Clinic, which treats women up to the age of 50 but makes occasional exceptions for over-50s, says that while any doctor would advise childbearing in a woman’s 20s or early 30s, the emotional, financial and social realities, added to the fact that human beings are living “stronger, longer and with greater ambitions” mean the trend is almost certainly set to grow. He predicts that medical advances will make it easier and cheaper in the years ahead.Gemma Barnes, meanwhile, hasn’t written her to-do list for her 52nd birthday, which is coming up later this year. But when I ask her what’s going on it she smiles broadly and says she is definitely not ruling out a brother or sister for Hannah."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2eeb694e6216fe1dc87ad71b154be3cc03642b73/0_138_3352_2010/master/3352.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47abc6b4280db0e7e7d4a354a352a6ac","title":"mtv vmas camila cabello wins big while madonna pays tribute to aretha franklin","story":"A muted ceremony saw the Havana singer win video and artist of the year while the late soul singer was remembered in a brief memorialThis year’s MTV Video Music Awards saw Camila Cabello taking home the night’s two biggest trophies for artist and video of the year for Havana, beating out Drake and Childish Gambino – though it was Madonna who generated headlines for what was seen by some as a misjudged tribute to Aretha Franklin.Given the short period of time since Aretha Franklin’s death last week, the ceremony didn’t include a much-expected musical homage but instead, Madonna came onstage to share a story about how singing You Make Me Feel (Like a Natural Woman) at an audition changed her life. “She led me to where I am today and I know she influenced so many people in this room tonight,” she said. “I want to thank you Aretha for empowering all of us.”But the singer’s tribute to the late star proved unpopular with many. The Breakfast Club host Charlamagne Tha God tweeted: “I thought Madonna was supposed to be paying homage to Aretha but I all heard was her paying homage to herself,” while comedian Roy Wood Jr joked: “’If it wasn’t for Aretha, we wouldn’t have Madonna’ – Madonna.”It was a much better night for Cabello, though, with the former Fifth Harmony singer giving a “shoutout to all the amazing female artists this year”.The night was kicked off by Cardi B appearing onstage with what looked like her recently born baby but instead, she was holding a blanketed VMA, announcing herself to be “the empress” before introducing a performance by Shawn Mendes. It was a more muted start for the VMAs following on from last year’s politically charged opener from Kendrick Lamar.Later in the evening Cardi B picked up awards for best collaboration with Jennifer Lopez and DJ Khaled, and best new artist. “A couple of months ago people were saying you were gambling your career by having a baby,” she said.This year there was no host but instead a selection of presenters, some taking control of the stage for longer than others, such as Kevin Hart who teased that “You never know what’s gonna happen at the VMAs.” It was a message echoed by MTV’s interstitials, suggesting that big surprises were in store – but they were few and far between.Major winners included Nicki Minaj picking up best hip-hop video for Chun-Li and Post Malone beating out Ed Sheeran, Bruno Mars (featuring Cardi B) and Drake to take home song of the year for his hit Rockstar. Ariana Grande won best pop video for No Tears Left to Cry, thanking her fiance, SNL star Pete Davidson “for existing”. Avicii, who died in April, won best dance video for his collaboration with Rita Ora, who paid tribute to him during the ceremony.Many of the industry’s biggest stars weren’t in attendance, with Rihanna, Lady Gaga, Beyoncé, Bruno Mars, Taylor Swift, Kendrick Lamar, Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, Childish Gambino, Drake and Ed Sheeran all steering clear. Instead, the ceremony devoted more time than usual highlighting up-and-coming artists with condensed performances from Jessie Reyez, Hayley Kiyoko, PrettyMuch and others.Arguably the most talked about video of the year, Childish Gambino’s This is America, was named best video with a message and was honored with prizes for choreography and direction. Beyoncé and Jay-Z were denied any of the bigger awards, and instead won for art direction and cinematography.Last year Logic performed 1-800-273-8255, named after the US suicide hotline, and tonight he returned with an equally impassioned setpiece, arriving onstage wearing a T-shirt saying Fuck the Wall, followed by children wearing T-shirts saying We Are All Human Beings. The stage, mocked up to resemble the border wall, proceeded to lift halfway through One Day, his duet with Ryan Tedder, to reunite the children with their parents.Other performers included Travis Scott and James Blake, Ariana Grande, Panic! at the Disco, Nicki Minaj and Video Vanguard honoree Jennifer Lopez, who delivered a medley of her biggest tracks in the night’s most extravagant sequence. The star became the first Latinx artist to win the award and in her speech, she spoke of the personal importance.“I grew up on MTV and this is really a tremendous honor for me,” she said. “It has been an incredible journey of dreaming my wildest dreams and then watching them come true ... I had to forge my own path and make my own rules.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7adea98d607b62c0f851208c85e81f45f2b509de/0_121_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd205501d2fb0bd48084ed515155a9e1","title":"wayne kramer mc5 interview book the hard stuff","story":"The guitarist of MC5 discusses his challenging and ultimately redemptive life, as detailed in his new autobiography Nine out of 10 rock star autobiographies trace the same arc: musician achieves fame, parties too hard, becomes an addict of some sort and yet, in the end, somehow finds redemption. Wayne Kramer, leader of the revolutionary proto-punk band MC5, does double-time mining that well-trodden territory in his new book. Not only was he an addict, he spent over two years in prison for dealing cocaine before plowing a happier path. Yet, along the way, he takes so many rare, and revealing, side-trips, he wound up writing a book as suited to the sociology section as the music aisle.“I knew there was much more to my story than most,” Kramer, now 70, said.Enough, in fact, to present himself as exhibit A in discussions about everything from the purposeful isions between race and class to the in-fighting among leftist political groups to the ripple effects of multi-generational sexual abuse to the need for prison reform. Small wonder his book bears the verbose title The Hard Stuff: Dope, Crime, the MC5 and My Life of Impossibilities. Kramer will also be touring this fall with a band called MC50 (for MC5’s golden anniversary) in an incarnation that includes Soundgarden guitarist Kim Thayil and key members of Fugazi and Faith No More, together filling the spots of the three deceased members of the original band.Appropriate to an anarchic band like MC5, Kramer’s tome opens with a riot. It’s 1967, and the band, armed with anthems like Kick Out the Jams, have already established themselves as the face, and sound, of counterculture insurrection in their Detroit home. When the crowd gets a bit too excited for the police’s liking, nightsticks start swinging. “The cops’ violence was outrageously out of proportion to the situation,” Kramer wrote.What’s most notable about the crowd that day, however, is its rich mix of black and white fans, a rarity in most rock events at that time. Yet, it was a hallmark of Detroit culture back then. Because of his rearing in the city, as well as his working-class roots, Kramer sees many issues through the lens of race and class. “Those subjects are ones I’ve been interested in my whole life,” he said. “When I see isions, I always ask myself, ‘How did that happen?’”The early part of Kramer’s book examines the reasons behind the transformation of Detroit, between the 50s and the 70s, from Motor City to Murder City, stoked by police harassment of black citizens and white flight. “To watch Detroit go from a booming manufacturing center of the world to what it became has been painful,” he said.The story of Kramer’s youth, in the 50s, helps contextualize why Detroit boasted such an enormous explosion of musical talent, from the blue-collar rock of Bob Seger to the pre-punk of MC5 and The Stooges, to the starry hits of Motown. He credits the influx of black and white families who moved to the city from the south after the second world war, drawn “by good manufacturing jobs. Detroit had very powerful labor unions. You could raise a family on a working man’s salary. All those people who were coming in brought their culture with them.”For all the city’s richness, Kramer’s home life was marked by ignorance and neglect. His father came back from the second world war with the kind of PTSD no one at the time diagnosed. Guilt-ridden, he became an alcoholic who abandoned the family. Kramer’s mother remarried, this time to a guy who used to fondle him and his sister in front of the whole family. “He thought it was funny that he’d hold this little boy down and fiddle with his penis,” the guitarist said. “My mom thought it was funny too. She had experienced the same thing as a child and each generation bases their parenting on their own experience. It was degrading and embarrassing.”Kramer began to act out at school. He sent his eighth grade teacher a turd in the mail, predating a plot point in the John Waters movie Pink Flamingoes by nearly a decade. “I could be very creative when I wanted to be,” Kramer said with a laugh.As a teenager, he formed Motor City 5 along with guitarist Fred “Sonic” Smith (who later became the husband of Patti Smith), singer Rob Tyner, bassist Michael Davis and drummer Dennis Thompson. They played a brand of cacophonous rock that took further influence from R\u0026ampB and funk, as well as the soloing of avant garde jazz artists Albert Ayler and Sun Ra. At root, MC5 strove to translate anarchy into sound. They were equally drawn to Marxist politics and wound up aligning themselves with local radical John Sinclair, who created the White Panther Party, a corollary to the Black Panthers.According to Kramer, San Francisco’s starry-eyed “summer of love never made a stop to Detroit”. “Bell bottoms and beads may have come,” he said. “But the MC5 and Detroit always had a hard, working-class approach to music. What we sensed coming from San Francisco was too lightweight.”Their experience with workers’ rights gave them a natural route to politics. For that reason, Kramer always questioned the media’s tendency to cast 60s working men as reactionaries against the hippies. “We used to say: ‘Hey, those are our guys!’” Kramer recalled.Word about the band’s radical music and stance made its way to New York, which alerted Elektra Records talent scout Danny Fields. “When he saw a couple of thousand kids pack the Grande Ballroom to watch a band no one outside of Detroit had ever heard of, he probably thought, ‘We might convert this into national success if we play our cards right,’” Kramer said.It was Kramer who turned Fields onto their “brother band”, The Stooges, resulting in the signing of Iggy’s legendary band to Elektra as well. Because MC5 were primarily a live band who knew little of the studio, the record company went along with their novel idea to make their debut album a concert work, titled Kick Out the Jams. Before the album even appeared, Rolling Stone put the band on the cover, with a five-page spread inside. Still, the album didn’t sell well and the band’s extreme rhetoric, brimming with “by any means necessary” encouragements to extremism horrified promoters, record stores and the label. “I guess we could have been more diplomatic,” Kramer deadpans.If MC5’s actions landed them on government watch lists, they had little support from leftist groups either. When a limo came to greet them at their Fillmore East show, they were cast as sell-outs, exploiting the movement for profit. “People that were grounded in Marxist analysis found it easy to attack us,” Kramer said. “The people at the underground radio stations and the underground press had some cynicism about the MC5 too. I had expected trouble from the establishment. But I didn’t think people in our own community would attack us too!”While the band were friendly with the Black Panthers, the party’s newspaper labeled them “psychedelic clowns”.The band even fell out with John Sinclair once he was arrested and sent to prison for up to 10 years for possession of two marijuana cigarettes. After the band imploded, felled by drugs, in-fighting and poor sales, Kramer became a full-time addict and dealer who later ended up in a federal prison. The later part of the book details his ongoing push for prison reform, elaborated by the group he founded, Jail Guitar Doors, named for a song The Clash wrote about him in 1977. After many more wayward years, Kramer got his life together. He became a solo artist, a creator of film and TV soundtracks and, incredibly, a first-time dad at 65. “That’s how long it took me to stop being a child,” he said with a laugh. In the last decade, Kramer has become an idol to stars such as Eddie Vedder to Tom Morello. Likewise, MC5 are seen as pivotal role models for punk. Yet, Kramer finds the genre lacking. “I kept thinking, ‘I’ve heard that sound before,’” he said. “I hear more original things in hip-hop.” He also finds fault with all three MC5 albums. “The live one didn’t catch us on a particularly great night,” he said. “The second was too restrained and the third, High Time, pointed to the future of the band that, unfortunately, had no future.”Kramer will feature improved takes on songs from all three albums on his upcoming tour. It’s taking place at a time when the political scene seems eerily similar to that of MC5’s heyday. “Trump and Nixon – same old, same old,” said Kramer. “Again, we have an undeclared war on the other side of the world against people that are no threat to the US and there’s across the board corruption. The similarity could cause anyone to be cynical. But we have to guard against that. We always need to strive for something better.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dd72a7592cecebbb64a577e3f3731ad949fa050/0_0_10663_6400/master/10663.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3a095ba84f19a1e77427865e6d1f944","title":"the inescapable weight of my 100000 student debt","story":" MH Miller left university with a journal full of musings on Virginia Woolf and a vast financial burden. He is one of 44 million US graduates struggling to repay a total of $1.4tn. Were they right to believe their education was ‘priceless’?On Halloween in 2008, about six weeks after Lehman Brothers collapsed, my mother called me from Michigan to tell me that my father had lost his job in the sales department of Visteon, an auto parts supplier for Ford. Two months later, my mother lost her job working for the city of Troy, a suburb about half an hour from Detroit. From there our lives seemed to accelerate, the terrible events compounding fast enough to elude immediate understanding. By June, my parents, unable to find any work in the state where they spent their entire lives, moved to New York, where my sister and I were both in school. A month later, the mortgage on my childhood home went into default.After several months of unemployment, my mother got a job in New York City, fundraising for a children’s choir. In the summer of 2010, I completed my studies at New York University, where I received a BA and an MA in English literature, with more than $100,000 of debt, for which my father was a guarantor. My father was still unemployed and my mother had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer. She continued working, though her employer was clearly perturbed that she would have to take off every Friday for chemotherapy. To compensate for the lost time, on Mondays she rode early buses into the city from the Bronx, where, after months of harrowing uncertainty, my parents had settled. She wanted to be in the office first thing.In January 2011, Chase Bank took full possession of the house in Michigan. Our last ties were severed by an email my father received from the realtor, who had tried and failed to sell the property, telling him he could now cancel the utilities. In May, I got a freelance contract with a newspaper that within a year would hire me full-time – paying me, after taxes, roughly $900 every two weeks. In September 2011, my parents were approved for bankruptcy, and in October, due to a paperwork error, their car was repossessed in the middle of the night by creditors. Meanwhile, the payments for my debt – which had been borrowed from a variety of federal and private lenders, most prominently Citibank – totalled about $1,100 a month.Now 30, I have been incapacitated by debt for a decade. The delicate balancing act that my family and I perform in order to make a payment each month has become the organising principle of our lives. I am just one of44 million borrowers in the US who owe a total of more than $1.4 trillion in student loan debt. This number is almost incomprehensibly high, and yet it continues to increase, with no sign of stopping. Legislation that might help families in financial hardship has failed in Congress. A bill introduced in May 2017, the Discharge Student Loans in Bankruptcy Act, which would undo changes made to the bankruptcy code in the early 2000s, stalled in committee. Despite all evidence that student loan debt is a national crisis, the majority of the US government – the only organisation with the power to resolve the problem – refuses to acknowledge its severity.My debt was the result, in equal measure, of a chain of rotten luck and a system that is an abject failure by design. My parents never lived extravagantly. In the first years of their marriage, my father drove a cab. When they had children and my father started a career in the auto industry, we became firmly middle-class, never wanting for anything, even taking vacations once a year, to places like Myrtle Beach or Miami. Still, there was usually just enough money to cover the bills – car leases, a mortgage, groceries. My sister and I both attended public school. The cost of things was discussed constantly. In my freshman year of high school, I lost my yearbook, which cost $40 my mother very nearly wept. College, which cost roughly $50,000 a year, was the only time that money did not seem to matter. “We’ll find a way to pay for it,” my parents said repeatedly, and if we couldn’t pay for it immediately, there was always a bank willing to give us a loan. This was true even after my parents had both lost their jobs amid the global financial meltdown. Like many well-meaning but misguided baby boomers, neither of my parents received an elite education, but they nevertheless believed that an expensive school was not a waste of money it was the key to a better life for their children. They continued to put faith in this falsehood even after a previously unimaginable financial loss, and so we continued spending money that we didn’t have – money that banks kept giving to us.I have spent a great deal of time during the last decade shifting the blame for my debt. Whose fault was it? My devoted parents, for encouraging me to attend a school they couldn’t afford? The banks, which should have never lent money to people who clearly couldn’t pay it back to begin with, continuously exploiting the hope of families like mine, and quick to exploit us further once that hope disappeared? Or was it my fault for not having the foresight to realise it was a mistake to spend roughly $200,000 on a school where, in order to get my degree, I kept a journal about reading Virginia Woolf? (Sample passage, which assuredly blew my mind at the time: “We are interested in facts because we are interested in myth. We are interested in myth insofar as myth constructs facts.”) The problem, I think, runs deeper than blame. The foundational myth of an entire generation of Americans was the false promise that education was priceless – that its value was above or beyond its cost. College was not a right or a privilege, but an inevitability on the way to a meaningful adulthood. What an irony that the decisions I made about college when I was 17 have derailed such a goal.After the dust settled on the collapse of the economy, on my family’s lives, we found ourselves in an impossible situation: we owed more each month than we could collectively pay. And so we wrote letters to Citibank’s mysterious PO box address in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, begging for help, letters that I doubt ever met a human being. We grew to accept Citibank as a detestable Moloch that we feared and hated, but were made to worship. The letters began to comprise a diary for my father in particular, a way to communicate a private anguish that he mostly bottled up, as if he was storing it for later. In one letter, addressed “Dear Citi,” he pleaded for a longer-term plan with lower monthly payments. He described how my mother’s mounting medical bills, as well as Chase Bank’s collection on our foreclosed home, had forced the family into bankruptcy, which provided no protection in the case of private student loans. We were not asking, in the end, for relief or forgiveness, but merely to pay them an amount we could still barely afford. “This is an appeal to Citi asking you to work with us on this loan,” he wrote to no one at all.Finally, at the beginning of 2012, my father started writing to the office of Congressman Joseph Crowley, who represented the district in the Bronx where my parents had relocated. In one of these letters, he described watching Too Big to Fail, an HBO film about the financial crisis, which had come out several months earlier. (My parents lost every asset they had, but they still subscribed to HBO, which became more than TV for them – a symbolic relic of their former class status.)The recession was over, officially anyway, and people who had not suffered its agonies were already profiting from its memory. Recession films often took place in the gleaming offices of hedge funds and investment banks, with attractive celebrities offering sympathetic portrayals of economists and bankers – Zachary Quinto, in 2011’s Margin Call, for instance, plays a rocket scientist turned risk analyst with a heart of gold, a do-gooder who discovers that his employer has leveraged itself to the edge of bankruptcy. These films often depicted figures who experienced little to no repercussions for their roles in leading the country into a recession, who abused the misfortune of people like my parents – unmentionables who owed more on their houses than what they had paid for them and, of course, rarely featured in the story at all.My father described himself and my mother to Crowley as “the poster children for this entire financial event”, by which he meant Americans who seemed to have done everything right on paper, but in doing so contributed to their own downfall. By the time he wrote to Crowley, my father was working again, but it had taken him two years to find another job, which paid him much less money. After his run of financial calamity, he knew better than to believe anything good would last. “We are in our 60s and I figure when we get to our mid-70s life will become difficult again,” he wrote.Crowley’s office wrote back. It was the first time in about two years that a person had responded to our correspondence with encouragement, or something like it. Someone who worked for his office in Washingtonhelped to arrange a conference call with government liaisons from Citigroup to discuss a different payment plan. The monthly payments to Citi were then more than $800 a month, and we were trying to talk them into letting us pay the loan over a longer period, at a rate of about $400 a month. These terms were reasonable enough, but the response to this request was like an automated message brought to life: “We are precluded from a regulatory perspective from being able to do what you are asking,” each of the representatives said. What made these exchanges more ridiculous was the fact that Citibank was in the process of retreating from the student loan market by selling off my debt to Discover Financial, who would give us the same response. We were nothing to these companies but a number in a database. And they fully controlled our fates.I used to wonder if the people who worked for these lenders had families of their own, and if they would ever find themselves bankrupt, wondering where they were going to live. Most of all, I wondered what they would do if their own children had to take out loans to pay for college. After 10 years of living with the fallout of my own decisions about my education, I have come to think of my debt as like an alcoholic relative from whom I am estranged, but who shows up to ruin happy occasions. But when I first got out of school and the reality of how much money I owed finally struck me, the debt was more of a constant and explicit preoccupation, a matter of life and death.I had studied English because I wanted to be a writer. I never had an expectation of becoming rich. I didn’t care about money. My MA fed an intellectual curiosity that eventually led me to newspapers, and I don’t regret that my translation of The Dream of the Rood from Old English to contemporary vernacular was not a terribly marketable or even applicable skill. I understand now the extent to which I was among the most overeducated group of young adults in human history. Still, following completion of this degree, I enrolled for an evening class in French at New York’s Cooper Union, as that deferred my having to start paying off the debt, and the cost of the new class was cheaper than the monthly repayments I would have to make. Once I could no longer delay and the payments began, a question echoed through my head from the moment the day began, and often jolted me awake at night. I would look at the number on my paycheck and obsessively subtract my rent, the cost of a carton of eggs and a can of beans (my sustenance during the first lean year of this mess), and the price of a loan payment. The question was: What will you do when the money from the paycheck is gone?I never arrived at an answer to this question. At my lowest points, I began fantasising about dying, not because I was suicidal, but because death would have meant relief from having to come up with an answer. My life, I felt, had been assigned a monetary value – I knew what I was worth, and I couldn’t afford it, so all the better to cash out early. The debt was mind-controlling – how I would eat or pay my rent without defaulting was a constant refrain, and I had long since abandoned any hope of a future in which I might have a meaningful line of credit or a disposable income, or even simply own something – but it was also mind-numbingly banal. I spent a great deal of time filling out paperwork over and over again, or waiting on hold for extended periods in order to speak to a robotic voice that would reject my request. It didn’t matter what the request was or who I was asking. It was always rejected.And so it felt good to think about dying, in the way that it felt good to take a long nap in order to not be conscious for a while. These thoughts culminated in November 2010, when I met with my father one afternoon at a diner in Brooklyn to retrieve more paperwork. My hope for some forgiving demise had resulted in my being viciously sick for about 10 days, with what turned out to be strep throat. I refused to go to the doctor in the hope that my condition might worsen into a more serious infection that, even if it didn’t kill me, might force someone to at last lavish me with pity. I coughed up a not insignificant portion of yellowish fluid before my father and I entered the restaurant. We sat at a table, and I frowned at the forms he handed me. I started the conversation by asking, “Theoretically, if I were to, say, kill myself, what would happen to the debt?”“I would have to pay it myself,” my father said, in the same tone he would use a few minutes later to order eggs. He paused and then offered me a melancholy smile, which I sensed had caused him great strain. “Listen, it’s just debt,” he said. “No one is dying from this.”My father had suffered in the previous two years. In a matter of months, he had lost everything he had worked most of his adult life to achieve – first his career, then his home, then his dignity. He had become a 60-year-old man who had quite reluctantly shaved his greying, 40-year-old mustache in order to look younger, shuffling between failed job interviews where he was often told he had “too much experience”. He was ultimately forced out of the life he’d known, dragging with him, like some 21-first-century Pa Joad, a U-Haul trailer crammed with family possessions, including, at the insistence of my mother, large plastic tubs of my childhood action figures.Throughout this misery, my father had reacted with what I suddenly realised was stoicism, but which I had long mistaken for indifference. This misunderstanding was due in part to my mother, whom my father mercifully hadn’t lost, and who had suffered perhaps most of all. Not that it was a competition, but if it were, I think she would have taken some small amount of satisfaction in winning it. The loss of home and finances felt at least like a worthy opponent for cancer, and yet here was my father telling me that none of this was the end of the world. I felt a flood of sympathy for him. I was ashamed of my selfishness. The lump in my throat began to feel less infectious than lachrymal. “OK,” I said to him, and that was that. When I got home I scheduled an appointment with a doctor.Navient released a public statement in reponse to that suit, which said: “There is no expectation that the servicer will act in the interest of the consumer.” When I received a notice from Navient in February 2017 that my monthly payments would be increasing, for reasons I did not comprehend, the email came with a note at the bottom saying: “We’re here to help: We’re happy to help you navigate your options, provide you with resources, and answer any questions you have as you repay your loans.” The company’s motto is, hilariously, “Solutions for your success”.These announcements flooded my inbox with subject lines declaring “Important Information”, but none of them altered my fate. Sometimes the monthly payments would go up, sometimes my salary would go up, sometimes I made a cheque out to a different company. The only stable thing was the money I owed, which never seemed to get any lower. And so the cash would go out to the various lenders with the blind hope that it was right. On top of all that was a dreadful anticipation that any day now I might hear from the credit bureau and my life would somehow bottom out.In some twisted way, I wanted it to happen. My mother’s cancer went into remission, and both of my parents found, in their 60s, new careers in New York. I maintained steady employment in journalism since finishing school, and in 2016 I was hired as an editor at the New York Times. Was it possible we had become lucky? I had spent so much time wondering what life’s nadir looked like that I was now curious whether it had already come and gone.In the summer of 2017, my father, now nearing 70, had lost another job, so I finally removed him as a guarantor and refinanced my loans with one of the few companies that provides such a service, SoFi. My wife, who agreed to marry me last autumn, would help with the payments when she could. Sharing the burden of my debt with my spouse instead of my parents was a small, depressing victory, a milestone perhaps unique to members of my generation, one that must have carried the same kind of significance that purchasing a home and having a mortgage had to my parents.SoFi has not made my situation much more tenable. The main difference is that I now write one cheque instead of several, and I have an end date for when the debt, including the calculated interest – about $182,000 – will be paid off: 2032, when I’ll be 44, a number that feels only slightly less theoretical to me than 30 did when I was 17. What I have to pay each month is still, for the most part, more than I am able to afford, and it has kept me in a state of perpetual childishness. I rely on the help of people I love, and I live by each paycheck. I still harbour anxiety about the bad things that could befall me should the paycheck disappear.But the “Important Information” I receive has changed. SoFi is a Silicon Valley startup that bills itself as “a new kind of finance company” its name is shorthand for Social Finance, Inc. In addition to loans, it offers membership outreach in the form of financial literacy workshops and free dinners. Their aim is to “empower our members” – a mission that was called into question by the resignation, in September 2017, of its CEO, Mike Cagney, who employees allege had engaged in serial workplace sexual harassment and who ran the office, according to a New York Times headline, like “a frat house.” The allegations, according to a report in the Times, include Cagney exchanging explicit text messages with employees, bragging about the size of his genitalia, and the company’s chief financial officer offering bonuses to female employees if they lost weight. In January, SoFi hired Anthony Noto, formerly of Twitter, as Cagney’s replacement.SoFi has also received criticism for its elitism, and for courting only wealthy, high-earning borrowers – to which I can only say this is a category with which I do not personally identify, especially after writing the check to SoFi each month. The news ahout Cagney came out not long after I refinanced my loans with the company – I became, I suppose, a SoFi’er, in the company’s parlance. Around the same time, I started receiving curious emails from them: “You’re Invited: 2 NYC Singles Events” or “Come Celebrate Pride with us!”I will reiterate that I am a 30-year-old married man with more than $100,000 of debt, who makes less each year than what he owes. Buying a pair of trousers is a major financial decision for me. I do not think myself eligible in any sense of the word, nor do I find my debt to be amusing merely on a conversational level.Still, I felt as if in 10 years, the debt hadn’t changed, but the world had, or at least the world’s view of it. This thing, this 21st-century blight that had been the source of great ruin and sadness for my family, was now so normal – so basic – that it had been co-opted by the wellness industry of Silicon Valley. My debt was now approachable, a way to meet people. It was, in other words, an investment in my future, which is why I had gone into debt in the first place. Would SoFi be this friendly if I lost my job and missed a monthly payment?Let’s say I was morbidly intrigued. The day after Valentine’s Day, I went to a Mexican restaurant in the financial district for a SoFi community dinner – this was not a singles event, but simply a free meal. There had been another of these dinners near my apartment the week before, but it had, to my surprise, quickly sold out. The restaurant was packed with an after-work crowd in business attire, and SoFi had rented out the back room, where a few dozen people had gathered, all wearing name tags and discussing financial woes. Sid, a software developer from Queens who had racked up credit card debt after college, told me that the debt was a unifying force at these gatherings. “When there’s a break in the conversation, someone can just say, ‘So, debt, huh?’ and things will get going again,” he said. “If we walked outside of this room,” he continued, gesturing to the suits by the bar, “everyone out there would have debt, too. It’s just a little more out in the open for us.”Despite the name tags, the dinner turned out to resemble something more like an AA meeting, an earnest session of group therapy. Everyone had their story about the problems caused by their student loans and how they were trying, one day at a time, to improve things, and no story was exceptional, including my own. Ian, an employee for Google who had recently successfully paid off his debt from a Columbia MBA programme, became something like my sponsor for the evening. He said he had a few “bone dry” years, when he lived on instant noodles. I told him I had a long way to go. “At least you’re doing something about it,” he said, sincerely.We sat down to dinner. Across from me was Mira, a defence attorney from Brooklyn, who attended law school at Stanford. Her payments amount to $2,300 a month, more than double my own. When I asked her why she came to this event, she glanced at me as if the answer should have been obvious: her payments are $2,300 a month. The table, myself included, looked on her with an odd reverence. She wore a business suit and had her hair pulled back, but I saw her as something like the sage and weathered biker of the group, talking in her wisdom about accepting the things you cannot change.After the food was served, a waiter came by with a stack of to-go boxes, which sat on the edge of the table untouched for a while as everyone cautiously eyed them. The group was reluctant at first, but then Ian said, “The chicken was actually pretty good,” as he scooped it into one of the boxes. Mira shrugged, took a fork, and said: “This is a little tacky, but I’d hate to waste free food,” and the rest of the table followed her lead. Maybe the next generation would do better, but I felt like we were broke and broken. No number of degrees or professional successes would put us back together again. For now, though, we knew where our next meal was coming from.This article first appeared in the current issue of the Baffler• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7349247556458e5f09b9ad73e07f55bb1f22b32/0_166_2954_1772/master/2954.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e56d8356cc80c5244bc321dfb9796f31","title":"labour mp says second brexit vote could lead to social unrest","story":"Barry Gardiner says politicians must honour the promise they made to voters in 2016A second referendum on Brexit could lead to social unrest and embolden the extreme right, a member of Labour’s shadow cabinet has saidThe shadow international trade secretary, Barry Gardiner, said that even though he thought Brexit would make the UK poorer in the short and medium term, it would be wrong to try to stop it by holding another referendum because that would appear undemocratic.His comments were immediately criticised by strongly pro-European Labour MPs who argued that dismissing a second referendum on these grounds was illogical.Gardiner told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that, although he supported remain, it was important for politicians to honour the promise they made to voters in 2016 that how they voted in the referendum would decide this issue for good.Although Brexit would be damaging economically, there was “more to this than simple economics”, he said.“If you then say to people: ‘We did give you a vote here and we, the remainers, lost the vote, but because you were stupid enough to do what you wanted rather than what we wanted ... we’ll give you another chance to get it right,’ that undermines the whole principle of democracy in this country.”He went on: “You never give as much succour to the extreme right as when you cut off the mechanism of democratic change.“If people want to be able to achieve change through democratic means, if they feel that that is being denied to them, they then turn to other, more socially disruptive ways of expressing their views, and that is the danger here.”When pressed, Gardiner said he was not predicting “violence on the streets” in the event of a second referendum. But there could be some form of disruption, he added.“What I’m saying is that in any situation, if people feel that the route to change is no longer a democratic route, then you look to social disruption, perhaps civil disobedience, in a different way,” he said.“This is playing with our democracy. It’s playing with the foundations of our country in a way that is really, really damaging. We have to respect people’s vote in that referendum. We told them we would, we must do it.”Labour is not calling for a second referendum and Jeremy Corbyn, who is less hostile towards Brexit than most of his MPs, has always strongly played down the prospect of the party backing one.But the party has not formally ruled out voting for a second referendum, and at the Labour conference in the autumn many activists will be pushing for the idea to be embraced, buoyed by polling evidence showing that further vote is popular with Labour supporters.Responding to Gardiner’s interview, the Labour MP Chris Leslie tweeted: Tom Brake, the Liberal Democrats’ Brexit spokesman, also said he was “appalled” by Gardiner’s line of reasoning.In a separate interview on the Today programme Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, said the government would never sign up to a Brexit deal that was “not consistent with both the letter and the spirit of the referendum”.He added: “It would be absolutely fatal for the UK if we were not to agree to something that was consistent with what people asked because we are a democracy.”Hunt also said that, although he was “cautiously optimistic” that the UK and the EU would reach an agreement, the chance of there being no deal was “not negligible”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94ac045d92de66d331fa3d6745e326bda4145d80/0_0_2441_1006/master/2441.jpg?w=645\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1cdae64b0f61495137d046776dc0cf7c 645w","title":"first win england india elephant never forget","story":"There used to be two shops in Birmingham called Tyseley Pet Stores. While in one advert they boasted of their stocks of “puppies, rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters and mice” these were not your average pet shops – by the end of the paragraph they had moved on to “our large selection of monkeys, tame chimps and latest arrival, the baby gorilla”. They imported around 2,000 marmosets a year and shipped tortoises from Morocco at the rate of 6,000 a time. As might be expected, not all of these creatures were particularly keen on life in a Birmingham pet shop: in 1961 a giant anteater caused chaos when it escaped and was pursued through town by RSPCA officers three years later Annie, a giant armadillo, crashed through the shop window and went missing for two days in 1967 three dingos broke loose and had killed five sheep by the time they were found.All of these creatures and many more were available to the general public at one stage in the 1960s Angela McWilliams, a part-time secretary from Kensington, earned a measure of fame for her habit of taking her leopard cub, Michael, for walks around London (she decided to give it back after a year). “She always struck me as being well-to-do,” Brian Williams, the shop’s owner, said of his client. “After all, not everyone can afford £200 for a leopard.” But it wasn’t just ordinary members of the public who shopped in Tyseley’s and in May 1970 Chessington Zoo bought a young elephant called Bella, a creature that was to go on to play a small but memorable role in the history of Test cricket.The final day of the third Test between England and India in 1971 coincided with Ganesh Chaturthi, the Hindu festival that honours the elephant-headed god Ganesha. In a bold move, a group of India fans celebrated the occasion by borrowing Bella from Chessington and bringing her to the Oval, where she was welcomed and paraded around the outfield. In the India dressing room Hemu Adhikari, the manager, and his captain, Ajit Wadekar, were discussing their team’s chances of knocking off the 97 runs they still required when Adhikari spotted an elephant strolling around the ground. “He said it was a good omen, considering it was Ganesh Chaturthi,” Wadekar recalled. “I went out to bat on my overnight score of 45 with my hopes doubled, and was run out first ball. As I came back to the pavilion I prayed to Lord Ganesha, imploring him to make the victory possible, having raised our hopes with his appearance that morning. The rest is history.”It was not history that Wadekar himself took a very active part in creating, however. The captain took off his pads, looked at the scoreboard and assessed the match situation. He was tired, his team were well placed, and the following day they were due to start another match, against Sussex. “Since we were winning, I thought to take some rest before the trip,” he explained. Wadekar lay down on the floor of the dressing room and closed his eyes. A couple of hours later it was over.“Every Indian tourist, businessman, waiter and schoolboy in London seemed to be at the Oval,” wrote Campbell Page in the Observer of the moment when Abid Ali struck the winning four. “What follows is like one of Eisenstein’s crowd scenes. While the ball is still 50 yards from the boundary, massed Indians leap the barrier and charge. The England team sprint for the pavilion. The umpires gather up the stumps before they are lost to the marauders. Hot on the heels of the shock troops, a little Indian girl of not more than five years old lifts her even smaller brother over the fence, takes his hand and drags him to where the action is. In no time the Indian batsmen are being swept towards the pavilion on the shoulders of the crowd.”Wadekar slept through it all. The first he knew of his team’s success came when he was shaken from his slumber by Ken Barrington. “Mate, they want you on that balcony pronto,” the England manager said, “else we could have a ruddy riot on our hands.”It was India’s first ever Test victory in England and – the first two matches having ended in rain-affected draws – their first series victory too, a success still celebrated as one of the country’s greatest. “The team, admirably captained and sustained by Wadekar, have succeeded where the great names of Indian cricket had failed,” wrote John Arlott in the . “The Test and the rubber were effectively won by the Indian spinners, arguably the strongest attacking force in international cricket at the moment, supported by the most sophisticated, enthusiastic and effectively deployed fielding ever produced by an Indian side in this country.”When the team returned to India their flight was erted to Delhi so the prime minister, Indira Gandhi, could congratulate them in person. Then they flew on to Mumbai, where an estimated 1.5 million people lined the streets and flung flowers in their path as they were carried in open-topped cars to a reception at the Cricket Club of India. “Glorious to be living at this hour and to be an Indian,” wrote the Times of India. “Days, months, years will pass, but our cricket team’s magnificent triumph over England in England will remain unforgettable.”Last Wednesday Wadekar died after a long illness. This Friday it will be 47 years precisely since he and Adhikari spied Bella from their dressing room. These two coincidences added emotional heft to India’s performance in this year’s third Test, and a display that conjured memories of a distant success that Indians, like a particular proverbial pachyderm, will never forget.• This is an extract taken from The Spin, the ’s weekly cricket email.

In the doldrums a couple of years ago, enthusiasm for women’s basketball has rebounded, and with that growth has come greater attention paid to what players have to say.WNBA players have always been active on social media, making their voices heard both to promote the game they play and to advocate on social issues they are passionate about. In 2018, however, they are louder than ever before.“People love to think that political, socioeconomic stuff, none of that touches sports – racism doesn’t touch sports, sexism doesn’t touch sports, none of that touches sports,” said Atlanta Dream center Imani McGee-Stafford. “It’s completely the opposite. Sports are a microcosm of the real world, and especially for the WNBA – most of us are women of color, a lot of us identify as LGBTQIA, and we speak out about the things we believe in. Like, the Black Lives Matter thing: we were at the forefront of that. Colin Kaepernick took a knee, but we were there first. Before the NBA started wearing shirts, we took a knee. We’re always on the forefront of social advocacy, because we have to be. I can’t play basketball and forget that I’m a black woman, forget that I come from Inglewood, California, forget that most of my friends, that I have a lot of friends that are homophobic, things like that. I have to deal with these things every day. I can’t step on the court and forget everything I am and everything that touches me.”McGee-Stafford certainly does not forget those things when she’s off the court and online, and that resulted in perhaps the best tweet of the 2018 season. On 5 July, the 23-year-old was fed up with an old trope, and wrote, “Yall really so tired with the ‘WNBA on the cooking channel’ ‘get in the kitchen’ yada yada. I’ll have you know I love to cook. I’m hella domesticated lol. But I’m also killing you in any one on one game and my muscles prolly bigger than yours.” That drew a response from Twitter user @solCYkb that simply read, “WNBA really pointless,” to which McGee-Stafford responded with her mic-dropping quote tweet, “My checks clear.”That last statement was impactful in two ways. First and most obviously, McGee-Stafford was standing strong and clapping back at a troll, in devastating fashion. Also, it touched at least a little bit on an important issue that has been talked about this season, the pay gap between WNBA and NBA players.Pay disparity, of course, is something that women are confronting across all walks of life, and that goes back to McGee-Stafford’s point about the impossibility of separating sports from everything else in the world. What is unique to sports is something that happened while McGee-Stafford was at the airport in Atlanta, being interviewed on the phone. Nobody would walk up to an orthopedist and claim to be able to set a broken arm as proficiently as the expert. But McGee-Stafford found herself being challenged by a stranger to a game of one-on-one. She decided to smile politely and move on with her travels.“It’s a lot easier for a man to ignore these things, because they don’t touch them,” McGee-Stafford said. “That’s privilege. Privilege is that because this issue doesn’t expressly affect me, then it doesn’t exist and I don’t care about it. We don’t have the privilege to ignore these things, because they’re real and we deal with it every day.”The one-on-one challenge in particular is a common occurrence for WNBA players, one that Phoenix Mercury forward Devereaux Peters authored a Twitter thread about in July. A few weeks later, that thread became an op-ed by Peters in The Washington Post, after the paper reached out to her to see if she wanted to write it. Some of that is a matter of celebrity, but it’s also impossible to ignore that in 2018, women – and especially women of color – are staking out and making the most of spaces in the national conversation that have previously been unavailable.“Right now, a lot of where we’re at comes with what goes viral, and what gets the most attention,” Peters said. “For me, it kind of just happened that the tweets happened to blow up, because a lot of us have had similar experiences. I was able to blow up like that because I’m a basketball player, and have had these people talk a certain way, and that provided me the opportunity to get to that point, but I think it’s important to be able to have discussions and have representation in the media to be able to talk about things. So, I do appreciate that we’re in a space where it’s more available to people to have these discussions.”That availability is being driven in part by the social climate, but also by social media, where voices can be heard that otherwise would not. The WNBA does not get a lot of traditional media coverage, but the internet is boundless, and makes it a lot easier for players to get their stories out.“We have a voice,” said New York Liberty center Kiah Stokes. “We’re on some sort of a platform. It’s obviously not as high caliber as NBA players, but we do have a certain platform, and we can use that to speak out. It also brings awareness to our league. So, like, I don’t want to say we complain about the pay, but the large pay gap, a lot of people assume that we’re making millions of dollars, and we’re not. We’re not saying that we deserve millions of dollars, but just to inform people. I think that’s the thing, to spread awareness, get people talking about our league, and when they come to a game, they can see, these girls work hard, and should get what they get, and bring more fans and more support.”It’s impossible to say how much players taking strong stands online is driving things like ESPN posting its highest single-game rating for a WNBA contest in seven years, or the overall gains in television viewership and attendance, but it clearly is not hurting, even if the league itself sometimes stands in the way. Players were fined for uniform violations over the Black Lives Matter protests two years ago, and the pay gap issue is an obviously sticky point between players and management.“It’s more of an inidual matter in deciding what you want to do and what you want to talk about,” Peters said. “Obviously, the league doesn’t necessarily always agree with what we may feel and what we may want to speak out on. … Social issues have always been a part of sports, no matter how much people want to say it’s their release, or they don’t want politics in it. It always has been, and it always will be, because athletes are people of influence. We’re people that can have an impact on social issues and social justice, and have that conversation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/545a19a157a5e7d45d80be3f79146234f23e838f/126_316_2807_1684/master/2807.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=643f291863749c545912203904e6295a","title":"england chasing record 521 to win third test again india day four live","story":"60th over: England 163-4 (Stokes 42, Buttler 57) There’s that reverse: Shami tails one in at Buttler’s toes, but he does well to flick the delivery off them tootsies for a single. Shami comes round the wicket to Stokes, missing the outside edge by a hair. 59th over: England 162-4 (Stokes 42, Buttler 56) Stokes misses out on a wide, over-pitched ball, picking out the fielder. There’s a strangled lbw shout, but otherwise a fairly quiet Ashwin over. 58th over: England 162-4 (Stokes 42, Buttler 56) Shami gets a bowl now, but still only two slips. With still north of 350 runs for England to get, what use is, for example mid-on in this game? Stokes plays an uppish drive through the covers without much timing, but they do get three runs which brings up the 100 partnership. It’s reversing out there, so that’s another bit of fun for England to deal with. That might have hit a fourth stump, but only just. Wicketkeeper Pant told his senior colleagues where it was going, but they paid him no heed. Shami to Buttler, bit of inswing, pad, looked very leg side live but India are convinced. Upstairs we go...57th over: England 158-4 (Stokes 39, Buttler 55) Some pundits do bang on about slips, to the point that if you listened to them every team would have nine in the cordon. But, they’ve got a point this time: all four wickets in this innings and eight in England’s first were caught behind or in the slips. Anyway, maiden by Ashwin. 56th over: England 158-4 (Stokes 39, Buttler 55) Bumrah floats up a ball that couldn’t have asked to be hit more if it had suddenly become sentient and said “Hit me.” Buttler does the honours, and brings up his half-century with a boundary through the covers. Then four more, from a slightly less controlled shot, edged through third slip, which - ho! - had just been taken out by Kohli. 55th over: England 150-4 (Stokes 39, Buttler 47) The lbw shout aside, both batsmen play out the over reasonably well, taking a single apiece to bring up the 150. Meanwhile, in non-cricket news, here’s a headline for you: ‘Libertines frontman Pete Doherty wolfs down Cliftonville breakfast challenge only a handful of people have conquered.’The India team go berserk for lbw, Stokes pushing forwards Ashwin. Umpire says no, but it looks good...54th over: England 148-4 (Stokes 38, Buttler 46) Bumrah drops his length back a bit: a wider one Stokes a little unwisely flays at, but gets himself four runs backward of point, then a straight delivery lifts and smacks him on the bottom hand. A little variable bounce in this pitch. Big lbw shout against Buttler from the last ball of the over, but it was going a decent way down leg. 53rd over: England 143-4 (Stokes 33, Buttler 46) Beautiful batting from Buttler: Ashwin gives him a full, straight one, probably actually on middle and leg, but he manages a feat of timing and contortion to drive inside out, through the covers and to the boundary. The next ball spins in extravagantly, Buttler barely keeping it out. But another over where the batsmen both survive and score some runs: it’s a low bar, but England have been limboing ‘neath it for most of the Test. 52nd over: England 139-4 (Stokes 33, Buttler 42) Buttler gets a thick inside edge onto his toes, then Stokes thick edges one that seems to hold up a bit in the pitch. But as crises go, that’s relatively small fry for England. Here’s Paul Griffin with a funny: “Stokes is playing really well! Why oh why wasn’t he picked earlier? These idiot selectors deserve a good slapping.”51st over: England 138-4 (Stokes 33, Buttler 41) Another sweep from Stokes, but while the last one was all delicate and touch stuff, he absolutely nails the second, to the mid-wicket ropes. A couple more come from a flick off his toes. Richard Dennis writes: “It seems this fairly decent partnership has come about through nothing more than playing pretty sensibly. Would that be right, from your eye? Odd that isn’t it, sensible batting produces runs, who would have thought it!”While it isn’t always quite as simple as all that...on this occasion it does seem to be as simple as all that. Cue one of these belting one straight up in the air...50th over: England 131-4 (Stokes 27, Buttler 40) Bumrah’s angle of delivery has helped him banjax a couple of right-handers - Root and Buttler, to a point - but versus lefties it does rather take lbw out of the question. A case in point: he goes up for one against Stokes, but that was pitching comfortably outside leg. 49th over: England 130-4 (Stokes 27, Buttler 39) Nice shot from Stokes, premeditating a lap sweep that trickles round the corner for four. Stokes then props forwards, puts a forward defensive into his boot: it pops up and India ask if that was all boot, no ground, but consultation with the third umpire suggests it did indeed hit the ground. John Cox challenges the assertion that Stokes played the most ungainlyleast gainly forward defensive ever. And...well...fair enough. “I would like to add to the collective gloom with my own worries about this England team,” adds Matt Emerson. “We’re only going along at 2.60 an over, which is behind the required run rate (we need 521 off ten overs plus two days  521190  2.74). Someone needs to tell Stokes \u0026amp Buttler to get a move on.”48th over: England 124-4 (Stokes 21, Buttler 39) Bumrah finds Buttler’s edge again, but it drops short of Pujara at first slip: the bowler urges his cordon to come up, and while they do seem a little deep, Bumrah should probably have thought of that before. Then, another edge, but this time it flies through where fifth slipgully would have been: but as there was no such fielder, the batsman gets four runs. Not a fair game sometimes, this. And that’s drinks.47th over: England 120-4 (Stokes 21, Buttler 35) Ashwin is loosening up a bit: he beats Stokes on the outside edge twice in three balls, then the batsman plays the most ungainly (least gainly?) forward defensive shot of all time, damn near falling over in the process. A big questioncall from Abhijato Sensarma: “If India draw or perhaps even win the series, and produce similar results Down Under, what do you think would be the legacy of this Indian cricket team?Considering Kohli performs as well as he as, perhaps perhaps elevating his standards further along the way, while leading his team to glory abroad and in the World Cup, do you think there is a chance that his all-format brilliance would justify him getting the title of the Greatest Cricketer of All Time?”46th over: England 120-4 (Stokes 21, Buttler 35) Double bowling change, as Bumrah comes on from the Pavilion End. It very nearly flummoxes Buttler first up, as he sort of shovelpulls a ball from outside off stump, right to where a sort of straight mid-wicket would have been. ‘Would have’ is the operative phrase there though: the ball plopped into empty space, and they run two. Erasmus calls a no-ball, but replays suggest it most certainly was not: it really is strange that we still rely on the on-field umpires to call these. Jossles then tries to leave one that ducks back in and hits the handle of his bat, then he tries a flick through mid-on but gets a leading edge: it scoots between first slip and the wicketkeeper, falling just short of both, and goes to the boundary. 45th over: England 113-4 (Stokes 21, Buttler 29) Well, for some reason here’s Ashwin again, looking about as comfortable as a man who’s just rolled around in a wasps’ nest covered in jam. He grimaces after his first ball, and while he gets some nice flight, the batsmen deal with it all relatively easily. Three runs from the over, which brings up the 50 partnership: England’s first since the first wicket of the first innings. 44th over: England 110-4 (Stokes 19, Buttler 28) Firm drive down through mid-off by Stokes brings one, two, three runs. Buttler singles to return Stokes to strike, and Sharma gets annoyed as he steps down the track and flings the ball in his direction. Aggro! Needle! Sort of! A summary of things, by Mike Daniels: “The long and short of it is that both batting sides have been under the pump this series when the ball has swung. What’s let England down at Edgbaston and here is the catching - Kohli would have got more like 200 runs this series if the catches had been taken from him and we’d still be saying that he hasn’t proved himself in England. A couple of drops have allowed him to show his undoubted class, but it’s all about the conditions, stupid. Whenever the ball moves consistently, wherever you are in the world, batsmen will find it difficult. That’s always been the case and always will be. It’s exacerbated with the short time in which series are played which can narrow the variation in conditions over a series.”43rd over: England 106-4 (Stokes 16, Buttler 27) Sensible batting this by England: broadly cautious, with the odd attacking effort. Like that, by Buttler, driving beautifully through the covers and to the boundary.Young J.Bairstow is lingering by the dressing room window in whites, so he might well bat. Although, as with Ashwin, it might be prudent to let him keep that fractured finger out of the action. 42nd over: England 102-4 (Stokes 16, Buttler 23) Runs! Runs! Runs! After nowt from the first three overs of the session, England are ticking along now. Stokes strikes two boundaries in three balls, the first flicked off his pads behind square, the second driven solidly down to long-on. Meanwhile, Robert Wilson wants to bring back the birch. Or something. “William Hargreaves’ nurturing hippy schtick is all very well. Gentle guidance and supportive sharing of viewpoints is probably rather agreeable. On the other hand, whispering to the hapless batsmen who refuses to move his feet to the ball that you’ve placed a twitchy and intolerant sniper on the roof of the midwicket stand is bound to concentrate the mind to some degree. Additionally, whether effective or no, I know which approach is more likely to get a few laughs.” 41st over: England 94-4 (Stokes 8, Buttler 23) Pandya tries a bouncer from the last ball of the over, which is ambitious. Stokes pulls him for a single. Ashwin is back on, although you wonder why: if he’s injured, tell him to rest up for the remainder of the dayTest. India are going to win this with or without him. Meanwhile, which dashing, left-handed, off-spinning erstwhile England all-rounder with impeccable timing has just reached 200 off 260 balls for Worcestershire? Find out with Graham Hardcastle in the county cricket blog...40th over: England 92-4 (Stokes 7, Buttler 23) Ravi Ashwin bowled a couple of overs earlier like he was the tin man, and he’s off the field again. Ravi Jadeja on in his place. And another sub is required, after Shami slips and possibly twists something chasing after a misfield from a Stokes drive. England take three, then Jadeja is straight into the action, chasing a Buttler shot to the cover boundary, but is unsuccessful and almost calls for yet another replacement fielder as he tumbles over the Toblerone and into the advertising boards. He’s OK, and England take seven from the over. A flood! 39th over: England 85-4 (Stokes 4, Buttler 19) Ironic cheers go up all around Trent Bridge, and you know what that means: England have scored a single. It comes from a Stokes drive that he seemed to change his mind about halfway through, but found enough of a gap for them to scuttle one. My inbox is full of dreadful English doom and gloom, which is at least partially justified, but it should be remembered that England are still 2-1 up in the series and absolutely steamrollered India at Lord’s. Nobody in the England team is scoring runs, but then again not many in the India team are scoring runs either. To wit: Kohli has 440 so far, and the next top-scorer, Bairstow, has 209. 38th over: England 84-4 (Stokes 3, Buttler 19) A shot! An attacking shot! Buttler drives the last ball of Sharma’s (pretty innocuous) over, but Mo Shami gets down to prevent some runs at mid-off. Another maiden. William Hargreaves is here, with some intellectual talk that suggests he’d get on with our chief selector. “Gary Naylor (33rd over) asks an interesting question about confronting batsmen with their misdemeanours. The coaching guru Tim Gallwey suggests that, by way of education  admonishment, a sportsperson should only be provided with awareness over an issue, choice over what to do about it, and trust. Any more intervention will actually be counterproductive, leading to cognitive issues that will detract from performance. “I stand by this analysis, actually, and would recommend it for all productive environments. There’s a long story about how this approach empowers responsible types and makes space for less responsible ones to become more self aware, but for now, here endeth the... blah, blah, blah.”Meanwhile Nigam Nuggehalli has a rather pithier observation: “The BCCI needs to convert all India series into five test series so that India can take the first two games to play themselves in.”37th over: England 84-4 (Stokes 3, Buttler 19) Another maiden, Stokes this time playing out six balls from Pandya, rather surprisingly chosen as the man from the Radcliffe Road End after lunch. On the Sky commentary, Mikey Holding is discussing the merits of being bilingual, the Indian players clearly communicating in a tongue unfamiliar to the England players. Reminds me of the tale told by Allan Donald, about the South African side coming up with all sorts of elaborate signals for when they were going to send down a slower ball. In the end, someone suggested the bowler should just shout “slower ball” in Afrikaans. 36th over: England 84-4 (Stokes 3, Buttler 19) A quiet start to the afternoon. Buttler is at least demonstrating here that he’s not merely a dasher, carefully regarding the over from Sharma, playing at not much, and the ones he does play are...watchful. Steve Coleman reckons there are issues all over the shop. “In addition to all the other things, just wondering if a single England batsman other than Jennings (close to being dropped anyway) is batting in the right place. Cook might be better at 3 these days (if in the team at all), Root better at 4, Bairstow better at 6 or 7 if keeping or 4 if not, Pope has never even batted at 4 before now, Stokes is not getting the regular runs of a top 6 batsman and could quite easily be a 7 (but will probably be 5 in the next Test), Lord alone knows where Buttler should be and Woakes is wasted at 8. A hot, steaming mess.”Afternoon. Nick Miller here. It’s a couple of minutes before this session is due to start, and the Indian team is already out on the field. The England batsmen are lingering, for some reason. Anyway, direct your correspondence to Nick.Miller.casual@the, or @NickMiller79.The letter bag! Where to begin? With Patrick Brennan, that’s where. “Cook is undoubtedly a legend,” he begins. “To score more than 12,000 runs opening, at least half of that in England, is extraordinary. The winter tours to SL and WI should afford opening batsmen some respite – nowhere near the movement you get in Eng, NZ, SA, and nowhere near the pace and hostility of Australia. My thought would therefore be to blood two new openers for those tours, give Cook a winter off. If both openers nail it over the winter, then perhaps that is goodbye to Cook (although I think there’s an argument for slotting him in at 3 and putting Root down to 4). If they don’t, then Cook is back for one last crack at the Ozzies in 2019.”I want to believe that he has a final act as much as anybody. And look, maybe he does. But the mathematics might catch up on him before he has the chance for it. Remember, if Mark Taylor didn’t salute in the second dig at Edgbaston in 1997, he would have been sacked (by himself, probably). Cook needs that innings the very next time he bats for England.“I’ve got TMS on while ‘working from home’ and every time I hear Charles Dagnall say Bumrah’s name, I feel obliged to follow it up with “...The Ever-Living!!” says Martin Sinclair. “The cricket isn’t going so well, so I might vanish down a He-Man related Youtube hole.” This isn’t in my hitting zone but I’m tipping it will be for plenty of others. “Remember those salad days of a couple of weeks ago when Ben Stokes reckoned England had “shut some people up”?” sniffs Gareth Fitzgerald, not unreasonably.”“Here we were led to believe that Kohli’s back would limit his fielding abilities more than his batting,” Sid V said in response to the Indian skipper’s wordly snaffle at third slip to remove Pope. Righto - that’s me done for now. I’ll pass the rest of your emails to Nick Miller, who is taking over from me at the  Towers End. Catch you all later, unless England fold in a session, in which case, I’ll see you at the Rose Bowl!Well, then. Four edges, four wickets. Four balls that didn’t really need playing at. Two openers prodding, now in strife for their spots - let’s be honest. The two right-handers that replaced them struggling to get in before throwing it away. It was the result of some top-shelf Indian bowling from Ishant and Bumrah, class acts both. Buttler and Stokes both had their moments but get to have a sandwich in the knowledge that they will return to the crease. England need 437 runs to win, which remains as irrelevant as it did when we got here this morning. The goal now is to find some small positives for Southampton. Not too dissimilar as it was at Lord’s at the start of the summer when Buttler and Bess (remember him?) picked up half-centuries. Something like that. I’m going to grab some lunch before returning to your emails. Nick will be around shortly as well. 35th over: England 84-4 (Stokes 3, Buttler 19) Ashwin throws it up at Stokes rather than digging into his big bag of tricks. The left-hander handles it well but is beaten by the last ball before lunch, ripping across his blade.34th over: England 84-4 (Stokes 3, Buttler 19) What about putting it away before lunch, Jos? Naaaah. Three boundaries from the penultimate over, including one through the air at cover from Buttler that - as well as it was hit - was not far from the ing Rahane. Earlier, he tucked a loose ball from Shami fine after pulling a long-hop. Shami has been far from problematic in this match but I reckon if Bhuuuvi is fit for Soton, he will be the man to make way. A metric shedload of emails. I’ll get to some at lunch before handballing the remainder to Nick Miller, who will be with you for the next session.33rd over: England 72-4 (Stokes 3, Buttler 7) Ashwin has two slips and a silly point for Stokes. Coming at him round the wicket, the left-hander is not tempted by the gap at midwicket but gets one from a ball misdirected down the legside, leaving Buttler a ball to negotiate. Buttler does the same and keeps the strike. So, we’ll have two more overs before lunch, Ashwin to get the last.“Bonjour, comment ça-va cher Adam?” G’day to you, Tony White. “I think having your test career on line every match is dumn neo-liberal think. Players should have a contract for the series, revoked only for extreme behaviour, on the field, snogging an umpire (without consent), never getting out, bowling the “atomic ball” (an unplayable item, subject of a light programme radio play, circa 1952). Or off the field, sleeping with opposition equipment, excessive crying during interviews, playing baseball. Just leave the poor buggers alone to get on with their game. If, at the end of the series it’s agreed that they screwed up, then it will be time for public castration and more. And the contract terminated. Till next time.”I can tell from this that I’d quite enjoy spending a night in the pub with you. 32nd over: England 70-4 (Stokes 2, Buttler 6) Runs! Four of ‘em! Buttler is happy leaving Shami early in his over but then deflects nicely past gully to the rope for his first boundary. He faced 24 balls before finding the rope, which may well be a record. Nine minutes to lunch and Ashwin is taking his cap off. 31st over: England 66-4 (Stokes 2, Buttler 2) Four maidens on the spin, Pandya to Stokes who looks at ease equally in defence as he does leaving. “You’ve watched England for some time now, at what point do the management tell Cookie that his efforts in going to the well are all appreciated, but he’s bringing less and less back, and have you ever heard of an opening pair being replaced at the same time?” asks Gareth Frith. I can remember two openers being replaced at the same time. Indeed, I was there: at Jo’burg this March. That wasn’t exactly a result of form, mind. Sigh."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a64455e0520861a0614067adf0482d7dd27b891/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9c7189eed8b60404a965d80f9776815","title":"italy piedmont mountains walking hiking alps","story":"A new walking trip in north-west Italy showcases the jagged peaks and wooded gorges of the little-known Valle Maira, as well as warm hospitality and fabulous regional cuisineThe first day of my hiking trip in the Valle Maira in Piedmont, north-west Italy, begins with a hot, lung-bursting, heart-pounding three-hour slog up a steep path. I should have expected as much. The tour operator classes its new circuit in this Alpine wonderland as “Grade 3: Challenging” – and my one-day training hike along the Devon coast hadn’t prepared me.The rewards, though, were plentiful. Once I’d made it over the San Michele pass, the climbing was far gentler, and the pine forests that clung to the steep sides sculpted by ancient glaciers provided plentiful shade. Also, there was cold, clean water at springs and public taps in the many small hamlets I passed. Handy information boards recounted that the Valle Maira, which is in the Cottian Alps close to the French border, had once buzzed with river-powered mills, where wheat, corn and rye were turned into flour. There were crafts galore, including – as the museum in the town of Elva recorded – making human-hair wigs for sale in Paris and London, and trading in salt from France (not always legit) and anchovies.The area became depopulated in the 20th century. The arrival of machines killed off crafts such as saddle-making a series of wars and the pull of the cities did the rest. Along the way, abandoned mills, locked and unloved churches and chapels, and once-handsome stone houses on the verge of implosion somehow still added romance to the wild landscape.My base for three nights was Agriturismo Al Chersogno, the family home of Luigi and Pasqualina. Proud of their Occitan roots – Pasqualina’s family have lived here for generations – they spoke the threatened language and played folk music on accordions. Meals were traditional and epic, with dinners of at least six courses, including antipasto, salad, pasta, a pie, a meat dish such as rabbit stew, ice-cream plus a glass of local grappa or genepì to aid digestion.After a sound night’s sleep I was ready for more – and my second big hike was the most spectacular. It began with another heave up a slope, landing me on the shoulder of 3,026-metre Monte Chersogno. As I climbed, I had my first sight of marmots – curious, bushy-tailed mega-squirrels common to the region – and spotted an ibex grazing in the shade of a large rock. Clouds had been boiling all morning and as I arrived at the highest point, a thunderstorm exploded above me. I crouched beside a boulder to hide from the driving rain and was surprised when three Italians came jogging past, laughing. They had climbed to the summit, which is very doable for fit walkers and requires no special kit or technical know-how. I opted instead to picnic by a nearby lake before heading home via a grassy ridge.When the time came to move on, my luggage was ferried by the local Sherpabus pick-up and drop-off service for hikers and mountain bikers – so I could travel light.Chiappera, my next base, seemed to me the best-preserved of the Valle Maira villages, its roof slates tidier, its stone walls carefully pointed. The refurbs have been sensitively executed, not least in La Scuola, the former village school now serving as one of the smarter restaurants-with-rooms. But the setting humbles all human efforts. The village sits at the bottom of a bowl of jagged mountains, with the fin-like peak of 2,451-metre Rocca Provenzale at its centre. It’s possible to walk around the mountain and right into France, with nothing marking the border but rusting second world war barbed wire.A wonderful hike south led over the Gardetta pass, with gun emplacements and a war memorial in arid steppe-like country, then descended into lush meadows, where white Piemontese cows were dozing – for once their bells weren’t ringing. I skirted another dramatic peak, La Meja, then turned north down a narrow valley to the two-donkey town of Preit. Even there, in the middle of seeming nowhere, I found a cafe and a perfect macchiato for a euro.That walk – and my trip – ended a few kilometres east in the hamlet of Finello, with dinner and a room at Locanda Lou Pitavin, the first hotel in the valley registered as an eco-ultra-friendly CasaClima. Owner Marco, told me that the Valle Maira, while still largely unknown to metropolitan Italians, was turning a corner in terms of tourism. “The things that made it unfashionable 20 or 30 years ago – wildness, lack of infrastructure, no flashy resorts or ski lifts – are now making it popular. Walking has become fashionable. Young people are coming back, too.”“We’re sourcing locally as much as possible. We’d love to do ‘zero km’ sourcing, but the problem is the valley doesn’t produce enough yet. My dream is that tourism will support agriculture and then Valle Maira will be a true paradise.”It is one of the most gorgeous places I’ve ever been in Europe. I saw several more ibex and deer, plus jays, shrikes and raptors, and heard cuckoos each time I entered a wood. Thanks to the rich pasture and abundant wild flowers, I also saw countless insects, especially bees (honey is a cottage industry) and butterflies. Ultimately, even the lung-busting climbs were welcome. Without them I’d probably have come back the size of a mountain.• The trip was provided by Inntravel, whose self-guided hotel-to-hotel walking holiday in Valle Maira costs from £1,095pp for eight days, including half-board, picnics, walking maps, transfers and luggage transportation, available 26 May to 6 October.

Venezuela is introducing economic reforms including new banknotes that lop five zeros off its fast-depreciating currency as the country battles hyperinflation.Hyperinflation is the term used to describe prices spiralling out of control, accompanied by plunging currency values – leading consumers to require wheelbarrows full of money to buy everyday essentials.In theory, prices should always fluctuate depending on supply and demand. Inflation is the term for rising prices, while deflation describes prices falling. Hyperinflation occurs when prices rise so wildly as to render the concept of inflation absurd.The problem comes when the supply of paper money in an economy outstrips demand for goods and services, causing the value of the currency to fall. This occurs when governments create new money to finance spending above their income from taxation.Hyperinflation in effect destroys purchasing power and encourages hoarding of goods, as people and businesses anticipate further price increases. Periods of hyperinflation tend therefore to be self perpetuating, as shortages further drive up prices.Lack of certainty over prices removes the incentive for buyers and sellers. The Times reports that restaurant owners in Venezuela no longer have menus with printed prices, while supermarkets have also removed prices from shelves. Many people use cards to buy goods rather than cash.Hyperinflation removes the certainty that a paycheck will be enough to meet living requirements, as prices rise to erode the value of wages. People can be forced to collect their wages in suitcases, although online bank accounts mean this is less of an issue than in the past.Aware of this problem, some Venezuelan companies have started offering unusual compensation packages, such as bonuses paid in eggs. Foreign currencies, retaining their stability, can also be used.Lower denomination currency becomes next to worthless. Over decades, inflation has the power to render some low denomination notes and coins irrelevant, such as 1p and 2p coins in the UK, where the government has considered scrapping them. Hyperinflation speeds this progress to unsustainable levels.There are often cash shortages and long queues at banks and cash machines as people require more money to make payments.Although considered rare by economists, there have been several occurrences of countries being gripped by hyperinflation in recent history.Russia experienced hyperinflation after the collapse of the Soviet Union, while Zimbabwe is among more recent examples, with soaraway inflation and the eventual abandonment of its domestic currency in 2009 in favour of the US dollar.Governments can use price controls to help manage periods of hyperinflation, yet goods at these prices can be scarce and black markets often emerge. Scrapping the old currency and replacing it with a new one or a foreign currency is one way out.Ultimately governments must restore stability through economic reforms and commitments to reduce the money supply. Boosting economic growth to balance the budget deficit, or using austerity and privatisations to raise money for the state to close the gap, are among the options available."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3603149.1534859298!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"higher education chief resigns amid frustration over lack of autonomy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Graham Love is to resign from his post as chief executive of the Higher Education Authority. Photograph: Cyril ByrneThe chief executive of the Higher Education Authority (HEA) has resigned from his post just over a year after being appointed to lead the organisation.The move follows growing frustration at senior levels over the extent of control from the Department of Education.Dr Graham Love, who was appointed as chief executive in January 2018, informed staff on Tuesday that he was leaving the organisation. There has been frustration within the authority over what some see as the organisation’s lack of independence and relevance.Sources claim that some key proposed reforms for the sector have either been stymied or delayed.In a statement released on Tuesday afternoon, Dr Love said that he was resigned as chief of the authority “with regret”.“ The HEA makes a valuable contribution to higher education in Ireland, ” he said.“ In my brief tenure, I have endeavoured to make strategic development a core element of HEA activities. I wish the organisation every success in the future.”Dr Love is expected to step down in October.The authority has statutory responsibility, at central government level, for the effective governance and regulation of higher education institutions and the higher education system.One source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there has been concern with the authority over the limited freedom given to the organisation.“It’s a question of the relevance of the authority: does it have a proper role or power? There’s been too much control and a real lack of clarity over its role.”In a statement, Michael Horgan, chairman of the authority, thanked Dr Love for his significant contribution. “Since joining the HEA, he has overseen the reorganisation of the internal management of the authority, the production of a new strategic plan and the recruitment of new staff to key positions within the authority,” he said.“ During his term, a new funding model has been developed, a new performance framework introduced and the redrafting of a new legislative foundation for the HEA begun. “Dr Love has significantly contributed to the development of the higher education system in Ireland and we in the HEA are sad and disappointed that he is leaving, but we wish him every success in the future. “As a board we will focus now on continuing the delivery of the HEA workplan, quickly securing an interim CEO and setting about recruiting a permanent replacement.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3603008.1534836108!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"opw defends decision to issue pass with crucifix to health staff during","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn ‘essential worker pass’ will be required for those travelling past Garda cordons during Saturday and SundayThe Office of Public Works (OPW) has defended its decision to include the symbol of a cross on the pass needed by workers entering controlled zones in Dublin during Pope Francis’ visit this weekend.  The pass, which will be issued to those travelling past Garda cordons during the pope’s visit, including healthcare workers, was criticised by Senator Lynn Ruane earlier this week as “disrespectful”.  Ms Ruane said she had been contacted by employees at St James’ Hospital who she said were “disgusted that they are required to wear a badge with a crucifix on it”.  “They were told they can’t go to work without it. We have such a erse workforce in hospitals of varying religions and none. Disrespectful,” she wrote in a message posted on Twitter.  A spokeswoman for the OPW said all passes issued would show a “geographical indicator” signifying which controlled zone the “essential worker” would have access to.\u0026nbsp  “The pass in question for Dublin shows an image of the steps and the Papal Cross which represents the closing event taking place in the Phoenix Park on Sunday 26th August,” she said.\u0026nbsp  The green pass, entitled “Pope Francis 2019 - Essential Workers Pass”, includes the worker’s name, role, access number and date of access.\u0026nbsp  The pass will be required by any essential staff arriving in controlled zones by car over the weekend. However, any workers travelling into the city by foot, bicycle or public transport will not need to display the pass.\u0026nbsp  A spokeswoman for the World Meeting of Families refused to comment on the design of the pass, saying they were not issued by their organisation.\u0026nbspSeparately, residents of a central Dublin street have been asked to carry photo ID and provide the names of all those who will be at their address on Saturday to gardaí ahead of the papal visit.Pope Francis will pass through Church Street as part of his two-day trip to Ireland and is to visit the Capuchin Day Centre for homeless people, which is located on nearby Bow Street.Church Street residents have received a flyer informing them they need to provide gardaí with the names of all those expected to be at their address on Saturday.A Garda spokesman said the notices “were issued to establish how many residentsfamily members will be in the area”.He said the flyers were necessary as there will be “limited space available” on the street during the visit.“In order to manage and ensure the safety of all concerned, access to this specific location will be curtailed,” the spokesman said.Meanwhile, medics have expressed concern that Dublin’s hospitals will “not be able to cope” with the demands of Sunday’s papal mass.The Irish Association for Emergency Medicine, which represents emergency medicine specialists. estimates up to 750 extra people will require hospitalisation.However, it says organisers have left it too late to start planning for the effect the influx of 500,000 people into the Phoenix Park – many of them elderly – will have on the health services.Necessary extra funding for hospitals has yet to be confirmed, and the assumptions about the extra workloads involved “appear to have been unduly conservative,” the association said in a statement.The association said Dublin emergency departments were struggling to bring in extra medical and nursing staff because of ongoing staff shortages while the onsite medical facility planned for the venue to stabilise critically ill patients was yet to be adequately staffed.In response, the HSE said medical services planning for the papal visit started earlier this year. It said there was a “robust medical plan” in place for those visiting Dublin city centre and the mass in the Phoenix Park.“More than 1,000 medical providers from around the country will be on duty, with a skill set ranging from community first responders to doctors,” it said, in a statement.“Over 26 aid posts will be in place along the numerous pedestrian routes and within the Phoenix Park.”The HSE said there will be additional ambulances along the routes to the main venue, along with an onsite medical assessment centre, staffed by experienced emergency department staff.

Photograph: Nick BradshawStudents’ unions are refusing to advertise some student digs on the basis that that homeowners are charging “exorbitant” rents.UCD students’ union said it has to refuse offers of rooms for rents from householders in some of the most affluent areas of Dublin’s southside.Rooms in student digs in the capital are generally available from between €450 and €550 a month.However, Barry Murphy, UCD students’ union president, said: “We’ve had homeowners in places such as Ailesbury Road and Killiney looking to rent out spare rooms to students for anything between €1,000 to €1,100 a month.“It’s also happening in areas such Dundrum, Stillorgan and Sandyford. We’ve had to refuse to advertise them.“Some of them seem to think students should be privilged to live there . . . As far as we’re concerned, they’re taking advantage of students because they know demand is far outstripping supply.”Mr Murphy also said some homeowners were also seeking to attach mandatory conditions requiring students to leave their homes on weekends.Others, he added, said wanted students to complete certain jobs, such as mowing the grass, walking the dog or cleaning the toilets in return for small discounts on the rent.“We generally just turn these offers away on the basis that you can’t expect students to return home every weekend. We’re also against anything that requires students to do jobs in exchange for discounts on rent. Students have enough on their plate as it is,” he said. Maynooth University students’ union has also refused to advertise some accommodation on the basis that some landlords were trying to exploit desperate students.The students’ union president Leon Diop posted a message on social media criticising a landlord for seeking €600 for accommodation in Maynooth. He said he told the landlord he would remove their advert from the students’ union accommodation page unless the price was lowered and made more “affordable”.The hunt for student accommodation has hotted up this week after more than 50,000 students received their CAO offers.The bulk of on-campus accommodation has already been snapped up, with students forced to look for digs or the private rental market.While the Government says an additional 3,000 purpose-built student accommodation units have come on stream in the past year, students’ unions say the bulk of these are “luxury” apartments which are out of the price range of most students.Many have been built by multinational property firms, specialising in student accommodation, and charge between €1,000 and €1,500 a month.Last weekend, students protested at the official opening of a new privately owned student complex at New Mill in Dublin’s south inner city.Students from DCU Students’ Union and the Union of Students in Ireland held a demonstration with posters calling on the Government to build affordable accommodation.In response, Global Student Accommodation (GSA) – which owns the new complex – said there were thousands of students in Dublin with differing expectations.Aaron Bailey, GSA’s development director for the UK \u0026amp Ireland, said: “We believe that we offer exceptional levels of service, but as a sector, we must always be asking ourselves whether or not we’re offering value for money. The private sector will keep trying to fill the accommodation void in Ireland, but ultimately we must ensure that we’re meeting the demands and expectations of the students we serve.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3602261.1534788693!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"russia casts long shadow as czechs mark 50 years since invasion","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tProtesters and residents standing on and around a Russian tank  on a Prague  street, August 1968. Photograph: Rolls PressPopperfotoGetty ImagesFor Ondrej Neff, a young journalist in communist Czechoslovakia, the bold liberal experiment of the Prague Spring ended with a phone call in the dead of night.“I remember it exactly. A colleague from Radio Prague called me at 2am and told me what was happening. I got up and rushed to our headquarters,” Neff, who was then 23 years old, recalled last week.“The first thing I noticed when I got outside was Russian planes without lights, very dark planes, flying at very low level towards Prague airport over the centre of the city. It was absolutely extraordinary.”In the early hours of August 21st, 1968, Soviet forces deployed troops, tanks and aircraft in an invasion of Czechoslovakia that would claim more than 100 lives and crush all hope that the Kremlin would tolerate “socialism with a human face” in its satellite states.It would be another two decades before Czechoslovakia ousted Soviet puppets from power, in the 1989 Velvet Revolution that was led by dissidents who had suffered repression after 1968.This year, however, the anniversary of the invasion finds Czechs pondering the legacy of the Prague Spring, under a new government that depends on communist support, a prime minister who allegedly worked as a secret agent of the regime, and a president who revels in his close ties to Russia.Five decades ago, Czechs met the might of the Red Army with a barrage of mostly non-violent resistance – protests, strikes, sabotage actions and a blizzard of anti-Soviet leaflets, posters and graffiti, which are now remembered in exhibitions and other events around the country.“We were all supporters,” Neff says of his Radio Prague colleagues’ backing for Alexander Dubcek, who had become head of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia in January 1968.Dubcek and allies eased restrictions on travel, the press and independent political groups, and advocated closer ties with western Europe and the introduction of elements of the free market and even democratic elections, with the proviso that his party retain its “leading role” in Czechoslovak society.Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev suspected Dubcek’s reformists imperilled Kremlin control of eastern Europe, however, and finally ordered an invasion on the pretext of crushing a western-backed “counterrevolution” in Czechoslovakia.“The invasion wasn’t a surprise for us . . . but it was a shock even though we were expecting it,” says Neff. “Up until August 21st there had been so much tension. Now the tension broke and it was very dramatic and we were also in a kind of euphoria.”The Soviets swiftly cut Radio Prague’s access to its transmitters and Neff recalls the station’s technicians switching to broadcast via telephone lines before Red Army troops stormed its headquarters a few hours into the invasion. “They chased us out of our building but our technicians found a solution to keep broadcasting. So Radio Prague was on air practically without interruption from the first day of the invasion, and I kept working as a journalist.”The Prague Spring was at an end, however.Dubcek and his allies were seized and flown to the Soviet capital, where almost all of them signed the Moscow Protocol, agreeing to reinstate censorship, sack certain officials and suppress opposition groups.The defeated reformists were flown home on August 27th. The following April, Dubcek was replaced as party leader by Soviet-backed loyalist Gustav Husak, marking the start of almost two decades of “normalisation”.For Neff, now best known as a science-fiction writer, “normalisation” meant being fired from Radio Prague and working in a department store and as a photographer, before returning to journalism after the 1989 Velvet Revolution.For sociologist Jirina Siklova, it meant quitting the Communist Party, being sacked from the philosophy faculty of the prestigious Charles University and working instead as a cleaner in a library and the geriatric department of a hospital. “I was told – not as a joke – that I was free to work there because their patients were half-dead already,” she tells The .Siklova, who was 33 in 1968, also started spiriting the work of banned authors into and out of the country. “The smuggling was very dangerous, of course, but I think it was very important. I smuggled plenty of manuscripts abroad and these books were published in the West,” she recalls.Siklova and Neff are among hundreds of people whose stories of the invasion and its aftermath make up the Memory of Nations project run by the Post Bellum organisation, which opened a special 1968 exhibition in Prague this month.In a recent poll commissioned by Post Bellum, 46 per cent of 18-34 year olds surveyed knew nothing about the events of 1968, a finding that Michal Smid, the administrator of the Memory of Nations collection, calls “alarming”.The Czech Republic’s historical awareness seems to be dwindling just as its attitudes to the communist period and to Moscow return to the political fore.Despite taking fewer than 8 per cent of votes in elections last year, the Czech Communist Party is now crucial in providing a majority for the government of prime minister Andrej Babis, a billionaire businessman who has so far failed to quash allegations that he acted as an informer for the Czechoslovak secret police.At the same time, Czech president Milos Zeman is perhaps the most pro-Kremlin leader in Europe, paying regular visits to Russia, urging the West to drop its sanctions on Moscow and retaining top aides with close business ties to the country.“However, it can be expected that with the upcoming 50th anniversary, some voices will attempt to downplay and question the seriousness of the occupation, as the Communist Party chairman Vojtech Filip has done . . . absurdly trying to absolve Russia from its past deeds.”While Babis has denounced the invasion and will speak on its anniversary, Zeman does not plan to make any public comment on Tuesday.“There will be no speech,” tweeted Zeman’s spokesman Jiri Ovcacek. “The president was brave at a time when courage was not cheap. And that’s much more valuable than a thousand speeches 50 years later.”Several senior Czech politicians have criticised the attitude shown by Zeman, who narrowly won re-election against a liberal challenger in January. “It is the 50th anniversary and the president should say something,” says Jiri Pehe, the director of New York University in Prague.“Everyone suspects that he may not want to make a statement because he would have to strongly condemn the Soviet invasion,” Pehe explains.“Zeman has been so pro-Russian lately that it would not go down well with the Russian leadership. So he prefers to be silent.”"},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

Flexible working is a growing preference for lots of people and provides opportunities to work for many who have other commitments or constraints that make it hard for them to work traditional working patterns. It therefore benefits organisations by giving them access to wider talent pools and creating more inclusive work environments. It\u0027s also clear that employees with access to flexible working arrangements are more likely to be satisfied and committed to their organisation.A previous study on the topic found that Londoners want to start work late, with over a quarter wishing to start work after 9am, compared with just 12 per cent in the rest of the South and 13 per cent in the North.YouGov explained said this could be because of a wish to avoid rush hour on London\u0027s busy public transport system.Another 13 per cent of people wanted an 8.30am start working until 4.30pm, and 10 per cent favoured 7am until 3pm. The choices did not appear to relate to whether or not the person surveyed was a parent. People with no children or with grown-up children were equally likely to want the earlier working day as those with school-age children. But the pattern shifts for people who live in London - and those in their late teens and early twenties. Early starts are less favoured by these two groups, with 19 per cent of 18-24 year olds saying they would like to start work after 9am compared to just 9 per cent of people aged 54 to 65. Comment: This is the lamest Strictly line-up in years – but just wait till the dancing startsBritish tycoon killed with family in seaplane crash left £41m to Oxfam after changing his will a year earlierIran unveils new fighter jet as president says US \u0026#39knows the consequences\u0026#39 of an attack on TehranFrench plan to remove police lifeguards from beaches faces fierce opposition from local mayorsSajid Javid apologises as it emerges 160 Windrush migrants were wrongly removed or detainedWomen requesting caesareans meet \u0026#39judgemental attitudes, barriers and disrespect\u0026#39Birmingham is just one of 15 prisons of \u0026#39serious concern\u0026#39 - the charts that show the state of our prisonsRome condemns \u0026#39the new barbarians\u0026#39 after tourists expose themselves in war memorial fountainHillsborough disaster: charges dropped against police chief accused of blaming Liverpool fans for tragedyItaly flash flood kills at least 11 hikers in tourist spot as rescuers search gorge for survivorsUS deports last Nazi war crimes suspect to Germany after 13-year stand-off Donald Trump fears that Mueller interview could be a \u0026#39perjury trap\u0026#39\u0026#39Daft\u0026#39 Michael Parkinson is wrong - Billy Connolly\u0026#39s brain has not been \u0026#39dulled\u0026#39, says wifeEltham hammer attack: Man charged with attempting to murder City worker and her motherFive-minute steam treatment that shrinks enlarged prostate offers hope for millions of men Woman fights to stop suspected robbers from stealing $75,000 We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 21 august 2018","story":"An ultra close-up crocodile, Spanish celebrations, Gamescom in Cologne and a paddleboarder with a bowhead whale are among Tuesday’s Pictures of the DayComment: This is the lamest Strictly line-up in years – but just wait till the dancing startsBritish tycoon killed with family in seaplane crash left £41m to Oxfam after changing his will a year earlierIran unveils new fighter jet as president says US \u0026#39knows the consequences\u0026#39 of an attack on TehranFrench plan to remove police lifeguards from beaches faces fierce opposition from local mayorsSajid Javid apologises as it emerges 160 Windrush migrants were wrongly removed or detainedWomen requesting caesareans meet \u0026#39judgemental attitudes, barriers and disrespect\u0026#39Birmingham is just one of 15 prisons of \u0026#39serious concern\u0026#39 - the charts that show the state of our prisonsRome condemns \u0026#39the new barbarians\u0026#39 after tourists expose themselves in war memorial fountainHillsborough disaster: charges dropped against police chief accused of blaming Liverpool fans for tragedyItaly flash flood kills at least 11 hikers in tourist spot as rescuers search gorge for survivorsUS deports last Nazi war crimes suspect to Germany after 13-year stand-off No more working 9 to 5?

But for children from poorer backgrounds, there are still challenges that must not be ignored.“Part of the solution will include targeted funding like the pupil premium, so it is our firm belief that this must be protected in real terms. Equally, great teaching and leadership is just as vital, so it is crucial then that government and the education sector continues to work together to ensure we attract more great teachers to areas of the greatest need.”\u0026nbspGCSE results needs urgent government intervention, say MPsLast year, a report from the Fair Education Alliance\u0026nbspfound that the poorest children in Britain are more than a year behind their wealthier peers by the time they sit their GCSEs.Angela Rayner, the shadow secretary of state for education, said: “No child should be held back from reaching their potential because of their background.“While the Tories have gifted tax cuts to big businesses, per pupil funding has been cut in real terms. It is the most vulnerable children paying the price for the resulting crisis in our education system.“The next Labour government will invest in a National Education Service, giving our schools the funding they need to raise standards and improve outcomes, so every child gets the education they deserve, regardless of their background.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspA-level results 2018 – in

Fraser flagship store on Oxford Street saved from closureHouse of Fraser’s flagship store on London’s Oxford Street has been saved from closure, after the retailer was bought out of administration by Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley earlier this month. The central London store had been earmarked for closure in June, as part of a company voluntary arrangement the group entered into in a bid to cut costs, which had become “unsustainable”.It was one of 31 branches, out of a total 59, set to shut down across the UK and Ireland, with up to 6,000 jobs at risk. However, the department store was forced to call administrators in earlier this month after failing to reach a deal with creditors. Mr Ashley’s purchase of the retailer for £90m was revealed just hours after the company collapse. He vowed to keep 80 per cent of the store network open, and said he would introduce more luxury brands such as Gucci and Prada to the product line, in an effort to make House of Fraser the “Harrods of the High Street”. James Keany of CBRE, the real estate firm which is advising House of Fraser on its property portfolio, said: This deal only happened because all parties realised it was better to keep the store open and fully operational.It was a real case of landlord and tenant genuinely working together and at great speed.Mike Ashley needs a new approach to make House of Fraser like HarrodsHouse of Fraser close to being sold for just £1 before Ashley dealHouse of Fraser cancels online orders and stops accepting gift cardsMichael Murray, Sports Direct\u0027s head of elevation, said the speed with which the deal was struck showed a commitment to turn around the House of Fraser business.He said: We said we would keep as many stores open as possible, and in less than a week we have saved the biggest store.Oxford street was meant to close in January and now it\u0027s safe, which is great news for all parties.Everyone must remember it was a bust business and we need landlords, councils and brands to pull together to save House of Fraser on the high street.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/21/13/winona-ryder-keanu-reeves.jpg","title":"keanu reeves winona ryder married dracula wedding francis ford coppola","story":"Created with Sketch.The director led the duo in a \u0027real marriage scene\u0027 as part of the 1992 filmClick to followThe Independent CultureFrancis Ford Coppola has corroborated the long-standing theory that Winona Ryder married Keanu Reeves on the set of a film he directed in 1992. \u0026nbspThe filmmaker led the duo in a wedding scene on the set of Bram Stoker’s Dracula which Ryder previously said she believes was legally binding.

It was a fairly low-key event, with a portable stage not much bigger than the park’s bandstand. The lineup was comprised of mainly tribute acts.Fast forward to 2018, and Bingley Music Live, as the event evolved into, is preparing for its biggest three-day festival yet, on the weekend of Friday 31 August. This time the roster is a little more impressive: Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds, Jake Bugg, Public Image Ltd, Shed Seven, former Spice Girl Melanie C… and all on a stage that wouldn’t be out of place at one of the summer’s big-name festivals.But, so what? Festivals are big business in the UK, and the summer calendar is stuffed with internationally-renowned acts zipping between fields across the country. Just down the road from Bradford, the Leeds Festival is twinned with its more venerable cousin Reading, and together they form the apex of the festival pyramid with old-stager Glastonbury (when it’s not having a fallow year, like this summer).But also on the calendar is Latitude, the Isle of Wight Festival, RiZE (formerly the V Festival), Wireless, Creamfields, BBC Music’s Big Weekend, Bestival… it seems that no matter where you are in the country, sling a 12in picture disc like a frisbee any time over the summer and you’re almost certain to hit a music superstar on the head.But what makes Bingley Music Live a slightly different beast is that just like the inaugural Music at Myrtle\u0026nbspevent in 1991, it is still run by the local authority. No longer free, of course, because you don’t get Noel Gallagher out of bed on the sort of money you can make up by adding a few quid on the council tax bills. But value for money certainly, compared to the big commercial festivals, and certainly pulling its weight in the ring with many of them.A spokesperson for Bradford Council said\u0026nbspthat when Music at Myrtle was set up in 1991, nobody really expected that it would become the major player it is now. She says:\u0026nbsp“When we held our first small free concert few could have envisaged that the festival would grow to attract such big names as Pet Shop Boys, Kaiser Chiefs, Manic Street Preachers, Chic and Nile Rogers, All Saints, Jess Glynne\u0026nbspand James who have all played over recent years.”The key, though, is that Bingley Music Live has grown organically. Bradford Council never set out to make a full-blown festival, it expanded a little bit year by year. She adds:\u0026nbsp“Although it has come a long way from its humble beginnings and it is unusual for a council to be involved in such a big festival we have grown it gradually and now it sees 15,000 people a day flock to the town for festival weekend.”\u0026nbspIn its early years, Music at Myrtle was split into themed days, with old rockers such as Bradford’s own Smokie on the bill, newer bands for the younger audience, and jazz. In 1998 Bradford Council partnered with local radio station Pulse to make the event a two-day festival, with Pulse using their clout and contacts book to bring in bigger names such as Liberty X, McFly, Rachel Stevens and another Bradford boy-done-good, Gareth Gates.That continued into the 2000s, until what was then billed as the Party in the Park hit its first major bump in the road. In February 2007, the event was summarily cancelled. Rising costs and declining audiences were blamed, and the Pulse’s station director, Tony Wilkinson, told the local paper,\u0026nbsp and\u0026nbspArgus, that support from the music industry for such small festivals was on the wane. He said that the record labels did not have “as many artists out on promotional tours to provide a top class running order”.Despite its small size, the festival has attracted larger, mainstream acts such as Maximo ParkWhat nobody envisaged in 2007, though, was that the music industry was in the throes of a massive shakeup. Downloading and streaming of music was in its infancy then, and music acts still made the majority of their money from physical album and single sales. However, a decade on, that situation is reversed nowadays it’s the touring of live shows and pounding the festival beat that earns pop and rock bands a crust.It would be nice to think that Bradford Council was playing something of a blinder back in 2007, but the chances are that it was pure serendipity. Either way, within a couple of months of the announcement that the Myrtle Park festival was dead, it rose from the ashes.The original plan was to scale back on the A-listers and give more of a platform to unknown, local bands. The rescue package had been put together wholly by Bradford Council, and they were obviously mindful of the budgetary restrictions of putting on a big festival but still wanting to provide residents with a music event of some description.Indeed, it was the residents of Bingley in particular who lobbied the council to save the festival in some form. This was at a time when the financial crisis was just bubbling over, and it’s fair to say that Bradford had been hit harder than most cities. Neighbouring Leeds had stolen a march on city centre development and by the mid-2000s had a thriving retail and leisure sector that put it in a stronger position to weather the credit crunch.aren’t too far removed from its neighbouring Leeds\u0026nbspBefore the financial collapse, Bradford had been on the up as well. Large swathes of the city centre had been demolished to make way for a brand new shopping centre built by Westfield. The majority of the work on taking down the tired, old buildings began in 2004, but by 2007 everything had stalled, leaving Bradford with an infamous hole in the ground that made it look as though it was ground zero of a meteor strike. It wasn’t until 2015 that the centre was completed and opened… and, to be fair, did help to kickstart a much-needed revitalisation of Bradford.So it was understandable in that atmosphere in 2007 that people wanted some form of entertainment, and Bingley Music Live was it. That year’s festival was indeed\u0026nbsppared down, but still attracted some recognisable names – Bruce Foxton’s post-Paul Weller “From The Jam” outfit, the Charlatans, the Bluetones. The following year brought the Happy Mondays, Echo and the Bunnymen, and local heroes Terrorvision.\u0026nbspBy the time the first headliners the Charlatans returned in 2012, the festival had added a third day on the Friday, and the festival was really on an upward curve.But can a local authority really justify the cost? There are partners of course, including Ticketline, Mercure Hotels and Carlsberg. But surely it doesn’t make any money?According to a Bradford Council reply to a freedom of information request last month asking for income and expenditure on Bingley Music Live over the past three years, in 2015 there was income of £946,000 against just over £1m in costs. In 2016 income was down at £822,000 against very similar costs, but last year, with costs standing at £1.15m, there was gross income of £1.3m… leaving a net surplus of £222,000.Having attended the event last year, those figure’s aren’t surprising. It was packed and money was flowing over the bars and food concessions. It’s also a very family-oriented event. And with ticket sales ensuring 15,000 come through the gates every day this year –\u0026nbspwhich the coup of booking Noel Gallagher has certainly helped with –\u0026nbspit looks likely that Bingley Music Live is on an upward trend.Being in the middle of one of the Bradford district’s big towns as well, rather than in splendid isolation on a field somewhere in Hampshire, there are extra benefits. My council spokesperson says: “The event is a big thing for Bingley’s businesses, with its many excellent pubs, bars, shops and places to eat all busy with people for the full weekend. The festival is also embraced by the local Bradford and Bingley Sports Club who provide camping for festivalgoers on their fields.”Ariana Grande and James Corden perform hit-filled version of TitanicWhy drag queen Vicky Vox is starring in Little Shop of HorrorsCamp Bestival forced to close early due to poor weather conditionsWhile Bingley Music Live might be unusual in being local authority-run, its model of being an “urban festival” is one that is becoming increasingly popular… and can pay idends for local economies.Journalist Claude Lynch, writing in CityMetric earlier this year, said that while the big, camp-out-all-weekend festivals were declining, smaller, urban festivals were thriving… and possibly because of a sense of community. He wrote: “Multiple studies into the dynamics and economics of festivals make similar arguments about how to drive ‘re-patronising’ – in other words, how to make festivalgoers want to come back next year. Evidence suggests that ‘social identification’ – having something in common with other festivalgoers – is often just as important as the quality of the music or the food. Festivals can capitalise on this boon of social identification by offering a self-contained event designed\u0026nbspwith both locals and tourists in mind. Locals are more likely to patronise events that emphasise community spirit while tourists are enthused by events that symbolise and epitomise the local culture.”From very humble beginnings 27 years ago, Bingley Music Live has survived and thrived, often against the odds, and when international superstar Noel Gallagher takes the stage in a couple of weeks’ time, it will be the culmination of the dogged determination that gets things done in this part of the world… and looks like providing the template for the future of live music.For more information go to bingleymusicliveMusic at MyrtleEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Despite its small size, the festival has attracted larger, mainstream acts such as Maximo Park"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/14/16/madonna-career-21.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-6463721  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt= 1984  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/14/16/madonna-career-21.jpg","title":"madonna 60 pop stars middle age patti smith kate bush","story":"Created with Sketch.In most\u0026nbspprofessions,\u0026nbspwomen of a certain age are invisible.

She has adopted four Malawian children and was in the country to celebrate the first anniversary of the Mercy James Centre for Pediatric Surgery and Intensive Care, named after one of her adopted daughtersMadonna and Jean Paul Gaultier arrive for the 2018 Met Gala But there is one area where the older woman is suddenly and somewhat unexpectedly thriving – rock music. Madonna celebrates her 60th birthday on Saturday. Kate Bush has just celebrated hers. In fact, they are the spring chickens. Suzi Quatro, 68, and Patti Smith, 71, are not just still rocking, they are still snarling. Cher at 72 pops up with a delightful cameo in the Mamma Mia!\u0026nbspmovie. The queen of soul, Aretha Franklin, is still recording at 76.\u0026nbspWho’d have thought it? Look back to the 1960s and there were precious few women at all in pop music, let alone older ones. In the UK, Sandie Shaw, Dusty Springfield, Marianne Faithfull and a handful of others carried the fight to the mass of male groups (the word boyband had yet to be invented).No one thought then about whether the stars would still be recording and performing in old age. Indeed the concept was unthinkable – for men as well as women, for stars as well as fans. When I put it to Paul McCartney that he must be surprised to be still going, he replied: “I do rub my eyes. I didn’t foresee it. In The Beatles we always said 10 years. But it kept on and kept on and it kept being good and we seemed to be the people who could do it. Now there is a great young generation of people who can also do it, but it tends to be that the people packing them in are the people who have the material, have hits, songs people know, and I think that’s important. I think they have stagecraft, they have an ability with an audience.”There’s no doubting that the likes of Madonna and Kate Bush have stagecraft in spades. Even in an industry that ostensibly prizes youthfulness and a certain amount of athleticism on stage, the female superstars, like the male, are now gliding into pensionable age, with fan bases, voices, charisma and downright sexiness still intact.\u0026nbspThough, when it comes to longevity, the women themselves didn’t always think it would be the case. Joni Mitchell once remarked, all too despondently: “Record companies want the look. And if you’re over 50, however well preserved, you just don’t have the look.”Maybe the look, or audience perception of the look, has changed. No one remotely cared that Kate Bush looked older than they remembered her (quelle surprise) when she made her stage comeback after 35 years in 2014. And tickets were inevitably like gold dust. I was there to note that she sounded the same, and she still exuded charisma and stage presence.She did a staggering run of 22 performances. Two things perhaps attested to the more mature Kate. The show was only part rock concert, it was also part theatre with video and dance, and even the odd comedy sketch starring her son. Also, she gave all her audiences an instruction on her website, which bore witness to the fact that she comes from an earlier generation than today’s performers. She wrote: “I very much want to have contact with you as an audience, not with iPhones, iPads or cameras.”Suzi, 68,\u0026nbspsays she\u0027ll \u0027retire when I go on stage, shake my ass and there is\u0026nbspsilence\u0027 (Getty)\u0026nbspEarlier this year I witnessed the return to live performance of Annie Lennox, at the age of 63. To raise funds for her charity she did a one-off show which was largely a chat show, interspersed with the odd song at the piano, going through her life and career. The self-deprecating humour was erting: “When I was studying at the Royal Academy of Music, I lived on £3 a week.” Pause. “Scottish people can do that.” Pause. “And we like it.”Perhaps she had stumbled across the format for the older star, a chat show setting interspersed with the odd song. Except, at the end that she knocked everyone there for six with a breathtaking 30 minute performance of Eurythmics and solo hits that showed she retained all her talent. She was the epitome of soul as she belted out Eurythmics anthems, sometimes crawling sensuously across the floor as she did so. The only surprise was that she had (lamentably) eschewed live performance for 10 years.For some female legends, the routine can be tiring. I was at Marianne Faithfull’s most recent London appearance, an intimate show at Ronnie Scott’s jazz club. Plagued by a variety of physical problems over the years, she had a walking stick and performed most of the show sitting down. It was nevertheless a beguiling evening. But notably at one point she actually pleaded with her fans to allow her to retire. “Please let me go,” she said, “I can’t go on for ever. I’m not Keith,” referring to her long-time friend Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones, definitely not one of life’s quitters.Madonna, too, is not one of life’s quitters. Her fitness routine keeps her more than show-ready, even for a show as heavy on breathless choreography as hers. But I think there is another clue to her longevity in what she said to the audience at one of her shows that I attended 15 years ago. Just before her final encore, she said in idiosyncratic style: “When I was a girl I always thought ‘grown-ups can f**k off’. But now I’m 45 years old, I have children of my own, and you know what, grown-ups can still f**k off!”As I say, it was a piece of philosophy delivered in her personal style. But it perhaps partly explains her longevity and continuing appeal. She retains the anarchic spirit she had when she burst on the scene. Female rock stars, just like their male counterparts, and possibly more so, have no intention of growing old gracefully. They haven’t just retained their vocal prowess and stage presence, they have retained the hint of adolescent rebelliousness that has always been an intrinsic part of rock’s appeal. And having met both Madonna and Suzi Quatro, I can attest that in both cases the aggressive, in yer face attitude is not just a stage technique.But rock-star rebelliousness is not the only reason that rock and pop’s biggest female stars go on and on or come back after long absences. Kate Bush was never keen on playing live and before her comeback had only done one tour of the country. But she was persuaded to perform again by her teenage son. As she had a song on one album about watching his clothes go round and round in the washing machine, it was clear that a request from him would, fortunately, carry weight.Victoria Beckham is, of course, far from the vintage of Bush, Madonna and the other older stars. But when the Spice Girls had their reunion tour, it’s interesting that she said the key reason she wanted to do it was that her children had seen Dad play football and knew all about his skills. Now was a chance for them “to see what Mummy did” before they were born.Performing for a global audience is important. But performing for the family clearly also is a factor in keeping the career going.Jonathan Morrish, a long-time senior executive at Sony record company, and now a music industry PR consultant, says: “Women generally live longer than men, so it should come as no surprise that so many as they get older seem to flourish creatively with their music and on stage. None of this is easy. I know from the many artists that I have worked with you need tenacity. So perhaps it’s the staying power they had to show at the beginning of their careers, perhaps a savvy emotional intelligence –\u0026nbspwhatever it is, I admire and welcome it. And applaud them.”\u0026nbspAnd even for those female rock and pop stars who have decided to call it a day, a new avenue has opened up: the stage musical. Right now in London, audiences can see Tina Turner on stage at one theatre, and The Supremes and all the other Motown stars at another. Or at least, one can enjoy their music and life stories, delivered by lookalikes and sound-alikes. It’s possible not just to go on into old age, but literally forever.Faithfull pleaded with a crowd at Ronnie Scotts: \u0027Please let me go. I\u0026nbspcan’t go on for ever. I’m not Keith\u0027 (Alamy)Meanwhile, there is a core of\u0026nbsp 60- and 70- something female rock stars, who thankfully show no signs of even thinking about stopping and relying on musicals to seal their immortality.No one puts it better than Suzi Quatro, celebrating 54 years in the business, who states: “I will retire when I go on stage, shake my ass and there is silence.”David Lister is the former arts editor of The IndependentEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/10/16/south-africa-school.jpg","title":"south africa corruption president ramaphosa mabuza zuma anc","story":"Created with Sketch.The ruling African National Congress pledges education and opportunity\u0026nbspfor black people\u0026nbsp– but embezzlement in the\u0026nbspdeputy president’s province has left schools so decrepit that children plunge to their death in toiletsClick to followThe IndependentSchool at Orange Farm, near Soweto: one of the ANC’s policies is to improve education for black South African childrenZiyanda\u0026nbspNkosi hated going to the bathroom at school. The pit toilets were so dark, dirty and crumbling. Many children were so afraid of them that they simply relieved themselves in the schoolyard to avoid the ordeal.But as she played with her best friend during recess, the little girl, a six-year-old first-grader, really had to go. She stepped warily inside the closet-like latrine.Even with the gentle pressure of her tiny frame, the floor caved in. Ziyanda flailed wildly, clinging to the edges of the hole, frantically trying to keep herself from falling in and drowning in the fetid pool below.“Mommy! Mommy!” she screamed, managing to hold on long enough for an older boy to run in and save her.Hundreds of parents, enraged that their warnings about the dilapidated school had been ignored for years, burst into protest a couple of days later, upending their quiet rural town for two weeks last August. They burned tires, blocked roads and demanded justice from the provincial government led by David Mabuza, a former maths teacher who had become one of the most powerful figures in the African National Congress (ANC) and was positioning himself to become South Africa’s deputy president.One of the party’s historic promises had been to provide a good education for black people, who had been deliberately denied the opportunity under apartheid. ANC leaders like Nelson Mandela often spoke about freeing black South Africans through school\u0026nbspand Mabuza, whose first big post in the province was education minister, got his political start by promising just that.But under the ANC the education system has been a\u0026nbspshambles, so gutted by corruption that even party officials are dismayed at how little students are learning, in schools so decrepit that children have plunged to their deaths in pit toilets.The rage in Ziyanda’s town grew so intense that protesters hurled stones at a local ANC leader, who narrowly escaped by whipping out his handgun and shooting randomly into the crowd, wounding two children and roiling the community all the more.Mabuza never came to the school or met with the parents –\u0026nbspand for good reason, local officials contend. The dangerous conditions were a clear reflection of his control over the province, where millions of dollars for education have disappeared into a vortex of suspicious spending, shoddy public construction and brazen corruption to fuel his political ambitions, according to government records and officials in his party.But the uprising and allegations against Mabuza did not crimp his political rise. To the contrary, only a few months later, as the ANC tried to quash national outrage over misrule by its leaders, Mabuza scored his biggest triumph by far. He was picked to become second-in-command of the entire ANC, launching him into an even more prominent post\u0026nbspas South Africa’s deputy president, second only to the nation’s leader.Mabuza may seem an odd choice, especially at a time when the ANC is desperate to purge its reputation for graft and restore its image as the rightful heir to Mandela’s legacy. After all, Mabuza’s rural province, Mpumalanga, is fairly small, has little economic clout and is widely regarded as one of the country’s most corrupt.But that is the vexing secret behind Mabuza’s spectacular climb, current and former ANC officials say: he siphoned off money from schools and other public services to buy loyalty and amass enormous power, making him impossible to ignore on the national stage and putting him in position to shape South Africa for years to come.Mabuza (second right) (AFPGetty)“He didn’t become what he is now because of his political capability,” says\u0026nbspFish Mahlalela, a senior ANC figure in the province and a national lawmaker.“No, no, it was out of money and\u0026nbspmanipulation,” he adds. “Nothing else.”Perhaps more than any other member of South Africa’s new government, Mabuza undercuts the promise of a “new dawn” in the country after the removal of President Jacob Zuma this year.Besieged by scandals that have hacked away at the ANC’s legitimacy and electoral prospects, the party installed a new president, Cyril Ramaphosa, in February. From the start, he pledged to root out corruption and finally deliver on the promise of a just South Africa for all of its citizens.But to seal his new post, Ramaphosa first had to secure the backing of Mabuza, 57, who built such a formidable political machine that he became kingmaker in the back-room negotiations to choose South Africa’s new president. After campaigning for a rival, Mabuza abruptly switched sides and joined forces with Ramaphosa, helping the two emerge from a pivotal party conference last December as the country’s undisputed leaders.Then, to the surprise of many in his province, Mabuza gave a speech just weeks after being sworn in as deputy president this year, lamenting the poor state of the schools and the “tragedies that take away the innocence of our children”. He spoke movingly of a kindergartner electrocuted at school. Of a toddler who drowned after falling into a broken pit latrine. And of a five-year-old boy whose body was discovered by his mother at the bottom of another dilapidated pit, his hand sticking out of a pool of faeces.Such deplorable conditions were all too common, he noted, symbolising the failure to provide black South Africans with a decent chance at life.“Where is our care?” Mabuza said in the speech. “What has gone wrong with our nation?”Yet under Mabuza’s leadership, millions of dollars for schools in his province have been misspent year after year, according to the national government. His province routinely spent less on poor students than required\u0026nbspand school construction projects have been riddled with inflated costs, government records show.Nearly a quarter of the primary schools in Mabuza’s province still have only dilapidated pit toilets, despite ample government funds to fix them. And during his tenure, his province was caught fabricating the passing rates on the annual national exam, enabling him to claim big leaps forward that never happened.The schools Mabuza did champion provided an easy way to funnel large amounts of money into politics, according to ANC officials, high-ranking defectors and anti-corruption groups. He pushed to build big boarding schools whose costs tripled\u0026nbspfor unexplained reasons\u0026nbspto $30m (£23m) each, alarming education experts. Some construction was so shoddy that roofs sprouted leaks soon after being finished, toilets barely worked, students lacked water, retaining walls collapsed and dormitories were missing doors, according to a provincial report.Over the years, Mabuza’s province also became known as one of South Africa’s most dangerous. Nearly 20 politicians, most from inside the ANC, were assassinated in the past two decades, some after exposing graft in public works projects.All the while\u0026nbspMabuza’s political career flourished. He attracted legions of new ANC members with government contracts, cash handouts and even KFC meals, according to current and former party officials.His sweeping recruitment drive turned his relatively insignificant province into the ANC’s second biggest voting bloc. Under the party’s delegate system, his territory became more influential than even Gauteng, the province that includes Johannesburg and Pretoria\u0026nbspwith a population three times the size and an economy nearly five times as big.Now, critics contend, Mabuza’s role as the country’s second most powerful politician casts doubt on the legitimacy of the new government and its assertions that the ANC is turning the page on corruption.Under the ANC, Mandela’s once-heralded liberation movement, tens of billions of dollars meant to lift poor black South Africans have been stolen by party leaders. Strong institutions like the tax agency have been hollowed out by party officials bent on shielding their illicit activities.But the nation’s poor schools are perhaps the ANC’s greatest betrayal of the dreams of black South Africans – some of whom have turned to burning down such institutions in protest.Mabuza, who declined to be interviewed, built his political career on the schools. Unlike other, more celebrated anti-apartheid leaders, he did not go into exile he was not imprisoned on the infamous Robben Island. Instead, he fought for the right of black South Africans to receive an equal education, a call he echoed in his recent speech.As many South Africans pin their hopes on Ramaphosa’s pledge for a fresh start, analysts say that much of the country is looking past an unpleasant truth: the new president owes his victory in part to corruption, and much of his administration’s future – as well as the country’s – rests in the hands of Mabuza.“If there is any powerful person whom Ramaphosa’s presidency actually relies on, it is Mabuza,” says\u0026nbspRalph Mathekga, the author of Ramaphosa’s Turn: Can Cyril Save South Africa?“We are being reluctant as a nation to face the reality of Mabuza,” he adds. “If Ramaphosa gets hit by a bus, Mabuza is going to be the president.”Scandal from the startThe numbers just didn’t add up, even at the beginning.After apartheid ended in 1994, Mabuza got his first big break: he became Mpumalanga’s education minister, a chance to shape the schools and generations of students attending them.He had the perfect resume. The son of farmers, Mabuza grew up here in the province, walking miles from his village to the only primary school in a nearby town. Though he often had no shoes, he always tucked in his shirt and buttoned it up to the neck, recalls\u0026nbspReginah Mhaule, a childhood peer.“He was never late,” says\u0026nbspMhaule, a longtime ally who recently became one of South Africa’s two deputy foreign ministers.A bright student, Mabuza ultimately took one of the few jobs available to black South Africans back then. He taught maths at the local high school and later became a founding leader of a teachers’ association.Poor schooling was a major spark in the anti-apartheid movement, most notably in Soweto in 1976, when thousands of students protested the introduction of Afrikaans as the language of instruction. In Mabuza’s province, teachers and students began organising against white minority rule in the early 1980s.The teachers were at the centre\u0026nbspof the movement, says\u0026nbspSandile Sukati, a teacher who recruited Mabuza into the main student organisation. Mabuza quickly stood out, he says, travelling far and wide to build ties among anti-apartheid groups.Museum of London  Henry GrantMuseum of London  Henry GrantA United Nations photograph by Kay MuldoonCourtesy of the News LineCourtesy of the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern AfricaSATIS (Southern Africa - the Imprisoned Society)Museum of London  Henry GrantMuseum of London  Henry GrantA United Nations photograph by Kay MuldoonCourtesy of the News LineCourtesy of the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern AfricaSATIS (Southern Africa - the Imprisoned Society)“He was a leader in his own right,” Sukati says.But after apartheid ended, Mabuza quickly ran into trouble, leading to the province’s first big scandal of the democratic era.\u0026nbspIn 1997, three years into his tenure as education minister, the schools were performing poorly, especially on the national obsession: the annual matriculation exams that determine whether students graduate from high school. The passing rate in his province was 46 per cent that year, slightly below the national average.Mabuza was feeling the pressure, particularly as powerful ANC leaders returned from exile, often with military credentials that overshadowed his own, several current and former ANC officials say.Sukati, who worked under Mabuza at the education department, recalls Mabuza\u0026nbsptelling some of the teachers: “I am in a tight situation.”\u0026nbspThe next year brought a stunning improvement. The passing rate inexplicably jumped to 72 per cent – an incredible turnaround that catapulted Mpumalanga to second place\u0026nbspamong the nation’s nine provinces.“I was suspicious,” says\u0026nbspSukati, who is now a senior education official. “It couldn’t just happen like that.”A whistleblower exposed the cheating a few weeks later. The real passing rate, authorities announced, was under 53 per cent. Moreover, the doctoring had taken place inside Mabuza’s residence, where he met with a small circle of bureaucrats, some of whom were later fired.An investigation was never completed. Mabuza never admitted wrongdoing or suffered any significant consequences. Dropped as education minister, he was named head of housing instead.Ever since, Mabuza’s career has been remembered for that scandal, one that helped establish the kind of culture of impunity in his province that has tarnished the ANC across South Africa..“I think\u0026nbspthe man, he had to be charged, but unfortunately I don’t know what went wrong,” says\u0026nbspRonnie Malomane, an ANC official who was taught maths by Mabuza in the early 1980s. “They were just giving him position after position.”Nationally, Mabuza’s standing kept rising, propelled by his success at attracting new party members. In 2009, Zuma appointed him premier of all of Mpumalanga province.But Mabuza raised more red flags, stripping some of the decision-making power over government projects from local officials and concentrating it in his own office. He justified the move – called the “Rapid Implementation Unit” – as a way to act quickly. Others had a different explanation.“That’s how he managed to loot,” says\u0026nbspCollen Sedibe, a former ANC leader who grew up on the same street as Mabuza and worked under him in the provincial housing department.Treasury officials in the province say they are now investigating the irregular expenditures “incurred through the contracts arranged centrally by the Office of the Premier”.But parents, officials and educators had warned about the damage from corruption and neglect for years, pointing to the painfully overcrowded classrooms and decaying, apartheid-era schools.‘They wanted to kill me’It took four days of rage before the local ANC councillor showed up.The councillor, Justice Twelve Siboza, explained that he had been busy the week Ziyanda fell into the toilet, tending to another corner of his ward. Other activities had also drawn his attention: he is a gospel singer with his own radio show, so he crisscrosses the region to perform at weddings and funerals.By the time he got to Ziyanda’s school, hundreds of parents had closed off the unpaved roads, furious that their grievances had been met with near silence from the ANC’s leaders.Siboza made sure to bring a gun. Politics is dangerous in South Africa, sometimes lethal, he says.The ANC has a grip on the area around the school because most residents, aside from the lucky few working at the sugar cane plant, are poor and rely on the party for government jobs, contracts or monthly welfare grants.It is an area Mabuza knows well. He began his ascent inside the ANC as the head of this part of the province. It was once part of a homeland set aside for black people by the apartheid government. To this day, several ANC officials say, Mabuza has kept a hold on it through powerful proxies.Some see a deep cynicism behind the conditions in the schools. When black South Africans become educated and move into the middle class, their loyalty to the party tends to wane, recent elections have shown. So by perpetuating a culture of dependence, critics contend, the ANC ensures its dominance.But Mhaule, the childhood peer of Mabuza, rejects\u0026nbspany suggestion that the ANC had failed to prioritise education.Officials like Mhaule say the rising pass rate on the national high school exam provides clear evidence of progress. But the figures can be misleading. The number of students taking the exam has declined in the past two years. Weaker students who would drag down the rate are being held back, education experts say.About 600 protesters gathered at the school that cold Friday morning when Siboza, the local ANC councillor, arrived with a police escort. As he moved to talk to the parents, demonstrators showered him with rocks.“They wanted to kill me,” the councillor says.Siboza made a run for it, reaching for the hip holster under his brown overcoat. He took out his gun – firing three times and hitting two teenagers, a girl and a boy.Agreement Mashele, the school board chairman, was shocked. “This man is a church member,” he says.A few days later, the ANC councillor visited the children he had wounded.“The councillor said he was very sorry,” says\u0026nbspthe girl, Siphesihle Ngobeni, whose left leg was grazed by a bullet. The councillor pleaded with her not to press charges and gave her about $15, she says. She used the money to buy sanitary pads.The boy’s injury was more severe. His father, Petros Thobela, who had gone to the same primary school and did not have a job, accepted a similar apology and compensation of, according to the councillor, about $150.The boy’s mother, Nobuhle Ndlovu, who does odd jobs, deplores\u0026nbspthe state of education.“They promise,” she says, “and they just disappear.”Still, she would remain loyal to the governing party.“Yes, of course, I vote ANC,” she says. “It’s our freedom.”‘He always had money in his house’The protests spilled into September, but the country’s attention was fixed on another battle: the national push to replace Zuma as South Africa’s president.The all-important ANC party election was only a few months away, and officials in Mabuza’s province were bracing to see whether his years of hard work had paid off.In early October, the ANC released the delegate breakdown, with good news for Mabuza: his previously low-ranking province was now the ANC’s second most powerful.Mabuza owed his outsize influence to a single feat. In the past decade, ANC membership in his province had skyrocketed nearly 190 per cent, eclipsing the national increase of less than 60 per cent. No other province came close to matching Mpumalanga’s explosive growth.But Mabuza’s numbers were as cooked as his high school passing rates, current and former ANC officials contend.In South Africa, taxes are collected by the national government, which distributes the money to provinces. The provinces then use the money – with little oversight from above.Treasury officials in Mpumalanga say that “irregular expenditures” more than doubled in the previous two budget years, particularly in education, housing and health.Wages account for most of the education and health budgets. So money is usually siphoned off by politicians and business allies through contracts for services or construction, ANC officials say. When costs are suspiciously high, schools are poorly built or facilities are badly maintained, they say, it is often a warning that money is being skimmed, at the students’ expense.Thousands in Israel protest draft law that would ‘exclude’ ArabsGrenfell victims were subject to ‘social apartheid’, says Diane AbbottSouth Africa is the most unequal country in the world, says World BankMandela’s letters chart his heartbreaking struggle from behind barsAs premier, Mabuza promoted the construction of big boarding schools, or mega-schools, in farm areas to improve rural education. Since 2012, the province has completed five, with two more in the pipeline.For reasons that have not been explained, the price of each school has ballooned from $11m to around $30m.Asked whether Mabuza wanted the mega-schools to facilitate the theft of public funds, Mhaule, his former education minister, laughs\u0026nbspand says:\u0026nbsp“I don’t know.”But other officials say the mega-schools were overpriced projects to reward Mabuza’s allies and finance his ANC membership drive.Mabuza\u0026nbspwas sworn in as deputy president in February. “His passion,” reads his official biography, “still remains in education.”Minutes after the swearing-in, he faced questions about corruption and political killings in his province. “There’s nothing to set straight,” he told the national public broadcaster.“I’m here to serve South Africans,” he added. “Let’s give this government a chance.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2014/12/08/11/Cold-call.jpg","title":"nuisance calls daily torment threequarters contacted which survey","story":"Created with Sketch.Two in five feel intimidated by unsolicited sales and marketing callsClick to followThe IndependentUnder new proposals, the Information Commissioner’s Office could be given powers to fine company directors who break the law up to £500,000Almost three-quarters of people in the UK have received at least one nuisance call in the past month and the problem has become a “daily torment” for some, according to a new report.Consumer group Which? said two in five of those it surveyed said they felt intimidated by nuisance sales or marketing calls.Those ultimately responsible for nuisance calls often evade punishment because under current rules only companies can be fined, rather than the directors running them.

We will be reviewing what we do post-Brexit.”Pushed on whether he supported the target, he said: “Naturally as a member of the cabinet I support the government’s policy but I think that we do need to look in the future at how we match our employment opportunities with our migration policy.isn’t it- Don’t you want to ditch it”“I think the big problem with free movement from Europe was that people were able to come to the United Kingdom without having a job and they were able to use our public services like schools and hospitals and housing without ever having contributed and I don’t think the British public thought that was fair and neither do I.”Anti-immigration politicians have attacked the government’s consistent failure to hit the target since it came in, whilst those in government around Ms May have been pushing for it to be scrapped for years.We do need to look in the future at how we match our employment opportunities with our migration policyCurrent Home Secretary Mr Javid has refused to explicitly say that he supported the target, but did insist he remained committed to the Conservative Party’s manifesto.George Osborne, the former Conservative chancellor, said last year that no senior ministers supported the approach.Net migration rose to 282,000 in 2017, up from 249,000 in 2016 while net migration from the EU fell to 101,000 in 2017, down from 133,000 in 2016 to its lowest level since 2012.Even after Brexit, the fact that non-EU migration was also above 100,000 in the most recent figures shows just how difficult it could be to meet the target.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereDrop the TargetEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/01/08/07/australia-heatwave.jpg  width= 2500  height= 1874  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/01/08/07/australia-heatwave.jpg","title":"australia climate change malcolm turnbull prime minister leadership","story":"Created with Sketch.‘Cheaper power has always been our number one priority’Click to followThe IndependentAustralia pulls out of climate change targets agreed at Paris conferenceEmbattled Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull has abandoned plans to set a new emissions reduction target, following a revolt by MPs in his own government amid a potential leadership challenge.Mr Turnbull’s signature energy policy – the National Energy Guarantee – contained a pledge to cut Australia’s emissions by 26 per cent, based on 2005 levels, by 2030. The laws\u0026nbspwould have helped the country meet its obligations under the Paris climate agreement.But after rebel Liberal Party MPs led by former prime minister Tony Abbott threatened to vote against the legislation – which would have triggered a crisis of confidence in Mr Turnbull – the PM decided to back down.As Greece burns, the Tories are signing off a laughable fracking billGlobal temperatures to be ‘abnormally high’ for at least four years2018 will be fourth-hottest year on record, climate scientists predictDealing with climate change by geoengineering Earth ‘would not work’It was Mr Abbott himself who signed Australia up to the Paris climate agreement, and it was he who at the time announced the\u0026nbspemissions reductions target of\u0026nbsp26\u0026nbspper cent from 2005 levels.In 2014 he even said Australia could reduce emissions by up to 28 per cent, saying:\u0026nbsp“There’s a definite commitment to 26 per cent\u0026nbspbut we believe under the policies that we’ve got, with the circumstances that we think will apply, that we can go up to 28 per cent.”Despite the boast, he was later reported to have told colleagues he was “misled” while in Paris, and recently argued that using energy policy as a means of reducing emissions is “madness”.\u0026nbsp“In politics you have to focus on what you can deliver,” Mr Turnbull said on Monday, adding the legislation would not pass parliament if it contained an emissions target.“Cheaper power has always been our number one priority when it comes to energy policy,” he told reporters.Mr Abbott has reportedly thrown his support behind Peter\u0026nbspDutton, Australia’s home affairs minister, for a possible leadership challenge, though Mr Turnbull said he had the support of his party colleagues including Mr Dutton.Efforts to introduce climate change combatting emissions targets have repeatedly frustrated Australian politicians.In 2007 Kevin Rudd famously declared climate change “the great moral issue of our generation”, but was unable to push through the changes he wanted while PM, eventually dropping them. His Labour party successor, Julia Gillard, faced an aggressive campaign led by Mr Abbott against her plans to reduce pollution, in which she was called a liar and was personally derided by conservative campaigners.MPs his government has dropped plans to put an emissions reduction target into legislation (EPA)The current debate over the impact of energy policy on climate change has seen even greater polarisation.Mr Turnbull’s failure to win support for the emissions target, comes despite a recent history of worsening wildfires and searing temperatures.

Seven per cent said they did not know.The Parthenon sculptures in London are an important representation of ancient Athenian civilisation in the context of world historyLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn has previously indicated that he would return the statues to Greece.A government spokesperson said: “The Parthenon sculptures are the legal property of the British Museum. They are free of charge to view and are visited by people from all over the world.“Decisions relating to their care are taken by the trustees of the British Museum, free from political interference.”A spokesperson for the British Museum said the Parthenon sculptures were “a part of the world’s shared heritage and transcend political boundaries” and were a part of “the story of cultural achievement throughout the world” which the institution’s exhibits tell.World news in picturesA Palestinian man throws his child in the air following morning prayers marking the first day of Eid al-Adha celebrations on the compound known to Muslims as al-Haram al-Sharif in Jerusalem\u0027s Old City.

MP lashes out at Brexit scaremongeringOf all the food producers exporting to Europe, the shellfish sector would be the most vulnerable if we have no deal.In Wales, 92 percent of registered vessels specialise in catching shellfish such as lobster, crab, whelks and mussels.In 2017, Welsh fishermen sold 90 percent of their shellfish to EU markets, contributing a total \u0026pound38.8m to the fishing sector.Speaking to the BBC, Mr Williams added: Any delay in the transit of these commodities will cause a lot of problems as they are live shellfish and they need to be supplied as soon as possible.Fishermen say they would go out of business in just four weeks if Britain leaves the EU with no deal (Image: )If they\u0027re held up in ports, they can deteriorate, lose value and even die.It\u0027s been calculated that the industry would not be able to hold on more than four weeks of not being able to sell products into Europe.Because of the high cost of fishing enterprises, people expect to get a quick turnaround of money to support their businesses.He insisted the British and Welsh governments must provide financial assistance to UK\u0027s fishing industry if no Brexit agreement is made.                \u0027SHARED challenge\u0027 May hits back after Italy demands UK take migran...

Those who have are mostly Remainers who would now vote Leave.Many people are deeply sceptical about the tedious stumbling blocks that have bogged down the process.Almost half — 48 per cent — think the political classes are deliberately making heavy weather of Brexit in the hope it will convince the public to change their minds.Six in ten believe the EU is out to punish the UK by refusing to compromise in talks on trade and free movement, our Deltapoll survey says.But the vast majority are convinced a departure deal will be hammered out in the end, even if it takes longer than expected.Former Cabinet minister Priti Patel last night said: “The Sun on Sunday’s poll shows that the British people ultimately believe we can build a stronger future for our country outside the EU.Nearly half of adults believe the weather goes in cycles and that heatwaves come around from time to time.Barely a third of voters believe the human race is responsible and that we will have more extreme temperatures unless we act soon.Our poll found that a majority of 18 to 24-year-olds blame global warming for the hottest British summer since 1976.But in every other age group, most people think it has little or nothing to do with climate change.Six in ten over-55s believe it was “just another hot summer”.“It is clear that most people are sick to the back teeth of being ­bullied by the EU and listening to politicians at home erecting all kinds of obstacles to prevent them honouring the referendum result.“The Government should sit up and heed the results of this poll. That means being tougher in negotiations with Brussels and doing what the nation voted for — to get Britain out of the EU.”Most people — 55 per cent — are against a second in-out referendum, according to our poll.Forty per cent think we should just leave in 222 days’ time as planned with or without a deal.Fifteen per cent want a vote on the final deal, but not a re-run on whether or not Britain leaves the EU.Overall, only 13 per cent have changed their minds on Brexit since the referendum on June 23, 2016. Most of those were once Remainers. Fifteen per cent of them admit to having shifted their view — equivalent to 2.4 million people.That compares with just 11 per cent of Brexit backers, 1.9 million, who have had a rethink.Ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said the poll had “nailed the lie” that many people regret voting Leave.Deltapoll director Martin Boon said the findings show most people are taking a tougher stance on Brexit.He added: “Half the public believe themselves to be under siege from the political classes trying to change their minds.“But the message they are sending back is that they haven’t changed their minds and the likelihood is they won’t.”Voters are evenly divided on whether there will be a hard border after Brexit. Twenty-two per cent say there will, 21 per cent say otherwise.There is also a split over whether leaving the EU will prove a historic mistake. Forty-four per cent think it will, 30 per cent believe it will not. One statement united 59 per cent of voters — “I’m really bored by Brexit.”Separately, our poll found that most people think former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson was right to raise the difficult and sensitive issue of women wearing burkas. Two-thirds believe he was right to start a debate about the Muslim veil.But some say he should say sorry because he went “over the top” by comparing wearers to “bank robbers” or “letterboxes”. Half of Tory supporters and 36 per cent of all voters believe his remarks were right and he has nothing to apologise for.A further 28 per cent say he went a little too far with his language and should admit it.He gets no support from 23 per cent, who say his remarks were offensive and he should say sorry.Deltapoll interviewed an online sample of 1,904 adults aged 18+ from August 14 to 16. Results have been weighted to the profile of all GB adults.The Labour leader has defied the odds after damaging revelations about the friends he keeps.Half of voters believe Labour has a problem with anti-Semitism. More than a third say Mr Corbyn is part of that problem.But a Sun on Sunday Deltapoll has Labour three points ahead of the Tories.If there were an election tomorrow, Labour would be 31 seats short of a majority but with enough MPs to form a government with Scottish Nationalist support.Tory backing has been sapped as traditional supporters switch to Ukip in protest over the PM’s weak handling of Brexit.There is little to celebrate for any of the party leaders who all get negative popularity ratings.Mr Corbyn scores minus 35, while Theresa May is on minus 26 — only two points better than floundering Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable.Today, a Sun on Sunday poll shows that idea to be total codswallop.Voters simply want our politicians to get on with delivering Brexit.The majority of people have not changed their mind since the referendum.Our poll shows those that have are mostly Remainers who would now vote Leave.Project Fear has never worked, and it is not going to suddenly start working now. The public are wise to it.Our poll makes it clear that fudging Brexit would unleash serious anger among the electorate. The Government should take notice.Almost half of voters already reckon that the political classes in Britain are making heavy weather of Brexit, in the vain and misguided belief that they can get the public to change their mind.Meanwhile, the drop in support for Theresa May in the polls and Ukip’s rise is a further indication of what the public thought of her Chequers proposals.Millions more will abandon the Tories if Brexit ends up being fudged.Remoaners and Brussels have done their best since the Leave vote to make us think we made a terrible mistake and that the cards are stacked in the EU’s favour.Well, today’s poll is clear.We didn’t and they’re not.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Even those of us who will never hit the big time have an Instagram audience waiting to “like” our every selfie.So this is just the logical next step towards making cosmetic surgery available to the masses, rather than the few.Some have argued that Superdrug Botox is actually a good thing, because it bridges the gap between the elite Harley Street options — where you pay several hundred pounds for an appointment with an “aesthetic doctor” — and the more backstreet treatments carried out by hairdressers with just a few hours of training.I disagree. Being able to buy a syringe or two of Botox when you are out shopping for your hairspray legitimises — and normalises — the act of injecting poison in your skin in the name of beauty.Being able to buy Botox over the counter, so to speak, makes it seem like no big deal — just another tick in the “maintenance” box, and as reasonable as tinting your lashes or getting your ears pierced.And that is the problem. All decisions we make about our appearance boil down to personal choice. And if it makes someone feel better to tinker cosmetically or surgically with their natural looks, that’s their choice. No one should judge them for it.But there is a wider problem.Increasingly, women think that whatever they look like naturally isn’t good enough. More and more, the “solution” is invasive cosmetic enhancement.A mainstream shop making Botox available for less than 100 quid is surely only going to add to the pressure some women feel to change their appearance using more than just make-up.Superdrug presents itself as responsible because it will refuse to treat under-25s, when other clinics will.That is shocking — not so much that some clinics WILL treat under-25s but that anyone so young could think they need Botox.You can’t blame Superdrug for this epidemic. It is simple supply and demand.The question is: Why the growing desire among women to look frozen?It’s not like you can get away with saying you’ve not had it when you have, because it’s so obvious.I’ve got a friend whose husband jokes that she needs to hold up little signs saying “happy” or “angry” when she feels an emotion, since her face is so paralysed by botulism.While I’m a big believer in your body, your choice, I’m also a believer in scratching the right itch.The truth is if you feel good about yourself, you look good. If you feel bad and lack confidence, nothing, no amount of Botox or fillers, will ever change that.Just look at Meg from Love Island, above, who, even after an estimated £40,000 worth of plastic surgery, is still massively insecure.Because it’s not what’s on the outside that counts, it’s what’s on the inside.The problem is our society tends to give far too much weight to the outside. That is especially the case for women, but increasingly for men, too.I realise all of this is easy to say, harder to act on. I’m as susceptible as the next person to comparing myself with ­others more beautiful — and possibly more airbrushed — and finding myself lacking.I’m just glad that, when that happens, I know the thing that will make me feel better is far more likely to be self-acceptance than Botox.After all, if you tighten a prune you don’t get a grape — you just get a tight prune!So the really big question is, how to achieve self-acceptance when we are surrounded by all these images of perfection?Well, we are all on our own journey with that one but I’ve got some suggestions which might help.The first is to focus on what you have, rather than what you don’t. And the second is to never, ever compare yourself to anyone else.Forget Botox, you can have that advice for free.You’re welcome.We all enjoyed cheering on the Three Lions players that would quickly become our heroes during the World Cup in Russia this summer.Sadly, those heady days are over and we were reminded of the seamier side of sport this week with the arrest of England rugby union ace Danny Cipriani.His embarrassing brawl outside a Jersey nightclub came hot on the heels of England cricket’s Ben Stokes’ trial over his clash with two men during a night out.Stokes was cleared, but what links these sorry sagas is our drinking culture, which dictates that consuming excessive amounts of alcohol is a normal way of letting off steam.Sportsmen are supposed to be role models, as they influence young people and need to keep themselves in good physical shape.But as long as we think it is OK to binge and push our bodies to the limits rather than sip a few drinks, then violence, injuries and stupid mistakes will continue to be a regular feature of our nights out.And if you are an England sports star, then public shame is just one of the tragic consequences – along with the end of your career – that you might have to face.Why should anyone be surprised at the news that sexual harassment in the police force is rife?Let’s face it, it happens everywhere. So why should the police be any exception?I thought they might hold themselves to higher standards. But no.A new survey reveals that dirty jokes, inappropriate touching, leering and being pressured to have sex are daily issues for many police staff.In a survey of almost 1,800 police staff in England, Wales and Scotland, half had heard sexualised jokes and one in five had received a sexually explicit email or text from a colleague.Shockingly, one in five had also been touched in a way that made them feel uncomfortable.Our head of police at West Ham is a woman.She is smart, tough, brave and would never put up with this type of behaviour.Part of the problem is that many women accept these actions as “normal” and don’t even know how to object. We must learn to stop putting up with it.But it is much more important that men learn what is OK and what is not.End of.Jacinda Ardern – the Prime Minister of New Zealand, who has continued to work since becoming a mother in June – was criticised this week for “using her baby as a prop” after she was seen breastfeeding her daughter at a public meeting.I guess whoever coined that phrase has never had the experience of looking after a baby who needs to be fed – right NOW.Nor will they have dealt with the very loud consequences of that failing to happen.Instead, what about congratulating Jacinda on doing such a great job of being a working mum?We said farewell to two legends last week, let’s remember them with this wonderful meme....So interesting that the day after A-level results arrived, more than 26,000 university places were still available.An Ipsos Mori poll found that while most students still think university is “important”, that is down from 86 per cent five years ago to 75 per cent now.Since a degree is expensive – and no guarantee of a job – you can see why people are questioning the validity of one.However, there is no viable alternative.There are just 10,000 degree-level apprenticeships available, compared with 300,000 university places, according to Sir Peter Lampl, of the Sutton Trust.We need to think how we prepare young people for work and we need more technical qualifications at degree level that offer the chance of a bright future.GOT a story?

It is whether the PM herself will seize the initiative and signal her own plan to jump before she is pushed.The undeclared contest has transformed Britain’s negotiating stance — from Theresa May’s meek, slow-motion surrender to a strident demand for a decent, honourable settlement. The good news is that while MPs have been away on holiday, Brussels has begun to blink.At long last it has dawned on our EU neighbours that they have more to lose from a messy Brexit than we do.Forfeiting the UK’s £40billion ransom payment — plus our annual £12billion contribution — would instantly cripple the EU expansionary budget plans and plunge poorer nations such as Greece into crisis.Car and pharmaceutical giants, not to mention French farmers, who export vast stocks to the UK, would be plunged into crisis. Cooperation on crime, security and defence would be at risk. Governments across Europe are now piling pressure on Brussels to see sense.Tory leadership wannabes have sniffed the way the wind is blowing.The Tories won’t pick another Remainer as party leader. Nor does this Government have a prayer at the next election unless it can see off Nigel Farage and his Ukip insurgents with a deal that satisfies the 52 per cent who voted Leave.This explains a sudden enthusiasm at the top for stating the blindingly obvious: Britain will survive a clean Brexit, while an obstructive Brussels will be diminished.After two years of being bossed around by EU bully Michel Barnier, senior Cabinet ministers are coming out as born-again Eurosceptics. Foreign Secretary and repentant Remainer Jeremy Hunt admits Britain will experience some turbulence, but says the EU will be damaged “for a generation”.His warning is echoed by Brexit supremo Dominic Raab, who has rubbished “Project Fear” stories about food and medicine shortages.While loyally insisting a deal is “still the most likely outcome”, Mr Raab insists Britain will cope with the alternative.Hunt and Raab are now openly jockeying for the top job — along with Home Secretary Sajid Javid, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson, Treasury chief Liz Truss and a host of others.Significantly, Michael Gove seems out of the race after endorsing Mrs May’s Chequers sellout. So where does this leave Boris Johnson? If tens of thousands of grass- roots Tory supporters have anything to do with it, he would be way out in front. As things stand, they don’t.BoJo is out of office and fighting confected outrage over Muslim face masks. Enemies such as the priestly Dominic Grieve threaten to quit the party if he is elected.Under present rules, Boris needs enough support from fellow MPs to be one of the two candidates submitted to party members for a final verdict. His rivals will do anything to stop him — which is why party activists are demanding rule changes to allow any MP with 20 votes to enter the final ballot.Boris has gone quiet — but not for long. He is reportedly planning a nationwide tour — complete with bright-red battle bus — trashing Mrs May’s Chequers deal and calling for a clean Brexit.There will be plenty of opportunities for car-crash interviews and zipwire-style TV images. But the bookies aren’t the only ones making BoJo the clear favourite as Britain’s next Prime Minister.He names Somalis, Ethiopians, North and Central Africans and Afghans as being responsible for the knife-gang slaughter of young black and Asian men.“Race is part of the picture,” says the equality campaigner. “Failing to point this out impedes the fight against these crimes and imperils yet more children of colour.”He is right, isn’t he?But how long before this decent black man is himself accused of racism for daring to tell this unvarnished truth?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I saw a gap in the market.The woman I want to dress [is] someone whos probably got a house in the country. She lives a dual life and wants to look sharp in both. It was me, really.The couples famous acquaintances dont stop at having Idris Elba and Craig David perform as a double act at their wedding.Jades luxury label has become hugely popular on the toff circuit since it launched in 2008.Megan Markle wore one of her coats earlier this year and her tweed creations have been seen on everybody from her old friends, Made in Chelsea’s Ollie Locke and Georgia Toffolo, to Love Island’s Chris Hughes, and Zara Phillips.When Becks and his boys were recently photographed trying to blend into Cotswolds life, the baker boy caps came from Holland Cooper.In February 2016, Julian was forced to sell four million shares, costing a £52 million stake, to fund his divorce from his wife of just under seven years, Charlotte Abbot, with whom he has two children.It was a staggering sum, especially given the couple only married in 2009, long after his clothing brand was off the ground.Earlier this year he reportedly cashed in £17.8 million of shares in what was thought to also be a bill for the same divorce.During their time together they lived in a £3.25m seven-bedroomed sprawling farmhouse in Gloucestershire.Although she has since deleted her Instagram account, the Daily Mail reported that Charlotte had then herself moved on to dating a younger man, posting pictures of them skiing and at black tie events together. Newlywed Jade says of marrying a man so much older than her: The age gap doesnt worry me. When you put it on paper you go Oooh, but I never think about it when were together. We have so many synergies and our morals are very similar.Since stepping back from Superdry, Julian is now pursuing cider brewing and a boutique chain of hotels, restaurants and pubs.But whatever happens with the Brexit negotiations, you can be sure that it wont make much of a dint in their ultra-glam and jet-set lifestyle.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s about attacking Jews.”Stephen Pollard told The Sun: “The recommendation that activists who want to rid Parliament of Zionists use the Jewish Chronicle for a hit-list of targets exposes the truth: that they use the word Zionist as a euphemism for Jew.A Labour Party spokesman said: “We don’t comment on staffing matters.”The latest anti-semitism howler came as Mr Corbyn claimed he “could not remember” if he had shared a takeaway with bloodthirsty boss of Hamas following The Sun’s revelations that he had bragged about it.Despite recounting the long dinner in a 2010 column for the communist Morning Star newspaper, yesterday Mr Corbyn told reporters A takeaway dinner? I dont remember any takeaway dinners.I have met many people from many aspects of the Palestinian cause as a way of bringing about dialogue, as a way of bringing about peace.During a visit to Scotland, the veteran lefty was also probed about comments made by former Labour MP Jim Sheridan who said he had lost “respect and empathy” for Jews because of the antisemitism crisis.Mr Corbyn said: Its completely wrong what he said. He did withdraw it later on, he has been suspended from membership, there will be an independent investigation - independent of me that is - so I cant comment any further.

Will our current free movement regime be rebadged as a “Labour Mobility Framework”?Such a move, speculated on in the media this week, would be politically toxic and very poorly timed. It would also betray her own instincts, which she rightly gave voice to when she became Prime Minister.Striking a chord with millions of people angry and alienated at their voices being ignored by the political elite on immigration and the downside of globalisation, delivered for her record poll ratings then and a real feeling of hope that at last people in power were listening.Yes, the main driver for the Leave vote was about democracy, independence and national sovereignty but it was also about the fundamental choice that a UK outside the EU would have: Who comes to our country and on what basis – decided by our own Parliament.Voters have noticed that the tightening of the labour market and record employment levels, as revealed by the Office for National Statistics last week, mean that at long last real wages – i.e. pay packets less inflation – are slowly rising and that belatedly big business is beginning to move away from an over reliance on cheap foreign labour, undercutting the pay and conditions of indigenous workers and giving rise to higher welfare dependency.It might seem a radical concept, but such employers might just have to pay workers decent wages, train them better, improve their skills and try hard to retain them. That’s why EU workers are still coming to the UK in huge numbers, despite ridiculous Project Fear stories to the contrary.So yes – Brexit will mean higher pay for British workers! Top businessman Stuart Rose, briefly spokesman for the Remain campaign, accurately predicted such a development before the EU Referendum.Regrettably, the multinationals’ trades union, the CBI didn’t get the message: No surprise that they now want no restrictions on foreign workers post Brexit – in other words an endless pool of cheap labour just like now.Likewise, they’re happy to defend the growing gap between average pay and that of FTSE 100 bosses.Ironically, The Prime Minister could still snatch victory from defeat on this issue, notwithstanding her lamentable record as Home Secretary on reducing net immigration to the tens of thousands.The alternative White Paper which David Davis and his Ministers were working on prior to it being dumped at Chequers, was much more evidence-based and looked to many workable international examples of mobility agreements between first world countries like Australia, the United States, Japan and Canada, as a model for future EU-UK immigration arrangements, to our mutual benefit.The policy would have been informed by the Migration Advisory Committee which reports next month, focused on what was the sensible policy for the whole of the UK and all business sectors rather than a noisy minority and their well-paid advocates.It also sought to end the systemic bias towards low paid and low skilled EU citizens over the well qualified from across the globe.It was pro controlled immigration and not about pulling up the drawbridge and that’s where most British voters are now.Will Theresa May use the opportunity to keep faith with the millions of people in the north and the midlands, in south Wales and south west, who look to her to keep her promises and defend their interests and not just those of the well heeled, the multinationals and those comfortable with the Brussels status quo?Will putative leadership contender Sajid Javid have the courage to resist further attempts at craven supplication on continuing free movement in all but name? Will Conservative MPs who benefited from the highest ever blue collar vote for their party in history, ignore their own electors’ concerns and just accept further concessions?The electoral prospects of her party depend on it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Appropriation.In the eyes of today’s politically correct policers of “wrongthink”, there is no greater crime than cultural appropriation.Cultural appropriation is when people embrace the grub or music or ideas of a culture that isn’t theirs.Like when Kylie Jenner wore her hair in cornrows. Or when Katy Perry donned a Japanese kimono. Or when drunken lads on a university campus put on sombreros as they neck shots of tequila.All of these things have been branded cultural appropriation by today’s potty warriors against “offensiveness”.And to this blacklist of things we must never appropriate, we can now add non-native foods.This is not the first time Jamie Oliver has been criticised for making foreign dishes. Two years ago foodies were up in arms when he put chorizo in paella — which the Spanish tend not to do.Clearly Jamie Oliver is only allowed to cook “white” British food, like roast beef and toad-in-the-hole.Not Cornish pasties or Yorkshire puddings, though.After all, what right does a man born in Essex have to appropriate the food of Northerners and people from the West Country? And presumably Dawn Butler only ever tucks into Jamaican dishes.If it is cultural appropriation for Oliver to make jerk grub, surely it must be cultural appropriation for Ms Butler to rattle up a bit of sushi?This would be the crazy conclusion to the war on cultural appropriation — none of us would ever dip into other cultures and experience their pleasures.What is most depressing about the Butler/Oliver spat is that it confirms how mainstream the miserabilist, divisive PC worldview has gone.It used to be just time-rich posh kids and snowflakes on university campuses who raged against cultural appropriation.Like the officious students at Cambridge who banned an Around The World in 80 Days fancy-dress party for fear students would wear “culturally appropriated” costumes.Or the clipboard bores at the University of East Anglia who banned students from wearing sombreros.Or the easily offended muppets at the University of Ottawa in Canada who banned a yoga class, because for white people to indulge in this ancient Indian discipline is an act of “cultural genocide”.I bet you never knew that when you do a pelvic tilt at your local gym you are being a horrible racist.Now, however, with Butler’s missive against the crimes of Jamie Oliver, this PC claptrap has crept from the fringes into the political centre. Butler is Shadow Secretary for Women and Equalities, and she is very close to Jeremy Corbyn.Is this what we should expect under a Corbyn government? Finger-wagging at anyone who deviates from PC rules?The worst thing about the clampdown on cultural appropriation is how divisive it is. The message is that we must always stick with our own cultures and never borrow from others.Didn’t that used to be known as racism?In recent years, Beyonce has been slammed for wearing a sari. Glastonbury has banned attendees from wearing Native American head-dresses. Selena Gomez was ridiculed for doing a Bollywood- inspired dance on US TV.This new racial divisiveness makes ­culture stiff and dull.Anthony Horowitz, author of the Alex Rider teen spy novels, says he was “warned off” from writing a black character. Apparently a white writer like him ­cannot understand the black experience.Is this really the world we want to live in? Where people never mix and never try to empathise with those who have had different life experiences to theirs?We should stand up for cultural ­appropriation.The global intermingling of food and fashion and art has enriched human life.As the great American novelist Lionel Shriver reminds us: “People with different backgrounds rubbing up against each other and exchanging ideas and practices is self-evidently one of the most productive, fascinating aspects of modern urban life.”Yet in their Brave New World, everyone would stick to their own people and their own ways. What a dispiriting, divided world that would be.I would far rather live in a world than has Jamie Oliver jerk chicken in it than in such a racially regimented PC nightmare.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

who are keen to clean up the notoriously seedy resort.Police have also issued an arrest warrant for the woman, although they have not yet identified her.The pair each face a £120 fine for breaking the countrys obscenity laws by performing a lewd act in public.This is not the first time Thai authorities have signalled a crack down on Brits boozy antics.University student Tarkarit Wongchamthong, 23, who filmed the pair has been arrested.He faces a £2,300 fine and up to five years in prison after admitting breaking the computer crime act.Pattaya Police Chief Apichai Krobpetch said: One of the offenders in the video is Mr Daniel Smith, 33, a British citizen.We have issued a subpoena for him.There is another Thai woman in the video who we still do not know the name of and we will issue an arrest warrant for her if she still cannot be found.They will be prosecuted for indecent offences and processed according to all of the evidence and the law.Police yesterday grilled Australian Coran Maloney whose firm organised the event at the boat-shaped and nautical themed A-One Royal Cruise Hotel where guests paid the equivalent of £26 to attend from 3pm until 11pm.Police said that they had investigated Maloneys business and found that he has been running it legally with all the correct documents.They said he did not intend to be indecent and neither him nor the hotel were responsible for the indecent tourists.Maloney said yesterday that he knew the identity of the man in the video and would hand over the name to police.He said: What happened at the party on Saturday night was horrible.Ive been doing these events for seven years and weve never had anything like that happen before.Were family friendly and weve had people attend of all ages.We dont attract that kind of crowd.In January a British tourist was arrested in Pattaya over the death of a Thai hooker who plunged five floors to her death as they had strange and extravagant sex on a balcony."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000427818131.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jeremy corbyn admits if labour win power it could take even longer to leave the eu","story":"The Labour leader called for a “substantial” transition period to take place at the end of Article 50, and said under his leadership there would be an even softer Brexit than under Theresa May.In conversation with the hard-left former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis last night he called for closer alignment with Brussels once we do eventually exit than in the Governments white paper.Appearing at the Edinburgh Book Festival he laid out his alternate vision for the talks if Mrs May was to exit 10 Downing Street in the coming months.He said: “We would obviously take over the negotiations we would obviously look for a substantial transition period, and our fundamental position would be access to the European market.“And we would accept the regulatory alignment, indeed we’d go further than it, we’d go further than the European Union on a lot of deals.”He also said a Labour government would not exit the EU without a deal, adding: “But we would not be saying ‘hang on a minute, if you don’t give us what we want we’ll go off and do a private deal with Donald Trump’.“Which will be about deregulation, it will be about diminishing of working conditions, which is happening in the United States courtesy of Trump and his administration.”Mr Varoufakis said he agreed, but said the preferred Brexit policy of his Democracy in Europe Movement was to have “as close an alignment as possible for five years – renewable”, calling it a “Norway-plus” model.Mr Corbyn did not disagree, but a source close to him later said he did not agree with such a lengthy transition.Elsewhere during the event the Labour boss claimed the party is facing greater hostility from the media than weve probably ever had before.He was also asked about recent pressures on his leadership, to which Mr Corbyn said: Im absolutely fine.There are pressures, of course, and there are abusive remarks that are made, but real pressure is when you cant feed your children, real pressure is when youre about to lose your home or working in an understaffed hospital.Political representatives have to absorb a lot of pressure but youve got to recognise real-life pressure that lots of people are under in a system that is grotesquely unfair.Shadow Trade Secretary Barry Gardiner predicted civil disobedience in the event of a second EU referendum, writes Hugo Gye.And he warned anti-Brexit campaigners they are playing with our democracy by threatening to ignore the will of the people.Mr Gardiner, who campaigned for Remain, told the BBCs Today programme a second referendum would boost extremists.He said: If people want to be able to achieve change through democratic means, if they feel that that is being denied to them, they then turn to other, more socially disruptive ways of expressing their views.And that is the danger here.Mr Gardiner added: If people feel that the route to change is no longer a democratic route, then you look to social disruption, perhaps civil disobedience.And this is playing with our democracy.It comes after increasing questions to be asked about his links to terror groups, after The Sun revealed a pro-Hamas lobbying group paid for him to attend a conference with a convicted terrorist.And this newspaper also reported that Mr Corbyn’s long serving personal secretary urged Labour supporters to read Jewish newspapers to “show you who not to vote for”.And the party’s anti-Semitism crisis refuses to go away, after one its former MPs Jim Sheridan was suspended at the weekend for saying he had lost respect for the Jewish community.Asked about the matter Mr Corbyn said Labour does “not tolerate anti-Semitism in any form”, adding: Its completely wrong what he said.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but

Freddy David was jailed last month for six years after defrauding 55 victims out of \u0026pound14.5million in a Ponzi scheme through wealth management firm HBFS Financial Services. Police said the 49-year-old from Elstree, north London, used the money to fund his gambling habit, his children’s school fees and foreign holidays. Freddy David gave \u0026pound2,000 to the local Conservative Party in Harrow West in 2013 while HBFS - of which he was the sole director - gave donations worth \u0026pound15,685 between 2013 and 2015. HBFS went into liquidation earlier this year owing more than \u0026pound13million to investors - with less than \u0026pound500,000 in assets to pay them back. James Holah, 42, Secretary of Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner Labour Party, said the Tories should hand over the donations to David\u0027s victims to take the moral high ground.  He said: “Not only is it the right thing to do, it would restore any faith in their credibility and suitability to stand candidates in future. Jessica Gooch, Secretary of the Harrow West Labour Party, has now written to Tory chairman Brandon Lewis asking if he will take the morally correct approach and return the funds to his victims or a charity which supports the victims of crime. Ms Gooch also asked if the Conservative Party will investigate the donations. David was jailed for six years at Southwark Crown Court on July 30 after pleading guilty to one count of obtaining a money transfer by deception, and one count of fraud by abuse of position. He was also disqualified from being a company director for 10 years. City of London Police investigator Katie Watkins said David had committed calculated and callous acts that caused significant emotional distress and financial harm to the victims involved.  Police said he ran the fraud in parallel with legitimate HBFS business, convincing victims their funds were being held in a high-interest bank account - while in fact money was transferred to David\u0027s personal accounts for his own use. Electoral Commission records show Freddy David donated \u0026pound2,000 in cash to the Harrow West Conservative party in 2013. HBFS donated \u0026pound9,685 in cash and \u0026pound6,000 in administration and staff costs between 2013 and 2015. David’s wife Hannah David was the Tories\u0027 parliamentary candidate in Harrow West in 2015 and 2017 and is a national director of the Conservative Policy Forum. Companies House filings show Mrs David and Freddy David were both shareholders in HBFS, but her husband was the sole director. Mrs David could not be reached for comment today, but she has not been accused of wrongdoing.

He had called at 1.30pm from his office at the American Consulate in Guadalajara where he worked as a Drug Enforcement Agency special agent. The couple and their two children had been in Mexico for more than four years while Enrique or \u0027Kiki\u0027 tracked marijuana and cocaine drug traffickers. But in February 1985, his time in country was coming to an end and he was looking forward to starting a new job back home in San Diego. Mika recalled her husband\u0027s last words when he called her to arrange lunch: He said \u0027meet me at this restaurant\u0027 and I said \u0027yes\u0027.  When she arrived, he was not there.  She said: I waited and waited. I finished eating, paid my bill and went back home. In the back of mind I was hoping he just got tied up and nothing abnormal. The next morning there was still no sign of Kiki and his wife grew worried. She called his colleague Victor Shaggy Wallace but he asked: “Didn\u0027t he meet you for lunch?” His disappearance  By now alarm bells were ringing and DEA supervisor James Jamie Kuykendall was alerted. He found Kiki\u0027s desk in disarray and notified the consul general. Alarmingly, a pilot who worked with Kiki had been seen being forced into car and driven away. Kiki had always known being a Special Agent could be very dangerous. His mother even tried to talk him out of it. But Kiki was sure. Even if I\u0027m only one person, I can make a difference, he said.  He was true to his word. A year before his disappearance, Kiki had had a brilliant success. An informant had led him to the Rancho B\u0026uacutefalo, a 2,500 acre plantation producing an estimated $8billion of cannabis a year. Acting on Kiki\u0027s intelligence, 450 Mexican soldiers, backed by helicopters, razed it to the ground.   How destroying a plantation signed his death warrant  The plantation was operated by Rafael Caro Quintero, a billionaire drug boss who ran the Guadalajara Cartel with Miguel \u0026Aacutengel F\u0026eacutelix Gallardo commonly referred to by his alias El Padrino (The Godfather).  Its destruction signed Kiki\u0027s death warrant. His story - and that of the Guadalajara Cartel in the 1980s - is told in the new season of Netflix\u0027s Narcos: Mexico. The series goes back to the roots of the modern drug was, when the country\u0027s trafficking world was a loose and disorganised confederation of independent growers and dealers.  But they were violent and vengeful with no morals or remorse.  In the aftermath of the plantation raid, Kiki received threats. He was warned to stop investigating and his informant was shot eight times with a 45 automatic. A DEA agent\u0027s car was machine-gunned in front of his house.  Kiki would not give in. Brave and resolute, he ignored the threats and continued with his job. But his enemies were closing in. On the day he was meant to meet his wife for lunch, five men snatched him and shoved him into a beige Volkswagen. One threw a jacket over his head and the driver sped away. Kiki\u0027s kidnap was a bold move as the DEA was a tight-knit family who were known to watch each other\u0027s backs. However, agents were hampered by corrupt Mexican police, many of whom were bribed by the cartels.  Six day after the abduction, agents got a tip that Quintero - the cartel boss who had lost his plantation - was about to board a plane in Guadalajara.  DEA officers raced to intercept him but corrupt local cops got there first.  Police chief Jorge Armando Pavon Reyes was on the scene and after a short armed stand-off allowed Quintero to flee, to the incredulity of watching DEA agents.  To add insult as his plane taxied away Quintero is said to have stuck out his head of the plane\u0027s open door, waved an AK-47 and shouted Next time my children, bring better weapons, not toys! The man then waved a champagne bottle, took a swig and went back inside the jet and closed the door. Pavon was later convicted of accepting a $200,000 bribe from the trafficker and sentenced to four-years prison. But that did not help the DEA at the time - the trail to find Kiki went cold. Officers continued to search houses associated with the cartel members and question those they arrested. At one address a photograph of Kiki was found. The house belonged to vicious drug lord Miguel Felix Gallardo. Inside plates of half eaten food and drinks were abandoned, indicating that the occupants had left the house in a hurry right before the arrival of the authorities.   A furious US Government took the extraordinary step of shutting down the border with Mexico to increase pressure on the government. Twenty seven days after the abduction, there was a breakthrough. The DEA were given sight of a letter claiming a farmer had kidnapped Kiki by mistake and he was being held at a isolated farm called El Mareno.  The bloody scene On March 2, agents drove to the small town of La Angostura, in the state of Michoac\u0026aacuten, but the judicial police had beaten them to it. Jack Lawn DEA administrator recalled: We arrived to a bloody scene with bodies located throughout the ranch, women screaming in the background. “We were told that Mexican Federal Judicial Police had approached the ranch, officers had been shot at so they were required to return fire to protect themselves. Our agents went through the ranch and determined that one individual was shot in the back while lying in bed so obviously not defending himself. Other individuals were massacred at the site. The scene was a set-up. The owners of the ranch had had been set up as scapegoats for the kidnap of Kiki. They were then murdered in cold blood by corrupt officers before they could reveal the truth. Jack Lawn explained: We asked for help searching the orchard behind the ranch and the Mexicans said they would not help.  Then about 6pm a boy who was passing noticed some bundles at the bottom of a culvert and went down to investigate and saw they were two bodies, very decomposed. Most of believed we were going to find them alive but it was Kiki and the pilot. Kiki\u0027s last days and death had been brutal.   Tortured with a cattle prod  Drugged, beaten and tortured with a cattle prod, he had repeatedly passed out and been revived with injections administered by a doctor.  He had finally died when one of of his captors drove a tyre iron into his skull.  Autopsy results revealed that Kiki had been dead for about three weeks when he was found. He had been killed elsewhere, buried, dug up and then dumped.  Kiki\u0027s body was flown back to the US where he was buried with full military honours. The death resulted in a huge outpouring of support from law enforcement officers all over the world and thousands of cards were sent to his widow. The hunt was on for his killers and the DEA were certain the drug lords were responsible. On April 4, 1985, officers raided a house in Costa Rica and Caro Quintero was found and extradited to Mexico. Meanwhile FBI forensic experts found three different soil samples on sheets used to wrap Kiki\u0027s body.  One soil sample matched that found at a house owned by Caro Quintero - the bodies had been moved to misdirect the investigators. Officers also found a number plate from the VW police car which was used to kidnap him. The hunt for his killers  A gruesome tape recording of Kiki\u0027s torture was also found where it was clear one of his abductors was a Mexican police chief and the DEA agent could be heard begging not to be struck as he was interrogated for the names of his informers. No stone was left unturned and DEA agents used extreme measure to subvert Mexican justice to get the killers. One man was arrested on the border and convicted because of strand of hair matched one found with Kiki - he was given five life sentences and 1,000 years confinement. Professional bounty hunters were used to drag suspects across the border into the hands of US authorities. In total, seven people were given a total of 30 life sentences plus 2,000 years in prison. Under interrogation, they revealed that Rafael Caro Quintero and another drug boss Ernesto Fonseca were at the house where kidnapped Kiki was held.

Stoke City FC fan Alfie Spain had gone to watch his beloved team play Preston North End when trouble broke out at Deepdale Stadium on Saturday.   Alfie, who has learning difficulties, was going towards the toilets during half-time when he was hit by the spray as it was used on fellow supporters in the away end.  He was left in tears with severely stinging and bloodshot eyes and was physically sick after the terrifying incident during the Championship match.  Dad Robert, 37, had to take Alfie out of the stadium, and the pair sat on the coach and missed the second half of the match, which ended 2-2. Lancashire Police said they were forced to take action to stop aggressive fans from forcing their way out of the stadium. But the family said all the fans were doing was singing songs - and the police spread the pepper-spray indiscriminately hitting Alfie even though he was not involved in any disturbance.  Mum Claire Wise, 39, of Kidsgrove, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffs., said her son now no longer wants to go the away games to watch the Potters play. She said: I was watching the match at a friend\u0027s house and didn\u0027t know what was unfolding. But then I started to get these videos showing the pepper spray. I rang Alfie\u0027s dad to see if they were OK, and he said \u0027no, Alfie\u0027s just been sprayed\u0027. They were spraying everywhere, they weren\u0027t just spraying at the ones who were causing a disturbance. It hit his eyes. He was being sick, his eyes were stinging and he was crying in pain. He was throwing up on the floor. His dad asked a police man if he could have some water for Alfie and they said \u0027no, you have to get back\u0027.  One of the stewards got his own water to them. One of the other stewards let them out the doors. He was by the toilets. The bar was closed, I think that was why the confusion was happening. The fans were just singing songs like they always do. If they were doing something wrong the police should have detained them somewhere else. Alfie is still upset. He has supported Stoke City ever since he was little. He loves it. He is not a trouble maker. He has never experienced that before. I am very annoyed. I have complained to the police.

Passengers revealed what the captain told them over the Tannoy system after Brit Kay Longstaff fell into the Adriatic Sea from the Norwegian Star. The 46-year-old air hostess is alleged to have rowed with her partner in the days before she plunged overboard and is said to have been having a tough time on board the cruise. Kay claimed she fell from the seventh deck of the 294m liner, before spending 10 hours floating in the Adriatic Sea off Croatia until she was plucked from the waters by the coast guard. But other tourists insisted it would have been “impossible” to accidentally slip over the chest-high railings surrounding the decks.  American Eddie Palladino, 60, who was on the cruise with his wife and two children, said: “We were woken up by alarm bells going off and then there was an announcement from the captain. “He said: ‘I’m calling to alert you now that we have a reported jumper off the ship and we’re now in a search and rescue mission.’ “He didn’t say anything about an \u0026shyaccident and called her a ‘jumper’. The railings right across the ship are very high. I’m 6ft tall and would have to climb up to get over them. She didn’t fall by \u0026shyaccident. Her shirt was found on the deck. I’m happy she survived… it’s a miracle.”  A worker on the ship later \u0026shyreportedly wrote on Facebook: “She didn’t fall, she jumped. It was on my ship. “I spoke [to her] throughout the whole week. She was arguing with her fella the whole time.” Croatian officials say CCTV images show Kay was alone at the time of the incident at 11.45pm on Saturday, 60 miles off the coast. Her partner Craig Rayment was said to be in bed when the drama unfolded. The electrician reported her missing at 2am, several hours after she vanished.  After finally being rescued at 9.40am on Sunday and taken to the Croatian city of Pula, Kay told a local TV station how “singing” and “yoga fitness” helped her survive the night. The expat, said to live in Marbella, added: “I fell off the back of the \u0026shyNorwegian Star and I was in the water for 10 hours. So these wonderful guys rescued me. I am very lucky to be alive.” Croatian Ministry of Maritime Affairs spokesman David Radas added: “She was really lucky, the weather was ideal. “The water was around 25C and there were no waves or currents, which is unusual for the northern Adriatic Sea.” Kay, originally from Gloucestershire, was discharged after receiving treatment for mild hypothermia and was said to have been reunited with Craig.

After he posted the letter on Facebook, Mr Quinn\u0027s friends joked he could pay the outstanding amount in 2p monthly instalments. The company director claimed he had no idea what the bill related to and said he had received no previous reminders from Amphora Trading Ltd, a private firm owned and run by Colchester Borough Council.

The correspondence, dated August 14, was a last reminder for his company Food and Drink Festivals UK to clear the amount. Despite doubting the debt, the honourable businessman decided to pay cash in hand at the town hall to avoid any more expense to the taxpayer. It was his only option seeing as his BACS system would not accept a 10p payment, he explained.

Air hostess Kay then survived 10 hours adrift in the Adriatic Sea, claiming yoga and singing helped her stay alive.

I was sitting at the back of the deck. She is reported to have told a rescuer that her fitness from yoga and singing helped her survive for so long in the water.  David Radas, Croatian Ministry of Maritime Affairs spokesman, said that by checking CCTV rescuers knew the exact moment Ms Longstaff fell in the water.

IT engineer Matt Nutt thought getting his souped-up Ford Focus ST fitted with two new brake pads would be a simple task. And the mechanics at The Tyre Factory - in Littlehampton, West Sussex - seemed to agree, telling him the work would be finished that day. But after picking up his beloved \u0026pound12,000 motor, the 26-year-old was stunned to find the worker flooring it during a three-minute joyride - at one point reaching a dangerous 52mph in a 30mph zone.  Video footage taken earlier this month shows the impatient mechanic speeding past pram-pushing mums and overtaking a cyclist before pulling a quick u-turn and haring back. He appears frustrated when vehicles sticking to the speed limit slow him down, and is even heard slating his powerful ride, saying ‘this is s***’. Mr Nutt, a married father-of-two who lives in Littlehampton, said: “You hear about these kind of stories so I check the dash cam every time I leave my car with someone. “Straight away you could tell from the engine noise that he was going too fast, even before I could actually see the speed. “When I had a closer look I was shocked to say the least. He floors it - he’s well above the speed limit. “Driving at that sort of speed in a 30mph zone is just ridiculous. “Had there not been more traffic on the road, I’m sure he’d have gone a lot quicker than he did. I guess it’s fortunate that it was busier.  “I would expect them to take it round the estate to test the brakes. “But I wasn’t expecting them to go out onto the main road, and I certainly wasn’t expecting them to drive like that. “I was really surprised he drove like that because the camera is clearly visible.” Mr Nutt - who has spent thousands improving his motor - had only taken it to the garage as he needed the works done in time for his brother’s wedding.  But after showing the video to garage staff, he said he was appalled by their attempt to make amends - by offering a set of discounted tyres. He has not yet informed police but says he has considered it. He said: “I’m really disappointed because they’ve always seemed reliable in the past. The staff are really nice and friendly, they smile at everyone. “Clearly the way they treat the cars they work on is not how they treat their customers.

A life sized jockey, horse and cart made out of flowers was the centrepiece to the funeral at St Michael\u0027s Catholic Church in Ashtead, Surrey. A 50ft red carpet was laid out leading to Mikey\u0027s grave in Epsom, Surrey, ahead of the funeral. And 16 of the luxury cars - that cost \u0026pound360,000 brand new - arrived at the church earlier for the service, carrying family and friends.  Each car had two light blue flags with the text \u0027Mikey Connors, our legend, one in a billion, king of the road\u0027.  A white Mercedes funeral car brought Mikey\u0027s coffin to the church as around two hundred people gathered outside to pay homage before going inside. Big Fat Gypsy Wedding\u0027s Paddy was seen visibly emotional as the coffin was carried out.  The burial is due to take place two-and-a-half miles away, at Epsom and Ewell cemetery. Floral tributes have been left at the grave site.   Mikey - described as a loyal family man - died following a collision in Thamesmead, southeast London, on July 28. The 30-year-old was horse racing when the incident happened. When he did not cross the finishing line, concerned family and friends went back to look for him and made the tragic discovery. His horse also had to be put down because of its injuries.  Mikey\u0027s death will have come as a devastating blow to Big Fat Gypsy Wedding\u0027s Paddy, who has lost several family members in just over a year. Doherty laid his mother to rest in April after revealing she died of a broken heart - following the death of her beloved husband. Known as Queenie, Elizabeth Doherty suffered a massive heart attack just days after a headstone was placed on the grave of her much-loved spouse, Simon.  Simon, known as Simey, died a year earlier after battling an illness and his funeral drew hundreds of mourners as he was remembered and celebrated as the father of all travellers. And in October 2017, the teenage nephew of the Big Fat Gypsy Wedding star tragically died in a car crash. Tom \u0027Tomboy\u0027 Doherty was only 17-years-old when he was killed following a collision in South Nutfield. After Mikey\u0027s death, Paddy\u0027s wife Roseanne paid tribute to him and said that everyone is in shock.

Sir Norman had the four charges against him dismissed after the Crown Prosecution Service said they would be offering no evidence at Preston Crown Court. However five men still face trial regarding alleged offences during Hillsborough and in the aftermath. Strict guidelines remain in force over what anyone - from news organisations to individuals using Twitter and Facebook - can write about the suspects.  Cases are still \u0027active\u0027 and comments online could be seen as prejudicing a potential jury against them. This means social media posts - whether a profile has 10 or 10,000 followers - should not include comments that implies any suspect is guilty of the offence they have been accused of. Commenter Brian Reade has warned on Twitter: Please, if you want Hillsborough families to gain justice don\u0027t comment on the outcome of today\u0027s Bettison case. I know it\u0027s hard but lawyers are watching and will use any comments that could influence a jury as a reason to get future trials shut down. This is really important.  Five men still face trial over Hillsborough. Laying in to Bettison could prejudice those proceedings as their lawyers will argue (and I have seen them do it in the pre-trial at Preston) that adverse social media comments about that day mean they can\u0027t get a fair trial. David Duckenfield, 73, Sheffield Wednesday club secretary Graham Mackrell, 68, retired police officers Donald Denton, 80, and Alan Foster, 73, and police solicitor Peter Metcalf, 68, all face trial. Duckenfield, who is charged with 95 counts of gross negligence manslaughter, is due to go on trial in January along with Mackrell, who is charged with an offence involving the stadium safety certificate and a health and safety offence.  Denton, Foster and Metcalf are expected to go on trial later next year charged with doing acts tending and intended to pervert the course of justice. In a statement this morning, Sue Hemming of the CPS said: “Since the original decision to charge Norman Bettison in June 2017 there have been a number of significant developments which have affected the available evidence. These include changes in the evidence of two witnesses and the death of a third witness. “Our latest review of the evidence has concluded the collective impact of these developments means there is no longer a realistic prospect of conviction. I appreciate this news will be disappointing for the families and the CPS will meet with them in person to explain the decision. “I would remind all concerned that although criminal proceedings are no longer active against Norman Bettison, there are five other defendants facing charges relating to Hillsborough and each has the right to a fair trial.  It is therefore extremely important that there should be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information which could in any way prejudice those proceedings.” What about information already in the public domain? Lawyers representing those accused of wrongdoing could argue that, because so much has been said, heard and written about their clients’ involvement in Hillsborough or its aftermath, it would be impossible for them to get a fair trial. That is not the case, however. A number of legal precedents exist that state no matter how well known an accused may be, they can still be given a fair hearing in a public court of law. Arguments include the ‘fade factor’ - which suggests the impact of past stories fades in the minds of jurors over the time between a suspect being charged and a resulting trial, a process which often takes months and months.  It is also established that jurors are capable of reaching fair decisions based solely on the evidence they hear in a trial, and that the ‘drama’ of the courtroom environment helps people focus simply on that which is put before them. Jurors are also warned not to research their cases, or discuss their deliberations with non-jurors, by judges. All of these factors explain why organisations do not need to remove past stories and comment pieces from their websites.

Co-founder Dr Harry Destecroix will be among the country\u0027s wealthiest after Ziylo was snapped up by the global healthcare company Novo Nordisk.  The huge deal, which is one of the biggest in the university\u0027s history, is thought to be worth around $800million (\u0026pound623million), Bristol Live reports.  And total payments could even exceed this.  While the deal will comfortably put the firm in the top 10 rich list for the South West , it could also bring brilliant news for diabetes patients.   Ziylo, set up by Dr Destecroix along with Professor Anthony Davis and businessman Tom Smart, has developed synthetic glucose binding molecule technology. And Dr Destecroix, a PhD student and CEO of the company, says its acquisition brings hope of a truly ground-breaking treatment to diabetes patients. It is thought the deal could lead to the development of the world’s first glucose-responsive insulin and transform the treatment of diabetes. The World Health Organisation estimates that more than 382 million people worldwide - including 4.05million people in the UK - have the condition. Everyone with Type 1 and some people with Type 2 diabetes need to take insulin, either by injection or pump, to control their blood glucose levels.  Dr Destecroix said: “Novo Nordisk, as the leader in the diabetes field, is the ideal company to maximise the potential of the Ziylo’s glucose binding molecules in glucose responsive insulins and diabetes applications, and it brings hope of a truly ground-breaking treatment to diabetes patients.” Scientists in the Davis Research Group in the School of Chemistry had been working on the problem for many years before Ziylo was established as a start-up company in 2014. The university spin-out firm has now developed a platform which could be a key component to enable the next generation of insulin that is able to adapt to glucose levels in the blood. This could eliminate the risk of hypoglycaemia and lead to better metabolic control for those living with diabetes.  Ziylo’s glucose binding molecules are synthetic molecules that were designed by Prof Davis, who has been at the forefront of research into synthetic sugar receptors for the past 20 years. The Professor of Supramolecular Chemistry, also Director \u0026amp Co-Founder of Ziylo, added: “The glucose responsive insulin we will develop with Novo Nordisk combines a natural molecule (insulin) with an artificial component (Ziylo’s glucose binding molecules). This combination of natural and unnatural could be a new approach to biodesign. “These unique molecules were inspired by nature and work in much the same way as natural glucose receptors. A group of chemists, called supramolecular chemists, have been working on this problem for many years. Often, they make molecules which behave quite like natural molecules, but usually they don’t work quite well enough for real-world applications. “The success of the Ziylo molecules shows that, with persistence, the problems can be solved and that biological molecules can be matched as well as mimicked.” "},{"url":null,"title":"were not child minding service","story":"News\u0027We\u0027re not a child-minding service\u0027 - Shop owners anger at parents leaving children alone there for HOURSAn exasperated Matt West who runs Miwk comic books store in Reigate, Surrey is fed up with parents leaving kids unattended for hoursShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByAmy ColesJenny Seymour11:17, 21 AUG 2018Updated11:35, 21 AUG 2018NewsThe Miwk comic book store in Reigate, Surrey.

Matt West, who runs \u0027Miwk\u0027 a comic and collectibles shop in Reigate, Surrey said every summer holiday he sees a spike in the numbers of parents leaving their kids in his shop on their own. He has now reached his wits end after being faced with unaccompanied children crying, fighting with rolls of wrapping paper and breaking stock.  It is bizarre, he told Surrey Live.   We live in a time when people are paranoid about leaving their kids, or about people talking to them, so leaving them in a shop for an hour or so seems odd.  My daughter is 13 and I don\u0027t think I would ever have done that with her. It\u0027s not that we don\u0027t want people to leave their kids for five minutes to look around, but it\u0027s every case on it\u0027s merits. Children aged between seven and 12 are being left for anything up to, and in excess of, two hours, he said. His account of some of the incidents this summer, outlined in a frustrated Facebook post, included the following: A guy left three boys in the shop saying to them he was off to Morrison\u0027s and would be back in half an hour, stipulating \u0027We\u0027re not buying anything!\u0027 By the time he\u0027d returned, the kids had been thrown out of the shop. They had been fighting with tubes of wrapping paper at the back of the shop, then started kicking soft toys about before breaking two mugs. They were sent out of the shop and told to wait outside by the window for their dad to get back.  When he got back he was furious with us for throwing his kids out of the shop and refused to pay for the damage they had caused saying it was \u0027not down to him to keep an eye on them\u0027. In another incident, a mother left three children for 90 minutes, while she went to the dentist. And last year, Mr West said he had to call the police when a mother left her children, one as young as seven, for more than two hours. When officers called her, she was in Croydon. We\u0027re not unreasonable here, he added in the post. We get regular kids popping in after school or during the holidays to browse and kill some time. We\u0027re fine with that.

This coupled with the news last week that kids were left in a car in Morrison\u0027s car park on a hot day unattended suggests there is a problem in Reigate at the moment, most likely related to the school holidays.

Three men are being held by Pennsylvania state police who served a search warrant at a rural home in the small town of Munson, Clearfield County which is 130 miles north east of Pittsburgh. Terry Wallace, 40, Matthew Brubaker, 32, and Marc Measnikoff, 34, face more than 1,000 charges each after what is thought to be five years of abuse of the animals. District attorney Bill Shaw told them the charges so far are part of an ongoing investigation into the abuse of animals. He told them: “This is an unpleasant topic, but the facts are that we received a report of folks having sexual intercourse with animals, farm animals.”  The men are accused of having sexual relations with at least nine female horses, a cow, a goat, and dogs, at a property on Mouse Road. Police also recovered several semi-automatic weapons at the home. A teenage boy was also present at the home and was reportedly used to hold the animals during the sex sessions and they are set to be additionally charged with endangering the welfare of a child, and the corruption of a minor. The statistics of alleged abuse is staggering, said police.  They face misdemeanours including 1,460 counts of sexual intercourse with an animal, and 1,460 counts of cruelty to animals, reports WTAJ. The men are in jail until they pay a $100,000 bail and a preliminary hearing is scheduled for Wednesday, August 22. Mr Shaw told the station: “So I’ve been doing this for over 20 years and this is probably the worse situation of this type of case that I’ve come across.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mountain dew addict who drank","story":"NewsMountain Dew \u0027addict\u0027 who drank 17,000 cans of the fizzy drink loses three stone and is now a bodybuilderJason Peck, 36, from Alabama, who tipped the scales at 20 stone consumed 999,343g of sugar from the fizzy drink aloneShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByHana Carter09:48, 21 AUG 2018NewsJustin first embarked on his weight loss mission in 2016.

Justin Peck, 36, was so obsessed with the sugary drink that he would glug a 550ml bottle every morning for breakfast before polishing off another six cans each day. The drink, containing 46 grams of sugar per can, was not the only element in Justin ballooning to 20 stone. The ex-solider had a weakness for junk food and would have a McDonalds meal for breakfast with a side of five breakfast burritos. But on New Years Day, the father-of-three from Alabama decided to ditch his half a dozen a day fizz habit and lost nearly two stone in the first two weeks. He first got hooked on fizzy drinks after leaving the military in April 2008 drinking six cans per day until January 2016.  Overall he knocked back around 16,986 cans containing 46g of sugar each, and 2,831 bottles with 77g each, meaning he consumed a whopping 999,343g of sugar in total. Based on Walmart prices - where a 12-pack of Mountain Dew costs around \u0026pound2.70 and a 20oz bottle around \u0026pound1.50 - the habit would have set him back in the region of \u0026pound7,795. Justin also gorged on fast food, played up to six hours of video games a night and did little exercise, which left him wearing XXL shirts and tipping the scales at 20 stone. But after kicking his habit, the computer programmer also started going to the gym twice a day and his new healthy habits helped him shed 30lbs of fat. Justin, who was in the Air Force for eight years then decided to focus on bulking up and took up bodybuilding in early 2017. He followed a strict diet plan and lifted weights to prepare for his first show. He\u0027s since placed first in his class twice and finished in the top five in a third show, and is training for the Alabama State Championships.  Justin says he is proud of his body and how far he’s come but best of all, he has endless energy to play with his kids Autumn, 13, Brayden, 11 and Camden, nine. The fitness fanatic, who currently weighs 15st, said: “I didn’t realise how badly I had gotten out of shape. “I got comfortable in my second marriage and started gaining weight “I would make a family-sized lasagne and my kids were young so they would have a little piece and then I would eat all the leftovers. “For breakfast I would have McDonald’s - four of five breakfast burritos and a biscuit to go with it.  “Out of boredom I would snack on candy bars and chips and I was addicted to soda. I would probably get through a six-pack of Mountain Dew per day. “Every morning it would be one or two 550ml bottles on the way to work. “I was drinking it until I went to bed. If I didn’t drink it after a certain period of time my teeth would ache and I would get a bad headache. I would be buying 12 packs every other day. “It was the drink of choice of my dad as a kid and we always drank it growing up. Not to that level but I would always drink it. “It was an addiction and I couldn’t shake it. “And every time I would look in the mirror I would have a cliche moment where I would berate myself.  “I would say, ‘You are fat. You are never going to find love again. You are disgusting.’ I beat myself up and then would go and eat a box of cereal.” Justin says his turning point came when he began experiencing suicidal thoughts - and then hated himself for having those thoughts because he needed to be there for his kids. He said: “I said, ‘I’m tired of saying all this to myself in the mirror. I want my kids to be proud of me.’” From New Year’s Day 2016, he went “100 miles per hour” and completely changed his lifestyle. He cut out Mountain Dew, began eating what he thought was healthy food and set a short-term goal of going to the gym for 30 days straight. The exercise combined with his new healthier diet helped him shed just over one stone in the first two weeks, and in three months he lost nearly 3st.  He started weight training in March 2016 and the following year began training for bodybuilding shows after a pal remarked it was the “hardest thing ever”. He said: “It fired me up and I was like, ‘Why not? Why couldn’t I be a bodybuilder?’” Justin has since begun eating a special diet with six or seven meals per day and a intensive training program that involves him hitting the gym three times a day.

Your hair is getting in the way but you don\u0027t have a hair band handy. So you twist it, wrap it into a bun and stick a pen through it to keep it in place. Most us do this without even sparing a thought for what could happen if it all goes wrong and the pen leaks. A bride-to-be with platinum blonde hair learned her lesson on this one the hard way. Just a week before her wedding , Daphne Martin took a pen out of her hair only to find it had left a massive inky blue patch over her blonde locks. Not ideal.  I was working at Costco at the time, and I had put a pen into my messy ponytail, she told Allure . A coworker approached me and told me what had happened, and I was in complete shock. Fortunately, Daphne had previously trained as a hair stylist, so she was better placed than most of us to sort out the mishap. She put her fianc\u0026eacute to work as her assistant and washed her hair in the kitchen sink before applying bleach to her hair. I washed the area, blew it out, and then applied bleach. Surprisingly enough, five minutes of bleach got that out of my extremely light hair. My hair was back to normal that day — even an hour later, thank goodness.  It\u0027s seriously impressive that she managed to pull it off in just five minutes, but arguably having platinum hair actually made it easier to bleach out. If she had darker hair, she could have ended up making the blue hair and surrounding area lighter and would then have had to blend it back in with another colour.

When something a little out of the ordinary happens in our home, it\u0027s easy to joke that the place is haunted, though not many of us actually ever think this is the case. But one mum has shared the odd goings on in her house and suggested the answer to all her problems is definitely that there\u0027s a \u0027spunking ghost \u0027 around. And people are totally on board with her theory.  In a post on Mumsnet , a woman, going by the username Chipshopninja, explained her reasoning for thinking her house was haunted. She wrote: Of all the problems to have... Last night my partner woke up around 1am because he heard our bedroom door open (it\u0027s squeaky, needs some WD40 but that\u0027s by the by). He didn\u0027t get up, expecting our son to tap him on the shoulder announcing he had had a bad dream, but nothing! He then heard the bedroom door close.  Her partner then decided to go and investigate what their son was doing. Just outside our bedroom door he stepped in a large wet patch, he checked on our son, but he was fast asleep all tucked in under his duvet, she continued. He then went downstairs to check on the dog, which was fast asleep in the living room. So slightly bemused, he came back to bed. In the morning he relayed the strange incident to his partner, who suggested it must have been caused by a spunking ghost.  But just in case it wasn\u0027t a ghost, the mum decided to ask the internet for their ideas about what might have caused the mess - she clarified that her dog definitely couldn\u0027t have caused it and there was nothing leaking from anywhere. One person said: Maybe your son was sleep walking and decided to pee outside your bedroom door? Although, a spunking ghost is definitely the most rational explanation.

The Avatar-style \u0027bot was revealed by Kalashnikov at the Army 2018 Fair just outside Moscow, as a \u0027demonstration of what is to come.\u0027 The robot can walk and has space in a cabin for people to sit and operate the robot from inside and can hold and move objects with its claws, including weapons. The pilots are protected from bullets, debris and any other dangerous object behind the armoured glass and metal encasement. The gold robot, which has been called Igorek, is still under construction and the creators do not wish to reveal all its characteristics until they have finished.  It looks eerily like the Amplified Mobility Platform (AMP) mech suits that humans use in James Cameron\u0027s sci-fi classic. In the 2009 flick the Pandora Utility Suit is used by the army as they try to take over the Na\u0027vi. While Kalashnikov are remaining tight-lipped on any further details at the moment, Igorek is likely to be used to magnify soldiers\u0027 strength while providing protection from military and environmental threats - just like the AMP suits in Avatar.  Other people have also compared the robot to the ?D-209 (Enforcement Droid series 209) from the Robocop series. Vladimir Dmitriev from the Kalashnikov group, said: This robot is probably one of the hottest new models of the \u0027Army 2018\u0027. Currently it is only a demonstration of the path we are planning on following. We understand that there are robotic machines driving on caterpillar and wheel drive, we also understand that there will be demand for anthropomorphic automatic movable systems.

It was just a terrible performance from the start.“I thought we were slack, very poor in possession.“Ayr had several early corners that put us on the back foot, there were bits of the first half where we got going but it really wasn’t good enough.“As a team, it’s not often I’ve seen so many players off form in one game. It was the polar opposite of Aberdeen last week, against the second best team in the country for the last few years, where we more than matched them.“The players can’t just take plaudits for how well they play and miss chances and then turn in a performance like that, it’s just not acceptable.”Striker Sofien Moussa was dropped to the bench after a poor run in front of goal but did his chances of a reprieve no good whatsoever after his introduction from the dugout.Within 15 minutes of replacing Jean Mendy, Moussa’s continual fouling caught up with him as referee John Beaton gave him his marching orders after a barge on Ayr midfielder Mark Kerr.And to cap things off, centre-back Genseric Kusunga was shown a straight red with the final kick of the game, scything down Michael Moffat in injury time.Neil added: “It was really poor from him, really poor from Gense.“I told Moussa that he can’t be making silly fouls, especially the one where he dived in to try to make a tackle on a yellow card.“It was a very dangerous game and he was warned and then paid the price for a poor challenge.“Then Gense obviously lost his composure and got a straight red which hurts us for this weekend, adding insult to injury.“Moussa had a great impact on the game, getting sent off, but, on the whole, our performance had a greater impact from start to finish, just not good enough.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"csaba looks to make signings after taking dundee united squad to aviemore for team bonding","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United boss Csaba Laszlo could still add to

I complicate my game sometimes but I’m working on just playing it simple and that’s what the gaffer and (assistant manager) Laurie Ellis want me to do.“They stress to me I have to play it simple at times and then do the magic when I can.”Not that it’s an easy process and Glass admits when he’s on the pitch he wants to be involved at the sharp end, doing the things that help win games.“I like to create chances and I really love to get shots in on the goal, it’s what my game is about.“I’m an attacking player and I like to excite but you can’t always do that and sometimes it is about keeping things simple and doing it for the team.”As those words show, this is a young man who does not lack confidence in his own ability but he’s also one who gives an honest assessment of his performances.For instance, while he was delighted to have played his part in a young United line-up that battled back from two goals down to beat St Johnstone’s U/21s in the Betfred Cup on Wednesday night, he was far from completely satisfied with his work.“It was a brilliant result, all the boys worked really hard to come from two behind like we did.“Obviously, the experienced players helped us a lot but I thought the young boys, including myself, dug in and we battled and battled.“St Johnstone were no mugs and I thought they really impressed so it was good to get on top of them by the end.“I know I wasn’t at my best but, like all the boys, I dug in and helped get the result.“I was maybe trying too hard at times for the killer pass or maybe trying to shoot too early.“Sometimes things don’t come off on the park but I still worked hard and helped the team and that’s what you have to make sure you do.”As he keeps grafting towards making the breakthrough in the first team on a regular basis, Glass was delighted by the victory, not least because it means there will be further opportunities to show he is ready.“This cup is a chance to get 90 minutes and, if I’m not playing in the league, I need to get games somewhere.“If it’s in the Irn-Bru Cup it’s better for me and the other boys, because they are very competitive, like league games.“You want to win them, both teams do, and it gives you the chance to show up well.“We want to do well in it and I think we can.“I thought our fitness was a big factor against St Johnstone.“We had a hard pre-season and I think we got the benefits of that against St Johnstone because we finished the game strongly and looked the fitter team.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"meekings grateful to dundee boss mccann for captaincy honour","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNew Dundee captain Josh Meekings has thanked under-fire boss Neil McCann for trusting him with the armband.McCann has confirmed the former Inverness defender will lead out the Dens Park side for the remainder of the season after trying out eight other potential candidates during pre-season.The 25-year-old Englishman says he is grateful for the honour and has vowed to repay McCann \u0026#8211 who is coming under increasing pressure from fans following his side\u0026#8217s shock Betfred Cup exit to Ayr United on Saturday \u0026#8211 with improved performances.He said: \u0026#8220I\u0026#8217m grateful for the manager for pulling me in to tell me I\u0026#8217m going to captain the side.

He says, though, coming off was just a precaution after needing surgery on the same ankle last season.He said: “It was nothing too serious. I had a shot and rolled my ankle a bit and I’ve had previous with it, so it was a bit of a worry at the time. However, a good bit of rest and the physio saw it. I’ve trained this week and it’s good. I just need to keep an eye on it.”Now would be an unfortunate time for Spence to be ruled out of action after some impressive displays in the early-season games and particularly due to the level of competition in the position now at Dens Park.“Last year there were a lot of centre-mids but again this year we’re very strong there, one of the strongest areas in the team,” he added.“I think that’s good because it keeps everyone on their toes, you can’t slack because there will be somebody else to take your place.“I believe in my ability and I’ve worked hard over the summer, worked hard in pre-season, too.“Obviously, I’ve been in the position but Glen Kamara is to come back and you’ve got Adil Nabi, Paul McGowan, Elton Ngwatala and Kharl Madianga, so there’s a lot of competition in there. I think throughout the season it will be getting rotated round and, hopefully, I can be in that team.“I think I’ve done OK so far. It’s still early but I want to keep this up through the whole season.“Last year I played well in stages and then got injured so I want to play consistently every week, play as much as I can, and obviously help the team climb the table.”And the way to do that will be to start finding the net, something Spence is adamant that’ll change soon.“I think our luck will turn around.“We have to put some of these chances away, we all know that, but the main thing is we are creating chances.“One day it is going to click, something is just missing at the moment but we all believe in the guys up front to go and do it.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tom duthie dundee united have to make tannadice a fortress to win back wait and see supporters","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAfter a difficult start to the season, something approaching a feelgood factor has returned to Dundee United following victory over Queen of the South in the Championship and a dramatic success against St Johnstone’s kids in the Irn-Bru Cup.This weekend the Tangerines will attempt to build on that by chalking up another success when Partick Thistle visit on the resumption of league hostilities.As well as a chance to build on the new-found momentum, the Jags clash will also be a chance for Csaba Laszlo’s players to send out a message that Tannadice is once again becoming a place where visits are to be feared, not anticipated and relished.While the general perception regarding the failure to secure promotion to the Premiership in each of the last two seasons has been poor away form has been the main cause, there is no question too many points have been let slip at home.In all competitions, last season saw United beaten five teams on their own patch. Three of those defeats came against Inverness Caley Thistle, Morton and Queen of the South in league outings.There were also draws against Dumbarton, Inverness and Dunfermline, meaning a total of 15 points that were expected to be taken were, in fact, shipped.That proved crucial as United finished 13 points behind champions St Mirren and one adrift of second-place Livingston, meaning they kicked off at the first stage of the promotion play-offs, while Livi had the benefit of a two-week break before beating them in the semi-final.Before last week’s Irn-Bru success with a side that was a mix of kids and fringe players, and against very young opposition, there was little to suggest this season would bring an improvement.Over 90 minutes, the Tannadice outings in the Betfred Cup against Arbroath and Alloa were drawn and the opening day of league business ended in a painful 3-2 defeat against Dunfermline that saw the Pars dominate more than the final score suggested.That United must improve at home start is important, not just in terms of their promotion challenge but also economically.The new regime under chairman Mike Martin have invested in a new squad and that’s cost money, some of which they’d like to think will be recouped by fans paying at the gate to watch their team chalk up regular victories at home.Decent income has already come from season ticket sales that are now approaching the 4,000 mark and, if that’s down on previous years, it remains a number that would be the envy of many Premiership clubs.It would be no surprise, however, if that cash has already been spent on the rebuilding of the squad, making supporters who pay on turning up for games a vital source of further funds.In not buying season books, many have adopted a wait-and-see policy so far as attendance is concerned. If United are going well they will come, if not, they’ll find something else to do.That makes wins at Tannadice vital and, in fairness, despite the problems the team’s experienced there in the past 12 months, there are now some encouraging signs.United looked impressive in Dumfries and could’ve scored more than the two goals.And in new arrivals Pavol Safranko, Nicky Clark and Craig Curran, they have strikers who bring as close as anyone is going to get of a guarantee of goals.A more direct style this term should also help, though, ultimately, the proof of this pudding is going to be in the eating.Hopefully, from Saturday the fans can start getting tucked in to what becomes a regular menu of home wins.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"pet-collar-melts-into-cats-neck-in-heatwave","story":"                          A WOMAN has issued a stark warning to other cat owners after her furry friend\u0027s newly-bought collar melted into its neck -

Homebase has been one of the most recognisable retail brands for almost 40 years, but the reality is we need to continue to take decisive action to address the under-performance of the business and deal with the burden of our cost base, as well as to protect thousands of jobs.\"The CVA is therefore an essential measure for the business to take and will enable us to refocus our operations and rebuild our offer for the years ahead.\"Retail workers trade union Usdaw says it is seeking \"urgent clarification\" from Homebase owner Hilco over its long-term plans for the firm.National officer Dave Gill said: \"All too often staff are excluded from the CVA process as the future of their jobs is being decided.\"Clearly there is a huge task ahead. It is crucial that the company listens to the staff and invests in their experience and expertise to turn the business around and again make it a success.

A scan revealed a tear in his hamstring, ruling him out of action for six weeks.Speculation over potential suitors has continued to swirl nonetheless.McInnes has said he rates McKenna as a future English Premier League star, but he wants him to continue his development with the Dons before going straight to the top flight down south.He said: “Any offer for McKenna will need to be way over the top – whether that’s in this window, the next window or a future window.“It’s not a matter of if Scott McKenna leaves Aberdeen. It’s when. And from my point of view, given what we want to do this season, I would rather it was further down the line.“Having spoken to Scott often enough he sees the importance of playing games at this stage in his career.”Meanwhile, reports have linked former Dons loanee Ryan Christie with a move to Sunderland from Celtic.Jack Ross is said to be keen on getting the 23-year-old midfielder, initially on loan, before a permanent deal in January, to the Stadium of Light.Christie was on loan at Aberdeen for the past season-and-a-half, but has found opportunities hard to come by since his £500,000 move

pawlett for dels dons","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBoss Derek McInnes believes Scott Wright has the potential to be a No.10 who can cause havoc to opponents.The 21-year-old winger was switched to a more direct role through the middle behind striker Stevie May in the 4-0 Betfred Cup defeat of St Mirren.McInnes hailed Wright’s performance as “outstanding” in a first start for the Reds since a 2-1 loss to Rangers at Pittodrie on December 3 last year.With the positions on the wings currently occupied by in-form Gary Mackay-Steven and Northern Ireland international Niall McGinn, the No.10 role could be the breakthrough position for Wright.Former Dons winger Peter Pawlett faced a similar situation when he was moved into the attacking role in midfield when McGinn and Jonny Hayes were the first-choice wide players.McInnes reckons Wright can be even more effective than Pawlett, who moved to MK Dons last summer.McInnes said: “It is a role Scott can play and I have spoken to him about it.“People naturally think that when you are quick player and a ball carrier you normally get played as a winger.“Scott is good out there as well.“We all know there is a natural talent there and the ability to run at people.“However, it is a similar situation to when we first had Peter Pawlett when we came into the building five years ago.“We played Peter in the No.10 position and asked him to go and eliminate people from there.“Scott has the potential to be a better ball carrier than Peter was.“Peter had an impact on our team and I think Scott can be something similar in that role.“Against St Mirren when it worked he picked and chose his moments to come off and to go in behind.“Scott was difficult to deal with as it is hard when quick players don’t stand still and he can eliminate people.”Wright has had to wait patiently for his first start in nine months and grabbed his opportunity to shine.With chances likely to be limited out wide due to Mackay-Steven and McGinn the 21-year-old has had to adapt.The No.10 role where Wright has been charged with bursting through the middle to beat the offside trap is one Wright has played before for Scotland at U21 level.McInnes said: “I wasn’t going to single anyone out but for me Scott Wright was the pick of everybody.“He allowed others to be as good as they can be by causing St Mirren all sorts of problems.“They didn’t know whether to play high or deep and he recognised that.“Scott is more than just a ball carrier.“I didn’t have the benefit of being able to run at speed and make a decision.“That for me is the difference between good forward players that have quickness in their game but can still make those right decisions.“We played him in and about McGinn and told him to make sure he never stood still and he didn’t.“That pleases me when you see him taking on information.“His decision making for the majority of the time was right, although he didn’t get his end product with his goals.“Scott was different class.”Wright was not the only product of the Aberdeen youth Academy to impress in the 4-0 rout of St Mirren, which could easily have been double that score-line.Frank Ross, 20, , was pitched into the Reds’ starting line-up at short notice following an injury in the warm-up to Niall McGinn.McGinn sustained a calf injury but is expected to be fit for Saturday’s Premiership trip to Hibs.Ross was given the nod 20 minutes before kick off but produced an impressive performance in only his second start for Aberdeen.Striker Bruce Anderson came off the bench, as did Connor McLennan.McInnes insists the only aspect missing from Wright’s performance was a goal, although he unselfishly squared a pass for Stevie May to score when in on goal.McInnes said: “If we are being hyper critical Scott should have been running away with the match ball as he got into great areas to score.“That is the one wee thing that I am sure will be nagging away at him – that he didn’t get his goals.“But he did everything else- Scott was outstanding.“However, we should be waxing lyrical about a hat-trick for Scott.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"1500 cyclists to be given chance to cycle

of the Aberdeen bypass, according to transport bosses.Transport Scotland confirmed remedial works are being carried out on the new River Don Bridge, near Dyce, which is part of the AWPR, after “minor defects” were found.North-east Labour MSP Lewis Macdonald has written to the Scottish Government calling for answers on whether the bypass completion date will be pushed back.But transport bosses claim the project “remains on schedule” for late autumn 2018, adding that contractor Balfour Beatty would pay for the additional costs.Mr Macdonald said: “This latest development will only reinforce concerns that the AWPR could be subject to further delay and it’s vital that the Scottish Government provide clarity on this matter.“The Scottish Government also need to be clear on the extent to which this will impact on the overall cost of the project and any implications for safety.“The bridges over the River Dee and River Don are clearly critical parts of the infrastructure of the AWPR and it is vital that the Scottish Government publishes its own assessment of the issues affecting the Don Crossing and their impact on the project as a whole.”It is understood the added costs could amount to millions – which would be met by the contractor – but Transport Scotland declined to give a figure for the works.A Transport Scotland spokesman said: “The AWPR contract sets out a clear standard for the works on AWPR and the contractor is required to complete any necessary work to deliver this at no additional costs to the public purse.“Some concrete panels are being replaced after minor defects were identified as part of the rigorous quality control processes which are utilised across the project.“It is not unusual for minor defects to appear during the construction of major infrastructure projects.“The contractor will undertake the necessary remedial works, at no extra cost to the taxpayer.“There will be no safety implications for users of the AWPR, and the AWPR/B-T project remains on schedule to open to traffic by late autumn 2018.“The previous Cabinet Secretary reported the latest position with the AWPR/B-T project to parliament in March 2018 and Balfour Beatty’s interim results remain consistent with this.”Two main sections of the £745 million project – from Balmedie to Tipperty and Blackdog to Dyce – have already opened to traffic.Transport bosses said the new 7.5-mile section would benefit tens of thousands of drivers through enhanced safety, reduced congestion, improved journey time reliability and safer access to local areas and the wider public network.The project is still slated for an autumn completion, following a series of delays caused by bad weather and the collapse of Carillion, a contractor on the project.The overall project is expected to bring in an additional £6 billion to the north-east economy and create around 14,000 jobs over the next 30 years.Balfour Beatty declined to comment saying it was working in partnership

Office rules, non-EU migrants can apply for a spousal visa if they are married to someone who has the right to live and work in the UK on the basis of their relationship.However, if their spouse leaves the UK or if they split up, non-EU nationals have to leave the country and apply for another visa, having to reapply for their job, which will be advertised for four weeks.If the post is not filled by a British or EU national, the applicant will have to go through the full interview process again, as if they had never worked there.NHS Grampian consultant nephrologist Dr Izhar Khan blasted the immigration laws, calling it a discriminatory policy.He said: “This is discrimination against non-EU migrants and is part of Theresa May’s racist immigration policy that she implemented while she was home secretary. This is a triple whammy – you have the human tragedy of a qualified, talented person being forced to leave the country.“You have the impact on the health service meaning we have to spend money on locums, who cost more money. And you have the effect on patients who have operations cancelled or delayed because of this.“There should be a common sense approach whereby the Home Office speaks to an employer and if they are a competent, qualified person, the visa is transferred over.“I don’t want to reveal the personal circumstances of people but there have been situations where contracts have been terminated.”The policy, which Theresa May brought in during her time as Home Secretary, attracted criticism, with critics saying it lacked compassion and has split families apart.She also introduced a minimum income of £18,600 for migrants living and working in the UK under spousal visas.A Home Office spokesman said: “No-one on a spouse visa has to leave the UK to extend their visa, as long as their partner is extending theirs – as spousal visa status is dependent on the principal applicant.“However, if a spouse visa becomes void, the person who came on this visa as a dependant must apply for another form of leave from their country of origin in order to return to the UK.“Each case is assessed on its individual merits against the published immigration rules.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"north east cops save pigs bacon1","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThis little piggie may have got lost in the north-east on its way to market.And while we can\u0026#8217t be sure where it was going, we can be sure it\u0026#8217s been rescued.Police officers on patrol on the A96 in the early hours of yesterday morning spotted this little piglet on the road near Elgin.Nicknamed Branston Piggle, he was taken back to the station while efforts were made to trace where it had escaped from.Thanks to the efforts of the officers, the piglet has now found a new home and has settled in well.The image was first shared in a post on the UK Cop Humour Facebook page(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]  if (d.getElementById(id)) return  js = d.createElement(s) js.id = id  js.src = \u0027https://connect.facebook.net/en_GB/sdk.js#xfbml=1\u0026version=v3.1\u0027  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs)}(document, \u0027script\u0027, \u0027facebook-jssdk\u0027))Last night this little fella was handed in to Elgin Police office.

As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough. I have contacted NHS Highland to voice my constituents anger about this situation.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) is seeking volunteers to clean up Scotland’s beaches in the 25th anniversary Great British Beach Clean from September 14-17.Volunteers also record the litter they find, and this has really helped change policy and behaviours.Last year 1,588 volunteers in Scotland took part, cleaning 111 beaches in four days. A staggering 491.4 pieces of litter were found for every 100 metres cleaned, a seven per cent rise on the amount recorded during 2016\u0026#8217s event.The fight to stop the plastic tide has only just started and we need everyone to take part now more than ever. We need the evidence from these surveys to highlight the action we all need to take for the sake of Scotland’s seas.To volunteer visit www.mcsuk.org/greatbritishbeachclean or call 01989 566017.Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland Conservation Officer.Sir,The Tories’ hypocrisy on MoD wages has been exposed – after it was revealed that around 220 staff in Scotland don’t receive the Real Living Wage, just days after the Tories topped up the pay of some of the best paid MoD staff.An MoD Freedom of Information response revealed that 220 staff in Scotland earn below the Real Living Wage of £8.75 an hour – yet they are not in line to receive any pay boost from their employers. The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"the sands of time are running out","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 02/08/18, 6:33 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAncient sayings relating to sand generally highlight its abundance. In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

However, they often endure short, painful lives without the most basic requirements.This is where SPANA makes such a huge difference, ensuring animals have access to the free veterinary treatment they urgently need when they are sick or injured.Actors Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are throwing their support behind this year’s event, and we hope your readers will be inspired to take part and help transform the lives of working animals around the world.The SPANA World Tea Party fundraising pack, full of free recipes, is available from www.spana.org/teaparty or by calling 020 7831 3999.SPANA World Tea Party Host, Tom HorsfieldSir,It only takes one person to put a stop to the accidental loss of life to drowning.With recent headlines being filled with tragic stories of people losing their lives to drowning, Lesley Laird, Shadow Scottish Secretary and the Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS UK) urge the public to be that \u0026#8216one person\u0026#8217: take some simple precautions and get \u0026#8216water smart\u0026#8217, before cooling off this summer.For more information on the issue, the statistics involved and interview opportunities, please contact Claire Huggins on 0300 323 0096 or email clairehuggins@rlss.org.ukSenior Communications Executive, Claire HugginsSir,There are more people using Instagram for interiors inspiration than ever before, but 70 percent of Scottish Instagram users feel dissatisfied with their homes after looking at images of other people’s houses on social media, a study has found.Researchers who polled 1,500 UK adults using social media for inspiration with their homes, found that a whopping 66 percent of those are displeased with their home. They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ (HDD).energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process. If we want to find a treatment or cure for disorders of memory like Alzheimer’s disease then we need to have a test of memory in animals that is analogous to human memory tests.\u0026#8217Steve Bargeton, St Andrews\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"do you want to see inveraray bank crumble","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 05/08/18, 6:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAnn Thomas\u0026#8217 latest cartoon depicts the growing worry over the potential closure of Inveraray\u0026#8217s branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland.The branch has been threatened with closure since the end of 2017, prompting protests and petitions.The status of the branch is still undecided and the bank remains open for now.The opportunity to have a say is quickly closing, with an online petition set to be hand-delivered by the person who initially set it up, Mid Argyll writer and journalist Marian Pallister.The petition will be handed over in Inveraray on Wednesday August 8.To sign online, visit the 38degrees website and search for ‘RBS Inveraray’.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tech savvy feis an tairbeirt gives musicians a professional edge","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 08/08/18, 7:29 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA Fèis an Tairbeirt workshop in music production, funded by Argyll and Bute Council\u0026#8217s Supporting Communities Fund, has been voted a success.Students recorded and produced their own tracks, created soundscapes with pre-recorded sounds, composed soundtracks and provided voiceovers for pieces of film and media during the three-day event.The chance to develop these skills is not usually offered outside of higher education but thanks to the knowledge and experience of tutor Luke Schofield, Fèis an Tairbeirt was able to offer this unique opportunity to local young adults.Another course has been arranged for September 15 and 16 and is limited to six places.The course is free but anyone interested should email feisantairbeirt@gmail to book a place.

The ball made its way through to the unmarked Robert Walker who had the simple task of tapping the ball home to open the scoring with 15 minutes played.Bute’s centre line started to dominate play and John MacCallum set up Iain MacDonald who made it 2-0 five minutes before the break.Inveraray came out stronger in the second half, enjoying the bulk of play, but it was Bute who scored a third goal with Robert Walker netting with 15 minutes remaining.The goal seemed to spark life into the Inveraray team who went on to score two goals in a four-minute spell.Craig Taylor fired home an unstoppable shot on 79 minutes, and just a couple of minutes later captain John MacKenzie made it 3-2.The visitors almost snatched a draw at the death through a Steven Cameron shot which went just inches wide of goal.Taynuilt 2 Kilmory 3Alister MacArthur scored twice as Kilmory beat Taynuilt at the Taynuilt Sports Field.Taynuilt started strongly, but while they dominated play the Kilmory keeper didn’t have a save to make the home side missed chances.The second half was only three minutes old when Alister MacArthur, who individually has scored more goals than the whole Taynuilt team this season, showed the reason why by firing the ball past Reid in the Taynuilt goal.He repeated the feat five minutes later to give Kilmory a two goal cushion.This seemed to stir Taynuilt into action and David Campbell scored from the edge of the D on the hour to reduce the deficit.Taynuilt went all out for the equaliser but were caught out on 72 minutes when Sandy Leiper ran away from his marker and laid the ball off to Ally MacLennan to slip it passed Reid and restore Kilmory\u0026#8217s two-goal advantage.It was a crucial strike as the home side pulled a goal back just six minutes later after a well-worked corner between David Campbell and Jamie MacFarlane with the latter firing a shot passed the Kilmory keeper to make it 3-2.Taynuilt laid siege to the Kilmory goal for the remainder of the game but they lacked the composure to get an equaliser.Best for Kilmory were Jones, Cunningham, and MacArthur and man of the match, Leiper.Kilmory leapfrog Taynuilt in the league and unless Taynuilt can find someone to put the ball in the net, they are going to be in the relegation dog-fight.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"past times present fun in lochgilphead","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/08/18, 11:29 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowOrganisers reckon 450 people came along to enjoy a dip into the past.Lochgilphead Community Council\u0026#8217s annual Celtic and Pictish Festival is gathering momentum year on year as it grows into an event with a character all of its own.Morning shoppers on Argyll Street were treated to the unusual sight of Picts, Vikings and Romans parading to Lochgilphead front green to begin the festivities.

Saints had the majority of possession in the second 20 minutes but the Star back line of Kyle Selfridge, Andy Weir and Luke Naisby remained resolute along with Luke Kalache in goal.The other sides in group two were debutants Port Glasgow who ran out 2-0 winners against Neilston as two first half goals sealed the match in the Inverclyde men’s favour.Red Star’s next game against Neilston was an entertaining affair. After a goalless first half, Star took the lead through Ian McGuinness before an equaliser from Neilston after some sloppy defending. Innes Meikle restored the Red Star advantage with a long range effort which he curled away from the Neilston keeper for 2-1. Star were once again pegged back however as a free kick into the box bamboozled Kalache in the box and ended up in the back of the net. Just as it looked like the points would be shared Gregor Peacock got on the end of a Cammy MacDonald flick on and headed into the net to secure a 3-2 win for the hosts.Oban Saints and Port Glasgow took to the Astro next and the Oban side soon got into their stride and ran out comfortable 2-0 winners to move to the top of the section on goal difference.Saints stayed on to play their final group match against Neilston and they continued to play some excellent attacking football with Donald Campbell scoring the pick of the goals in a 3-0 win to secure top spot.This left Red Star and Port Glasgow to face each other in the final game to determine who would go through as runners up. Both sides were keen to secure the victory but the defences remained on top in a 0-0 draw and the Lochgilphead side made it through after picking up five points from their three matches with Port Glasgow finishing on four.Over at the Ropework, Campbeltown Pupils opened up their campaign with a 1-0 victory over local rivals Tarbert. Kilsyth, making their tournament debut, also got off to an excellent start with a 3-1 victory over Dunoon.Dunoon stayed on to play against old rivals Campbeltown Pupils in what turned out to be a feisty encounter with the Pupils running out 2-1 winners thanks to a Martin McCallum free kick in the final minute.Tarbert then took on Kilsyth in a 1-1 stalemate, with Nikki MacDougall scoring the equaliser, before fighting out another draw with Dunoon to end the campaign with two points.This left Kilsyth and Pupils fighting for the top two spots in the final match of the section and the North Lanarkshire side edged the tie 1-0 to secure top spot and a semi-final against Red Star.The first semi-final saw Oban Saints take on Campbeltown Pupils, with Saints taking the lead in the first half after Fraser McFarlane was felled in the box. Up stepped Lewis Cameron to make no mistake from the spot.Pupils weren’t lying down, however and got back into the game with a penalty of their own to equalise, and will be disappointed not to have forced a winner late on.The match was decided by a penalty shoot-out and Saints eventually came out in top on a contest that swung back and forward, providing some excellent entertainment for the crowd that had gathered.The second semi-final also proved to be an exciting affair as Red Star took on Kilsyth. The hosts fell behind early on when Kilsyth opened the scoring after their midfielder finished well from 20 yards to beat Kalache in the Star goal.Red Star equalised soon after with a Ben Forbes wonder strike from 30 yards which thundered past the Kilsyth keeper. Star took the lead when Gregor Peacock was barged in the box and Andy Weir stepped up to fire the penalty beyond the ‘keeper to give the hosts the lead. Kilsyth were causing Star plenty of problems however and were level again before the half-time whistle when a scramble in the box saw the ball deflect in off the unfortunate Luke Naisby.The winner came for Star early in the second half when Kilsyth couldn’t clear a free kick into the box and the ball broke kindly to John Kennedy, who volleyed home to secure the win and send Red Star into the final where for the second year in a row they would face Oban Saints.Into the final and the Red Star side were clearly feeling the effects of their exertions as they struggled to contain a fluid Oban Saints attack early on. Saints had a couple of good attempts saved by Luke Kalache before Matt Rippon opened the scoring after the ball broke kindly on the edge of the box.The Premier division side put themselves 2-0 up on the stroke of half time when more good play saw the ball fall to Shaun MacIver who bundled home.The second half saw Saints stretch their lead through James Ford before Cammy McDonald pulled a late consolation for Red Star but it was Oban Saints who ran out deserved 3-1 winners and won the tournament for the second year running.Saints also had the Player of the Tournament, which was awarded to Lewis Cameron who was excellent throughout the day.Red Star would like to thank all the teams and officials who took part in the competition, as well as the Stag Hotel for their excellent hospitality.Tomorrow Red Star round off their pre-season schedule with a home match against Helensburgh which will take place at the Ropework, with a 2pm kick-off.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 6:15 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,At the latest Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islands meeting I stated a large number of my younger constituents have been contacting me in regards to the availability of housing.While a greater number of affordable rental accommodation is more than welcome, a larger amount of affordable housing to buy needs to be built across Argyll.I was also very happy at a recent meeting with my fellow Conservative councillors to discuss the huge importance of having a more streamlined planning service that helps rather than hinders economic strength across Argyll and Bute.An effective planning system plays an important role in supporting growth – promoting and enabling the homes, jobs and services that communities need, creating a more competitive local economy and minimising uncertainty and delay for those proposing or affected by development.We in Argyll are seeing a tremendous increase in our industrial output and we as a council must not place barriers in the way of future growth in this area.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.Sir,I\u0026#8217m calling on Argyll and Bute\u0026#8217s small shopkeepers to enter the Best Small Shops competition, celebrating the creativity of small shops and the central role they play in their local community.Argyll and Bute is a hub of small local retailers, many of which are a lifeline.The Best Small Shops competition is open to any small shop operating in the UK.

It strikes me this sort of selfish attitude is something that may also be contributing to the growing problem of drivers throwing rubbish out their windows on Argyll\u0026#8217s road network.If you can\u0026#8217t find a public toilet, at least find a tree to hide behind when you\u0026#8217re caught short \u0026#8211 and a bin to chuck your rubbish in.Name and address supplied.Sir,At Royal Mail we never forget that we form an essential part of the UK’s social fabric.We know our postmen and postwomen are valued members of the local community as they deliver letters and parcels six days a week \u0026#8211 in all weathers.

Builder John MacDonald followed with colourful tales of Archie McVicar, with whom he worked as a young man. Greta Cameron talked about the early years of the Oyster Bar, established on the estate in the late 1970s by Christina\u0026#8217s brother Johnny Noble along with fish farmer Andy Lane.Piecing together records from her father\u0026#8217s journal, estate records and blending these with the recollections of the people of the estate, Christina has created a remarkable piece of work.This book is not just about the Nobles, but the Ardkinglas community, the people who make it and have made it and the story of how they lived and worked.\u0026#8216I\u0026#8217m very pleased that so many people have come along today for our launch party,\u0026#8217 said Christina.\u0026#8216Ardkinglas is a place that is very dear to me, and the place and the people have contributed to making me who I am today.

I foolishly stood up too soon approaching the Kilmartin stop and fell forward, landing head to door and feet in the air.Thank you to the doctor who checked me over, and to the driver and passengers who waited until I had been checked.Janet Jardine, KilmartinSir,I would like to give thanks to Tarbert Festivals Committee for all their hard work in organising the very successful Seafood Festival.Tarbert Festival Queen 2018 Chloe MacDonald with her Princesses Cara and Kaitlyn were beautiful and a great credit to the festival.My thanks again to everyone who helped in any way to make this year’s festival such an amazing event and to the very many people who visited the village for the occasion.Councillor Anne Horn, TarbertEditor\u0026#8217s note: With apologies to Councillor Horn for the delay in publishing this letter, originally submitted in July.Sir,The closure of the tourist centres at Tarbert and Inveraray is very worrying and I can’t understand why VisitScotland, backed by the Scottish Government, came up with such a decision.Tourism is extremely important to Argyll and Bute, and all agencies should be working together to assist the tourists that come to this area.Tarbert is in my council ward and I know how valuable the centre there is. The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex (number two) from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray. They searched all the places they had visited, including the George, but the keys were not found, so they returned to Cairnbaan by taxi.Fortunately the hotel found the keys and managed to make contact with them, and they returned to Inveraray by taxi to collect the keys from the staff who had been kind enough to wait for them.Once again I would to thank you for your help in making my guests\u0026#8217 stay memorable.Pauline Houston, Crinan Canal CottageSir,I was very happy to attend this year\u0026#8217s Islay, Jura and Colonsay Agricultural Show.It was great to hear about the terrific work being done by the Islay Development Initiative with their Islay Pollinator Initiative which generates employment, including two Modern Apprentices in Beekeeping.I spoke to local farmers about single farm payment delays, feed prices, fuel prices, broadband speed and the poor quality of our infrastructure.

Over the years, while working towards the awards, Myles has learned to play the accordion and now regularly enjoys playing in a band. He has spent a residential week carrying out an archaeological exploration, and he has taken part in several expeditions to places including the islands of Arran and Skye. He became involved in numerous other activities over the years.The award consists of four elements, at each of the three levels \u0026#8211 these are physical such as sport, skills, volunteering and expedition.Activities must be followed for a long enough period of time to show a real commitment to the sport, skill or volunteering choice, and can range from three months at bronze to a year for gold.Blair Fletcher, who helped Myles on the project, said: \u0026#8216Congratulations to Myles on having achieved his bronze, silver and now his gold award \u0026#8211 It\u0026#8217s well known that achieving a Gold Duke of Edinburgh\u0026#8217s Award is a marathon, not a sprint,and requires persistence, commitment and the ability to work within a team.\u0026#8216Myles has shown, by his efforts, that he possesses all of these qualities and thoroughly deserves his Gold Award.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13080662.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_IBP_AYP_090818LABOUR_07JPG.jpg","title":"scottish labour leader richard leonard","story":"NewsScottish Labour leader Richard Leonard stops off in Doon ValleyHe made a good impression on a whistle-stop tour of Dalmellington and Bellsbank.Share\u0026nbspByLochlin Highet13:53, 14 AUG 2018NewsLabour leader Richard Leonard visited Dalmellington (Image: AYRSHIRE POST)Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRichard Leonard went on a charm offensive in an area that was once a Labour heartland. And he is well aware that Labour must recapture votes in places like the Doon Valley if it is to regain power at Holyrood and Westminster. “This is precisely the kind of constituency we need to win back,” admitted the Scottish Labour Party leader. He made a good impression on a whistle-stop tour of Dalmellington and Bellsbank. But time will tell whether or not this will bring voters back to the fold. Mr Leonard chatted amiably to lady volunteers at the Kirk Shop, in the middle of Dalmellington. There was clearly lots of goodwill for the Yorkshire-born politician. The affable Labour leader then moved on to Dalmellington Care Centre, where he planted a red rose to mark the 70th anniversary of the NHS. “My grandfather was a gardener, back in Leeds,” said Mr Leonard, as he wielded a spade. He heard about grassrooots co-operation in Dalmellinton among groups like The Zone and the care centre.  Mr Leonard said: “It’s the resilience of the people that’s keeping the Doon Valley going. “But it’s about time they were given a helping hand from government. “There are too many people living in poverty and on poverty pay. “We need investment in public services and we need to see communities having more control, with the possibility of community buy-outs.” Mr Leonard said only Labour is pledging a decade of investment. “We’re the only party opposing the austerity policies of the Tories, which are being passed on by the SNP.” He said the SNP’s own Growth Commission report revealed there would be even more austerity in an independent Scotland. And he was adamant: “The Labour Party is absolutely opposed to a second referendum on independence.”  Labour colleague Colin Smyth MSP said: “We’re seeing a growing frustration among voters on a debate focused on the constitution. “People want to see improvements in education and health.” Mr Leonard popped up to Bellsbank to see how streets are being transformed with ‘Balamory’ style painting of houses. In the afternoon, he visited the Sovereign Credit Union in Cumnock to hear about its services in the community. Then it was on to Tarbolton, to meet residents who are unhappy about their doctors’ surgery hours being cut, due to a shortage of GPs.

They resided in the old Tower on the hill, which is now in ruins. The Govans continued in possession of Cardrona until the latter end of the seventeenth century, when it was purchased by Mr Williamson, writer in Peebles, and Town Clerk of that burgh.

This was granted, and the work of demolition was soon begun. The roof was taken off and the chambers filled with earth, and in the course of a short time the effects of the weather made themselves apparent. The walls cracked in every direction, and large masses of the building fell.\nNext the crowbar was applied with great success and to make the appearance of an ancient ruin as near perfect as possible, a cartwheel was fixed in one of the largest rents, that the effect at a distance might be that of a venerable abbey.

The tradition in the family [Horseburgh] is that this part of the property was sold to defray the expenses of a lawsuit which had arisen between two brothers.\nAt Nether Horsburgh there are the remains of an old tower or keep, which used to be called Shillinglaw Tower.

benefits claimants in applying for welfare. \u0026nbsp\nThe petition further calls on the council to \u0026ldquoensure there are sufficient staff resources within Scottish Borders Council for maximisation of benefit entitlement in the Borders and to \u0026ldquoacknowledge the error made in not carrying out any public consultation on the restructure.\nThe author of the petition and chair of the Borders mental health forum, Jenny Mushlin, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom very concerned that at a time when the benefits system has become so complicated the council has changed its service.\n\u0026ldquoThere are now fewer welfare officers and they are all working across different services.\n\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom hoping this petition will give some understanding to councillors

on customers to self-serve online has created increased demands on Council services to assist customers.\n\u0026ldquoPrior to November 2017 the equivalent of 1.7 welfare benefit assistants were

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message.

Christa Gerdwilker, 51, has lived in Scotland for over 30 years. She and wife Susan live in East Saltoun but she said the uncertainty over what would happen when Britain leaves the European Union had prompted her to seek UK citizenship.  Christa said: \u0026ldquoBrexit is the reason I decided to apply for citizenship.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove lived here for 30 years and came with certain expectations thinking we were secure but it has pulled the rug from right under our feet and suddenly the future is uncertain.  \u0026ldquoIt has caused some sleepless nights and so it made sense to get permanent residency.  The ceremonies, which are held in East Lothian three or four times a year, are the final part of applying to become a British citizen.  Since April 2016, 103 people have taken part in a ceremony in East Lothian.  Each person who takes part is presented with a certificate confirming their residency status and a welcome pack. East Lothian Council also presents everyone who takes part in a ceremony in the county with a memento of the occasion.  The Lord Lieutenant said: \u0026ldquoFor the people here it is the end of a journey which for some has been a very long one. It can be an emotional moment for many and is important to them.  \u0026ldquoIt is extraordinary to see the range of places people are from who want to be UK citizens.  The ceremony was held in the Adam Room at John Muir House and overseen by registrar Janet Fairnie.  East Lothian Provost John McMillan and Angela Leitch, chief executive of East Lothian Council, joined the ceremony welcoming the new citizens, who were watched by family and friends invited along.  Mr McMillan told the new citizens: \u0026ldquoCitizenship brings certain privileges. You now live in a parliamentary democracy where everyone is equal in the eyes of the law. It brings with it a responsibility to treat fellow citizens with respect and be good neighbours, and to take an active part in society, which I hope you will.  Ms Leitch praised the East Lothian residents who had gained their new status.  She said: \u0026ldquoI know it has been quite a journey for some who have come through a process that many of us who have lived in this country all our lives do not have to go through.

It connects us to our ancestral origins and reasserts our relationship with nature, of which we are also a part. There are few such important gifts that we can give our children, and ourselves, than a regular forest bath.  The term forest bathing of course comes from Japan, where it was first coined in the 1980s to describe the mental health benefits of regular meditative time spend in the woods. But the spiritual and mental uplift that nature provides has long been known, and here in Scotland the Celtic tradition in particular has a powerful relationship with trees and the nature.  But we are forgetting it all. We are forgetting who we are and from what we came. And we are suffering as a result.  Another recent term is nature deficit disorder, a phrase created by Richard Louv who wrote Last Child in the Woods in 2005. While it is not an actually recognised medical condition as such, putting a name on the effects of nature deprivation has made people more aware of it.  So for my final journey of discovery this summer, I took a friend who is unused to spending time in nature for a walk in Butterdean Wood. I cannot put into words how important this place is for my family and my soul. My children have grown up, and are growing up, in this wonderful wood. It\u0026rsquos a cradle of nature where you can feel simultaneously lost and found, for the trees envelop you, as if to say \u0026ldquowelcome back.  It\u0026rsquos horrific to think that a number of years ago there was a plan to cut the wood down, but thanks to Gregor Neil Robertson and others, a campaign to save the wood, supported by Friends of the Earth, was successful.  My friend suffers from depression and anxiety. When I told him I planned a walk in a wood he protested. He has weight issues as well, and going for a walk is something he knows he should do, but doesn\u0026rsquot enjoy.  \u0026ldquoYou will enjoy this walk, I reassured him.  \u0026ldquoDon\u0026rsquot think so, was his reply, but he nonetheless finally agreed to come along, after I\u0026rsquod promised it would only be a short one.  There are different options when you begin to explore the wood, but my family have a favourite part and so that\u0026rsquos where I took him. Trees have a way of bringing feelings to the surface and soon my friend was talking about stuff.  We first wandered through the pine wood. It\u0026rsquos planted with mainly non-native pine trees but has a wonderful atmosphere.  I told him of the story about the brownie who hides in the wood, because he is fearful of humans whom he believes to be cruel after witnessing a farmer\u0026rsquos son whip a horse.  The story took us to what my children call the \u0026lsquofaerie bridge\u0026rsquo. It is here that the wood changes in character. Once across the bridge the wood is more mixed, with mainly deciduous trees: oak, rowan, ash, sycamore, beech and hazel, but also the occasional Scots pine.  \u0026ldquoCheck for something metal on you, I told my friend. He looked at me funny. \u0026ldquoEh?  \u0026ldquoSomething made of iron or metal of some kind, I reiterated.  \u0026ldquoWhat for?  \u0026ldquoWell, because the faeries live in the part of the wood across the bridge, but iron undoes their magic. So you are safe if you are wearing something made of it, I explained.  \u0026ldquoSeriously?  I just smiled. He was lucky, he had a metal strap on his watch. And so we ventured over the bridge.  This part of Butterdean Wood is vivid green in high summer. We soon reached a junction in the path.  \u0026ldquoOK, this is the short way back, we\u0026rsquoll take that. I was keeping my promise that we\u0026rsquod only go on a short walk. But my friend protested.  \u0026ldquoOh naw, let\u0026rsquos go on for a bit more, I\u0026rsquom actually enjoying this.  And so we ventured further, past the tall beech tree which still has the rough end of a rope tied round one of its upper branches. It was here, in summers about 10 years ago, my now grown-up daughters would swing on the rope swing I made for them.  We sat here for a short while so my friend could take a breath. He noticed the silence, which was then softly broken by the swish of tree tops swaying in a breeze. We sat for perhaps two minutes, not looking at each other, but just being present under the canopy of nature.  \u0026ldquoOK, he said, \u0026ldquoyou\u0026rsquore right, it is magic.  I smiled and nodded.  We walked, at a guess, over three miles through Butterdean Wood on this day. I introduced him to different trees and we paused often, soaking in the power of it all. It\u0026rsquos a place of constant minor changes, as all woods are, and it\u0026rsquos only when you visit them regularly that you notice the changes.  As we left, my friend commented on how much better he felt, how his anxiety had eased and that he\u0026rsquod want to come back with his son.  \u0026ldquoButterdean Wood would be a gift for your son, I said, \u0026ldquolet him bathe in the forest too.  We all need this, and on a regular basis. We need to find time for it, find a wood we can reach and bathe in. It benefits our health in so many ways but it also helps us to connect and have a relationship with nature. It should be a birthright of our children to run free in the wood, to explore and become part of it.  Later in the week I returned with my children. We followed our trails of memory, my older daughters walking in their own footprints of younger years, which are now overlaid with the imprint of their younger siblings. I searched but saw no signs of autumn.  But soon the summer will end, and the heatwaves of 2018 will become part of our folk memory.  Autumn in Butterdean is nature\u0026rsquos show, but it\u0026rsquos not ready for that yet, it\u0026rsquos still fully clothed in summer\u0026rsquos colours."},{"url":null,"title":"disgraceful-state-of-north-berwick-toilets-slammed","story":"  The quality of the toilets on the town\u0026rsquos Quality Street has long been lauded by residents and visitors alike, but last week it drew criticism from one resident, who contacted the Courier to offer her concerns.  Helen Mulgray wrote: \u0026ldquoI was shocked to see how the cleanliness of the toilets had deteriorated.  \u0026ldquoThese once highly praised, award-winning toilets have been degraded to become offensive and at times a health hazard \u0026ndash no soap to wash hands and no toilet paper unless [it is] picked off the floor.  She described the condition of the toilets as a \u0026ldquodisgraceful memory of a visit to North Berwick for the thousands of visitors that flock to the town every summer.  East Lothian Council is currently proposing to cut the permanent toilet attendants at the county\u0026rsquos public loos and instead see them maintained by an extended team of mobile attendants.  Ms Mulgray slammed the council for the proposal, adding: \u0026ldquoImplementing the proposed plan to do away with full-time attendants means this mess will be a permanent sight for visitors to the toilets.  \u0026ldquoIt takes no account of the crowds coming from the beach until late, busloads stopping at the car park, and events like the Fringe [by the Sea] and the [Highland] Games.  \u0026ldquoIs saving money this way more important than the tourist image of North Berwick?  Ms Mulgray added that when she returned to the toilets last Monday, they were \u0026ldquospotless.  She put the improvements down to the fact that the usual full-time attendant had returned from annual leave.  Ms Mulgray wrote to the council to express her concerns about the toilets being allowed to deteriorate last week and, in a response seen by the Courier, Lorraine Faulds, senior officer of facilities management, wrote: \u0026ldquoLooking at your specific concerns with North Berwick toilets, it has been maintained by a combination of permanent and mobile attendants for more than six years.  \u0026ldquoThis pattern has ensured appropriate levels of cleanliness throughout the year and includes recognition of the busier summer months.  \u0026ldquoWe are aware that at any toilet, on any occasion, whether by intent or accident, toilets or sinks can be blocked by paper or left as debris.  \u0026ldquoFortunately these remain isolated incidents at our sites and North Berwick toilets actually have a more frequent attendance by the mobile attendants than some of our other sites.  She said the emptying of sanitary bins would increase from once a week to twice due to Ms Mulgray\u0026rsquos complaint of them \u0026ldquooverflowing.  The letter added: \u0026ldquoWe take our service provision extremely seriously and aim to maintain the very high standards of our public toilets.

It comes as the number of lairs at Deer Park Cemetery, opposite where the proposed new burial ground would be sited, reaches a dangerously low figure.  Ward councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the importance of new burial spaces being created in the town.  Mr Hampshire, chairman of the council planning committee, was unable to comment on the merits of any specific application because of his role on the committee.  But he said: \u0026ldquoI have been told by officers, early next year there will be no spaces available in the cemetery.  \u0026ldquoIt would mean people in the community would need to be buried outwith the town, which would not be acceptable to people. There is a desperate need for [a new] cemetery within Dunbar.  The proposed new cemetery comes as part of a controversial planning application approved by the planning committee last year.  More than 100 houses are set to be built on land at Newtonlees Farm, despite the site being outwith the sites identified at that stage by the council\u0026rsquos Local Development Plan and recommended for refusal by planning officers.  Mr Hampshire ultimately had the casting vote on the Gladman Developments scheme after the vote at the council meeting was tied at 4-4.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe original proposal had been to extend the existing cemetery.  \u0026ldquoHowever, when the consent was given for a housing development along with the golf course at Dunbar Golf Club, the land was not secured at that time by the council.  \u0026ldquoThere have now been more burials in the cemetery and the way the layout is the bit of land that was available to purchase would not have created the substantial extension that would have been viable for the future in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoThat is why the council had to look at alternative sites to create a new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoThe two cemeteries are very close to each other.  \u0026ldquoThere will be parking still available in the old Deer Park site and some new parking created within the new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoI think the two will work well together and be a cemetery which is available for a long number of years and satisfy the needs of the Dunbar community.  Deer Park Cemetery opened in 1953 and is expected, according to East Lothian Council, to reach capacity by the summer of 2020.  There are a total of 1,300 lairs in Deer Park cemetery, which are expected to be full within 18-24 months.  A spokeswoman for the council said: \u0026ldquoThe size of the proposed cemetery is approximately 1.2 hectares offering 2,000 lairs, 700 ashes-only lairs and an area for woodland burial.

That has led to questions being asked as to how the current doctors\u0026rsquo surgery, on Newton Port, will cope with the increase in people.  Fiona-Frances Adam, one of the town\u0026rsquos community councillors, raised the issue with councillors.  She asked: \u0026ldquoWhat are they going to be doing?  \u0026ldquoAre they going to extend the surgery with all the incoming people?  \u0026ldquoThey are stretched.  Land was previously earmarked for a new doctors\u0026rsquo surgery to be created on the site of the new East Lothian Community Hospital, which is currently being built on the site of the former Roodlands Hospital.  The new hospital is expected to be complete in 2020 but no planning application has been submitted for a GP surgery at any site in the town, including the hospital and within the new Letham Mains development, which is sandwiched between the B6471 and the A6093.  Jan Wilson, chairwoman of the community council, said: \u0026ldquoWhere the surgery is at the moment is central.  \u0026ldquoI think as far as I am led to believe there is supposed to be a doctors\u0026rsquo surgery in the Letham Main development.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership told the Courier that discussions had been taking place with Haddington GPs on how to support the growing population for \u0026ldquosome time.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe new housing is phased, which enables us to plan ahead.  \u0026ldquoAt the moment we are still looking at a range of options.  \u0026ldquoOf course, the focus on greater multi-disciplinary working coming in now with the new GP contract will allow patients much greater flexibility and swifter access to the right clinical professional at surgeries and other local settings.  Provost John McMillan, a councillor for Haddington and Lammermuir ward, said planning the development of any future health facility had to be carefully weighed up.  Mr McMillan also noted the variety of services which would be included within the new \u0026pound70 million hospital.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is the same issues around working with a town that has got a good town square and you need to look at car parking.  \u0026ldquoWe are looking at that in a measured way and working in partnership.  \u0026ldquoIt is the same with families with young children coming in and an ageing population.  \u0026ldquoYou have to look at schools and the health service as well."},{"url":null,"title":"pear-tree-nursery-set-to-create-up-to-30-jobs-in-haddington","story":"  Pear Tree Nursery has opened a second facility in the town in a former bed and breakfast on West Road.

Nicola Pryde, director of the nursery group, which is already open on Meadowpark and has another facility in Dunblane, Stirling, said that the new centre had been opened to meet demand as the town sees more families moving in.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe wanted a second site because of the waiting list we had at Meadowpark and were delighted to be able to take on the former B\u0026ampB on West Road.  \u0026ldquoOur open day showed how much nursery places are in demand and with all the new houses being built we knew there was a need for it.  \u0026ldquoWe are delighted to have a second nursery in Haddington.

The findings come at the same time as overall employment in the county has increased slightly.  Figures show that the number of people in either part-time or full-time employment in East Lothian rose to 78.6 per cent between April 2017 and March 2018, an increase of 3.6 per cent from the previous year, when the rate was at 75 per cent.  Councillor Brian Small, leader of the opposition Conservative Group on East Lothian Council, said: \u0026ldquoObviously the fact that 4,000 households are without work is worrying.  \u0026ldquoWork isn\u0026rsquot only important for the financial benefits to those in employment, it also generates health and social benefits for them.  \u0026ldquoHaving something to get up in the morning for is good for you.  \u0026ldquoBut we have to welcome that East Lothian is better than both the UK and Scottish average but there is still more that can and should be done to get people back into work.

County MP Martin Whitfield said: \u0026ldquoClearly the increase in the local employment rate over the last year is welcome. However, the fact there are still many people out of work remains a concern. It underlines the complacency of the UK Government, which is simply not doing enough to help people into work.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council, through its East Lothian Works employability service, is doing a good job supporting jobseekers, but both the UK and Scottish Governments must do more to enhance prosperity and create new jobs.

A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoUnemployment figures in East Lothian are following a positive trend as there are over three per cent more people in employment now compared to last year.  \u0026ldquoThe council continues to strive to grow East Lothian\u0026rsquos economy and to make it the best place in Scotland to live, work and do business and we would very much hope our employment figures will continue to rise year-on-year as a result of this work.  \u0026ldquoIt is difficult to comment in detail on the figure of 4,000 households being classed as out of work as it\u0026rsquos unclear, as yet, exactly how this figure has been calculated.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to note that the roll-out of full service Universal Credit in East Lothian has had an effect on the recording of our out-of-work levels so this too needs to be looked at more closely.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Works continues to support people of all ages and abilities to gain skills, re-train and undertake courses and work experience to get them back into rewarding employment, working closely with employers and education providers. There are also many initiatives to support the most vulnerable in our society, including those living in poverty, including projects initiated by our area partnerships designed to meet the needs of our very different communities across East Lothian.  Across Scotland, the most common reason people gave for not being in work was being sick or disabled \u0026ndash 37 per cent of out-of-work individuals cited illness or disability as the primary reason.  Students made up 13 per cent of the group, and 18 per cent were early retirees, with 10 per cent of jobless people in the area officially \u0026lsquounemployed\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash looking for work and able to start within two weeks.  A spokesperson from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said: \u0026ldquoSince 2010 the proportion of workless households is down in every region of Great Britain.  \u0026ldquoThe unemployment rate remains at its lowest since 1971, but we\u0026rsquore committed to ensuring that everyone who wants to work has the opportunity to do so \u0026ndash while making sure there is a safety net for those who can\u0026rsquot.  The DWP has also said that the majority of employment growth has been in both full-time and permanent roles.  David Leese, policy analysis manager at charity the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said that workless families in particular were at a much higher risk of poverty.  Figures from the DWP for 2016-17 show that in workless households nearly 75 per cent of children were growing up in poverty, compared to only five per cent of children with two working parents.  \u0026ldquoIf a child lives in poverty, it affects their health, their education, their family relationships and their plans for the future, Mr Leese said. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not right that any child lives in such insecure circumstances."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-courier-pet-idol-see-the-top-50","story":"  Pictured here are all the 50 pets still in the running.

Among the East Lothian pubs to have permanently closed during this period are the Elphinstone Arms in Elphinstone The Hub in Tranent the Bay Horse in Haddington and The Hayweights, Burgh and Mrs Forman\u0026rsquos in Musselburgh.  The figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that in 2010 there were about 55 pubs and bars in East Lothian but by 2017 that had fallen to about 45.  Michael Peters, who is behind The New Pheasant in Haddington \u0026ndash which opened this week at the site of the former Pheasant, which shut in 2009 \u0026ndash was not surprised by the figures.  He said that there were a variety of reasons for the decline in the number of pubs, including the lowering of the drink-drive limit in Scotland in 2014, issues with breweries, and the state of the economy.  Mr Peters felt that there was a real need for pubs in towns and villages and said: \u0026ldquoI am not biased but every town needs a pub.  \u0026ldquoIt is not just for drinking but socialising and the community \u0026ndash nothing would be happening. Most things that happen \u0026ndash golf trips, football, anything like that \u0026ndash it is organised when you are in the pub.  \u0026ldquoWhere do most people socialise?  Across the UK, 5,745 pubs closed over the same period, and there are 54 local authorities across the country where 30 or more shut.  Pubs have been pointing the finger of blame at the taxman for their troubles, complaining about the duty on beer, VAT levels and the cost of business rates.  Britain\u0026rsquos Beer Alliance, a group of organisations in the pub and brewing sector, has started a campaign called Long Live the Local with a petition and calls for people to write to their MP to have beer duty reduced.  The latest data from the ONS shows that between 2016 and 2017, 655 pubs and bars across the UK called time for the last time.  In East Lothian there was a slight upturn in that period, with numbers up by about five.  A change in consumer habits, with people drinking at home more often, has been blamed for fewer people visiting pubs.  There are 21 areas of the country that have bucked the decline and have more pubs now than they had in 2010. Top of the list is Hackney in East London, which had 55 more bars in 2017 than it did in 2010."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-the-mermaids-magic-storm","story":"  AFTER our return from a final camping trip in the midges and mist, my youngest daughter started school. She needed an early-morning shower to remove the lingering smell of wood smoke in her hair this morning before getting ready.  She protested a bit, as she said she liked the smell of wood smoke because it reminded her of camping in the Highlands. But soon she was all excited to be dressed up, smart and clean for school. She is attending Prestonpans Infant School, as her big sister did before her, and as I did when it was the primary school.  She looked so smart and business-like as she walked into class with a beaming smile. We shared this moment with many other parents, who were taking the same photos and shedding similar tears. Only the day before, Skye had climbed the side of a mountain in Glencoe as if she had once been a mountain goat and proclaimed she wanted to live by a waterfall.  Now, all dressed to conform (although hair still looking slightly wild as she likes it), she has entered a formal system which in my day did its best to (literally) beat out any original creativity that didn\u0026rsquot fit in with teachers\u0026rsquo expectations.  But as our daughter walked through the same doors I had once gone through, I was uplifted by a hopeful expectation that when we come to pick her up she will be less smart, less clean and her hair even wilder. That\u0026rsquos what school should be like for a wee girl not yet reached five. And I know she is in good hands in that respect at Prestonpans Infants.  But as I kissed her goodbye this morning, she asked: \u0026ldquoCan we have tea by a campfire in the woods? The campfire had been the communal focus during our camping trip. As darkness fell, the spirit of the fire glowed brighter and danced with our imaginations as we told stories and riddles with each other. I of course agreed, but her comment helped me think of which tale to tell this week.  Much of our summer has been spent exploring the wonders of East Lothian. We explored beaches and caves. We climbed hills and moors. We swam and paddled in rivers, climbed trees and sat under them having picnics.  But wherever we went there was one thing that we always saw, even in quite remote places: litter. Sometimes there was more, sometimes there was less, but we couldn\u0026rsquot escape it. My children notice it I suppose because I mention it. Our children pick up other people\u0026rsquos litter as we walk, so we now need an extra rucksack to carry it.  \u0026ldquoWhy do people do this? asked my nine-year-old after she had watched a family sitting in a car in a car park by a beach. They had been eating sandwiches and drinking juice, and then threw all the packaging out of the windows. The plastic juice bottles rolled about in the breeze and the sandwich packaging blew away and got caught in some sea buckthorn bushes nearby. The family then drove away, no doubt having had a nice day at the beach, but leaving their rubbish for others to enjoy.  I make no apologies for sounding angry at this. And I do not blame the children, it\u0026rsquos the adults who frame this behaviour. I understand people want to keep their cars tidy but I couldn\u0026rsquot answer my daughter\u0026rsquos question as we sat watching someone else\u0026rsquos rubbish desecrate a beauty spot. I just can\u0026rsquot understand the mindset. So all I said was: \u0026ldquoWell they just don\u0026rsquot know any better I suppose, or maybe just don\u0026rsquot care.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos so sad, she replied, then went very quiet. Then she came up with an answer to the problem: a story:  \u0026lsquoThe king of the sea told all the mermaids not to go close to the shore because of the dangerous litter that humans pollute it with. One mermaid asked what litter was and the king replied it was many things, such as broken glass and plastic which kills sea creatures, as well as making the place humans live look ugly.  \u0026ldquoWhy do they do this? asked the mermaid. The king shrugged his shoulders, and said: \u0026ldquoThey must be less clever than the animals they kill.  But one day the mermaid disobeyed her king and swam to the shore close to the beach at North Berwick. But her tail was cut by broken glass and then she got caught in plastic bags floating on the surface. She was in trouble and a fisherman saw her.  He helped her remove the bags and gave her cream for her cut tail.  \u0026ldquoWhy do you people do this? she asked him. He felt ashamed because he also would throw litter. He promised her he would never do it again. But there was so much rubbish in the sea that they agreed they would try and collect it.  So the mermaid gathered her friends and collected the rubbish. The fisherman\u0026rsquos boat was soon so full that it nearly sank, and when he returned to the harbour people saw the mountain of rubbish he had caught. They laughed at him, thinking he was not a good fisherman because all he had caught was litter and rubbish.  \u0026ldquoLook, said the fisherman, \u0026ldquothis is what we are doing to the sea and the land. Why do we do this? But nobody cared.  \u0026ldquoThis is impossible, we can\u0026rsquot collect all of it, said the mermaid, \u0026ldquoand every day the wind blows more into the sea.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos hopeless, people will never change, said the fisherman. But the mermaid was angry: \u0026ldquoThey must change or else we will all die, including them too eventually.  Mermaids have powers to control the wind. They can whip up storms and so she decided she would make a very unusual, magic storm.  The wind blew not everywhere but where the litter lay. It blew all the rubbish thrown by the humans back into their houses and cars. People woke up with broken glass in their beds and plastic bags covering their children. Their homes were piled high with dangerous and ugly rubbish. When they tried to get rid of it, it just blew back in.  The countryside and sea became wonderfully litter free because of this magic storm, and when people littered the storm whipped up again and blew it straight into their house or car. They couldn\u0026rsquot escape from it. People were living knee-deep in the rubbish they had thrown out of windows or not recycled.  So soon they stopped littering because now they understood what it meant for the other creatures. Finally they cared, because they were the ones who suffered most. At last they got the wisdom of the animals.\u0026rsquo  This story, I think, would make the perfect start to any school day."},{"url":null,"title":"new-world-record-set-at-haddington-rugby-club","story":"  A total of 458 men, women and children took to the pitch at Neilson Park on Sunday as part of the Haddington 700 celebrations. Currently the world record for players involved in a continuous game of rugby is 442.  Now Haddington RFC president Keith Wallace is waiting for official confirmation that a new record has been set.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe day was a fantastic occasion despite the worst day of weather all summer, and we were delighted by the huge effort and support from the club and the rugby and local communities in getting past the record.  \u0026ldquoAs a celebration of the town\u0026rsquos 700 years of the Royal Charter it was a great success, with the match kicked off by Provost John McMillan, and great support from the town, with particular thanks to the boys\u0026rsquo football team who arrived late on, like the cavalry, to help get us over the line.  \u0026ldquoMore than that, though, it was brilliant to see players [aged] from five to 73 enjoying our great game, with several cases of three generations from the same family playing at the same time, including one connected family group of 18.  \u0026ldquoThis is the power of rugby. We look forward to seeing many of our record-breakers back at the club in the near future.  \u0026ldquoWe would also like to thank the Royal Bank of Scotland, sponsors of RugbyForce day of which we were one of two top prize winners, without whose support the event would not have been possible \u0026ndash in particular their many staff, including a good number from the local branch who helped massively on the day.  The match between Haddington President\u0026rsquos XV and Haddington Barbarians XV was kicked off by Provost John McMillan.  The councillor, who previously played for Murrayfield 3rds, said: \u0026ldquoIt was a real honour. I have not played rugby for well over 40 years and it was an amazing day, with a great turnout.  \u0026ldquoIt was very well-organised, despite the horrific weather. It was a great community thing and I was impressed how many people were there \u0026ndash men, women and children of all ages.  \u0026ldquoIt was a great tribute to the club but also the community.  Following their \u0026pound1,000 win for their successful application as part of the Royal Bank RugbyForce initiative, delivered in partnership with Scottish Rugby, Haddington\u0026rsquos event organisers will now submit evidence of the record for verification from Guinness World Records.  Haddington RFC will also use the prize money to contribute towards a recruitment drive to increase playing numbers at all levels and fund community engagement projects.  Haddington RFC\u0026rsquos charity partner Wooden Spoon were also in attendance on the day.  Mr Wallace, who took part in the early stages of the mammoth six-hour match, thanked current Scotland internationalists Stuart McInally, Willem Nel and Sarah Law while there was also an appearance from ex-Lions and Scotland forward Finlay Calder, who grew up in Haddington. Mr Wallace said: \u0026ldquoIt made a huge difference \u0026ndash the kids loved seeing them and they were great."},{"url":null,"title":"new-headteacher-wants-to-make-knox-academy-a-flagship-school-for-east-lothian","story":"  Susan Cook took charge at the Haddington school this week after moving from Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Trinity Academy, where she was acting headteacher.

Ms Cook, who lives in the county, previously worked in Edinburgh at a number of schools, including Drummond Community High School, Leith Academy and Tynecastle Academy.  The teacher, who has a background in physical education, started on Monday.  Two in-service days gave her the chance to meet the staff before pupils arrived.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe staff seem fantastic, a creative group of people. They really are keen for the school to engage with the challenge.  Ms Cook has also vowed not to remain in her office at the school but instead wants to get out and about and speak to the pupils and staff.  She said: \u0026ldquoI found when I was at Trinity Academy, the headteacher and the senior leadership team were in the middle of the school.

She said: \u0026ldquoI absolutely love the school.  \u0026ldquoLots of people say it about Dunbar, that it is a really special community.  \u0026ldquoThere is really something quite magical about the school and the community.  \u0026ldquoThe youngsters here are just tremendous and the friendliness you get from young people and staff \u0026ndash it is a really caring place.  Currently the school is undergoing a large-scale expansion, which is due to be fully complete in early November.

And it takes the masterplan a stage further with more detailed ideas for each of the zones proposed in its vision, including calling for the Scottish Government to be invited to base its HQ for its proposed state company on the site, as well as suggesting offshore windfarm company Inch Cape \u0026ndash which wants to place a substation on the land to bring energy ashore from proposed turbines \u0026ndash should also be encouraged to put its Scottish base there.  The community council document comes in the wake of a brochure produced by neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council promoting its vision of a Port of Prestonpans cruise terminal at the former power station site.  That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.  Graeme Jeffrey, community council chairman, said: \u0026ldquoAs a community council we are promoting our vision of what we would like to see.

Operators First Bus has confirmed no one was injured during the blaze on board the X37 service, the cause of which is not yet known.    Graeme Bell, 32, was standing in his garden as the drama unfolded.  He said: \"I heard a noise which at first sounded like a tractor going by with steel beams attached to the wheels.  \"It stopped about 20 yards from my house then it started smoking.  \"It got worse and worse then the whole bus went up in flames.    \"From my garden I could see people on the top deck running towards the exit.  \"I imagine they would\u0027ve got quite a fright if they were up the back.  \"It took about 20 minutes for the fire brigade to come.

He added: \"I just went along to see if they were OK.  \"It must\u0027ve taken about 15 or 20 minutes for the fire service to put out the flames, but by that time it was completely burnt out.  \"Our kids were quite worked up by it all and it caused quite a bit of alarm in the street, specially with it being so close to the houses.\"  A First Scotland East spokesman said: \"We can confirm our vehicle was involved in an incident at 8.05pm last night (August 20) in Allandale.  \"No passengers or staff were injured in any way in the incident.  \"The driver deserves huge praise as his swift actions to stop the vehicle and evacuate all four passengers have prevented any injuries whatsoever and avoided a much more serious incident.  \"Our staff are all highly trained and we have emergency procedures in place for this sort of incident.  \"Passenger and staff safety is our number one priority and is at the forefront of everything that we do.  \"We will now carry out a full internal investigation to establish the root cause.\""},{"url":null,"title":"calorie-content-of-britains-unhealthiest-takeaway-in-greenock-revealed","story":"  As first reported by the Evening Times on Monday, the bargain bucket contains chips, two pizza crunches, fish, two sausages, two hamburgers, onion rings, chicken nuggets and fritters - all battered.

The Scot inherited a Premier League-winning winning squad, but could only guide United to seventh the following season and was sacked before the close of the 2013/14 campaign.  Ferdinand says that Moyes, who is now in the running for the US national team manager\u0027s position, introduced a new mentality into the dressing room that proved a shock at Old Trafford.    \"Even the mindset in one of the training sessions, I hope I\u0027m not speaking out of line here toward David Moyes, but our mindset we were never worried about the opposition [before],\" said the former England international.  \"We never set out thinking we need to contain the opposition, we\u0027re going to try and win this game based on what we\u0027re good at.  \"But I remember the first couple of games against Liverpool and Chelsea, we were talking more about Hazard and Coutinho than we were about our own attacking tactics.  \"There\u0027s doubt and players there looking at each other thinking \u0027This isn\u0027t us.

The adorable duo, believed to be around ten, were found in a \"very sorry state with lots of issues, and no enthusiasm for life\".  They were severely underweight and suffering from a painful, untreated condition on their rear legs.  Originating in New Zealand, the breed nearly became extinct in the 1970s with only 50 purebreds known to be alive.  Still classified as rare, Kunekunes - meaning \u0027fat and round\u0027 in M\u0026#257ori - are small domestic pigs and typically kept as pets because of their docile and friendly natures and size.  According to the New Zealand Kunekune Association: \"The typical Kunekune nature is of a sociable placid pig that likes close human contact.  \"They are intelligent, resourceful, and affectionate, with a passion for food and a good scratch.  \"Although boars can be aggressive to each other or if a sow is in season, Kunekunes are usually very trustworthy, easy to handle, and safe to have children around.\" Ava\u0027s and Doris\u0027s condition has improved dramatically since they were rescued and now the RSPCA wants to find them a suitable \"forever\" home.  RSPCA inspector Ellie Burt said: \u0026ldquoWhen the pair came into our care they were in a very sorry state with lots of issues, and no enthusiasm for life.  \"But following months of care and loving treatment by the centre which has been looking after them, their personalities are now really shining through.  \"They are now much more mobile and love to jump up at the gate when you go to visit them.  \"I am really hopeful that there is someone out there with a smallholding or a farm that would be happy to take on this pair so they can live out the rest of their lives in comfort.  \"They have the most wonderful characters and really deserve a second chance.\" The animal charity said it\u0026rsquos \"essential\" that their new adopter has experience of keeping pigs to make sure they can provide everything they\u0026rsquoll need to be looked after properly, as well as knowledge of the laws associated with keeping pigs such as what they can and can\u0026rsquot be fed.  Their new owners will also need to register their land to keep pigs if they haven\u0026rsquot already done so, and follow the required laws to transport them.  To be properly cared for, the pigs will need a large designated space just for them where they can wallow in mud to cool down in the summer, and a pig hut full of comfy straw in the winter to \"snuggle up inside and keep cosy\".  As of 2010, Kunekunes no longer face extinction, with breed societies in both New Zealand and the UK.  The pigs, which on average live until the age of 20 and weigh between 60 and 200kg, are numbered in their thousands thanks to a recovery breeding programme."},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy-hunt-calls-on-eu-partners-to-stand-shoulder-to-shoulder-with-uk-and-us-against-russian-aggression","story":"  The challenge will come as he makes his first visit to Washington as Foreign Secretary to give a speech during which he will consider the raft of challenges to the \"international rules-based system that has kept us safe for decades,\" raising issues that could cause some unease in the White House.  Mr Hunt will encourage the EU to join western allies so they speak with \"one voice\" against transgressions by Russia \"whenever and wherever they occur, from the streets of Salisbury to the fate of Crimea\".  EU member states, including Germany and France, have been among dozens of countries which expelled Russian diplomats following March\u0027s Novichok nerve agent attack on former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, which also resulted in the death of a British woman, Dawn Sturgess, in June.  Yet some have since reached out to President Vladimir Putin with Emmanuel Macron, the French President, travelling to St Petersburg to call on Russia to work \"hand-in-hand\" with Europe and Italy questioning whether sanctions imposed over the 2014 annexation of Crimea should continue.  The Secretary of State\u0026rsquos visit also follows the historic and controversial summit between Donald Trump and Mr Putin in Helsinki, which led to widespread criticism of the US President.  In a speech at the US Institute of Peace, Mr Hunt is due to say that, under Mr Putin, Russia\u0027s \"aggressive and malign behaviour undermines the international order that keeps us safe\" and its foreign policy has \u0026ldquomade the world a more dangerous place.  He will go on: \"And today, the United Kingdom asks its allies to go further by calling on the European Union to ensure its sanctions against Russia are comprehensive and that we truly stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the US.  \"That means calling out and responding to transgressions with one voice whenever and wherever they occur, from the streets of Salisbury to the fate of Crimea.\"  The Secretary of State will also warn the West\u0026rsquos democratic model is \u0026ldquodeclining in attractiveness for too many people with many voters since the financial crash of 2008 starting to question globalisation and rejecting political leaders they associate as defending it.  While he will insist the heart of democracy is freedom of expression, Mr Hunt will point to how the \u0026ldquoubiquity of fake news, social media targeting and foreign attempts to manipulate elections have undermined confidence that this can actually happen.  Yet he warns against \u0026ldquoputting our heads in the sand to blame social media by pretending some of the causes of social resentment are not real whether caused by the \"decline in real incomes for many Americans and Europeans, dislocation caused by changes in technology or the identity concerns of many voters caused by immigration.

Official figures released in June showed exports of UK goods and services hit a record \u0026pound620 billion last year, accounting for almost a third of UK GDP.  In a speech to a business audience in London launching the Government\u0027s new export strategy, Dr Fox is expected to say: \"UK businesses are superbly placed to capitalise on the rapid changes in the global economic environment and the UK has the potential to be a 21st century exporting superpower.  \"As an international economic department, we are determined to support, connect and grow UK companies on the world stage through our international network.  \"As we leave the EU, we must set our sights high and that is just what this export strategy will help us achieve,\" the Scot will declare.  The Trade Department noted how research showed that companies, which exported, had increased growth potential, were more productive and had better paid jobs.  Last year, UK exports posted a record high with \u0026pound620bn of goods and services sold abroad by British companies, accounting for 30 per cent of the UK\u0026rsquos wealth creation.  Yet the Department estimates 400,000 businesses believe they could export but do not while demand for British expertise and goods overseas is growing.  Announcing a \u0026ldquonew national drive to export, Baroness Fairhead, the Trade Minister, said: \u0026ldquoAs the world\u0026rsquos sixth largest exporter, we do punch above our weight however, we also punch below our potential.  \u0026ldquoThis Export Strategy sets out to change that and to increase exports as a proportion of GDP from 30 to 35 per cent, taking us from the middle of the G7 to near the top. This is ambitious but achievable, she insisted.  Mike Cherry, the National Chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the Government\u0027s export strategy was \"strong on aspiration\" and welcomed the commitment to increase exports as a proportion of GDP and other measures which could support small firms.  \"Incentives like export vouchers and grants should be made available to small businesses to help them with upfront investment costs for things like translation services or additional market research.  \"An assessment of financial incentives, including export vouchers, as mentioned in the strategy, is a step in the right direction, but we are fast running out of time, he warned.  Mr Cherry added: \"The clock is ticking. If the Government doesn\u0027t act quickly and introduce financial incentives there is a risk the current uncertainty will have a serious and detrimental impact on the growth of small businesses.\"  Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI Director-General, said: \"This strategy is a timely signal that the Government is committed to improving the United Kingdom\u0027s international competitiveness.  \"The CBI strongly supports the ambition to make exports 35 per cent of GDP, which will put the UK out in front of many of our international competitors.  She added: \"We estimate that in every region of the country there are around 10 per cent of businesses that could export but don\u0027t and we look forward to working alongside the Government to support and inspire them to seize the opportunity.\""},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-admits-to-worrying-about-contributing-to-woes-of-world","story":"  The First Minister also described the world as often a dark and \u0026ldquoworrying place at present.  Ms Sturgeon made the comments at the Edinburgh International Book Festival while hosting a talk with the novelist Ali Smith, whom she called \u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos greatest living writer.  The First Minister was reflecting after reading a passage from Ms Smith\u0026rsquos recent novel Autumn about the divisions in society left by the EU referendum and Brexit.  Ms Sturgeon, who is due to make an announcement on a second independence referendum in October, said: \u0026ldquoAs a politician, I\u0026rsquom acutely aware \u0026ndash and it\u0026rsquos something I think about a lot \u0026ndash that politicians, by definition, [are] opinionated. We put forward strong views and policies.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore sometimes the cause, or a cause, of the division. Also, how we communicate now seems to reinforce those divisions. It pushes people to take sides and simplifies things.  Although Ms Sturgeon mostly put the questions to Ms Smith, the author also asked the First Minister, a voracious reader, what happened when she read a book.  Ms Sturgeon said: \u0026ldquoA whole variety of different things. Sometimes the ability to escape and switch off from whatever it is that\u0026rsquos worrying me at the time.  \u0026ldquoIf there was one thing I could make compulsory for leaders across the world it would be to read fiction. For me fiction, much more than non-fiction, allows situations that I have no direct experience of to be really conjured up and for me to develop an understanding in a way that is different to reading non-fiction.  After Ms Smith referred to President Trump and political lying, Ms Sturgeon said most people would recognise the world \u0026ldquoto some extent [as] a dark place just now, a worrying place.  The two were speaking in conversation at the Edinburgh International Book Festival, where Ms Sturgeon acknowledged that politicians were often the cause of such division.  She said: \u0026ldquoAs a politician I\u0026rsquom acutely aware, and it\u0026rsquos something I think about a lot, that politicians by definition we\u0026rsquore opinionated, we put forward strong views on policies, we\u0026rsquore sometimes the cause or a cause of the division.  \u0026ldquoAlso how we communicate now seems to reinforce those divisions, it pushes people to take sides and simplify things.  \u0026ldquoIs there a case right now that either through the form of the novel or the perspective of the writer, that perspective is actually much much more needed than perhaps has been in our lifetimes?  Ms Smith responded: \u0026ldquoThe novel is a unifying force. All art reminds us to engage and it reminds us to enter \u0026ndash even just with itself \u0026ndash dialogue. Dialogue is the source of life.  \u0026ldquoThe point at which you actually talk to somebody, rather than block a story... that\u0026rsquos coming from someone else, the point at which the stories meet and become one story instead of separate stories on competing sides of the walls and fences \u0026ndash which politics across the world at the moment is not just threatening us with, but building.  Ms Smith said this was \u0026ldquothe darkest time that I\u0026rsquove ever lived in, adding: \u0026ldquoIn our lives, across the world from this country outwards, from the UK outwards it\u0026rsquos a dark, dark premise.  \u0026ldquoWith nobody interested in the UK Government in those splits... to try to heal the thing that is revealed by Brexit. Everybody vying for power in a way that is absolutely terrifying.  But she told the First Minister, who said most would recognise to some extent the current time as \u0026ldquoa dark place, a worrying place that the novel was ultimately a form that gave hope for the future.  Nick Barley, Book Festival director, provoked laughter when he thanked Ms Sturgeon for being a \u0026ldquoprime minister who reads, before correcting it to First Minister."},{"url":null,"title":"andrew-mckie-the-people-have-voted-and-the-result-must-be-allowed-to-stand","story":"  A lot of the people who voted Remain are saying that, if anything, their dire predictions understated matters financial calamity is certain, there will be a hard border within the UK and we\u0026rsquoll be so cut off from EU trade that there will be shortages of everything from food to medicine.  Hundreds rally in Edinburgh, and a millionaire pledges money for a push for a second vote, in the hope that people will change their minds. Polling suggests that rising numbers (48 per cent at the last count) would like another referendum on the final deal.  I say imagine because, though all that is happening now, I\u0026rsquom thinking of a similar situation in an alternate version of 2016, two years after Scotland narrowly voted to leave the United Kingdom. Leavers predicted an oil boom worth \u0026pound57 billion, based on a price around $150 a barrel the oil price is now (as it was in the real 2016) falling, and currently below $25 a barrel.  The EU is insisting that either Scotland effectively abandons the main elements of independence or has a hard border with England. Half the Leavers now want a very soft independence deal (devo ++) the other half want the hardest possible exit. Unionists think that by telling everyone disaster is looming, just enough people will change their minds in a second vote. Everyone on both sides is astonished that nobody seems to have thought about any of the details.  Does another go at the referendum, in such circumstances, sound like a recipe for improving the situation? Or like a desperate bid by increasingly hysterical losers to overturn a democratic decision with breathtaking assertions about future catastrophes which are entirely hypothetical?  Both Julian Dunkerton, the co-founder of the Superdry clothing chain, who is giving \u0026pound1 million to the campaign for a \u0026ldquoPeople\u0026rsquos Vote \u0026ndash so-called, presumably, because it is designed to reverse the vote the people have already cast \u0026ndash and the unofficial Leave campaign\u0026rsquos Arron Banks, who claims to have drummed up \u0026pound2 million to depose Theresa May and abandon her deal (whatever it might be) in favour of a hard Brexit, are throwing money at equally chimerical problems.  The simple point about both the Brexit and independence referendums is that they were democratic decisions about the future. And no one knew or knows now what will happen in the future.  That\u0026rsquos as true of the \u0026ldquoremain side of both votes as the \u0026ldquoleave the only status quo that remains exactly the same forever is the band. In real life, Remainers were signing up to the future direction of travel of the UK or the EU with no more certainty about it than Leavers had about the future outside either union.  That is why all counterfactual claims are worthless and unverifiable. Claims that, for example, the UK economy has grown less than it would have done if we\u0026rsquod stayed in the EU are neither true nor false \u0026ndash they are meaningless, because we don\u0026rsquot know what would have happened had the vote gone the other way. For the same reason, we can\u0026rsquot know whether any of the \u0026ldquoProject Fear claims made in the independence referendum would have come about.  We can guess that the fall in the oil price would have put paid to the SNP\u0026rsquos pre-referendum predictions, and point out that Alex Salmond\u0026rsquos oil boom didn\u0026rsquot happen. But even if we think it likely, we can\u0026rsquot say with certainty that economic disaster would have followed, or that an independent Scotland would be worse off because it didn\u0026rsquot happen.  So we can\u0026rsquot assess whether people are worse off or growth is lower than would have been the case if the Brexit vote had gone the other way. What we can know is that the vast majority of the predictions made by the Remain campaign about what would happen immediately after the vote were not only wrong, but the reverse of what did happen.  Unemployment did not go up by 500,000, but fell to its lowest level since 1975. Interest rates did not rise, but fell. Foreign investment in the UK increased, as did the number of foreign students. There was not, as George Osborne assured us there would be, an \u0026ldquoimmediate recession with four quarters of negative growth the economy grew every quarter, and UK growth is currently higher than Eurozone growth. There has been no enormous exodus of capital or foreign firms.  All those things could, of course, happen in the future, along with plenty of other bad things. But their failure to materialise so far is not a compelling argument for believing that those who wrongly predicted them now have access to a better crystal ball.  Naturally, Remain voters regret the result. It\u0026rsquos even reasonable that some Leave voters might now vote differently. Votes, however, are not conducted on the basis of time travel, or \u0026ldquoif I had known then what I know now. No one could have known, to take the most obvious example, that Theresa May would be the worst prime minister in living memory, and making a pig\u0026rsquos ear of the negotiations.  But the case being made by campaigners for a second referendum is not even that. They know now no more than they knew at the time of the vote. Their earlier warnings having been disproved, they are just shouting other ones, more loudly. Some, such as Professor AC Grayling, Lord Adonis, and the former BBC journalist Gavin Esler, now resemble the demented 19th-Century Millerites who were constantly predicting the Apocalypse, and changing the date when it failed to turn up.  Even if you calculate that the current Government is bound to mess things up, the solution would not be to reverse a democratic decision before it been implemented it would be to get rid of the government. A rally of several hundreds of Remainers in Edinburgh at the height of the Festival, and even the 650,000-odd signatures on a petition calling for a \u0026ldquoRight Kind of People\u0026rsquos Vote should not invalidate the biggest popular vote for anything ever, and especially not before it has even happened."},{"url":null,"title":"murrayfield-has-a-great-chance-of-hosting-top-football-games-says-sru","story":"  The upbeat message from the Scottish Rugby Union (SRU) came as Glasgow City Council vowed to tackle the issues surrounding transport to and from Hampden, in a last gasp bid to keep the home of football in the city.  According to Glasgow council leader Susan Aitken, plans to improve transport links are already under way, and could transform the way supporters travel to Scotland matches and cup finals.  Transport issues have been a common area of complaint from football fans and people attending events at the stadium.  Bosses from the SFA are due to make a final decision next Wednesday on whether to shift showpiece internationals and cup finals away from their traditional home to BT Murrayfield in Edinburgh.  It could bring an end to more than a century of international football history and heritage linked to the 52,000-seat stadium, as well as have dire consequences for current owners, Queens Park.  The SFA currently rents Hampden under a lease with the Ladbroke\u0026rsquos League Two side, which is set to expire in 2020. Although it has an option to renew the lease, football\u0026rsquos governing body opted to explore alternatives.  While Queen\u0026rsquos Park are reported to be willing to sell their property to the SFA for \u0026pound6 million, rugby chiefs believe they have the credentials to lure the SFA from their home since 1906.  Dominc McKay, the SRU\u0026rsquos chief operating officer, said: \u0026ldquoI think we\u0026rsquove got a great chance. We\u0026rsquove had brilliant discussions with our colleagues at the SFA at every level, whether that is financial, commercial, marketing or security.  \u0026ldquoIn every element we\u0026rsquove spent a lot of time with them and will be hosting them again shortly. So we\u0026rsquore in a great place.  \u0026ldquoPut it simply we believe we have the best stadium in Scotland. Don\u0026rsquot take my word for it, take the hundreds of thousands of people who came through our turnstiles last year and the year before. People who come to Murrayfield have a great experience, whether that be Hearts who played four games last year there or the opposition who got a couple of wins.  \u0026ldquoI think our changing-room facilities, our media facilities and our facilities for the athletes are better than anything else in Scotland. We have a great bid, we\u0026rsquove certainly put our best foot forward and we look forward to hearing how we get on.  Glasgow City Council chiefs yesterday insisted they were working to resolve transport issues, which have historically dogged fans attempting to reach the stadium.  The main route is via train from Glasgow Central to Mount Florida, or bus along Aikenhead Road or Cathcart Road. Fans have complained the stadium is not accessible, with long queues for trains, traffic jams on surrounding roads and limited parking.  In a letter to the SFA president, Ms Aitken said work was currently under way to make further improvements.  She said: \u0026ldquoMost notable is the South City Way, which is building safer, more comfortable, faster and more coherent cycle and walking routes from Queen\u0026rsquos Park to the Merchant City. Within two years, the experience for walkers, cyclists and public transport users will be unrecognisable. Coupled with signage and promotion, this will go a considerable way towards delivering the Hampden Stride and improving the experience of walking to and from the stadium.  \u0026ldquoThe council is participating with Hampden Park and transport stakeholders on a transport working group to put in place an Event Transport Plan, which will make travelling by public transport to international games, domestic cup matches and concerts at Hampden markedly better."},{"url":null,"title":"seats-in-scotland-vital-for-labour-election-win-says-jeremy-corbyn","story":"  The Labour leader is due in New Lanark to meet with those selected to stand in target Westminster constituencies as part of his four-day trip north of the border.

The trip was revealed in minutes of a meeting between Ms Sturgeon and Mr Torra at the First Minister\u0026rsquos Bute House residence last month.  The Catalan Government said it hoped to set a date in the coming weeks.  The Scottish Tories said the trip was a political visit to push separatism and should therefore be paid for by the SNP, not the public purse.\u0026nbsp  Mr Torra\u0026rsquos meeting with Ms Sturgeon was the first high-level discussion between the Scottish and Catalan governments since Alex Salmond visited Barcelona as FM in 2008.  However the president at that time was Socialist Jos\u0026eacute Montilla, who opposed separatism.  Mr Torra had been in Edinburgh to discuss Clara Ponsati, the St Andrews University Professor then facing extradition to Spain on charges of rebellion and abusing public funds.    Prof Ponsati was a member of the Catalan government which held an independence referendum in October 2017 despite Spain\u0026rsquos constitutional court ruling it illegal.  Spanish judges later threw out the case against her and the extradition case was dropped.  Mr Torra, a former journalist and lawyer, was sworn in as Catalan president in May after the previous Catalan president, Carles Puigdemont, went into exile to avoid arrest by Madrid.    Ms Sturgeon had backed the Catalan government\u0026rsquos decision to hold the referendum, which produced a 90% vote for secession, and was marred by Spanish riot police attacking voters.  The minutes of the Bute House event, released under freedom of information, said the two leaders discussed the \u0026ldquochallenging and complex situation in Catalonia.  \u0026ldquoThey agreed that the way forward for Catalonia must be through peaceful and democratic solutions involving dialogue between the Spanish and Catalan authorities, respecting the right to self-determination of the Catalan people.  \u0026ldquoThe President extended an invite to the First Minister to visit Barcelona, the First Minister indicated she would be delighted to do so.  The two governments also agreed to strengthen trading links, with the Catalan Secretary of Foreign Affairs offering to share experiences on creating a national investment bank.  The Scottish Government also offered lessons learned from holding a referendum through the \u0026ldquoEdinburgh Agreement process.  Ms Sturgeon\u0026rsquos briefing note emphasises \u0026ldquoopportunities for bilateral cooperation.  \u0026#8203Scottish Tory MP Adam Tomkins said:\u0026nbsp\"As First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon has become utterly sidetracked playing to the nationalist gallery.

It should come out of the SNP\u0027s own coffers.\"  A spokeswoman for the Catalan government confirmed the Barcelona visit, and said there were hopes to fix a date after the summer recess in Catalonia.

Dr Fox, who travels to China today, told a business audience at the Institute of Directors: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos really important that we don\u0026rsquot have such a narrow bandwidth that we only think about Brexit.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos really interesting when I go to China and other parts of the world and talk about the global economy, tariffs, the US and China, the WTO and in the UK we talk about Brexit, Brexit and Brexit. It\u0026rsquos an important issue but it\u0026rsquos not the only issue in terms of global trade.  \u0026ldquoWhat we are trying to do today is to\u0026hellipwiden our horizons, to lengthen our timeframes.  \"Our competitors are not thinking about next year or the year after. They are thinking in five, 10, 15-year timescales about how they can improve their global position.\"  The Secretary of State said Britain had the potential to be a \"21st century exporting superpower\" and that the new strategy was being led by business rather than government.  His ministerial colleague, Baroness Fairhead, told the IoD that 20 years ago Germany had an export industry which accounted for 30 per cent of GDP, similar to Britain\u0026rsquos today but it had grown its exports so they now accounted for almost 50 per cent of GDP.  Dr Fox stressed how Europe, which accounts for some 43 per cent of the UK\u0026rsquos export market - 10 years ago it was more than 50 per cent - remained very important but he sought to set this in a global context.  He explained how China within the next decade or so was expected to have some 220 cities with a population of more than one million people today, the whole of Europe has just 35.  He also noted how it was predicted that by 2060 there would be more than one billion middle class Africans.  \"The shifts in global economic and demographic power - and the rise of collective wealth of developing countries that it is bringing - will shape future opportunities of free trade in the years to come.  \"Making the most of these changes - providing the jobs and prosperity the UK needs - means navigating this shift successfully,\" explained the Secretary of State.  Dr Fox, who earlier this month suggested the odds of a no-deal Brexit was 60/40, insisted quitting the EU did not mean Britain would \"pull up the drawbridge,\" rather, it would be able to \"embrace the opportunities that the changing pattern of global trade presents\".  The Scot added: \"We must raise our ambitions, widen our horizons and expand our timescales.  \"Europe is, and will, continue to be an important market for our goods and services, but there is a world beyond Europe and a time beyond Brexit.\"  But the Government\u0026rsquos opponents were unconvinced by the launch of its new export strategy.  Sir Vince Cable claimed the 35 per cent trade target was meaningless, having been \u0026ldquopulled out of thin air.  Such targets, the Liberal Democrat leader argued, had been created, missed and forgotten about several times before.  \u0026ldquoThe best way to become an exporting superpower is to protect our place in the single market and customs union by exiting from Brexit whilst simultaneously supporting exports to rapidly growing markets across the world from within the EU,\" he added.  Labour\u0026rsquos Peter Kyle, on behalf of the People\u0026rsquos Vote campaign, said: \u0026ldquoFar from being a future superpower, Liam Fox and his fellow Brextremists are shrinking our global ambition and the risk of leaving the single market and customs union will be far more damaging than any fantasy gains dreamt up by ministers.  \u0026ldquoThe chaos and uncertainty of Liam Fox\u0026rsquos bad deal or no deal Brexit is why we need a People\u0026rsquos Vote on the Brexit deal to let the people take back control, he added."},{"url":null,"title":"windrush-review-finds-18-people-may-have-been-wrongfully-removed-or-detained","story":"  Officials examined nearly 12,000 historical records and established that 11 people who came to the country from the Caribbean prior to 1973 and stayed permanently left the country voluntarily after being unable to establish continuous residence.  Some of those who departed were served with immigration enforcement papers informing them they had no right to be in the UK.  The review found that a further seven individuals were detained before being released, without being removed.  Of these 18, four were removed and two detained before May 2010 and seven were removed and five detained after that month.  The review, which has looked at 11,800 detention and removal cases of non-foreign national offenders, also identified 74 people who it would appear were either detained or removed because they had lost their entitlement to indefinite leave to remain after leaving the UK for more than two years. `  The Home Office said all of those identified will be put in contact with a specialist taskforce set up in response to the crisis and signposted to a compensation scheme.  Home Secretary Sajid Javid said the initial priority is to contact the 18 cases which the Government considers are the most likely to have suffered \u0026ldquodetriment.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe experiences faced by some members of the Windrush generation are completely unacceptable and I am committed to righting the wrongs of the past.  \u0026ldquoI would like to personally apologise to those identified in our review and am committed to providing them with the support and compensation they deserve.  \u0026ldquoWe must do everything we can to ensure that nothing like this happens again \u0026ndash which is why I have asked an independent adviser to look at what lessons we can learn from Windrush.

Our friendship has remained firm ever since.The Great Polish Map of Scotland was mainly the work of a small group of Poles from the Jagiellonian University of Krakow, led by the map’s lead designer, Dr. Kazimierz Trafas.                                                                                                        But its creation was the brainchild of Krakow-born Jan Tomasik, a sergeant in the 1st (Polish) Armoured Division, who was stationed in Galashiels during the war and married a Scottish nurse in 1942 after being treated in the town’s Peel Hospital.He became a successful hotelier in Edinburgh after the war and added Barony Castle in Eddleston to his properties in 1968, where the map was conceived and created.He wanted to show hotel guests the landscape of Scotland and hoped the map would become a tourist magnet.Jan also wanted to show the coastline of the country Polish forces had been responsible for defending.                                                                                                        He is remembered as saying to hotel patrons: “I shall die but I shall leave my map as a gift to the Scottish people to thank them for the hospitality they showed the Poles when it was needed”.After the hotel closed in 1985 and ownership of Barony Castle passed from the Tomasik family, the map fell gradually into disrepair.But in 2010, Mapa Scotland was formed – a group of volunteers who were dedicated to restoring the map to its former gloryThanks to grants from the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Fund, along with fundraising, that goal has now been achieved.And it is hoped it will become both a visitor attraction and an educational resource for many generations to come.                                                                                                        With that in mind, a digital documentation team from Historic Environment Scotland spent five days on site, laser scanning the map to create a 3D model.The team then spent several months, working with Mapa Scotland and the Polish Cultural Festival Association, to create an interactive app highlighting Scotland’s Polish heritage.For Marta Pilarska, digital documentation intern with HES, the project proved to be a learning curve.She said: “I’m Polish and even I was discovering new connections between Poland and Scotland which I had never heard before. “It was a really interesting project to be involved with.“I knew the basics – the soldiers during the war years and that Bonnie Prince Charlie’s mother was Polish.“But I never knew that 40,000 Scots emigrated to Poland in the 1600s and that many towns and areas are still named after Scotland.“One of the quirkier facts we discovered was that a Polish folk dance, dating back to the 1600s, is actually based on a ceilidh dance.“I had no idea about any of that until this project.”Marta joined the HES team at an ideal time too – just one month before work started on the project.She added: “I was in the perfect place at the perfect time – a nice coincidence.“We hope people will enjoy finding out more about the two countries links and that teachers will also visit the map and use the digital app as a learning tool.”The Great Polish Map of Scotland measures some 50 metres by 40 metres and lies in an oval pit surrounded by a 142 metres long perimeter wall. Covering an area of 1590 square metres, it is understood to be the largest three-dimensional physical representation of a country and the largest outdoor relief map in the world.Visit https://sketchfab/HistoricEnvironment Scotland to explore the app.A labour of love for MAPA Scotland volunteers who restored landmarkA business meeting at Barony Castle Hotel in 1996 led Keith Burns to stumble across the Great Polish Map of Scotland, literally – it was so overgrown.But it wasn’t until 1999, when the engineer from East Linton retired, that the discovery started “nagging away” at him.In 2000, Keith and several friends started discussing what they could do to transform the landmark’s fortunes.And in 2010 they formed the charity MAPA Scotland, with the aim of raising enough funds to restore the map.Initially, they thought it would take two years and around £45,000 to rectify – but it proved a much larger undertaking.Keith, who was the project manager, explained: “We seriously understimated how long the work would take and how much it would all cost.“There were two reasons for that: firstly, we didn’t realise how much repair work the foundations of the map would require. They had been built with old tin cans from the hotel and they were crumbling away.“And secondly we had to get one or two specialist contractors to repair the pit wall and relay a lot of underground water supply pipes for the seabed.“The water supply had never worked it now does so we’ve actually upgraded the map.“But all of that took money and, to date, it has cost in excess of £120,000 to restore.”That funding was raised thanks to the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Funds, as well as major contributions from the Barony Castle Hotel, Borders Council, the Polish Consulate and the Scottish Polish Cultural Association, as well as generous public donations.However, 12 MAPA volunteers bore the brunt of the labour.Keith added: “We were all retired and could spend time on the project. It was hard work and involved a fair bit of travel but we’re delighted the map has now finally been restored.”Collection boxes around the site will help MAPA maintain the map for future generations.

Another is from Sandra Gow, of Lybster, who stated that the plan would be detrimental to the \u0026ldquoexisting, privately owned hotels, B\u0026ampBs and self-caterers in the surrounding areas with the potential of closure to many small businesses during the winter months.The chamber, however, has since sought to clarify its stance, stating in a post on the planning department\u0026rsquos website that the original objection was \u0026ldquomade specifically on behalf of our members in the hospitality industry.Of the documented cases submitted to planning, the Caithness Disabled Access Panel has written in support of the hotel plan.It says it accepts the development could impact on other hotels, but adds: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only hotel in the county with completely disabled bedrooms and showers and adhering to the laws on discrimination.The organisation says it has had \u0026ldquonumerous complaints from visitors in the county on the lack of disabled rooms in the area.Since the chamber\u0026rsquos objection was first reported on July 13, social media users have voiced their feelings.Those posting online generally have fallen onto two sides \u0026ndash those in support of local hoteliers, and an opposition accusing them of self-interest.\u0026ldquoWe need more beds.

Some reports suggest it may be more than just a fanciful notion.When first contacted by Wick historian Harry Gray about the recent restoration of the \"Iron Wellie\", we had visions of a giant Wellington boot unearthed from the Caithness moors. That theory was firmly booted into touch after a visit to this unearthed marvel on the northern side of Wick Bay.The Iron Wellie is in fact a spring water well situated down a flight of recently restored Caithness flagstone steps close to the Soldiers\u0027 Tower on the North Head.Charlie Bain of Wick Paths Group explained how together with Denny Swanson, Tommy Munro and others from the Royal British Legion Scotland they recently restored the site of the spring.\"The steps down to it were overgrown and damaged,\" he said. \"We also replaced the pipe the water flows through and there is a marker stone at the top of the steps.\"Denny Swanson said he remembered bringing the water to his mother who suffered from arthritis for most of her life.\"She sent me down every second day for a bottle of \u0027Iron Wellie water\u0027, as she called it. She maintained it helped her arthritis and it certainly seemed to take some of her pain away.\"After Harry symbolically cut a ribbon of barricade tape the group, together with Charlie\u0027s dog Jet, went down for a taste of the water that many in the area depended on in bygone times. It is speculated that the inhabitants of nearby Tinkers\u0027 Cave would have consumed the water. The Wick worthy Tudor James resided close to the site and lived to a ripe old age.Harry said that the Iron Wellie was also known as the Chalybeate Spring and its taste has been described like \"sookin\u0027 pennies\".\"Chalybeate waters, also known as ferruginous waters, are mineral waters containing salts of iron \u0026ndash hence the local name Iron Wellie,\" he said.\"There is no written history of this well but it was certainly known in the 18th century and by the turn of the 20th century it was sometimes referred to as \u0027Jocky Simpson\u0027s Wellie\u0027. Who Jocky Simpson was, is lost in time.\"Harry said that \"generations of Wickers\" out for a walk along the braes or exiles home on holiday would nearly always stop for a drink from the wellie.\"We as youngsters firmly believed that the water did us good despite the taste and it was a welcome drink when playing around the North Head or when fishing or swimming from the rocks,\" he said.\"Young lads get hungry and we would sneak a turnip from Bob Cormack\u0027s field above the wellie, dock it on a stab [for the uninitiated that means removing the ends of the neep by striking it against a fence post] and we then cut off the skin and washed the neep in the Iron Wellie water before sitting on a rock and devouring it.\"Harry laughed at how present-day health and safety regulations would make drinking the water seem like a risky act \"but none of us became ill or died from it, perhaps proving the efficacy of the wellie\u0027s water\".Perhaps in the future Wick will host thousands of pilgrims queuing up for a taste of the rejuvenating powers of the Iron Wellie water.Tuesday 21 Aug 2018 3:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117108.jpg","title":"Dont be put off if youre being bullied employees are told after Scrabster complaint is rejected by tribunal","story":"A LOCAL advice service is stressing that although a tribunal has rejected a complaint of workplace bullying made by a Scottish Government agency employee, others should not be deterred from launching similar action.DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment while employed as a fisheries officer for Marine Scotland at Scrabster harbour, but a tribunal this week ruled against her in the case.Speaking to the Groat, Iain Gregory, the deputy manager of Caithness Citizens\u0027 Advice Bureau (CAB), stressed that bullying regularly takes place in the workplace, and each year he hears numerous complaints.\"Clients feel that they have been the victim of unfair dismissal, discriminatory treatment, bullying or other types of incorrect treatment,\" he said.\"Anyone who feels they have been the victim of such conduct or treatment should never be deterred from reporting the matter.\"DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment after she became a \"whistleblower\" while employed as a fisheries officer at Marine Scotland at Scrabster.The 49-year-old Canadian national told an employment tribunal in Aberdeen recently that she felt intimidated after being sent anonymous cards between 2015 and 2017, and claimed she was targeted with sexual harassment, for being a woman, and because of her age.In a previous hearing, Ms Fitzpatrick had also alleged that she was taped to a chair and gagged by colleagues in 2010.The employment tribunal, however, ruled against Ms Fitzpatrick in its decision on the case.In its judgment, it said it could not agree whether the cards came from current colleagues, and is understood to have been unable to consider the chair allegation as it was said to have taken place more than three years before the complaint was brought.Mr Gregory says that each year CAB deals with a \"substantial number\" of bullying cases, each of which is examined carefully and then detailed evidence is obtained.He says in many cases CAB is able to resolve matters without progression to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) or to a tribunal \u0026ndash \"perhaps by raising a grievance with the employer or by negotiation\".He added: \"However, there are numerous cases which require referral via ACAS and we can often resolve issues at this point by using the \u0027Early Conciliation\u0027 process.\"He underlined that it is \"comparatively unusual\" for a case to proceed to tribunal, with only a \"small percentage\" going that far.\"While it would be inappropriate to comment on any case in which we were not involved, I would stress that people should not under any circumstances be dissuaded from pursuing their rights,\" Mr Gregory said.\"The system exists to ensure that your case can and will be properly considered and we can advise you and make sure that you understand it.\"Tuesday 21 Aug 2018 3:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116895.jpg","title":"Gala furore over Lidl Wayne absolutely ridiculous","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMany people took to social media to voice their anger and concern at the reaction and coverage in the national and regional press following the appearance of the character on Saturday night.Around 90 per cent of the responses were positive and supportive.

No personal information will be gathered as part of this.Evidence suggests that across Scotland more than a quarter of people in education have struggled at some point in the previous year to access sanitary products with some girls and young women having missed school or skipped classes because they didn’t have access to products.The Scottish Government, local authorities and the university and college sectors have therefore committed to providing free access to sanitary products in all schools, colleges and universities in Scotland beginning from the new academic term.Further information can be found at  www.young.scot/periods.\u0026nbsp\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Accompanied by a support boat, Mr Cameron, 40, reached the shore on the other side, near Duncansby Head, sometime just before 8.20pm tonight.Mr Cameron decided to take on the seven-mile swim across the Firth in memory of his girlfriend Ena Brown, who died suddenly earlier this year. Money raised through the challenge will be going to the Kirkwall Maternity Ward, where Ena had worked.Speaking tonight, Monday, following the swim, he said: \u0026#8220It was a grind, I was swimming for over four hours and I never stopped for one second, I just ploughed on the whole way.\u0026#8220It was quite choppy to start with but it got better as I went on. Things eased off after about an hour or so. I knew I had it in me, I was just worried about the conditions changing and having to pull the plug, so I couldn\u0026#8217t relax during the swim. I went through all sorts of emotions \u0026#8211 I was confident and I had moments of doubt.\u0026#8220That last hour was a real grind, I must confess. I could see Duncansby Head in the foreground and I didn\u0026#8217t think I had long to go, but I was scared to ask. I had thought I had about 15 minutes to go, but I had an hour-and-a-half to go. It was real tough going.\u0026#8221\u0026#8220I\u0026#8217ve done marathons, I\u0026#8217ve won Scottish championship surfing titles, but that\u0026#8217s the toughest thing I\u0026#8217ve done.Asked how he felt following the swim, he replied: \u0026#8220I feel a big weight off my shoulders. If this hadn\u0026#8217t happened this week we would have been looking at next summer. I feel I\u0026#8217ve achieved something, I know this has been done before once or twice before, but this is something I will remember for the rest of my life. It\u0026#8217s very rewarding.

Indeed, the evidence suggests that the capital grants previously available have made a real and positive impact.“Everyone agrees that encouraging new blood into farming is vitally important, including here in Orkney. At a time of real uncertainty for the sector, there is a need for the government to help provide what stability it can.“It is all the more surprising therefore that the minister has chosen to take this decision now.  I have written to Mr Ewing, who is due to visit Orkney next month, asking for a reassurance that the government does not intend to walk away from supporting new entrants and ensuring agriculture in Scotland has a bright future.”   \u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Made with footage culled from up to 240 cameras that captured both the initial launch and the nine-day mission that followed, the film is a vital scientific document, a portrait of late \u0026#821760s America and a visually cogent exploration of man\u0026#8217s place in the universe.With an original score by Charles Morrow and a commanding narration by Laurence Luckinbill, the documentary won a special award at the Cannes Film Festival. However, for the next few decades, it was practically forgotten even the original printing elements were lost.Christopher Riley is a film producer, director and writer specialising in science, engineering and history. His work has been celebrated by BAFTA, the US Television Academy, the Royal Television Society, the Sundance Institute and the Grierson Trust.He is a regular contributor to  newspaper and presents science documentaries for BBC Radio 4. In 2007 he tracked down Theo Kamecke — who was working as a sculptor in upstate New York — and found that he held the only remaining 35mm print. Working closely with Theo, Moonwalk One was re-mastered, combining a unique 35mm director’s cut with newly transferred 16mm NASA flight film media, to create a new HD digital master of the film.This will be the first chance to see the new high-definition Blu-ray version of the film which is due to be released next year.Moonwalk One: The Director\u0026#8217s Cut is on at West Side Cinema, Stromness Town Hall, Saturday, September 8 at 7.45pm.

This will also improve the availability of recycled material for use in the production of bottles and cans in future.“I would encourage everyone with an interest to provide their views on how this scheme can meet Scotland’s needs and help us tackle our throwaway culture.”Iain Gulland, Chief Executive, Zero Waste Scotland, said: “Scotland’s planned deposit return scheme is a landmark in the nation’s circular economy journey, with the potential to drive inward investment and create jobs in Scotland at the same time as improving recycling and reducing litter.\u0026#8221Consultation available to view.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Her cooking was what initially drew clients to come to the centre and her baking, he said, was \"legendary\".This theme was echoed by speeches from Ina Mackenzie, Mina Stewart and Kerry Watson. Laela Maclean composed a poem which reminisced and poked good-natured fun at Cis\u0026rsquos life in Lochcarron and the Centre.Cis\u0026rsquos husband Sandy kept the feet tapping with musical interludes on his accordion \u0026mdash including one tune called Christine Ross of Lochcarron, initially written for Cis by the late Iain Crichton, from Stornoway.Christine Houser, Donar MacIver and his son, Stephen MacIver sang Gaelic songs \u0026mdash the eyes of some of the older guests lighting up as they joined in the choruses.Cis was aided by Morag MacCuish to cut her retirement cake which had been made by Harry Gow, her favourite baker. She made a speech thanking everyone for their presence and for the gifts she had received from the clients, staff and board members.The event provided a lovely send-off for Cis.

Hopes for a visitor trail around an area that was heavily militarised during WWII are now full steam ahead after the project team behind the Aultbea museum secured almost \u0026pound73,000 from the Scottish Land Fund towards the purchase of a former butcher\u0026rsquos shop it has been renting to house the display.People from 19 countries outside the UK were amongst the 5500-plus visitors dropping in between May and October last year and that number is set to mushroom as the facility is improved and plans for a wider trail developed.The project\u0026rsquos chairman Francis Russell told the Journal: \"To some extent we have become masters of our own destiny. This opens up new avenues of funding. The location on the NC500 is very important.\"We ask people when they come in how they heard about us and some say it was while they were driving by. It puts us on the map. We\u0026rsquoll look at the feasibility and cost of a major refurbishment and possibly an extension. We could do with much more space.\"Fellow project volunteer Elizabeth Miles said the boost \"will allow us to get on to develop it the way we would like\".She said: \"Owning the site will open new possibilities. We will look to create a WWII trail where everywhere gets visited. We\u0026rsquore hoping to really do something with it.\"Research found the NC500, which passes the makeshift museum, brought 29,000 extra visitors in its first year, adding an extra \u0026pound9m to the Highland economy.The \u0026pound72,820 award will contribute towards the purchase of the former butcher\u0026rsquos shop and surrounding land.Honorary president of the RACP George Milne said the aim is to create a multi-site museum for current and future generations to learn about the convoys.He said: \"The overall aim is to establish a unique multi-site museum in Wester Ross. Around Loch Ewe we hope to create a permanent exhibition centre, a WWII Trail with interpretation panels, a memorial garden, and the preservation of selected wartime buildings to honour all who served in the Arctic convoys to and from Russia from 1941-1945.\"\u0026nbspThe 75th anniversary of the last convoy to sail from the area will be marked in 2020, with relatives of servicemen and visitors from around the world expected to come in their droves.Gairloch Heritage Museum, which itself secured backing from the Heritage Lottery Fund and Highlands and Islands Enterprise for a \u0026pound2m project to convert the old anti-aircraft operations room in the centre of the village into a state of the art new facility, welcomed the news.It said: \"Congratulations to our friends at Russian Arctic Convoy Museum on procuring the funds to purchase their exhibition centre.

All my sculptures contain a memory and I felt it apt that this particular work should be imbued with the feeling of being held in a loving embrace, feeling safe and secure enough to develop your potential.\"The Shelter of Your Arms is one of a collection of pieces created by Ann on display throughout the garden and in the Sawyer Gallery within Inverewe House.Operations manager Kevin Frediani said: \"As a result of the Gulf Stream meeting the Highlands, Inverewe Garden is a nirvana of unusual and wonderful plants and wildlife. Through our arts and exhibition programme we are providing visitors with another dimension to the garden and new way to enjoy Scotland\u0026rsquos national and natural treasures, as our reputation as a centre of arts and culture grows.\"The exhibition is open now and runs until August 30.Last month, NTS unveiled its vision of a proposed new 20m viewing tower within the garden.The plans, which have been submitted to Highland Council for consent, would see an observation tower overlooking Loch Ewe.If given the go-ahead, the tower would provide unique panoramic views for visitors with, according to the NTS, minimal impact on surroundings and could be used to host educational talks.A spring 2019 opening is planned if all goes according to plan.The attraction has enjoyed a surge in visitor numbers after recent investment including the renovation of Inverewe House, the development of the new Sawyer Gallery and Bothy Caf\u0026eacute and new glasshouses.Tuesday 21 Aug 2018 3:40 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

We wanted to take positive action to help the red squirrel population spread into the local woodlands as safely as possible. The combination of bridge and road signs definitely appears to be working well, which is great news.\"It\u0026rsquos safer for reds to travel in the tree canopy rather than on the ground, so it\u0026rsquos likely that if they have the option of using a bridge rather than crossing the road, they will take it. We also installed feeders at each end of the bridge to encourage the squirrels to use it.\"Since the bridge and road signs were introduced, there has only been one known red squirrel road death locally, with none reported so far in 2018. The year before, there were three reported road deaths of reds in the immediate area and two others further away.The rope bridge is suspended over the A896 outside Shieldaig village, alongside the Ben Shieldaig woodland, one of Scotland\u0026rsquos few remaining fragments of ancient Caledonian forest.Local climber Chris Hingley worked with Becky to install the bridge last June 2017, with support from Highland Council.

She said: \"All the neighbours were out watching. The road was like a volcano.\"She said: \"If they patch this now, it\u0026rsquoll only burst another six weeks down the line further down.

He said: \"The most cost effective way would be to renew the pipe rather than having to call in squads of repairmen each time.\"A spokesman for Scottish Water apologised to customers affected and said the performance of mains is closely monitored \"to target investment where it is most needed, recognising that replacing water mains typically involves higher cost and further disruption for residents, whereas targeted repairs can often restore reliable service\".He said: \"Given the deteriorating performance of a section of the main serving customers in Knockbreck Avenue over recent months, this has now been identified as a priority and we will therefore be replacing the length of water main where bursts have occurred. We will keep residents informed once a proposed timescale for this work to take place has been identified in consultation with Highland Council.\"On health concerns, he said the water supply across Scotland is sampled, on average, once every two minutes and tested against strict quality standards to protect public health. Additional samples are routinely taken when a main is returned to service.He said the World Health Organisation has concluded there is no evidence of a health risk connected to drinking water from asbestos cement water mains.Tuesday 21 Aug 2018 3:40 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

An army of the unemployed descended on Edinburgh from all corners of Scotland. With them were bands, field kitchens and banners. Each marcher had a knapsack and blanket. The goal of the marchers was to meet with Sir Godfrey Collins, Secretary of State for Scotland, to demand the abolition of the means test, increased relief for men, women and children and for work schemes to provide jobs. The city authorities made it clear the marchers were not welcome and they would provide no accommodation or food.            The march was organised by the Communist-led National Unemployed Workers Movement (NUWM), whose Scottish organiser was the veteran agitator, Harry McShane, but it won support from the Independent Labour Party, the trade unions and Labour Party. The Aberdeen and Dundee contingents marched south to join with the Fife contingent in Kirkcaldy. The Ayrshire contingent joined with Lanarkshire marching via Shotts and East Calder. The Renfrewshire and Dunbartonshire contingents, including a women’s section marched via Glasgow, Coatbridge, Airdrie, Bathgate, and Broxburn. The main Glasgow contingent marched to Kilsyth and Falkirk, where they joined with Stirlingshire, and onto Edinburgh via Bo’ness.READ MORE: Video: Rare footage of Edinburgh in the 1930sOn Sunday 12 June, they joined up in Costorphine for their entry into the capital. The next day 20,000 people greeted them at the Mound. The first sign of a thaw on the part of the authorities was when the Ministries of Labour, Health and Education agreed to meet delegations of marchers. But there was still no reply from Collins. A second victory was when the police lifted a ban on street collections. But Collins refused to meet with them.The NUWM members paraded through the royal palace of Holyrood with their band playing ‘The Internationale’ and other socialist tunes, and when the city council refused to provide accommodation their leader, Harry McShane, said they’d sleep on the pavement of Princes Street, the city’s most prestigious thoroughfare, as marcher William McVicar recalled: “I think someone offered us somewhere [to sleep] like Waverley Market or somethin’. And McShane and them wouldn’t accept that, they says, ‘No, no, we’re not going there.’ So they says, ‘Oh well, we cannae give you anything else.’ And of course he says, ‘Right we’ll sleep in Princes Street.’” The Edinburgh Evening News reported McShane telling the marchers as they gathered on the south side of Princes Street: “So far here we are and here we stay until another decision is reached. We can breakfast, dinner or tea here, and the men require a rest. They can have that rest in Princes Street. We have decided to give them a long lie in ‘bed’ this morning.” The Edinburgh Dispatch caught the mood among the ordinary folk of Edinburgh as they made thier way along Princes Street on that first morning: “Walking along on the carriageway one heard snatches of conversation: ‘Slept well?’ ‘How did ye enjoy yer feather bed?’ ‘Did ye feel a draught coming in during the night?’”            On the first morning, women marchers blocked the tramway while men shaved using their reflections in the windows of the big department stores. Tom Ferns remembers: “And they couldnae ha’ picked a better spot than Princes Street. Under the Conservative Party headquarters, the Liberal Party headquarters and the big luxury hotels, here was hundreds and hundreds o’ angry unemployed. Obviously a sight like that is not seen every day, particularly in the capital city of Edinburgh.”READ MORE: Astonishing press photographs capture interwar-era EdinburghAnother marcher, James Allison, said, “the police were going mad”. Yet Edinburgh police were not keen on inciting a pitched battle as Hugh Sloan recalled: “At dinner time, our field-kitchen came along and the police chief told Harry McShane, ‘This is Princes Street, you can’t feed here.’ Harry told them, ‘It was good enough for us to sleep here, it’s good enough for us to feed here.’” The marchers then demanded free transport home. Eventually the city’s chief constable and deputy town clerk told them they would provide transport if McShane guaranteed there would be no more marches to Edinburgh. He refused and the chief constable, worried about disturbances on the capital’s streets, backed down. Transport was then provided to take the marchers home.            On the last night, the marchers and their supporters gathered to burn an effigy of Sir Godfrey Collins before boarding buses and a final meal paid for by the city council. The march organisers refused to give a guarantee that no further hunger marchers would defile the city!Throughout the 1930s, the unemployed protested but the NUWM also organised children’s parties in the summer and at Christmas. A number of the marchers would go on to fight in the Spanish Civil War, including the leader of the Aberdeen contingent, Bob Cooney.The inter-war period, not just the “Hungry Thirties”, was grim in Scotland. Prior to the First World War, it had been at the cutting edge of British industry. Within a few years of the wars end the traditional industries, coal, steel and shipbuilding were in trouble. Scottish banks and companies were bought up by their bigger English rivals. Unemployment was a permanent feature, peaking in the 1930s and only ending with the demands of the Second World War.The shale mining industry collapsed, for example, as cheap imported oil cut demand for paraffin. In December 1925, “The Scotsman” reported from Tarbrax, a shale mining village then in South Lanarkshire under the headline “Situation at Tarbrax: Faced With Starvation,” which reported: “Workers from Tarbrax, to the number of nearly 400, marched in procession to Carnwath, nearly ten miles distant, on Thursday night last for the purpose of asking poor relief. Relief under the emergency clause of the Poor Law Act, which enables people in a state of absolute destitution to get relief, has been given to a number of people in Tarbrax on the recommendation of the doctor there. A meeting of Carnwath Parish Council has been called for today to consider the whole situation.”  Starvation – it’s a strong word. My father was little over a year old when the mine at Tarbrax shut. His father would have been on that cold December march before briefly finding work at another pit nearby, then giving up and coming to Edinburgh in search of work. He was without a permanent job until the end of the 1930s.

According to The Office for National Statistics, the number of Scots aged 16 to 64 who are in employment rose by 17,000 to a working-age rate of 75.2 per cent.                However, for employers looking to expand and recruit, this trend brings additional challenges as the pool of job seekers shrinks. So, how do employers make themselves more attractive to potential employees? I believe the answer lies in building their brand as an employer.            A few weeks ago, Mactaggart and Mickel Homes achieved something that no other Scottish housebuilder has done, and which only one other UK housebuilder has accomplished. We were awarded Investors in People (IIP) Platinum accreditation, the highest level which can be achieved. Only 2 per cent of IIP-accredited organisations in the UK – 78 companies – have attained this standard.            As a director of Mactaggart and Mickel Homes with responsibility for human resources, I welcome this recognition. But, the truth is, we didn’t set out to gain IIP Platinum. Our objective was, and remains, to be an employer of choice. Gaining IIP Platinum tells me that we are heading in the right direction – but the journey is not over. In fact, it should be a lifelong journey for all responsible employers who wish to recruit the best talent. How do you become an employer of choice? There is no set formula, but here are four areas that have proved to be instrumental for Mactaggart and Mickel Homes.Firstly, give your staff a voice. Make a sustained effort not only to listen to what your people are saying, but be prepared to act on that advice. Mactaggart and Mickel have Employer of Choice champions across the business – our eyes and ears, if you like – and we also hold regular “spotlight” lunches where employees discuss ideas with our CEO. One suggestion was to introduce a charity volunteering programme so staff can make a real difference using their varied skill sets. We plan to launch this programme in the autumn.Secondly, identify your future leaders. We have an emerging leaders’ programme which brings together talented people to hone their skills by addressing a specific business challenge, most recently looking at customer service before, during and after a home purchase. In fact, the changes we implemented as a result of their work were a key factor in us achieving a five star rating from the Home Builders Federation for the sixth year in a row. This is voted for by the people who buy our properties, so it means a great deal to us.Thirdly, think continuous improvement. It’s tempting to pay less attention to the areas of your business that are performing well. Management focus tends to be drawn towards the challenges and how to overcome them. But, to become an employer of choice, you need to be able to show improvement across the high performing areas, too. It’s about being fit for purpose next week, next year and in ten years’ time.                Finally, plan for sustainable growth. Quick wins are welcome, but IIP assessors and potential recruits are looking for something more evidence that business strategies are robust and taking the business forward. Our expansion into the English housebuilding marketplace was a landmark strategy for us and, together with our continued diversification into new markets such as the private rental sector, has been key to us being able to showcase our progress to our teams.There’s no silver bullet that will ensure that the brightest talent chooses to join your business rather than your competitors. But committing to programmes such as Investors in People is a good place to start on your own journey to be the employer that everyone wants to work for.Marion Forbes, director at Mactaggart and Mickel Homes."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4787412.1534855076!/image/image.jpg","title":"sam gardner scotland has limitless amounts of renewable energy","story":"        Today has proved a great day for Scotland\u0026#8217s renewables industry.                First off the mark is the impressive news that we are among the top users of renewable energy in Europe, a tangible consequence of our leadership in this sector.            The second, hugely encouraging news is that a flagship tidal energy turbine in Orkney produced more electricity in its first year than the whole of Scotland’s wave and tidal sector managed to produce before. We have momentum, now we must accelerate.            None of this has happened by accident. It’s the result of forward-thinking policies, commitment and investment by Scottish Governments of all colours, in our abundant renewable resources.Indeed the transformation of the electricity sector over the past ten years has seen renewable output rise from 24 per cent in 2010 to 68 per cent in 2017.READ MORE: Scots fourth in European green energy usage leagueAt the same time, of course, we have seen thousands of jobs created and costs of onshore wind, solar and offshore wind tumble.We’ve clearly come a long way and that should be celebrated, but we can’t rest on our laurels.            If we’re to fulfil the ambition of the energy strategy published last year, which cemented the Scottish Government’s ambitions to deliver half of all our energy from renewable sources by 2030, we need to transform how we heat our homes and offices and how we travel to work and school. Electrifying our heat and transport systems will have a significant role to play in delivering low-carbon heat and transport.So how can we ensure the renewable sector continues to grow? First and foremost, we need the UK Government to urgently provide a route to market for mature technologies like onshore wind and solar and to support newer technologies like tidal power in the next auction round. READ MORE: Brian Wilson: Scotland missed an open goal with renewablesAs the Committee on Climate Change recently advised, the UK Government’s failure to take advantage of low-cost, low-risk options is unfairly penalising consumers who could enjoy lower energy bills.

When was the tipping point, the moment British politics went past the horizontal and could only be described as being “upside down”? David Dimbleby announcing the EU referendum result on the BBC immediately springs to mind.            It’s an understandable error. Many months before that, Jeremy Corbyn’s election as leader of the Labour Party was the first sign that people were angry and alienated enough to do something quite unexpected.            Now, deep into an age of uncertainty, questions are being asked about whether another group of people might be about to do something even more unusual – join the Conservative Party.That’s the fear among the soft-Brexit faction on the Conservative benches, who have been alarmed by threats from groups such as Leave Means Leave and Leave.EU to “flood” the party with tens of thousands of new members in anticipation of the next leadership election.It looks increasingly likely that the UK is going to be presented with a choice between a Chequers-style compromise that keeps at least one foot in the EU single market and customs union and no deal at all.With Britain running out of road to Brexit day, the likes of Nigel Farage and Arron Banks – not Conservatives, you might have noticed – want to ensure that Downing Street is occupied by the kind of person willing to stamp on the gas and take the country over the precipice, rather than slowing down to consult the map. Or even worse, turning around. The identity of this person is as yet unclear, but feel free to use the name “Boris Johnson” as a placeholder if that’s helpful.READ MORE: Brian Monteith: Brexit no longer means Brexit            Scots Tory MP Paul Masterton warned that “infiltration” of the Conservatives by supporters of an “ideologically pure” Brexit would make the Tories “unelectable”. Of greater concern to everyone else will be the fact that they will be choosing the next prime minister.So could Farage and company pull off their very Tory coup? It seems unlikely.Joining the Conservative Party isn’t a natural act of political rebellion. It’s a group that by most accounts is both shrinking and aging. The Tories don’t often share their membership figures, but the total does appear to have fallen at least as low as 124,000, with the party denying rumours that it has dropped beneath the psychological six-figure barrier. More people probably remember the Tories in their will than sign up each year.It’s hard to see how an influx of people motivated solely by Brexit would swing a Tory leadership election. Unlike the union affiliates and registered supporters who paid just £3 each to win the Labour top job for Corbyn, Conservative interlopers would have to sign up to a £2.09 a month direct debit. Would they bother?            Rather than second-guessing the views of unwelcome newcomers, Conservative Party HQ should perhaps be doing a better job getting to know what the shires think. In trying to sell its Chequers plan for Brexit, Downing Street first demanded loyalty and is now issuing furious warnings about the no-deal alternative.READ MORE: Jeremy Corbyn accused of betrayal over post-Brexit ‘renaissance’ messageNeither approach seems to have resulted in local party members urging their MPs to back the Prime Minister. Ordinary Conservatives are as least as likely to be gung-ho about Brexit as their parliamentarians. Either that or, like ordinary constituents, they just want the bloody thing done with.Unlike Labour, Tory MPs get to narrow down the field of leadership candidates to just two. But in the last two leadership elections, the Conservative membership has backed the candidate with fewer nominations by MPs. When it comes to choosing their leaders, it turns out Tories like a maverick.Given the fractures in the party, Brexiteers already have a better-than-evens chance of getting what they want out of the next Tory leadership contest. The latest surveys from the Conservative Home website suggest Johnson’s exit from government has restored him as the grassroots favourite. You can call off the infiltrators.            If you’re a Conservative MP hoping for a soft Brexit, and praying that Theresa May doesn’t resign without a deal on the table, your problem isn’t that your party might pick up too many members. It’s that it already has too few."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4787398.1534852984!/image/image.jpg","title":"snp s 350k action plan to get parents to help at scottish schools","story":"        Funding of \u0026#163350,000 has been announced as part of an action plan to get more parents involved in schools.

Scots are now among the most prolific users of green energy in Europe, beating renewable powerhouse nations like Denmark and Germany.                New figures have prompted fresh calls for control over energy to be devolved to Holyrood and a cut to ring-fenced renewable subsidies.            Scotland was the fourth largest consumer of green energy in the EU in 2016, with 54 per cent of its electricity provided by renewables, according to statistics compiled by the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe). This is more than twice as much as the average for England, Wales and Northern Ireland.            More than two thirds of Scotland’s electricity came from renewables in 2017 – a 15 per cent rise in one year and a threefold increase since 2007.Nationalist MSP Alasdair Allan said: “With over half of our energy supplied by renewable sources, Scotland is, alongside Austria, Sweden and Portugal, crowding out fossil fuels faster than most other EU nations. We are setting an example to the rest of the UK as one of Europe’s top consumers and producers of renewable energy.“The Tories need to take a more strategic view of our environment and stop cutting subsidies for renewables, which experts have confirmed will be more cost-effective than nuclear power in the near future.”Scotland’s green record beats other EU nations like Germany, which has seen a rapid expansion of renewables with its groundbreaking Energy Act of 2000 and plans to phase out nuclear power stations by 2022. Denmark is also behind Scotland despite being a recognised world leader in decarbonisation in recent decades, developing new offshore wind farms.The UK government’s green energy priorities came under fire two years ago when the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) was axed and policies came under the business agenda.             Gina Hanrahan, of WWF Scotland, said: “If the sector is to continue to grow, the UK government must urgently provide a route to market for mature technologies like onshore wind and solar and support for newer technologies like tidal power.”A Government spokesperson said: “The UK is world leading in tackling climate change, with carbon emissions 40 per cent lower since 1990 and over the last five years investment in renewables has more than doubled to an average of £9 billion each year.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"wait is over as texts arrive with exam results ","story":"\nThose who chose to receive the news by text or email will have woken up to their results this morning while for those awaiting the traditional method will have to wait for an envelope falling through the letterbox.\nShetland pupils have performed strongly, though in some areas the number of passes were down on last year.\nPass rates for National 4 were 94 per cent, down from 96 per cent in 2017.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"various apprenticeships ","story":" Radar Technician – SERCO – Unst\nApprenticeship vacancies are open to male and female applicants, candidates over age 25 will be considered for some vacancies.\nWages vary dependent on employer.

In other areas customers have been left facing road and ferry journeys of more than 50 miles to get to a bank.\nIn 1989, there were more than 17,800 bank branches estimated to be operating in the UK. By the end of this year that number is expected to fall to fewer than 8000.\nSome projections have suggested it could drop to as low as 600 branches in five years\u0027 time.\nBetween 2015 and 2018, 48 bank closures have taken place or are under way in the HIE area including 22 in the Highlands. Some of these are the last banks in their communities.\nConsultants Indigo House Group said banking facilities need to be understood as core to community infrastructure.\nIt said access to cash remained fundamental to the viability of the small retail businesses that are prominent in rural areas. This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies.

A car park, for example, would be a major benefit, although that would of course be a question for the current community council to consider.\"\nAlso there to view the proposals was local Highland councillor Muriel Cockburn, who heard that the new works would have capacity to produce up to 200,000 litres of drinking water per day, supplied by an \"abundant source of raw water from the River Spey\".\n\"It all looks like a major improvement,\" she said, as she surveyed the old treatment works \u0026ndash mere yards from the disused compound where A9 mega pylon workers had been based until a few years ago.\nConcerns have long been raised over that particular eyesore but hopes are high now that a new tenant will be moving in soon to make use of the building.\nFull details of that particular development are still awaited.\nBut if the Scottish Water team win through on schedule, their new treatment works would be installed between the two old buildings.\n\"Obviously we will have to go on using the old treatment works while we construct the new system,\" explained project manager Debbie Henderson. \"But once in place the village will have a new works to look at.\n\"It will actually include two new buildings, which will be prefabricated and delivered to the site from Ross-shire Engineering\u0027s factory in Muir of Ord.\"\nGeorge Phimister, the company\u0027s senior project manager, explained: \"The main treatment process involved passing the raw water through a series of membranes which filter out larger organic compounds while allowing clean water molecules to pass through very fine pores.\n\"The water that has passed through the membranes is then treated further to ensure that it meets customers\u0027 expectations and remains safe to drink all the way to the tap.\"\nThe system will involve new piping from bore holes to a storage tank to the north of the village.\nMr Steel explained: \"Having gathered local feedback we will consider the comments will later advise customers when we are submitting our planning application.\n\"Subject to being granted approval, we anticipate being on site in early 2019, with work continuing into 2020.\"\nTuesday 21 Aug 2018 3:40 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117090.jpg","title":"Leader echoes call for special case funding","story":"Iain Ramage\n\u0026nbsp\nTHE Scottish Government is \"short-changing\" the Highlands, according to Scottish Liberal Democrats\u0027 leader Willie Rennie.\nHe has echoed local politicians and organisations who argue that Highland is a \"special case\" because of its vast geography.\nHe has told us that he agrees with council chiefs that the region merits a larger share of grant distributed by Holyrood.\n\"The special nature of services in this part of the country isn\u0027t recognised by the Scottish Government,\" Mr Rennie said. \"Highland is short-changed on the NHS and the way the Scottish Government tried to short-change it through council tax changes in 2016 was outrageous.\"\nA proposal was mooted, but later scrapped, for inflicting higher council tax band payers with an extra levy \u0026ndash \u0026pound5 million in Highland \u0026ndash to fund education attainment.

There is certainly great excitement surrounding them and anticipation is high amongst both band and audience.\n“The Stirling concerts will be celebrations of our long musical journey, albeit tinged with the realisation that these are farewell appearances and so naturally emotions will be high – this is something we experienced recently at the farewell concerts in England and Europe – all spectacular events but nevertheless very moving.\n“We’ve been overwhelmed by the response to the announcement of the Stirling concerts – all the positive comments, the stories about what our music has meant to so many people, the sadness as the end approaches. But overall there will be a huge amount of love and positivity at Stirling and that’s what will carry everyone through these days ahead.\u0026#8221\nJones has been with Runrig all his adult life, having first joined the band on stage as a 17-year old at a dance in Portree’s Skye Gathering Hall in late 1977. He hopes the set list – which will be lengthy – will give a full reflection of the groups’s journey from a three -piece Scottish dance band playing island village halls to one which has sold out major venues across Scotland and Europe.\nHe said: “Compiling a set list is always a dilemma, with such a large back catalogue to choose from. Of course, there are certain songs that have to be included, otherwise we’d be lynched – but it’s also nice to pick some lesser-performed songs, possibly giving them a fresh twist.\n“Our set will be a good bit longer than usual – the problem was trying to keep the length down to sensible proportions – in essence, it will hopefully represent the band’s whole career, a celebration of our music and the unique bond with our audience.”\n century – the history of their native communities has shaped Runrig’s lyrics and songs. Jones believes that staying true to their roots – fusing them with the popular rock and pop influences they listened to in their teenage bedrooms \u0026#8211 has made sure the band’s popularity has endured through the generations.\n“We’ve been fortunate that throughout our long career we’ve continually gained new fans of all ages, at home and abroad, which has sustained us, even as fashions come and go around us,” he adds. “I guess there must be something in the lyrics, the melodies and the ethos of the band that has attracted such loyalty amongst fans, something universal that transcends our shared background in the heartland of the Highlands and connects with the wider world.”\nAuthenticity has been the hallmark of a band which can essentially still trace its origins to the three Portree streets of Fraser Crescent, Kitson Crescent, and Balmoral Road.\nThe original Run-rig dance band was founded by the Skye-raised sons of North Uist Calum and Rory MacDonald, along with Blair Douglas in 1973, and a year later the trio were joined by Donnie Munro, who became the band’s singer for more than two decades.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary (better known as ‘Nana’) Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon. The main speaker was Austin Currie MP, later a Fine Gael TD. Also speaking was Gerry Fitt, West Belfast MP. Fitt who, years later, was lifted into the House of Lords by Margaret Thatcher, declared that they would go on until they had “Civil Rights and a 32-County Republic”.\nBut the real leaders of the Civil Rights Movement which began that day were the rank and file, the ordinary people of Tyrone and beyond who marched for justice and freedom. \nThe first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon was held on 24 August 1968, 50 years ago this week.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27459  ","story":"Sinn Féin spokesperson for Business, Innovation and Enterprise Maurice Quinlivan TD\n Callum Smyth\n\n“The government is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming the apprenticeship system.

When I saw the wonderful fundraising that Mark and his family had raised, I wanted to do something to help. When I told Mark I was taking on the Berlin Marathon, he was sure he wanted us to support BHF NI once again.”\n  \nKaren McCammon, Health Services Engagement Lead for BHF NI explained: “When the BHF was founded in 1961, 8 out of every 10 babies born with congenital heart disease died before their first birthday. Our research has helped to turn this around, and now 8 out of 10 babies survive to adulthood. Breakthroughs such as these are only possible because of the support we receive from supporters like Mairead, Mark and his family. We are therefore extremely grateful for all their efforts.”\n  \nBHF have also developed pioneering surgical techniques to treat complex congenital defects. However, there is still much more work to be done. For children like Mark, who have complex congenital heart disease, treatment can be much more difficult.\n  \nMairead, Mark and his family are keen to raise as much awareness and funds as possible and are asking everyone to support in any way they can. You can donate to Mairead or Mark in person or call into any of the following businesses in Ballymena: The Moat Bar, Kockeden Lodge, Credit Union, Willy Allen’s Butchers, The Mace, Ballykeel Chemist, Molly Malone’s Chip Shop and A Star Valeting and Detailing, Ballymena who are running a special offer between August 16 and September 16 - offering full valets for just \u0026pound60 and \u0026pound70 for jeeps and 4x4\u0027s, \u0026pound2 of every full valet will be donated to the cause.\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_921291.jpg--.jpg?1534232684000\n","title":"dungonnell dam features on ulster giants tv show","story":"  \nA reservoir in the hills between Ballymena and the glens features in the new series celebrating the achievements in Northern Ireland of the Institution of Civil Engineers on the occasion of their 200th anniversary. \n  \nThe fifth episode of ‘Ulster Giants’, which continues on Monday, August 20 at 8pm on UTV is all about water and the various ways in which it has been collected, stored and treated before being delivered to our homes and workplaces. \n  \nJoe Mahon’s first port of call is the now abandoned Hunt’s Park Water Tower in Donaghadee in Co. Down. \n  \nAnd of local interest, he also visits the water treatment works at Dungonnell Dam in the Antrim Hills. \n  \nJoe interviews Derek McKane of NI Water, who demonstrates the operation of the dam and takes him on a tour of the bewildering number of processes our modern water supply has to undergo before it is deemed fit for human consumption. \n  \n“After watching this you’ll never take tap water for granted again!” Joe promises.\n  \nCivil engineer Alan Cooper then directs our attention to the innovative construction of the actual dam itself – the first to be built using asphalt, and employing many of the same construction methods you would find in road-building! Alan rounds off with some insights into the general history of dam-building in this country and relates how civil engineering has developed its own code of ethics over the 200 years since the foundation of the Institution of Civil Engineers.\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_921285.jpg--.jpg?1534232428000\n","title":"estelle in the frame for spectacle wearer of year win","story":"  \nA Ballymena woman has been chosen from thousands of proud glasses wearers as a finalist for Specsavers’ Spectacle Wearer of the Year.\n  \nEstelle Wallace, shortlisted in the 45 – 59 age category from Rasharkin could follow in the footsteps of last year’s Award winner, Love Island hunk Alex Miller, winning \u0026pound10,000 and the chance to mingle with the stars at the annual awards. \n  \nGlasses wearers across the UK and Republic of Ireland have been showing off their specs style by sharing their selfies online.\n  \nEstelle, who is a health and wellness coach, was invited to visit her local Specsavers store in Fairhill Shopping Centre to receive a bottle of champagne, a certificate and a \u0026pound125 glasses voucher.\n  \nEstelle said: “I was really delighted to be shortlisted as a regional finalist.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that.

We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

The Skoda man felt the format incurred unnecessary expense in terms of fuel costs.\n\u0026#8220The fuel isn\u0027t cheap and the cars run on it whether you are driving a stage or the road sections, said Bogie. A remote service after Friday\u0027s first two stages would work for everyone.

This unique history project is being supported by Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council as part of the PEACE IV Shared Spaces and Services programme.\n\nUrsula Kearns from Mayfair Business Centre said: “We are really keen to speak to any women and men who worked in the factory during the 1960s and 1970s, including those who were made redundant when the factory closed. We want to hear and collect their experiences and memories and we want those stories to be recorded and shared. The intention would be for the former workers to meet together on a regular basis over coming months. It will be informal and will be a chance for old friends and acquaintances to meet up. We intend that the project will be led by those taking part, so we expect that it will touch upon other work-places as well as people’s social lives.

As the years went on they became less and less involved, but they were still on our board of directors for a number of years.\n“As time went on we became more secular and we didn’t have that relationship with the Church anymore. But we’re still very grateful for them for setting it up and for identifying the huge need for counselling and support in this area, I suppose because Ardoyne was hit so hard by the conflict.\n“The Passionists worked tirelessly, and I remember sister Kathleen constantly bringing funders into a room and saying ‘You have got to fund this.’ Because there was very little funding in the early days she worked extremely hard to get us established, funded and working.\n“We have grown considerably, and we now deliver about 12,000 to 13,000 sessions a year to about 2,500 people. As well as operating from this site, we also work in a range of local schools and community venues. If someone wants to be seen or needs help somewhere else we can do that too.”\nNorma continued: “Our clinical practice is excellent. We have just been awarded BACP [British Association for Counselling and Psycho-therapy) accreditation for our services. Most counsellors are individually accredited by the BACP, but very few organisations carry the accreditation. We are one of only six in Northern Ireland to be accredited this year.”\nWith a degree in psychology and a professional background in both therapy and conflict resolution, Norma said that New Life felt like a place where she could make a difference.\nIn the past, she has worked at New Life as a sessional counsellor and her experience in play therapy has allowed her to help children and adults alike. New Life is one of the few organisations in the north that offers child and family therapy – services that Norma insists are vital for North Belfast.\n“I think in this area you are working with generations of people who have had things really difficult,” she said.\n“Personal safety was at risk throughout the Troubles and the area has grown up with generations and generations of high unemployment. Poverty, conflict and trauma have a huge impact, not just psychologically, but on a cellular level it impacts people physically.\n“Poverty also has a huge impact on children’s education and a number of different things, so we’re working with multiple issues for a lot of families and they are trying really hard to overcome those things. It has a massive impact on people’s self-esteem, so it’s almost a vicious cycle.”\nShe continued: “There is a lot of research that has come out recently into adverse experience in childhood and the impact that those have on physical health, mental health, and educational achievement. The aim is to try to tackle things early. I think that’s why we believe that child therapy is so important, because you’ve got to be working with children from an early age to begin to address their issues early on.\n“If you don’t catch certain things in childhood, sometimes you’re working with very difficult teenage years because it’s harder to intervene. Sometimes those teenagers will come back as adults and they will feel like they are ready to tackle the issue at that stage.\n“At any stage in life it’s encouraging to know that anything can be repaired. Our brains are wonderful organs and in many ways they have a great plasticity so you can address those issues, you just have to be motivated and have the right motivator to identify what that change might look like.\n“Not everybody needs counselling, sometimes a friend or a colleague or anyone you can connect with can transform things for you. Talking to anybody helps you and can help you, but counselling gives a framework and a focus for those who need it.\n“If you can catch people before they hit the crisis it’s much better. When you’re in a crisis your ability to think clearly, to support yourself or to act lessens, so it’s much harder to activate the changes you need. If you can get into counselling when you’re not in crisis then you’ll be able to change things more quickly, but counselling can really help. It helps you to clear your mind enough to realise what needs to happen next to take you out of crisis.”\nWhile New Life has come on leaps and bounds since it began, offering thousands of yearly counselling sessions, Norma admits that mental health charities, including New Life, need more support to effectively help those in need of support.\n“I think pre-Troubles we didn’t have nearly enough mental health services,” she said.\n“People were just in lockdown mode, they were just surviving. Since the peace process there has been a lot more services established. I think mental health services are still desperately underfunded in Northern Ireland given what we have come through.\n“For our service we have a six-month waiting list and sometimes it can go up to a year. If you need a counsellor it’s way too long to wait, but we don’t have the funding to deliver any more sessions than we currently do.\n“I think there needs to be more accessible services. People get fed up sitting on a waiting list and a lot can happen in that space of time.”\nShe concluded: “If you do need someone to talk to it’s important that you come forward. Young people, especially can access our services quite quickly so we would really encourage them to come forward.”\nIf you think you might benefit from talking to New Life, call 90 391630.\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"tribute call for elisha scott","story":"\n\nTHE\n public vote to name the new road leading to the Olympia Leisure Centre in Belfast is in its final week and SDLP Councillor Donal Lyons is encouraging people to ensure they have their say and to vote for \u0026#8216Elisha Scott Boulevard\u0026#8217.\n\nElisha Scott is a Liverpool football legend and was Belfast Celtic’s most successful manager who also took the club on their tour of the US in 1949 where they defeated the then British champions, Scotland.\n\nCllr Donal Lyons said: “The vote to name this new road closes on this Sunday and the 125th anniversary of Elisha Scott’s birth will be on the 24th of this month, just days after. \n\n“I’m glad that my proposal to name this road after Elisha Scott has been included because despite Elisha being one of the most successful footballers to have come from our city, awareness of his achievements has faded. \n\n“It’s my hope, that by naming this road after Elisha Scott that we can correct this and begin to give him the full and long overdue recognition he deserves.”\n\nGoalkeeper Scott was born just yards from this new road. Cllr Lyons said it It would be fitting if the road was named after one of Belfast’s greatest ever footballers.\n\n“After famously signing for Liverpool FC in 1912 for ‘£1 and the price of the boat trip’, Scott would be a key player in Anfield for an incredible 22 years, making 468 first-team appearances. He holds the record as Liverpool’s longest serving player to this day. The earliest recorded football chant was Liverpool fans cheering his name. Scott is widely considered the first King of the Kop. \n\n“But it’s not just his time in Liverpool that’s worthy of celebrating. Elisha returned to the Donegall Road in 1934 to become player-manager for Belfast Celtic. Over the following 14 years, he would secure 31 trophies with the Grand Old Team, including 10 Irish League titles, six Irish Cups and eight Gold Cups. Belfast Celtic were the powerhouse in local football and the club still retains a loyal and dedicated fan base. \n\n“Scott also knew what mattered in football and when challenged amid worsening sectarian tensions in the 1930s, for fielding a cross community team he responded in his trademark forthright style, ‘I don’t play Protestant players. I don’t play Catholic players. I play good players.’ Scott’s success as both player and manager secured his place in history but his dedication to his club, players and fans ensured his place as a legend of the game.”\n\nYou can vote online at https://dof.belfastcity.gov.uk/NameTheRoadVote/  or by emailing NameTheRoad@BelfastCity.gov.uk with Elisha Scott in the subject and including your name and address.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"75m rooftop running track plan for old belfast","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

There will also be shops and food and drink options on the site, which has been renamed \u0027The Sixth\u0027 in a reference to Belfast\u0027s  evening edition, \"the sixth late Tele\".\n\nWork is due to begin by the end of the year if the plans get the go-ahead.\n\nStephen Surphlis of Bel Tel LLP said: \"Offices and workspace are evolving and UK and international companies are looking to Belfast and the wealth of talent we have on tap from our universities and within our professional, creative and technology sectors.\n\n\"These firms are placing a premium on employee satisfaction and are seeking working environments that facilitate team interaction, innovation and creativity. \n\n\"Our plans for The Sixth emphasise quality, heritage-led design that makes a contribution to both user wellbeing, and the fabric of our city.\"\n\nArchitecture firm Allford Hall Monaghan Morris (AHMM), winner of the 2015 RIBA Stirling Prize for its work on Burntwood School in London, has been enlisted to work on the scheme.\n\nPaul Monaghan, founding director of AHMM, said: \"The Sixth is a bold project, focused on the experience of its users and mindful of the site\u0027s landmark status and importance as part of Belfast\u0027s built heritage. We have taken cues from the surrounding buildings and the city\u0027s lost Victorian arcades, and will restore features removed or lost from the original listed building.\n\n\"For example, we\u0027re planning to reinstate the building\u0027s main access onto Royal Avenue and reintroduce dormer windows removed from the original roofline.\n\n\"New features such as the roof-top running track, roof-top terraces and break-out spaces complement the building\u0027s focus on the user.\n\n\"A new public atrium space serves as walkway through the building, which alongside a range of ground floor retail and food and beverage offers will enliven the street level space around Royal Avenue and Donegall Street.\n\n\"The Sixth will contribute to the rapid regeneration of the area and with its close proximity to Ulster University, it will be at the centre of an emerging creative district serving the education, culture, media and technology sectors.\"\n\nCouncillor Aileen Graham, deputy chair of Belfast City Council\u0027s City growth and regeneration committee, said: \"The partnership is pleased to have submitted its full planning application for The Sixth. \n\n\"We\u0027ve made a commitment in the Belfast Agenda to growing our city\u0027s economy and positioning the city to compete internationally. Quality, innovative workspaces like The Sixth will attract the high-value jobs necessary to grow our economy and help our people reach their full potential. \n\n\"Not only will The Sixth boost the city centre\u0027s vibrancy as part of an emerging creative district, it\u0027s going to breathe new life into one of Belfast\u0027s most loved and iconic buildings.\"\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37235253.ece/11bc0/AUTOCROP/w620h342/anes_02-_Read-Only_.jpg","title":"belfast harbour estate announces changes to bus lanes after traffic gridlock","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The gridlock has been caused by the introduction of bus lanes in the area.\n\nThe Department for Infrastructure said it was concerned that the congestion would affect the operation of the Glider service which is due to be introduced next month.\n\nA spokesperson said: \"Improved bus priority measures are critical to the delivery of the new Glider service in the Harbour Estate. \n\n\"As the increased traffic delays currently being experienced would also affect the operation of the Glider service, it has been decided to amend the bus priority measures in the area.  \n\n\"These changes involve suspending the city-bound bus lane on Sydenham Road opposite the SSE Arena from Tuesday and introducing, in the coming days, an additional section of city-bound bus lane on Queen\u0027s Road, south of the junction at the Titanic building.\"\n\nThe department said it will be it will be working with Belfast Harbour and other partners in Titanic Quarter over the coming months to introduce new measures to enable the Sydenham Road bus lane to be reintroduced. \n\nThe spokesman added: \"Translink will also be engaging with local businesses to encourage greater use of public transport and of walking and cycling where appropriate. \n\n\"At peak times, the road network in Titanic Quarter is at full capacity or over capacity. With the potential for new development, the number of cars on our roads is likely to continue to grow and public transport and active travel are a key part of the solution to the problems that gives rise to.\"\n\nLast week Belfast Harbour said a new interim relief road would also be introduced linking Queen\u0027s Road and Sydenham Road at peak evening times. It is understood this measure will be introduced on Wednesday or Thursday.  \n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37235497.ece/01414/AUTOCROP/w620h342/pe_Francis_wave%208.jpg","title":"gail walker why declining invite to meet pope is missed opportunity for unionist leaders","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Leaders of other Christian traditions, be it via Luther or Calvin or Knox, offer the esteem due to his spiritual role as well as the clear piety and humility his character has shown.\n\n\n \nPope in Ireland: DUP has shot itself in foot by snubbing invite, insists Catholic UUP councillor\n \n\n \nPope in Ireland: Why meeting Francis would have been an easy gig for Arlene Foster\n \n\n\nObviously, a sustained engagement here on this island is of huge consequence.\n\nAnd, of course, as the leader of world Catholicism, his presence in Ireland will have vast added importance for his co-religionists here, who have seen their values apparently recede from the position of self-assurance they once occupied.\n\nNone of this is to mitigate the scale of the crisis in which the Catholic Church finds itself, in the face of scandalous abuses of trust, most recently in Australia and the US, but of persistent relevance on this island. Catholic institutions here (from hospitals to schools and care homes, even to the daily social standing of clergy and nuns) have been run down, ridiculed, often closed and discredited.\n\nFrequently, its clergy have been arrested and convicted of child abuse and other crimes.\n\nBut none of that, in turn, can diminish the significance of this cultural moment.\n\nThere is absolutely nothing surprising about the various moral stances which the Catholic Church has adopted on issues, from contraception to abortion to same-sex marriage. Those views are of very long-standing.\n\nThey may be unsupported now by legislation around the globe, they may be in the minority in most countries, certainly in Ireland itself as tested by referenda.\n\nBut they cannot be considered unprecedented or new. They are still intrinsic to the Catholic faith.\n\nThe Catholic Church has shown no more inclination to alter its teaching on these issues in the face of legislative change than it has in relation to the position of women in the Church or any of the many other doctrines and beliefs it promulgates as part of its unique ‘faith package’.\n\nThe severe criticisms of the Church come as vocally from inside as from outside.\n\nBut criticism from outside has become much more strident and bullish in recent decades. The old fear of being thought ‘anti-Catholic’ — which may not have held such sway in parts of Northern Ireland or indeed Britain, as it may have done in other parts of Europe — has also receded and there is renewed confidence in parodying ‘Catholic values’ and lampooning the Pope, as well as the characterisation even of the expression of traditional Catholic doctrines as being equivalent to ‘hate speech’.\n\nThese are amazing days, replete with irony. Sentiments which, until recently, would only have been found on gable ends in Belfast, now are scrawled on placards at public events in Dublin.\n\nFrankly offensive slogans that would have marked out individuals in Belfast as blatant sectarians and bigots and had them shot, punched or frogmarched to the barracks, now routinely pepper the discourse on social media of Irish people who have been no closer to Belfast than watching Carl Frampton on BT Sport or listening to Snow Patrol.\n\nMany of the people who would still instinctively bridle at the idea that the partition of Ireland in 1921 was a ‘good thing’ because it limited the bailiwick of a rapacious and corrupt Church with designs on schools and care and children’s homes — Home Rule is Rome rule’ — now find themselves seeking zealously to uncouple health and education from the control of that very Church, but almost a hundred years too late.\n\nIt was heartening to hear that Presbyterian Moderator Dr Charles McMullen is to attend the state reception for the Pope in Dublin, saying his Church “recognised that this papal visit would bring great joy to our Roman Catholic neighbours and friends, and it was something we wanted to welcome”.\n\nMaybe it’s just bad timing all-round but it’s regrettable that the leaders of the two unionist political parties in Northern Ireland declined their invitations to attend the Pope’s speech. The leader of the Alliance Party has other commitments also. The UUP and Alliance are each sending someone but the DUP can find no one at all to make this trip.\n\nIt’s clear that the dismay which has greeted this news has already meant that yet another opportunity has been missed to build bridges, reach out, heal divisions, change mindsets, alter perspectives, modify attitudes, correct misunderstandings or fix mistakes. Call it what you like — whatever it is you want to call that gesture of goodwill — it has been let slip yet again.\n\nOne wonders, after the hundreds already side-stepped, how many opportunities for making that crucial difference are actually left to us now?\n\nLeaving aside the obvious current social issues with political impacts on which Ulster Protestantism of whatever stripe finds common ground with Irish Catholicism, there is a clear benefit to be gained by unionism in putting into practice what it so often states is its core secular message: the attraction of the Union is for all people regardless of creed.\n\nAs has been stated in this newspaper, the strength of the Union can only be enhanced by the visible benefits of it to a population now only by a fraction in the minority. An important part of that benefit would be the clear, simple respect of unionism for the faith of that population.\n\nIt doesn’t matter that church attendances are declining or that many Catholics are at odds with the Church on this or that issue, or even that some of those at the papal Mass in Dublin will have voted Yes in the recent referendum on same-sex marriage or even abortion.\n\nWhat matters is that unionism is regarded as principled, yes, but also modern, nuanced, accommodating, mature, hospitable, and no longer perceived as simply knee-jerk hostile to Catholic ritual.\n\nNo more Old Red Socks, no more No Pope Here.\n\nCertainly, not among our MPs in Westminster, thanks. Not among our MLAs in Stormont.\n\nIt is a matter of fact in our day that unionism is no enemy of Catholics.\n\nIt still believes it is the best guarantor of prosperity and equality for all.\n\nIt should still be possible for that message to be conveyed in person to the pontiff in Dublin at the weekend.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"manager helps deliver baby boy at belfast shopping centre","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

She was Polish, so she was able to interpret a bit for us.\n\n\"We didn\u0027t know whether the baby was due, whether she was full-term. Things kept progressing.\"\n\nMs Coulter said ambulance control told the staff to get towels and a shoe string to help tie the umbilical cord as the baby was coming.\n\nMuch to the relief of Ms Coulter, a rapid response paramedic arrived at the scene.\n\nMs Coulter said: \"He said to me \u0027we are going nowhere, the baby is coming\u0027.\n\n\"It was all a bit surreal, I don\u0027t know how long it was until the actual baby arrived. There was one last big push, her waters broke and out came the little baby. It was beautiful, talk about the miracle of life. It was absolutely amazing. I was a bit emotional.\"\n\nThe paramedic wrapped the baby in towels before handing the little boy to his mother.\n\nMs Coulter said: \"It was a little boy. By this time some of her relatives had gathered outside so we could hear everybody yo hoing and having a big celebration, shouting \u0027Connswater baby\u0027 outside, so that brought a bit of lightness to it.\n\n\"It was such a lovely experience.\"\n\nThe assistant manger said she hoped to see Nicole and her baby boy come back to the centre to visit staff.\n\nShe added: \"I got to cuddle the baby before the ambulance took the baby and mother away.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"we deserve better campaigners pull out of belfast rally after request to reconsider speakers","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

They felt these are \u0027agendas\u0027 and that this campaign wasn\u0027t about them.\n\n\"Organisers asked us to rethink these speakers as they wanted their message to be solely about getting the parties back to talk. It is therefore with deep regret that we have decided to pull out of said event.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDylan Quinn is started the #WeDeserveBetter campaign in Enniskillen\n\n\n\n\nThe spokesperson added: \"We understand wanting to attract as many people as possible and from all corners of Northern Ireland, but we feel the issues of LGBT rights and bodily autonomy are extremely important issues that need addressed and not \u0027agendas\u0027.\"\n\nThe spokesperson said that money donated for the Belfast event via GoFundMe will be refunded within three to seven working days.\n\nThe spokesperson added: \"We would like to publicly apologise to John and Elaine. We stand with them, and the organisations they represent, in full solidarity in working to achieve equality for these and other issues.\"\n\nDylan Quinn, speaking to the Belfast , said each of the \u0027we deserve better\u0027 events are completely independent from each other and that he did not object to the speakers chosen, but that he was concerned the event was being diverted away from the specific aim of putting pressure on political parties to return to Stormont.\n\nHe said: \"It became apparent that some of the speakers, the things that they were talking about, were resulting in people not focusing on the main aim of the  \u0027we deserve better\u0027 but were instead focusing on specific issues, which are important and vital issues, I don\u0027t underestimate that. But the whole idea of this is that we don\u0027t have a government to deal with any of this.\"\n\nHe added: \"Now what we have is people arguing with each other and I am sure some of the political parties are loving it, because we are not focusing on them.

But outbreaks have occurred at Muslim, Christian and Hindu religious events, at sports events, and at large-scale open air festivals in the past. \n\n\"When they occur, they most commonly involve vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, influenza, mumps and hepatitis. \n\n\"Other reported outbreaks are mainly of gastrointestinal infections caused by a number of different pathogens,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan said. \n\n\"Given the nature of this historic papal visit, a large number of young children and elderly visitors are expected to attend the final mass, including many international visitors. \n\n\"In the current context of ongoing measles spread in Europe, it is highly advisable that all attendants, especially young children, ensure that they are up to date with their vaccinations,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan added.\n\nAccording to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the measles outbreak is continuing across Europe, with more than 30 deaths reported in 2018. \n\nThe Papal visit is expected to attract 15,000 overseas visitors and the final mass will draw a crowd of around 500,000 people. \n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a mass gathering as \"a planned or spontaneous event where the number of people attending is sufficient to strain the planning and response resources of the community, state or nation hosting the event\". \n\nDr Jack Lambert, specialist in infectious diseases at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, said the reality is people risk contracting diseases during mass gatherings.\n\n\"There are real outbreaks, as with the Hajj in Saudi Arabia in the past… but most of the population in Ireland are protected against diseases like measles,\" Dr Lambert said. \"But, in saying that, if one person with measles is walking around 15,000 people and coughs, some individuals might get it.\" \n\nHe cautioned, however, that while infectious disease spread is not impossible during the Papal visit, it is \"highly unlikely\" and the risk is \"minimal\". \n\nPope Francis will attend the \u0027Festival of Families\u0027 in Croke Park on August 25 and a final mass in Phoenix Park on August 26. A significant policing plan has been put in place, along with major traffic diversions.\n\nIrish Rail will provide capacity for up to 250,000 journeys for those travelling to the Papal Mass. Extra bus and rail services will be provided by Translink for people travelling from Northern Ireland to Dublin for the visit.\n\nBuses will be run across both days by Translink, with additional services from Belfast, Banbridge, Newry and Londonderry for the Saturday. \n\nOn the Sunday, as well as the destinations listed, additional services will run from Larne, Dungannon, Downpatrick, Limavady, Dungiven, Magherafelt and Newtownards. Additional rail services will also run across both days.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"tidal turbine sets benchmark for industry with landmark performance","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

tidal steam turbine off the coast of Orkney has produced more renewable energy in a year than Scotland’s whole wave and tidal sector produced before it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({})\n\n\nIn 12 months of continuous operation, the SR2000 supplied the equivalent annual power demand of about 830 households.\n\nThe turbine – the most powerful of its kind in the world – has been described as setting a benchmark for its industry due to its performance.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIt produced 3GWh of renewable electricity during its first year of testing at the European Marine Energy Centre.\n\nOver the 12 years before its launch in 2016, wave and tidal energies across Scotland had collectively produced 2.983 GWh, according to Ofgem.\n\nAndrew Scott, chief executive officer of developers Scotrenewables Tidal Power, said: “The SR2000’s phenomenal performance has set a new benchmark for the tidal industry.\n\n“Its first year of testing has delivered a performance level approaching that of widely deployed mature renewable technologies.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SR2000 was launched from Belfast’s Harland and Wolff shipyard in May 2016 before being towed to Orkney\n\n\n\n\nHe added: “The ability to easily access the SR2000 for routine maintenance has been a significant factor in our ability to generate electricity at such levels over the past 12 months, including over winter.”\n\nThe team at Scotrenewables believes that their success – combined with Meygen’s generation of over 8GWh over the past year from four tidal turbines deployed in the Pentland Firth – is convincing evidence of tidal power’s market readiness.\n\n\n\nIt’s critical that both Scottish and UK governments recognise the potential of these technologies\nHannah Smith, of Scottish Renewables\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nHannah Smith, senior policy manager at trade body Scottish Renewables, said: “This milestone for the tidal energy industry truly demonstrates the untapped potential of this emerging sector.\n\n“Scotland’s remarkable marine energy resource has placed us front and centre in developing this industry with global potential.\n\n“To keep driving progress it’s critical that both Scottish and UK governments recognise the potential of these technologies and work with industry to fully commercialise these innovations.”\n\nGina Hanrahan, acting head of policy at WWF Scotland, added: “As we transition to a wholly renewable electricity system, it’s really important that we have a diversity of renewable electricity sources.\n\n“We’ve seen huge growth in onshore wind and offshore wind over recent years, and it’s great to see new tidal technologies now hitting new milestones.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"dolly parton
