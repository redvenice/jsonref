But some other wealth managers have been more receptive - having seen crypto prices surge over the last year. Back in March, Morgan Stanley became the first big U.S. bank to offer its wealth management clients access to bitcoin funds, for example.China’s economic recovery appears to have cooled last month, with manufacturing production and consumer spending both slowing. AFP has more details: That’s according to new data from the Office for National Statistics:  The ONS has also looked at management practices during the pandemic, and found that ‘better managed firms’ handled the shift to homeworking better. But the airline struck a hopeful note, suggesting the vaccine rollout would help the company recover from an unprecedented year of disruption for the aviation industry. Ryanair said it could break even this year, in the absence of further disruption....and also reported “recent strong increases in weekly bookings since early April”, suggesting the recovery in European air travel has begun. Here’s the full story:  Neil Wilson of Markets says this latest volatility shows that bitcoin is highly speculative, easy to manipulate....and a bubble:  He writes that the “wild-West of crypto-mania” is coming to an end, following the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack that triggered fuel shortages and panic buying at some US gas stations. Last week, Bloomberg reported that the hackers who took control of America’s largest fuel pipeline had been paid a $5m ransom, in bitcoin, to end the cyberattack. That is going to intensity pressure on to regulate crypto, Halley argues:  A report from Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis earlier this month showed that ransomware “exploded in 2020”, with victims paying over $406m worth of cryptocurrency to attackers, four times as much as in 2019 (when it estimates $93m was handed over). Back in February, Treasury secretary Janet Yellen expressed concern about bitcoin’s use in illicit finance. The Colonial Pipeline hack has highlighted that bitcoin is an effective tool for cybercriminals, so it may spur policymakers into action.  Technically, Bitcoin is ‘pseudonymous’ rather than anonymous -- every transaction linked to a particular address is stored on the blockchain. As Bloomberg put it last week: Weston has also warned that the momentum in bitcoin is ‘to the downside’, adding (via Reuters): Bitcoin is on a wild ride today as Tesla CEO Elon Musk sparked alarm that the electric vehicle maker could sell its holdings -- before clarifying that it has not sold any bitcoin. The drama began last night on Twitter (of course), when an account called @CryptoWhale tweeted: Musk (who last week suspended plans to let Tesla customers pay in bitcoin) replied: Bitcoin had already weakened last week, following Musk’s criticism of its high energy use and environmental impact.  And Musk’s one-word response last night sent bitcoin tumbling to its lowest level since February, as fear swept the crypto world that Tesla could have already sold its holding (even though Musk said last week that Tesla will not be selling any bitcoin). It slumped as low as $42,212.56, Coindesk data shows -- and further from the record highs over $64,000 seen in April. But...Musk has now returned to Twitter, and declared that: Musk’s ability, and willingness, to shift cryptocurrency prices with a single tweet could well deter other companies from following Tesla’s lead and putting bitcoin on their balance sheet. Kyle Rodda of IG explains that the episode is slowing bitcoin’s move towards the mainstream: Naeem Aslam, analyst at Think Markets, says ‘Elon’ was the dominant word in the crypto market over the weekend. But, he adds that bitcoin was already shifting downwards - and could have further to fall..... European stock markets have opened a little higher, as concerns over the Indian variant of Covid-19 rise in the UK and coronavirus restrictions are eased further in England, Wales and most of Scotland. A survey of factories in the New York area, and a new healthcheck on US builders, will show how America’s economy is faring this month. In the UK, the ONS are publishing a new report into ‘Management Practices, Homeworking and Productivity’ during the pandemic. A major deal is brewing in the media space, with US telecoms giant AT\u0026ampT reportedly closing in on an agreement to combing its WarnerMedia unit - which includes CNN and HBO - with rival Discovery.

Spending as much time indoors as we all have lately, setting it up is something that would improve my life immeasurably. A competent friend of mine helped me get the projector up in my last place. But between lockdowns and just plain asking too many DIY-related favours from the poor guy, I realised if I wanted to put something up on the wall, I was very much on my own. So I did what all humans do in times of need: I turned to the internet. Being an older millennial, I’d assumed that TikTok was beyond me. It’s the place where young people mime to music, right? Could the TikTok community really help? I have to confess, I was sceptical. To test the water, I decided to see what help I could get for putting up a picture – using hashtags to search TikTok for relevant videos. The picture I sought to hang is a wonderful illustration of my beloved cat Itzi, to serve as a constant reminder of who’s boss in the house. So it wasn’t something I wanted to mess up. To start with, I find a top tip from Kim, a home decor blogger who posts TikTok videos under the handle @clippercityhouse. She suggests filming myself holding a picture at different heights to decide on where I should place it. This is a great idea if you’re working on your own – as I was.I put the hook in the wall, and move on to the fiddly part of trying to get the hanging wire over. After struggling for a bit, @goodleyearth comes to the rescue with his tip to use an unexpected item of cutlery. Under calm tutelage, I place a fork upright on the nail and use it as a guide to get the picture on – I get it right the first time. Now this is the stuff I’m here for! I discover that DIY videos on TikTok are like having access to countless experts sharing learned knowledge, saving hours of misery, frustration and unnecessary holes in the wall. No more skipping through long, painful videos trying to find the relevant 30 seconds. After some nervous tea drinking, the picture of Itzi remains vertical. And so bolstered with caffeine and perhaps too much confidence, I set my sights on the shelf for my projector. After a quick search, I find that @haizzly has a useful video about prepping and priming wood. Soon the board is sanded, primed, sanded again, painted (is it starting to sound like I know what I’m doing yet?) and left to dry overnight. Woodshop Diaries – under the handle @woodshopdiaries – shows me how to drill wood without splitting, and even takes me through the basics of how a drill works in a cheerful and straightforward way. While it’s not necessarily essential for this particular task, it was a nice touch I really appreciated. And @constructiontips proves to be a treasure trove of, well, construction tips. Most of them are for tasks far above even my most lofty ambitions – however, there is a nifty trick I can see myself using in the future. It’s actually intended for picture hanging, but works well enough for a small shelf. Using tape and cardboard, I mark the drill points and have a template of where to drill the wall. Minimal fuss and no scrawling. Next, I check out @mcp_thats_me, who gives a brilliantly efficient overview of getting screws in the wall. Once this is done, I’m finally able to mount the shelf. The other useful thing about these TikTok tutorials is that they play on a loop, which is particularly handy if your hands are covered in paint, or you’re holding something heavy.A few days later, the shelf is still standing, the projector is working as it should and the wall is looking more interesting than it has in a long time. As I sit, I start to think about other projects that could now be possible. Revarnishing a coffee table? My previous doubts abated, I fire up TikTok to find out.

Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top nine cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high or high risk (cohort 4 and 7) and those aged 50 to 69 (cohorts 5 and 9).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be residents of long-term care facilities aged 16-64 (cohort 8), followed by people aged 64 years and younger, alongside people aged 64 and younger who are living or working in crowded settings.

Photograph: Nick BradshawClarity on the use of hundreds of thousands of doses of Covid-19 vaccines is not expected for several days as the HSE examines the conditions to be attached to the use of AstraZeneca and Janssen shots.The HSE is examining the implications of the advice from the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac), which is thought to support the use of the vaccines in principle among those aged 40-49. However, sources said a set of conditions under which the people in this group can be given the shot are also contained in the advice.These relate to communicating what risks may be involved and to assess the availability of other vaccines before administering either the AstraZeneca or J\u0026ampJ doses. This will present challenges in terms of implementing the advice, informed sources said.The HSE is working on a plan based on a letter sent by the chief medical officer, Dr Tony Holohan, to the Minister for Health, outlining the Niac advice. However, Dr Holohan is yet to send a letter outlining his views on the advice to the HSE – which may ultimately vary from the Niac advice.Sources said that implementing the advice will be “tricky” as it is not clear whether the information on risks can be given through existing frameworks and structures in the vaccination programme, or if they will need to be modified. Other aspects, such as whether the conditions attached complicate plans to roll out the vaccine through community pharmacies, also need to be examined.Second dosesThe Government is hopeful that the advice will clear the way for the use of hundreds of thousands of doses of the single-shot J\u0026ampJ vaccine in particular. Many of the AstraZeneca shots due to be delivered in the months ahead are earmarked for use as second doses. Sources involved in the vaccine rollout have said failure to substantially use much of the 600,000 J\u0026ampJ shots would limit the ability to hit Government-mandated targets for the programme for the end of June.Speaking to RTÉ’s This Week programme on Sunday, the HSE’s chief clinical officer, Dr Colm Henry, said information on when people in their 40s will be vaccinated will be announced later this week, but that the expectation is people in this cohort will begin vaccination later this month and throughout June.Regarding whether people in their 40s will be offered the AstraZeneca or J\u0026ampJ vaccines, Dr Henry said: “We have just received that information before the weekend and we’ll be going through the impact for us on the response regarding Johnson \u0026amp Johnson, AstraZeneca, and the choice of vaccines for those people.“Clearly what we want to do is progress with a safe, effective vaccination programme at speed and at pace to cover as much of the population as possible, and using the stock of vaccines that are coming into the country in the most effective and safe way.”‘Needs time’He said the HSE “needs time” to analyse the information it had been given on the use of the vaccines. “We’ve just received the information ourselves in the HSE. We’ll be going through that in the coming days and I expect we’ll come to an operational decision ourselves in mid-week.”A memo for Cabinet on travel, which is expected to cover potential revisions to the State’s mandatory hotel quarantine system, as well as a pathway to lifting travel restrictions for vaccinated people and plans for the implementation of the EU digital green certificate, is being prepared. It will be brought by the Department of the Taoiseach.The Cabinet will also discuss the report of the tourism recovery taskforce. The taskforce has argued that travel from Britain should resume as soon as July, while about €1 billion in extra revenue and 50,000 jobs could be generated by reopening the State to holidaymakers during the summer.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"supply of 99s crumbles due to unprecedented flake shortage","story":"Siblings Elly (10) and Jack Fields (7) in Howth on Sunday. Photograph: Tom HonanSupply problems and soaring demand has caused a shortage of the crumbliest chocolate that traditionally elevates ice-cream cones to 99 status.Despite the cold start to the summer, demand for mini Flakes has intensified in recent weeks while supply has struggled to keep up, and 99s are now at risk of disappearing from shops, vans and ice-cream parlours entirely.Cone connoisseurs across the Irish ice-cream industry have said they have never seen shortages like this, and warned that supplies may be exhausted by the middle of June.Joe Quinn of the Bon Bon beach shop in Salthill was tipped off about the shortages last week and managed to secure a supply ahead of his shop’s reopening today after months of lockdown. “I was lucky to get some in because they can’t be got now,” he said.Paddy O’Donnell’s Clarmac business supplies Flakes to ice-cream vendors across the country, but he said his supplies were dwindling.“They are impossible to get at the moment but there is word they will be coming out in dribs and drabs. It is the first time I heard of a shortage like this.”He said half of his supply was gone already. “I have sold more Flakes so far this year than I had right up to the middle of last summer,” he said. “Hopefully things will be back to normal soon but I am lucky at leave to have some stock left.”Boosting suppliesCadbury, which makes the crumbly chocolate bars that have been sitting on top of soft scoop ice-cream cones for almost 100 years, confirmed the shortages but moved to assure the public that it was working hard to boost supplies to satisfy summer demand.“We are seeing a recent increase in demand for our Cadbury 99 Flake in Ireland, ” said a spokeswoman for Mondalez , the multinational that now owns Cadbury. “The product is still available to order and we’re continuing to work closely with our customers.”For generations Cadbury made its 99 Flakes in Dublin, but in recent years the bulk of its production has moved to Egypt.

Mr Geoghegan was recently selected unopposed as the Fine Gael candidates after the former TD Kate O’Connell announced she would not seek the party’s nomination as she believed she was not wanted by the leadership.Fianna Fáil is expected to run one of two local councillors Deirdre Conroy and Claire O’Connor, while the Labour Party has said it will run Senator Ivana Bacik. Brigid Purcell will be the candidate for People Before Profit while Independent councillor Mannix Flynn has also said he will run. Sinn Féin and the Social Democrats have yet to announce their candidates, while the Green Party will have a contest for the nomination between Dublin Lord Mayor Hazel Chu and Cllr Claire Byrne. Fine Gael is seeking to capitalise on a “Covid bounce” in support for the Government party as the vaccination programme accelerates and the country reopens after the lengthy lockdown. The party is favourite to win the seat in what is both one of the most affluent constituencies in the country and a traditionally strong base for the party.However, significant parts of the constituency are less affluent than the areas of Ballsbridge, Donnybrook, Ranelagh and Rathgar which are most associated with it, and the housing crisis is likely to be felt across the entire constituency. Sinn Féin has said that it will seek to make the contest about housing.

How and when, I have no idea.Mr Marr gave no further hint about the source of his mounting frustration with politics, but had reflected earlier in the interview on his flirtation with Marxism when he was a student. His interest in radical left-wing ideas even earned him the nickname Red Andy, but he told the interviewer that he never fully embraced Marxist theories.Mr Marr said the work of Karl Marx was still a “useful tool when you’re trying to understand the world”, but added: “He had absolutely no real sense of politics.”He went on to say of capitalism: “My view is that the market is something in which we live all the time, it’s almost the water we swim in and it’s given us all the things we take for granted around ourselves.“It’s a great machine for inventiveness and ingenuity, but it presents two really serious problems.One is dirt, it produces filth and pollution. The second is that it produces huge and unacceptable levels of inequality. To me, the job of politics is to clear up the dirt and reduce the inequality.”Mr Marr was appointed as the BBC’s political editor in 2000 before going into presenting programmes including The Andrew Marr Show, which has run since 2005.Aye Write continues from Friday 21 May to Sunday 23 May 2021.  The full digital programme is available at www.ayewrite.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"football no place politics high time kicked","story":"Must football inevitably end up like the Golden Globes and the Oscars, with players using the pulpit afforded them by their professional prowess to make political arguments and condescend to supporters and fans?This weekend Leicester City defeated Chelsea to win the FA Cup for the first time in their history. Before kick off, the players and match officials knelt in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. As they did so, a minority of fans – allowed into the stadium for the first time in more than a year – booed. After the match, two Leicester players unfurled a Palestinian flag, presumably to share their views about the conflict between Israel and its terrorist enemy, Hamas.Football has been getting steadily more political for several years. Star players and famous names from the past campaign for causes and use their social-media reach to make political points. The ownership of many clubs by foreign billionaires, the many nationalities of Premier League players, and the vast income derived from global television and merchandise deals mean that foreign conflicts and politics can flare up here. Add to that issues such as the plan to host the next world cup in Qatar, or the abandoned attempt to form a European super league, and politics seems never far away from our national game.This might not seem like such a big deal. After all, don’t footballers have the same right to express themselves as the rest of us? Shouldn’t football use its enormous reach to help advance good causes? Isn’t sport, especially when it is international, unavoidably political?Study some examples and you will soon realise how complicated answering these questions can be. Marcus Rashford, the Manchester United and England forward, has campaigned skilfully to force the Government to change its policies and provide free meals for poor children outside the school term. His work was away from the pitch, never strayed into party politics, and was not particularly isive. Supporters seemed to take pride in what he had done, and the Government even awarded him an honour for his efforts.But a year and a half ago, Mesut Özil, then an Arsenal player, found himself in a more controversial situation. Özil is a German international with Turkish ancestry and a Muslim. Following the reports that the Chinese state had incarcerated one million Uighur Muslims, Özil criticised China, defended the Uighurs, and criticised his fellow Muslims for not speaking out. China responded by having Özil removed from a Chinese version of a football video game and blocking the broadcast of Arsenal’s next fixture on Chinese television. Arsenal disowned Özil, saying the club was “always apolitical as an organisation” and issuing its statement on the Chinese social media platform, Weibo.Such blatant hypocrisy is just part of the problem with political football. Footballers may take political positions, it seems, unless those positions interfere with the commercial interests of their employers. And footballers and their clubs may take positions on specific ethical issues, insisting they are very much holier-than-thou, while remaining silent on their own conduct.And so we have the former footballer and television presenter, Gary Lineker, who wears his progressive credentials on his sleeve, under investigation by the tax authorities for millions in unpaid taxes. We have Sam Allardyce, who had to resign as England manager after a corruption scandal, back in the Premier League at West Bromwich Albion. And we have owners like Mike Ashley, who, according to a Parliamentary inquiry, treated his Sports Direct employees as if they were in a Victorian workhouse.Next year, the football World Cup will be held in Qatar. The decision to host it there was the result of a suspect process, overseen by Fifa, the international football governing body, whose senior leadership has been investigated, and in some cases prosecuted, for corruption. Much construction in Qatar is undertaken by migrant workers trapped in appalling conditions that amount to modern slavery. Since Qatar won its World Cup bid 10 years ago, 6,500 migrant workers have died there.And yet the football world has remained almost universally silent. There were no flags at the Cup Final for the Pakistanis, Indians, Nepalese and others trapped in forced labour on Qatari World Cup construction sites. Nor were there flags for the Uighurs or the many Muslims who have suffered and died under Assad and Isis in Syria, or those who live under tyranny in Gaza and Iran. Nor were there flags, needless to say, for the Israeli civilians – Jews and Arabs – who have been targeted by Hamas terrorism.Nobody was able to make this point to the players as they paraded their Palestinian flag at Wembley on Saturday, of course. And this is the other big problem with political football: it represents the abuse of a captive audience, brought together in stadiums and on television to enjoy a spectacle together without the ision of politics.Among us, there are different views on the conflict between Israel and Hamas, just as there are on Black Lives Matter. Football fans almost universally respect and support the long-running campaign to “kick racism out of football”, but while some agree with Black Lives Matter, others are repelled by its association with campaigns to defund the police, abolish prisons and radically remake society. Even if players believe taking the knee is a gesture of solidarity in the face of racism, they are unwittingly bringing politics – and the isions of values that politics by definition represent – into the sport. They are taking sides, which alienates many.In this respect, football does reflect wider society. Across so many parts of life, politics – and usually the politics of the radical Left – is intruding. And as it does so – in sport, in television and movies, the arts and heritage, and elsewhere – it unavoidably ides us, because that is what politics does.In this era of polarisation and culture wars, we need more places, events and moments that bring us together, not fewer. Footballers are entitled to their beliefs and opinions, but politics must be kept out of matchday.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"australias oldest man shares secret living 111 years chicken","story":"Dexter Kruger, who was two years old when the Titanic sank, attributes his long, long life to a simple lifestyle and a balanced diet with one unusual indulgence - chicken brains.Mr Kruger reached the milestone of 111 years and 124 days old on Monday, is not only Australia’s oldest man but the oldest Australian man on record.He may even be the oldest living man in the world.The Guinness World Records website says there is currently no record holder and they are investigating existing claims after Brit Bob Weighton died last March just a day after his 112th birthday. He put his longevity down to white meat and German wine.Mr Kruger, who hails from the outback Queensland town of Roma, is a former veterinary surgeon, poet and author who spent his life living a bush lifestyle on his land.He refused to retire from his 5,300-hectare cattle property in the Maranoa region until his mid-90s.He told the ABC that this had helped him keep healthy.“It\u0027s because I do things differently… I lived very close to nature and I ate mostly what I grew in the garden or the orchard or the farm,” he said.While never a big smoker or drinker, Mr Kruger did have one indulgence.“Chicken brains… You know, chickens have a head and in that is some brains, and they are delicious little things. There\u0027s only one bite,” he said.Born just nine years after the Federation of Australia, and when the population of the country was less than 4.5 million, Mr Kruger has lived through world wars, the Great Depression and other recessions, droughts, bushfires, and pandemics.Now residing in an aged care facility, Mr Kruger maintains a strict daily morning exercise regime, gets sunshine and fresh air, and works on his latest book – his autobiography.He told the ABC he follows global and local affairs, and commented on the pace of Australia’s vaccine roll out and the growing problem of domestic violence.Mr Kruger has witnessed 111 years of astonishing change - including the invention of zippers, electric toasters, modern band-aids, teabags, instant coffee and television - but he also sees downsides.“Until we got all this computerised technology, life was much more relaxed. There are marvellous things you can do with a little chip, but we were once very much more relaxed,” he told the ABC.A party will be thrown to mark Mr Kruger’s milestone, with the Australian Book of Records and various politicians and community leaders expected to attend the celebration.Mr Kruger\u0027s 74-year-old son Greg told the ABC that his father\u0027s simple lifestyle and balanced diet, complete with “plenty of salt, sugar and fat”, had a lot to do with his age.“He lived through a period that was a lot less stressful than what society is faced with today. He didn\u0027t go around chasing the bright lights, he was happy being around horses and cattle… His system wasn\u0027t worn out trying to process the junk food – he\u0027s never been overweight, always active,” he said.Manager at Pinaroo Roma aged care facility Melanie Calvert said Mr Kruger was in better health than many residents aged in their 80s and 90s.“He\u0027s probably one of the sharpest residents here… His memory is amazing and his cognitive functioning is unbelievable,” she said.“He sets goals to write books, to achieve milestones, and I think that keeps him going… To be able to have that personality — that doesn\u0027t get down on things, that picks themselves up and gets on with it — I think that\u0027s a big part of living longer.”Japanese woman Kane Tanaka, born in January, 1903, is 117, making her the oldest person currently alive, according to Guinness World Records. Ms Tanaka has said that she likes to keep her mind active by waking up at 6 am and studying maths. The oldest person to ever live was also a woman. Jeanne Louise Calment was born in February, 1875 in France and managed to meet Vincent Van Gogh over her 122 years of life.She said the secret to a long life was olive oil, port and chocolate. She passed away in August, 1997.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"does andrew marr think kidding know exactly thinks","story":"The  news that Andrew Marr is itching to free himself from the restraints of the BBC’s code of impartiality induces a wry smile it might fairly be asked ‘who do you think you are kidding Andy?’  because while Mr Marr strives hard to stay neutral in his interviews  it has always been clear exactly where his sympathies lie. Andrew Marr was, is, and always will be a man-of-the-left. And like so many of his BBC colleagues the effort of maintaining the veneer of  even-handedness is proving burdensome.Marr now joins a long list of senior and famous BBC journalists who have allowed themselves to open-up about  impartiality at the BBC. Think of John Humphrys, who on retirement from his perch as the senior presenter of the Today Programme,  acknowledged that the BBC, overall has a bias to the liberal-left think of Jeremy Paxman, ex-Newsnight presenter, who said much the same. And now Andrew Marr has ventured into the same territory at a literary festival in Glasgow.  Admittedly he takes a different line from Humphrys and Paxman – who both found the political correctness the BBC imposes on its output increasingly irksome as they  got older quizzed about his political views Marr  went all coy ‘ I cannot tell you now because I would lose my job’ he said  - but it hardly takes  an investigator of Sherlock Holmes’ acuity to  figure out what those views really are. All you need to do is to look back over the known facts about his career to form the clearest of impressions.At Cambridge University in the 1970s, he belonged to one of those  groupuscules so beloved  of the far-left ‘The Socialist Campaign for a Labour Victory’  and was known as  ‘Red Andy’ he spent his leasure time fomenting revolution by distributing copies of Mao Tse-tung’s ‘Little Red Book’ . Leaving university he went into journalism first at the Scotsman, then as the political editor of  The Independent and finally that newspaper’s editor in 1996.  Throughout that time  the tone of his journalism was always consistent he was antagonistic to the Tory Party,  sympathetic to the left generally and particularly  hostile to ‘Thatcherism’ his student days might have been long behind him but  those early revolutionary enthusiasms left their mark.It was no great surprise when, in 2000, the BBC  decided that with this journalistic pedigree Marr was just the man to get what is probably still the most important job in British journalism – that of political editor at the BBC. But it caused some raised eyebrows at the time because there had been  an informal convention at the Corporation that when the country had a Labour government it was more seemly to have a journalist from the right take on the role and vice a versa when the Tories were in power. This makes sense from the BBC’s point of view because it allays  the suspicions of the Opposition . But in 2000  Blair was in his pomp and here was the BBC choosing a man whose sympathies clearly lay with the incumbent government.I once had a conversation with the great  political columnist Hugo Young just after Marr was appointed to the role he wanted to know what journalists inside the Corporation made of this appointment (I was a BBC reporter at the time). I told him the view, insofar as I knew it, was that he was a good fit because his views were aligned so completely with the BBC’s own political culture. But Young, as scrupulous a journalist as one was ever likely to meet, felt it was unwise of the BBC to choose Marr. He acknowledged that Marr was a very good journalist who was perfectly suited to the role of political editor – just, maybe, not at that precise moment.And one thing that must, in fairness, be said of Marr is that  he is a very clever, very well-informed journalist with a clear and elegant writing style and a courteous and penetrating interviewing technique. But now he has intimated that conforming to the BBC doctrine of impartiality is beginning to chafe and that he is yearning to be able to express himself more freely about political issues of the day. This will be a relief to us all as it will save us all the bother of having to parse his performances to ine his underlying political beliefs not that this has been difficult.For instance his many interviews, over the years, on the subject of Brexit could never have left anyone in any doubt whatsoever that here was a man who feels leaving the EU was – in that so-overused phrase – ‘an act of national self-harm’. Nor was there any doubt in my mind that Mr Marr was opposed to Donald Trump and all that he stood for and had no sympathy whatsoever with the insurgent proles  who put him in power. Mr Marr is clearly averse to anything in politics which smacks of ‘populism’ there is a pungent snobbery about the politics of the patrician left to which Mr Marr so clearly belongs.A final point the BBC’s journalism is founded on the creed of impartiality. According to that belief system the BBC will always maintain a perfect even-handed stance when reporting contentious issues. In theory this is a wonderful boon to the country and its politics but is is one that in recent years the Corporation has consistently, and disastrously,  failed to  deliver. And the reason it has failed to live up to the creed is because the overwhelming majority of BBC journalists and programme makers privately ‘dress left’ in their politics. Inevitably this sets up terrible personal conflicts for the journalists involved (how one’s heart bleeds!) who must pretend to be disinterested in subjects about which the feel passionately. Over his BBC career  Andrew Marr has striven, manfully, to achieve the gold-standard of impartiality, and has succeeded better than some of his BBC colleagues. But while the one-time Maoist student revolutionary might have moderated his views, as age and wisdom advanced, the years have clearly  not entirely quenched the fires of political enthusiasm.

Kwasi Kwarteng claimed the country could still end all legal restrictions, as hoped,the B... Covid strain does not prove resistant to a vaccine. He told Sky News I fully expect that we’ll be reopened on June , adding: I think it’s very likely to happen. The vaccines are working against the Indian iant. We’ve got to look at the numbers so we’ve got some flexibility. But there’s nothing I’ve seen and there’s nothing the Prime Minister’s seen up to now that suggests we’re going to delay that June  date.The Business Secretary risks being accused of mixed messaging - days after Boris Johnson said the June  unlocking could have to be delayed. On Friday the Prime Minister said todayaposs easing - with indoor gatherings of up to six people, hugging and overnight stays all allowed - would go ahead, but this new iant could pose a serious disruption to our progress and could make it more dficult to move to step four in June. More than , cases of the faster-transmitting strain have been detected in the UK, with the number more than doubling each week for two weeks in a row. SAGE member Sir Jeremy Farrar warned scientists still donapost knowthe vaccine rollout has decoupled infection rates from the number of people ending up in hospital or with aposLong Covidapos. He told the BBC: That is the key question and to be honest we don’t know that today. The expert warned we may have to reverse back into more lockdownthe Indian or another iant proves resistant to a vaccine - as the B... strain is becoming dominant in parts of the UK.  Reports today claim ministers are pushing more strongly for lockdown to end fully on June  - amid claims most of those hospitalised declined a vaccine. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said yesterday: In Bolton, where weaposve seen a number of people in hospital with this new Indian iant, the vast majority of them have been eligible for a jab but not taken the jab. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said there were concerns about small numbers of older people who are yet to take up their vaccine offer. The biggest risk comes from,there are large numbers of older people who are unvaccinated, he told Times Radio. Defending the decision to ease the lockdown, Mr Kwarteng told Sky News: Yes, things are opening up but people should have common sense, they should use judgment and I thinkwe act in a reasonable way, there is no reason to suppose that we canapost reopen the economy entirely on June . I think there has to be a degree of common sense, a bit of caution and people shouldnapost be running away being too exuberant, I suppose. I think we just need to be measured and cautious. He added:Matt Hancock said yesterday very clearly that he had a lot of confidence that the vaccination does work against the Indian iant. But of course we canapost definitely prove anything until weaposve eased up and we see what the actual data shows, and thataposs why weaposve got a degree of flexibility. But there is nothing in the evidence now that weaposve seen that suggests that the vaccine isnapost very effective against the Indian iant. Despite new figures today putting the UKaposs cost of Covid at £ BILLION, a string of experts said they will be more cautious than government advice allows as the economy reopens. Prof Adam Finn, of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationsaid scientists still donapost know exactly how fast the B... strain transmits - with over , cases already in the UK. He told Sky News mixing people together at this particular point in time... is really actually quite risky. Prof Finn added: On a personal level… I’m advising my family and friends to continue to be very careful about making contact with each other until we’re clearer about just what’s going to happen with this iant over the next two or three weeks.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnConservative PartyBBCBoris JohnsonHospitalsThe economyPoliticsCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"sadiq khan demands covid vaccine","story":"NewsSadiq Khan demands Covid vaccine is offered to all ages in  Indian iant hotspotsLondons mayor is urging the jab to be offered to people of all ages in Hillingdon, Hackney, Ealing, Croydon and Bromley - along with other hotspots for the B... strain where in the UKmirrorShareCommentsByPippa CrerarDaily Mirror Political EditorDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video sadiq-khan-pledges-vaccinate-young-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:jsJJiq,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeSadiq Khan has joined calls for a surge in Covid jabs to people of all ages in UK Indian iant hotspots - including five in London. The capital’s Mayor said the Government should use the vaccine sensibly and tackle transmission in pockets with high ratios of the B... strain. He said has asked the Health Secretary Matt Hancock to give flexibility to allow young people to get the vaccine early. Mr Khan told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: “One of the things I’m lobbying the government for is to accelerate the rollout of the vaccine in those parts of our city and the country where there are high levels of this particular iant.” He added: “There are four or five boroughs where there do appear to be small clusters of this particular Indian iant. What I’m asking the government to do and the fantastic NHS is to in those parts of London, young Londoners to receive the vaccine sooner than in other parts of London.”  It’s understood the London boroughs of Hillingdon, Hackney, Ealing, Croydon and Bromley all have “very early stage” active investigations into the iant. Around  cases have been found in the capital. In total just over , had been found in the UK as of last week but that is expected to rise. Currently only people in their late thirties, apart from frontline workers and those with underlying health conditions, have been offered the jab. In Bolton, a major hotspot area outside London, medics admitted that other age-groups had come forward for the jab over the weekend. Dr Helen Wall, who is running the local vaccination programme, said: We are looking for ways to vaccinate people rather than turn them away but we are sticking with the flexibility of the JCVI criteria.  But Cabinet minister Kwasi Kwarteng hit back today, saying people should only get the jab in the “correct order”. We would suggest that people should do it in the correct order, in the right way,” the Tory Business Secretary said. Pressed on whether ministers could put pressure on local authorities breaking from the guidelines, Mr Kwarteng said: I donapost know the actual details of what is going on in Bolton but weaposve got very firm guidelines and we want people to follow those. I can see what they are trying to do, I can see exactly what they are trying to do, the Cabinet minister added, in reference to Bolton reportedly attempting to avoid a local lockdown. But what Iaposve said is that there is a really good way that weaposve managed to roll out the vaccine and we would urge people to follow the guidelines that weaposve set out and the method that weaposve used.  Reports have said people as young as  were able to get the jab at the mobile site in Bolton, with young people living in multigenerational households among those fast-tracked. Dr Wall said last week here were around , people in the area in the highest priority groups who were yet to be vaccinated. With , jabs administered over the weekend, she added: “I’m hoping that we’ve made a big dent into that now”. Government scientic adviser Prof Peter Openshaw said it was important to vaccinate people as fast as possible including those under  in hotspot areas. Ex-PM Tony Blair added: There are some areas, that will be bigger priorities than others, and itaposs probably sensible when you go into those areas not simply to vaccinate the risk population which is usually the more elderly population, but also to make sure that youaposre reaching the younger people as well who can spread it.But Prof Adam Finn, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said there must be a strategic approach across the country. He added that when younger people get a jab, you are of course giving doses to vaccine to one person and those doses are not being given to someone , either there or in other parts of the country. We do need to all work on this together and be joined-up about it.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeGovernment advisors have pleaded with Brits to be cautious despite lockdown easing today - as they fear the Indian iant could trigger another big wave. People in England are allowed to meet indoors in groups of six, stay overnight with friends and family, go on foreign holidays to the green list and make their own decisions on hugging as the economy finally begins to recover. But despite new figures today putting the UKaposs cost of Covid at £ BILLION, a string of experts said they will be more cautious than government advice allows. Prof Adam Finn, of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationsaid scientists still donapost know exactly how fast the B... strain transmits - with over , cases already in the UK. He told Sky News mixing people together at this particular point in time... is really actually quite risky. Prof Finn added: On a personal level… I’m advising my family and friends to continue to be very careful about making contact with each other until we’re clearer about just what’s going to happen with this iant over the next two or three weeks. Prof Finn said it was perfectly likely that Boris Johnson could have to tear up plans for ending all restrictions from June .He said: I really hope that the current concerns around this iant evaporate and that everything goes to plan. But I think we just have to accept the possibility that we’re in for another big wave and we will have to change what we’re doing. SAGE member Sir Jeremy Farrar also said he wouldnapost meet family and friends indoors for the moment. He told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: I think it is reasonable to just be sensible about knowing where transmission is occurring - mostly indoors, mostly in larger gatherings indoors with lots of dferent people, dferent families, dferent communities - and I would just restrict that at the moment personally. Sir Jeremy said I donapost think itaposs unreasonable to lt restrictions now but added: This is the most dficult policy decision frankly in the last  months or so. It is very very finely balanced.  Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng today insisted it was still very likely all restrictions will be able to end from June .London mayor Sadiq Khan added he would finally be hugging his mum as he urged residents to cautiouslyto pubs.But Mr Kwarteng added: People shouldn’t be running away, getting too exuberant I suppose. I think we need to be measured and cautious. Sir Jeremy warned scientists still donapost knowthe vaccine rollout has decoupled infection rates from the number of people ending up in hospital or with aposLong Covidapos. He told the BBC: That is the key question and to be honest we don’t know that today.  The expert warned we may have to reverse back into more lockdownthe Indian or another iant proves resistant to a vaccine - as the B... strain is becoming dominant in parts of the UK. A third government advisor, SAGE member Prof Graham Medley, said he would go to a pub or restaurant indoors but only under certain conditions. He told LBC radio: If it was suitably organised and it looked okay and was in an area of low prevalence and the clientele was very old [and therefore mostly vaccinated]… fair enough.It comes after a fourth advisor, SAGEaposs Prof Mark Walport, told Sky News on Sunday he would be avoiding going indoors in a pub. He said: [It is] a question of people making judgments and you know my personal judgment is that I will do things outside as far as possible. He warned Brits against tight clinches adding: My advice is just because you can do something doesn’t necessarily mean you should. As far as possible, socialise outside, maintain social distancing,you are going to hug, hug cautiously. Boris Johnson has issued a plea for people to use a heavy dose of caution as lockdown rules ease further today.  Pubs and restaurants will be able to reopen indoors and the ban on foreign travel is lted, allowing holidaymakers to jet off for some sun for the first time in months. People will also be allowed to hug friends and family from dferent households for the first time since Covid restrictions were imposed more than a year ago. But the Prime Minister urged the public to remain cautious despite the greater freedoms, as concerns mount over the spread of the Indian Covid iant. Surge testing is being ramped up in hotspot areas and the vaccine rollout is being accelerated to prevent the new strain from derailing the route out of lockdown. Vaccine first doses are tipped to be rolled out nationally to over-s later this week and over-s by the end of the month. London mayor Sadiq Khan joined pleas for hotspot areas to get vaccines faster for younger groups to stop the Indian iant.  He told ITVaposs Good Morning Britain: There are four or five boroughs where there do appear to be small clusters of this particular Indian iant. What I’m asking the government to do and the fantastic NHS is to in those parts of London, young Londoners to receive the vaccine sooner than in other parts of London. Some medics - including reportedly in Bolton - have been defying government guidance and offering jabs to younger people who come forward. But government minister Kwasi Kwarteng refused the pleas, saying today: We would suggest that people should do it in the correct order, in the right way. And the JCVIaposs Prof Finn said there must be a strategic approach, adding that when younger people get a jab, you are of course giving doses to vaccine to one person and those doses are not being given to someone , either there or in other parts of the country. We do need to all work on this together and be joined-up about it.  Reports today claim ministers are pushing more strongly for lockdown to end fully on June  - amid claims most of those hospitalised declined a vaccine. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said yesterday: In Bolton, where weaposve seen a number of people in hospital with this new Indian iant, the vast majority of them have been eligible for a jab but not taken the jab. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said there were concerns about small numbers of older people who are yet to take up their vaccine offer. The biggest risk comes from,there are large numbers of older people who are unvaccinated, he told Times Radio. Now the good news is weaposve done very well with the vaccine take-up but there is a very small number who are eligible for the vaccine, who actually havenapost taken it and surprise, surprise, as the Secretary of State was saying yesterday, thataposs the majority of cases that we are now seeing. And as he said there were five people whoaposve had a single dose in hospital, and only one person whoaposs had a double dose - so that does suggest that Sir John Bell is correct when he says that actually the vaccine is really efficacious. The real issue is that we know that there are communities of people who havenapost been vaccinated and who are eligible - and we know thereaposs a link for example to deprivation, we know thereaposs a link to ethnicity.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnBoris JohnsonSadiq KhanHospitalsPoliticsCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"im 44 jealous people try","story":"NewsI’m  and jealous people try to get my girlfriend, , to dump me constantlyModel Michael Stomatuk, , says his girlfriend has been messaged by strangers, claiming that hes been unfaithful, and says he is often hit-on by admirers on his TikTok accountmirrorShareCommentsByRosaleen FentonAudience WriterAmy Walters:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsOver time, they realised they were head over heels for one another. \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The -year-old is in a relationship with girlfriend Emily Downing, , and insists theyaposre very compatible, despite the age gap. But he says Emily is constantly bombarded with messages from people trying to break the pair up, but it doesnapost work.. Michael, from Massachusetts, the USA, has received admiring comments from women and men on his TikTok account. The couple met in  whilst they were both at yoga classes and Emily was drawn to his positive energy.  Michael says he made the first move as Emily was apprehensive about their age gap. But she agreed to exchange numbers with Michael and the pair arranged to go on a date, where they walked his dog around the neighbourhood. He said: “I initially thought Emily was very sweet and easy going and she recalls thinking that I was funny and had a good, positive energy about me - but was slightly apprehensive due to the age dference of  years. “However, I really took a liking to her, so we exchanged numbers and arranged to meet up a few days later where we went on a dog walk.  We brought along some wine and began talking, where we spent three hours discussing our common interests and hobbies. I think we both knew there was a connection, but due to a prior relationship of mine and our age dference, we were both quite reserved in the beginning and didnapost want to rush into a relationship.

Iaposve also had some comments from fangirls - and boys - which are rather sexual, such as aposHey daddyapos and aposOmg, what a dilfapos which I take with a pinch of salt, as they can be quite funny. Although these comments havenapost affected our relationship, there have been numerous outreaches to Emily from strangers saying that I havenapost been faithful and that she should break up with me - but this isnapost true and Emily knows this which is the main thing, but itaposs not that easy for her to hear claims such as this.

But it wasnapost until she received a Zoom call from People’s Postcode Lottery ambassador Matt Johnson that she learned how much she had won. When Matt revealed the cheque, tearful Vicky said: “Oh my God! Are you serious  Thank you so much, that’s amazing!” Vicky plans on treating her two children, who are six and eight years old, to a trip to Disneyland when restrictions allow. And she also has plans to splash out on an extravagant purchase for her home, which she shares with her husband.  She added: “We wanted to get a hot tub. I was going to have to work extra nights and days to save up for it and now I can actually get it, I’m so excited!“ One of the reasons Vicky plays People’s Postcode Lottery is because of the support going to good causes. She went on: “I always like to give a bit to charity, and I can’t always do all of them, so I thought this is the perfect one to do because it covers quite a few. And obviously there is always a chance of winning so that is an extra bonus on top!” People’s Postcode Lottery costs £ a month to play and there are guaranteed winners every day. People play with their chosen postcode and are automatically entered into all draws.People’s Postcode Lottery ambassador, Matt Johnson, said: “I’m over the moon for Vicky!

The Met Office describes the last couple of weeks of May as cold particularly in the north of the UK, with heavy showers punctuating most days.They predict: Unsettled conditions continuing, with scattered showers again developing across most areas. To start the period, these may be heavy, and at times wintry in the far north, especially over hills.

Brief spells of more organised cloud, bringing rain and strong winds, remain possible, particularly in the south. Generally staying breezy throughout.  While temperatures by night are likely to below average, frost is expected to be restricted to prone locations, especially where winds fall light.

Sammy Hayes says his contract with courier giant Hermes was terminated on the spot after an incident at a depo near Glasgow, when he was asked to put on a face covering while in the back of his van.The -year-old self-employed driver - who is exempt from wearing a mask but chooses to wear one when he can - has appealed the decision but is now set to consult lawyers after months of silence from his former bosses, reports the Daily Record. Sammy, from Glasgow’s Ruchill, said: “They’ve taken my livelihood and I’m in debt now, struggling to pay my house and live.” “I was there around  years. It’s absolutely ruthless.”  Sammy claims he was sorting parcels in the back of his own van in a car park in Bishopbriggs when he was approached by a security guard in February. He said: “I was asked to put my mask on, which I duly did as I had one around my neck. “I had  deliveries and four picks ups. I completed my work and had a phone call that night saying my contact was being terminated due to not wearing a face mask. They were determined it was a sackable offence.” Sammy submitted an appeal and wrote to bosses granting them access his medical records to prove he was exempt after suffering a stroke, a loss of vision in one eye and acute anxiety.

But three months on Sammy says he has had to turn to charity to support him during his unemployment. He said: “I told Hermes I’m exempt but they said I should have made that known before. “I’ve got one of the cards and do wear it on certain occasions but not all the time as it’s not a legal requirement and I do wear as a mask whenever I feel I can. “I’ve never been unemployed in my le and still haven’t claimed social security because I was unsure on what was happening with my job. “I’ve had to sell my caravan, which I fought tooth and nail to try and keep. I’m totally disgusted and the silence is worse than anything .” Hermes told us Sammy did not disclose his exemption so had been logged as repeatedly “refusing” to wear a mask - something he denies. A Hermes spokeswoman said: “The local team have confirmed that this self employed courier had his contract terminated for repeatedly refusing to wear a mask on site and this was documented in a number of Covid audits.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCar parksHermes"},{"url":null,"title":"drink freedom lockdown eases happy","story":"NewsDrink in freedom as lockdown eases and happy hours, hugs and hols are back - for nowAs lockdown restrictions ease in England a government adviser has warned Britain is in a perilous moment with at least , cases of the Indian iant in the UKmirrorShareCommentsByPippa CrerarDaily Mirror Political Editor:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsPub-goers are looking forward to getting out of the rain as boozers reopen indoors \"Join the lockdown community for surveys on your viewsInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Some foreign holidays are also back on the cards, along with hugging, trips to the cinema and theatre and staying overnight with family and friends. But experts urged caution as the highly-contagious Indian iant of Covid rampages across the country, sparking fears our regained freedoms may be short-lived. There are now at least , cases of the mutation in the UK with “hotspots” in Greater Manchester, London and Glasgow. And scientists are warning it is quickly becoming dominant.

One government adviser said the spread is putting Britain in a “perilous moment” that could put Boris Johnson ’s hopes of relaxing all restrictions by June .The PM, who came under fire for not closing our borders to India earlier despite the country reporting , cases a day by April , said the latest lting of curbs must be done “with a heavy dose of caution”. He added: “We are keeping the spread of the iant first identied in India under close observation and taking swt action where infection rates are rising. I urge everyone to be cautious and take responsibility when enjoying new freedoms today in order to keep the virus at bay.”  Health Secretary Matt Hancock admitted the Indian iant – which may be % more infectious than the Kent one – could “spread like wildfire” among the ­unvaccinated population as the Government stepped up the pace of the jabs roll-out. But he insisted it was “appropriate” to push on with easing restrictions in England today. However, he would not rule out taking tougher measuresnecessary – including local lockdowns in hotspot areas. As ­landlords and restaurant owners yesterday put the finishing touches to ­preparation to welcome customers back indoor, for Mr Hancock said: “We willit’s necessary to protect people.”  Government ­scientic adviser and SAGE expert Professor Sir Mark Walport warned it will be “extremely ­important” to keep an eye on the numbers of iant cases over the next few weeks. He said: “The problem is the data takes a while to emerge, which is why there’s every grounds to be very cautious about the ability to open up in June. “It’s fair to say it is a perilous moment. We have a iant that shows good evidence of being more transmissible and possibly ­signicantly more transmissible.” Speaking of today’s lting of curbs, he added: “My advice is because you can do something doesn’t necessarily mean you should. Try to socialise outside, keep social distancing,you’re going to hug, hug cautiously.” Hoards of people were pictured queuing near Bolton’s Essa Academy school vaccination centre yesterday as fears of regional lockdowns in the North West grew among locals. One said: “I can’t believe how many are here, it’s crazy. They’re queuing round the block for a jab.”  Public Health England revealed the area has had a sharp spike in infections since mid-April. The Indian iant now makes up the majority of new cases. Demolition worker Darren Hall, , said: “I thought it had all gone away, but it’s not. I’m worried that we’d be the only town in the country still locked down.” During the pandemic lull last summer a spike of cases meant Bolton had to shut pubs and restaurants. Northern Monkey Brew Co manager Andreea Oros, , said: “We’ve been pretty much shut for the whole thing.” Old Three Crowns landlady Lisa Day, , added: “It is quite scary for everybody. “We’ve been in it so long, everybody’s saying, ‘Not another lockdown. I’m not going to do it.’ I just think enough is enough.” India was not added to the UK’s red list of ­countries until April  – three weeks after Pakistan and Bangladesh were. Mr Johnson has been accused of dragging his heels because he wanted to go ahead with a visit to India to secure a trade deal. At least , passengers who could have been infected with the iant were allowed to enter Britain while he dithered. Labour’s Yvette Cooper called for the ban on foreign travel not to be lted today over fears of more iants coming in. She said: “I think they should be being much more cautious.”  A landlady is calling for the public to help save pubs across the UK by raising a glass in them on “Magic Monday”. Lana Bewry, , who runs the Golden Anchor in Nunhead, South East London, said she has been “blessed” by the support of the public who saved her business. She now wants everyone across the country to support their local and told The Mirror: “The customers are loving it, being out and socialising and you cannot ask for more support. “We have made it thanks to people coming out to support us. “All the pubs in Britain need a Magic Monday.

Ellie, a student nurse, said: “It’s really weird being here, we’ve forgotten what it’s like to go on holiday. “It’s a pain having to do the tests but it’s reassuring to know everyone is Covid-free before they travel.  “We were shocked at just how many tourists were on the flight, obviously lots of people couldn’t wait to get away.” Zoe Berry, , from Wigan, was hoping to cross the border to Spain to see her boyfriend in Alicante.

There were last-minute fears on Thursday when the Portuguese government hinted travellers would not be allowed into the country until May  with holidaymakers having already booked flights and accommodation. But on Friday afternoon the situation was cleared up, with ministers confirming the borders would be open to Brits. A surge in bookings had come after Transport Secretary Grant Shapps announced the -country green list on May  during a Downing Street briefing.

As part of the re-opening of the border to international tourists a new traffic light system has been implemented, putting counties into red, amber or green, depending on their Covid risk. Just  countries have been placed into the green category and most nations across Europe are amber, meaning a period of isolation and more testing is needed to travel.  But Mr Hancock said that holidays in amber countries should not take place at all. He said people should “certainly not” go on holiday to some popular tourist destinations such as Spain, Italy, France and Greece, because of the risk from mutant strains of Covid. He told Times Radio: People should not travel to amber or red list countries unless it’s absolutely necessary, and certainly not for holiday purposes. He added the green list had been drawn up to “provide for a safe way” to travel, saying: “The red and amber list countries are places that you shouldn’t go to unless you have an absolutely compelling reason.” John Bell, professor of medicine at Oxford University and a member of the government’s vaccine task force, was also reported to have warned against continental breaks, saying that swathes of Europe were aposlargely unvaccinatedapos and aposvulnerable to new iants.apos Meanwhile, Boris Johnson has also urged restraint and issued a plea for people to use a heavy dose of caution as lockdown rules eased today.Pubs and restaurants will be able to reopen indoors and the ban on foreign travel is lted, among a raft of other changes. In a statement, Mr Johnson said: Together we have reached another milestone in our roadmap out of lockdown, but we must take this next step with a heavy dose of caution. We are keeping the spread of the iant first identied in India under close observation and taking swt action where infection rates are rising.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"ignore lockdown easing meet outside","story":"NewsIgnore lockdown easing and meet outside to beat Indian iant, warns scientistFrom Monday in England people can socialise indoors in homes, pubs and restaurants, and physical contact between households will once again be allowedmirrorShareCommentsByCatherine WylieAine FoxWilliam Walker:,  MAY NewsLockdown easing comes amid concerns over the spread of the Indian iant of coronavirus \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

From Monday in England people can socialise indoors in homes, pubs and restaurants, and physical contact between households will once again be allowed. But ahead of the relaxation of lockdown Professor Sir Mark Walport, a member of the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies , urged caution. He warned that the pandemic is at a perilous moment and said it will be extremely important to keep a close eye on the numbers over the next few weeks. He said he will be staying outdoors as far as possible despite todayaposs relaxation of restrictions.  Sir Mark told Skyaposs Sophy Ridge On Sunday vulnerable people who have not been vaccinated really need to get vaccinated, adding: Becauseyou havenapost had a vaccine you really must have one actually. Thereaposs no good reasons for not. So thataposs the important thing. But then it is I think a question of people making judgments and you know my personal judgment is that I will do things outside as far as possible. Askedhe would avoid indoor pub tables, he said: For the moment, yes. Sir Mark saidpeople are doing things inside they should make sure windows are open and the room properly ventilated. He said he thinks complete normality is going to take a bit of time to , and people have got to be sensibly cautious. Asked what his advice would be to people on Monday, he said: Well my advice is that just because you can do something doesnapost necessarily mean you should.  As far as possible socialise outside, maintain social distancing,youaposre going to hug, hug cautiously. It comes amid concern over the Indian iant of Covid that has ravaged the country. Professor John Edmunds said while the Indian iant is a new threat the UK is in a much better position compared to before Christmas when the Kent iant was detected. Speaking on BBCaposs Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, he said: I think we should be concerned but not panicking. Weaposre in a much, much better place now than we were when the Kent iant first hit us back in November, December. He added: Now the hospitals are empty, thankfully, or virtually empty of Covid patients and two-thirds of the adult population have been vaccinated. Prof Edmunds saidthings deteriorate quickly with the new iant, action will have to be taken. I think we have to monitor this very carefully, I donapost think we should rule anything out. Sothings look like theyaposre getting worse rapidly then I do think that action needs to be taken. Elsewhere, Professor Adam Finn, from the University of Bristol and a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation , was askedthe JCVI would look again at the recommendation that people under  should be offered non-AstraZeneca jabsit means that it could speed up the rollout.He told Skyaposs Sophy Ridge On Sunday: Yes absolutely, thataposs on the agenda, andnecessary thataposs something that could be done.When we expressed a preference for non-AstraZeneca vaccines for this age group it was done in a very provisional way on the basis of everything going absolutely right.Andthe evidence shows that the risk benefit balance for people in their s is to be offered that vaccine then absolutely that recommendation will be changed. At the moment we donapost think thataposs necessary, but it could well become a recommendation in the future.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"indian covid variant uk under","story":"NewsIndian Covid iant: UK under-s could be given AstraZeneca jab againPeople under  in the UK are being offered alternatives to the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine, but that could change due to the spread of the Indian iantmirrorShareCommentsByChris KitchingSenior News ReporterCatherine WylieAine Fox:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video majority-indian-iant-patients-bolton-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:UHVIGeCS,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Professor Sir Mark Walport, a member of the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies , warned that the pandemic is at a “perilous moment” and said it will be “extremely important” to keep a close eye on the numbers over the next few weeks. He said he will be staying outdoors as far as possible despite Monday’s relaxation of restrictions.

Asked whether all restrictions are likely to end on June  as planned, Prof Edmunds said: “I think we’ll know much more about that in the next few weeks as we see how this iant spreads and the impact that it’s going to have. “I think at the moment it’s a bit too early to say.”FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCoronavirus vaccine"},{"url":null,"title":"inside tiny 2 bed cottage","story":"NewsInside the tiny -bed cottage - with a coastline view worth half a million pounds-year-old Bryn Canaid has two bedrooms and sits at the end of a dirt road - but with stylish interior features like a log fire and a Japanese soak tub plus an unbeatable sea view, auctioneers have reckoned the guide price should be £,mirrorShareCommentsByJoanne Ridout:,  MAY NewsThis -year-old cottage is on sale \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

But auctioneers say what it lacks in indoor space, it makes up for with panoramic views of the sea from almost every angle of the surrounding land.Sitting above the rugged coastline on the western tip of the peninsula, the remote property boasts incredible vistas of sprawling fields and clear blue ocean, reports Wales Online. Directly opposite and adding to the fairytale charm is the mythical island of Ynys Enlli, also known as Bardsey Island or the legendary Island of , Saints. Surrounded by National Trust land, neighbours - other than of the animal, bird and insect kind - are few and far between.

That was what happened to Ekow Otoo – an actor, spoken-word poet and model. “My legs had been giving me problems for years I was suffering a relapse and felt too weak to cook, so I’d ordered a takeaway. I remember being pinned to the wall when I took the pizzas from the delivery guy – they were too heavy to walk with,” says Ghanian-born Londoner Ekow, now . Ekow, who now knows he has multiple sclerosis , started experiencing issues aged . “I tried to get out of my bed one morning and my legs wouldn’t follow. After a nap they were fine again, but next time I played basketball I couldn’t run – my knees would buckle and I couldn’t get any speed.” A GP put the issue down to Ekow shooting up six inches in just one year. “They just thought I’d grown too quickly and my muscles were catching up.” MS is an inflammatory disease in which the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord are damaged. Slowly the disease affected Ekow to the point he had to give up sport entirely. “I couldn’t even walk two roads without resting on walls.” At university Ekow struggled to get information from his brain to the page. “I think they thought I was lazy,” he says. “I didn’t connect the problem with my legs, though.”  Help and advice In February , Ekow went to bed with a chest infection. “When I woke I felt funny, sat down and couldn’t stand up again. I ended up in hospital with a doctor standing over my bed, saying: ‘This is MS.’ I remember thinking, ‘Wow, there’s a name for it.’ “It was such a relief to have a definitive diagnosis. I knew it wasn’t all in my head.” When he was first given his wheelchair, Ekow was, “overcome with peace”: “I thought it was going to be a massive struggle, but I sat in the chair and pushed for the first time, and it was like all the stress melted away. “It turns out I’m really good at it. I can travel faster than I used to, without worrying I’ll fall over, look strange or have to stop.” Since his diagnosis, Ekow has relied heavily on The National Lottery-supported MS Society which proved a vital source of information and help when he needed it. He has also benefited from sports, including wheelchair racing – mentored by Paralympian Vanessa Wallace – and adapted rowing with another National Lottery-supported organisation, British Rowing. By playing The National Lottery, you raise £M for good causes every week* “Getting back into sport was the first step in finding my confidence as a wheelchair user. I just loved it – I took part in a development programme with British Rowing for a year and, in , won a para-rowing gold in the British Championships.” Ekow has even excelled at acting, and was recently picked to play the lead role in a stunning new National Lottery TV advert, which sees him performing dramatic stunts in his wheelchair.  Thanks to some clever CGI, viewers watch as he is transported from a street corner into the middle of a Viking invasion, before tearing through a museum and then taking off above the city skyline. At one point Ekow is even flung into the air as he travels through a skate park.

Skin-lightening creams are said to work by reducing the concentration or production of melanin, natural pigment that gives skin its colour. Alex Malouf, a former PG executive, said: Meghan has talked a lot about the issue of race and racism, so this does stick out like a sore thumb.  Campaigner Nina Davuluri, the first Indian-American to win Miss America, argued skin whitening creams sell a aposracistapos ideology that you need white skin to be beautul, you need white skin to be successful.An investigation by The Mail on Sunday found that PG skincare brand Olay sells White Radiance moisturiser in India, Malaysia and Singapore.PG also reportedly sells Olay White Radiance Light Perfecting Essence in the Philippines.

Harry, , revealed he had wanted to quit the Firm in his s and said look what it did to my mum, as well as suggesting heaposd inherited his parentsapos pain. The Duke also implied dad Charles’ parenting left him with “genetic pain and suffering”. In her Mail on Sunday column, Ms Vine, who is married to the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, said while Harry is dferent since he met his we, he hasnapost been brainwashed by Meghan.Instead, he is just starting to be himself.Do you enjoy reading about the royal family for all the best royal news from the Mirror here  She added: I donapost think she [Meghan] is the only one to blame. I believe Harry is just as complicit. Itaposs only that weaposve never really wanted to accept it because in our minds he is still that tragic young boy at his motheraposs funeral. But that Harry is gone now and the man we see before us is a very dferent kettle of fish. Far from being brainwashed by Meghan, I think heaposs just starting to be himself. In the bombshell podcast released last week, Harry reflected on how he wished to break the cycle for his own children.  He did, however, say there is no blame, and the finger should not be pointed at anybody. He said: I don’t think we should be pointing the finger or blaming anybody, but certainly when it comes to parenting,I’ve experienced some form of pain or suffering because of the pain or suffering that perhaps my father or my parents had suffered, I’m going to make sure I break that cycle so that I don’t pass it on, basically. “It’s a lot of genetic pain and suffering that gets passed on anyway so we as parents should be doing the most we can to try and say ‘you know what, that happened to me, I’m going to make sure that doesn’t happen to you’.” Ms Vine said he has clearly harboured deep resentment for his father and the family for the unfair way he feels Diana was treated. She added that while weaposve seen glimpses of that before he has finally spelled it out, having married someone who he probably knew would never take to public le in Britain and who could provide him with the perfect excuse to leave.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnMail on SundayDax ShepardPrince HarryMichael GoveRoyal FamilyParenting"},{"url":null,"title":"mirror newspaper tablet offer promotion","story":"NewsGet The Mirror free on tablet for two months*Its packed with breaking news, sport and entertainment - and is perfect during lockdownmirrorShareByDave MastersDigital Commercial Editor:,  APR Updated:,  APR News\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

At £, for the first guest and £ thereafter, many would expect it to be a luxury experience. But the mum has laid the ups and downs bare in a series of revealing TikToks offering a rare insight into the government-mandated stay. Highlights appear to have included catching a glimpse of a secret film production taking place on the street outside and a sweet family game of cards. But the mum jokingly explained how her le had become an endless cycle of Paw Patrol reruns and Covid tests as they looked to pass the time, Edinburgh Live reports.  On night one, the family are sitting around playing cards while the energetic little one makes full use of his new surroundings. Night two sees them enjoy repeats of the popular children’s cartoon before undergoing the mandatory COVID lateral flow tests. Scottish Government guidelines require anyone who travels directly to Scotland from overseas to quarantine at a hotel for ten days, or  nights, as soon as they arrive. People are required to book the hotel they will be isolating in, through the quarantine hotel booking website, before making their way to Scotland. In addition to Edinburgh, hotels are also located in Glasgow and Aberdeen. Meals, along with fruit and soft drinks, are delivered to rooms, while water, tea and coffee is pre-stocked. People are also required to take Covid- tests while they are in hotel rooms – on day two and day eight of their ten day stay. If either of these are positive they are required to quarantine for a longer period. Prices for the hotel stays do not come cheap, with costs placed at £ for the first adult and then £ for any other adults or children over the age of  after that. Itaposs £ for children aged five to .

Germany, Spain, the Netherlands and Switzerland became the latest nations to ease restrictions on foreign visitors who have had both doses. Vaccinated travellers will be able to enter the countries without having to do a PCR test or go into quarantine. Germany said yesterday it is even allowing people from higher risk amber nations and all will be exempt from having to self-isolate on arrival, while those requiring a test to enter will be given one for free. Spain and the Netherlands, meanwhile, are allowing anyone from countries with low infection rates and they donapost even have to prove vaccination status. The former is considering a  or  per , case rate threshold, while the later has set theirs at , which would include the UK. Switzerland is also dropping quarantine for jabbed people from safe countries.Have your holiday plans been affected by Covid  Let us know at webnews@mirror In contrast, Britain requires anyone from just  green-listed countries to take a test on or before the second day of arrival, eventheyaposve been vaccinated. Those include Portugal, Israel, Gibraltar and Iceland. It comes after Portugal announced Brits would be allowed to enter the country from Monday when the borders re-open following hours of uncertainty. Anyone coming to the UK from an amber listed country, which includes Spain, Germany, Switzerland and Holland, as well as France and Greece, must quarantine for  days and have two PCR tests after two and then eight days.  As such, the UK has been criticised for being too cautious, despite the threat being posed by the Indian iant. Johan Lundgren, chief executive of easyJet, said tougher rules meant not only are Brits going to be beaten to the sun loungers by the Germans, Dutch and Swiss but this will leave them picking up a bigger bill for their holiday, coupled with an onerous, expensive and unnecessary testing regime for low-risk countries. We donapost want Britons to be left behind in the race to the sun when the huge success of our vaccination programme does mean travel can safely reopen, he added.  Tim Alderslade, of Airlines UK, said: The UK will rapidly fall behind the rest of Europe unless it looks again at its overly cautious approach to international travel. There is no reason why our green list canapost be expanded to include the US and the most popular European hotspots, or for the UK not to follow the EUaposs lead in exempting vaccinated travellers from restrictions. There are fears that the B.. strain will hinder the UKaposs pandemic recovery and could lead to the final lting of restrictions on June  being postponed. As experts say vaccines have saved , lives, a surge in cases in Bolton threatens to scupper progress. Scientists and government figures are holding urgent talks amid fears it could delay the end of lockdown rules.

Fitness enthusiasts were also pictured enjoying a late-night training session with indoor exercise back on, with eager travellers arriving at airports as the day wore on. And a touching photo also showed a grandmother and granddaughter hugging as advice on restricting contact was lted.From today a raft of restrictions aimed at tackling the spread of coronavirus have been lted following months of lockdown.Among the changes many venues, that were limited to serving customers outdoors, can now welcome punters back inside after months of keeping their doors closed. But many of the nationaposs boozers were not as busy as in scenes that were captured in April when lines of people waited for the stroke of midnight as beer gardens re-opened.  Huddersfield Pictures taken shortly after midnight showed revellers enjoying a drink at the Showtime Bar in Huddersfield as indoor hospitality and entertainment venues re-opened indoors. Finlay Woodhead, , could barely contain his excitement at being back inside a pub. Iaposm over the moon, Iaposve been waiting so long, he said while sitting next to his friend, -year-old Josh Utting.  Itaposs so nice to be sat inside where itaposs warm. I love it, honestly, I love it. Ian Snowball, the pubaposs owner, said it was incredible to be able to open his doors for those wanting a drink inside. Itaposs incredible - the anticipation and the planning has been amazing. Weaposve got all the staff here and everyoneaposs happy. Itaposs nice to be inside, warm ... I donapost have to have a hoodie or a coat onany more - itaposs great.  And hopefully we donapost have to go back outside again, hopefully this is the end of it now, he added. I think for people from the North, itaposs kind of special to us, a pub. Thereaposs an intimacy when we all get together, with our friends, and we talk. Newcastle In Newcastle, the cityaposs Switch Bar also saw a healthy influx of punters as staff began welcoming back drinkers inside.  Sheffield  Students could be seen out and about in Sheffield as the clock struck midnight. Queues snaked along roads outside bars and pubs as undergraduates made the most of their chance to party. Indoor drinks are still only allowed in groups of six, or two households.  London As well as thirsty punters there were also fitness enthusiasts gathering after midnight with indoor exercise sessions back on. The Fusion Park Road Leisure Centre in north London was among the venues that welcomed people looking to get in shape back inside.  And two women were quick toto the sauna. Juliet Arthur and Jane Harrison enjoyed their first trip to the facilities at at the Laboratory Spa and Health Club on Monday. Saunas had previously had to remain shut under lockdown rules.  Stansted AirportThousands of people were also expected to take to the skies on Monday as travel restrictions eased. The relaxation of the rules was described as a symbolic moment after the most dficult year in our history, by one airports chief.  Travel firms have reported a surge in demand for trips to Portugal, after the Government put the country on its green list for travel meaning travellers will not need to self-isolate on their , and are only required to take one post-arrival test. One group of travellers could be seen enjoying an early drink at Stansted Airport. Rules As of May  in England, people can meet outdoors in groups of up to  people and indoors in groups of up to six people or two households or bubbles. Pubs, bars and restaurants are all now allowed to re-open indoor areas for the first time since the New Year, and indoor entertainment such as cinemas and museums can also re-open. But experts have urged caution as the highly-contagious Indian iant of Covid rampages across the country, with at least , cases of the mutation in the UK. On Sunday Health Secretary Matt Hancock insisted it was right to continue with the easing of restrictions despite concerns over the Indian coronavirus iant. Government ­scientic adviser and SAGE expert Professor Sir Mark Walport said of the lting of restrictions: “My advice is because you can do something doesn’t necessarily mean you should. Try to socialise outside, keep social distancing,you’re going to hug, hug cautiously.”FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"thousands brits head portugal first","story":"NewsInside first UK flight to Portugal after travel ban ends as thousands jet abroadThe Mirror was in the queue to board the first flight from the UK to Faro and joined sun-seekers desperate to swap our wet and miserable May for blue skies, golden beaches and a temperature of CmirrorShareCommentsByPaul Byrne:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsFirst in the check-in queue at am were Louis Myers, Elle McLaughlin and their son Kruz \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Fancy an escape to the Chill newsletter for weekly inspiration and advice on UK holidays Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.Sign Up!When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Desperate sun-seekers began booking flights to swap our wet and miserable May for blue skies, golden beaches and a temperature of C. Passengers visiting a green list country will not be required to quarantine when they get back to England, but will be required to fill in a passenger locator form, provide a valid notication of a negative test result prior to travel and take a sequencing test on day  after arrival. The Mirroraposs Paul Byrne this morning joined holidaymakers in the queue to board the first flight from the UK to Faro - read his story below... After Portugalaposs announcement on Friday, I immediately paid £ for a PCR Covid test and had an anxious  hour wait for the negative result, which gave me the all clear to travel.  I’ll have another test when I , adding a hefty £ to the cost of the trip. But with an estimated , Brits heading for the country every day this week, it appears it is a price people are willing to pay. Ryanair flight FR was the first plane to leave the tarmac for Portugal’s southern coast at .am today, one of  jets taking holidaymakers from throughout the UK to Faro. First in the check-in queue at am were Louis Myers,  and Elle McLaughlin, , together with their  month old son Kruz. The couple from Manchester had booked a one week holiday to Vilamoura.  “We can’t wait to get away. We think we deserve after what has been such a horrible year for everyone” said full time mum Elle. “This is Kruz’s first time on a plane. We are so excited.” Construction worker Louis added: “We booked it as soon as we could last week and we are glad we did because the prices have started to go up.” Also in the queue were newlyweds Camilla and Calum McNally, from Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester. The couple tied the knot on Saturday and after an earlier honeymoon to Greece had to be cancelled because of Covid restrictions, they booked their flights to Portugal as soon as the UK government gave the go-ahead. Civil servant Calum, , said: “We were desperate to have a honeymoon.  “We are pretty excited. We want to relax and have some good food by the pool. I feel a lot of people are wanting to do that and we feel very lucky to be able to do that today.” Camilla, , said: “It was pretty stressful leaving it to the last minute but it is worth it. We have not been away for so long now.” Pals Kim Howard and Olivia Sheridan from Altrincham, Greater Manchester, were looking forward to lounging around the pool at their hotel in Albufeira. Hairdresser Kim, , said: “I want to have a break, sit down around the pool, get a sun tan, have a drink and have some good food. “Like a lot of people I struggled during lockdown. People have had enough of it now.” Olivia, , who runs her own salon, Olivia Rose Beauty in Urmston, Greater Manchester, said the pair were desperate for a break after working flat out in recent weeks.  She said: “We are both in the beauty industry so it has been non-stop since the end of lockdown. “People have been having their hair done at am. I’ve been doing nails at pm. It has been crazy.” She added: “I just love going on holiday. I can’t wait.” Luke Senior, , an electrician from Leeds, West Yorks, said: “I’m flying out to meet up with a mate. I booked the flight two days ago. “I just want to have a bit of sun. I’m really excited. I’m ready to party.” James Welsh, , from Halewood, Merseyside, arrived in Faro with his partner and their two children, Anthony, three and eight month old Delilah, after booking the flight over the weekend.  “We have had to cancel seven holidays in the last  months. We used to go away all the time and it has been frustrating not being able to get away. “When this opportunity came up we jumped at it.” Inside Manchester Airport, masks were compulsory for both travellers and staff. And announcements reminded passengers to respect social distancing guidelines. But there was no real need because the airport, which usually handles around million passengers a year, had little of its pre-Covid hustle and bustle, with few shops open and the bars firmly shut.  The first flight out of Manchester was at am to the Portuguese island of Maderia. Elizabeth and David Jollfe from Hamilton, near Glasgow, booked their tickets last week after their first choice of Dubai was left off the “green” list. Elizabeth, , said: “There was nothing available from Glasgow so we came down here. It is worth it, we are desperate to get away.” Finance director David, , added: “The past year has not been normal, not being able to get a bit of sun. “We can’t be in lockdown forever.” More than .million Brits visited Portugal in the year before the pandemic and it is desperate to welcome them back. Covid is still a threat and masks are worn both indoors and outdoors. And the country has imposed a scary sounding “state of calamity”, which allows for emergency lockdowns to combat the virus. But it has not stopped Brits booking flights for a much needed break. Portugal’s secretary of state for tourism Rita Marques said “everything is open”. She said: “Some restrictions apply, of course, so you have to wear a mask, you have to maintain social distancing. “Masks need to be used all day long, except when you are on the beach, of course. “Soyou are going to a restaurant near the beach you should wear a mask, butyou are near the sea you don’t need to wear a mask.” She added: “At the end of the day, the experience will be great.” I certainly hope so.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCoronavirusHolidays"},{"url":null,"title":"voice sunday mirror enjoy yourselves","story":"NewsopinionVoice of the Sunday Mirror: Enjoy yourselves as rules relax without killing othersJust because we can mix with friends and family indoors for the first time since January, it doesn’t mean we should slobber all over themmirrorShareCommentsByVoice of the Mirror:,  MAY NewsopinionWe might have more freedoms from Monday, but we still need to be careful \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Just because we can mix with friends and family indoors for the first time since January, it doesn’t mean we should slobber all over them. Of course this newspaper welcomes the reopening of indoor hospitality. God knows, it needs the custom. Of course we feel for families desperate to be reunited with loved ones – for the grandmas and grandpas who yearn to speak to grandchildren in person, not just in a Zoom call. All this has been made possible by the sacrices everyone has made during the lockdowns.  And all that progress could be thrown away unless we proceed with caution. The worrying spread of the new Indian iant makes taking care all the more important. The Indian iant is not the first mutation we have faced, and it will probably not be the last. Despite the phenomenal success of the vaccination programme, scientists do not rule out a iant that can get past the vaccine. We have lived with masks and social distancing for so long, it will not hurt to live with them a little while longer where they are necessary. We do not want to be killjoys. We are just asking for everyone to enjoy themselves without killing others.  Even up rights Now that cohabiting couples are the nation’s fastest-growing type of family unit, it is timely to review the rights and responsibilities that living partnered-up with another person entails. Because the fact is, there are no rights. The concept of common-law marriage is a myth. Too few people know that. So we applaud the inquiry by the Commons Women and Equalities Committee into the legal changes neededcohabiting is to be brought into line with marriage and civil partnership. But we accept MPs are about to step into a legal minefield. Married couples enjoy - claims on property the instant they say “I do”. There is no such landmark moment when two people just start living together. The Law Commission recommends that couples should only have similar rights once they have been living together for five years – or just twothey have children together. And that is as good a point as any for MPs should start their deliberations from.

Rowan Umland thought all his Christmases had come at once when he was chowing down on a packet of salt and vinegar Hula Hoops and made the miraculous discovery.

The woman, only known as Lucy, shared a video of how she discovered spotted black wires hanging from her tap. But it wasnapost actually wires - it appeared to be the legs of a spider that was firmly wedged inside the tap, ready to shoot out when the water was turned on.  Her video of the discovery has gone viral, with more than , views, although some pointed out that it could be a plastic spider. In the caption, she wrote: So I saw these things sticking out the bath tap, before zooming in up the spout of the tap. She then turned the taps on, which dislodged the uninvited house guest - and sparked a wave of comments from arachnophobes. The video left many people unnerved, as one joked: I wouldaposve died, while another wrote: That thing was about to take my le out. Others joked that they couldnapost watch for fear something would jump out the tap, and many admitted they didnapost finish the whole video. But one person claimed: Thataposs a toy spider, Iaposm not having it. Lots of people urged the woman to leave, with one commenting: Pack your bag and burn the house down. Another agreed, commenting: Simple solution is to move house.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @MirrorWeirdNewsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnViral"},{"url":null,"title":"doctors india find vaccinated people","story":"NewsDoctors in India find vaccinated people have .% chance of going to hospitalA total of , healthcare workers were given the vaccine for the experiment carried out in Delhi - and just two required hospital treatment, reports saymirrorShareCommentsByJonathan ColesReporter:,  MAY NewsThe study has not yet been peer-reviewed, reports say \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Iaposve said the vaccines are working against the Indian iant, I think weaposve got to look at the numbers so weaposve got some flexibility but there is nothing I have seen and nothing the Prime Minister has seen up to now that suggests we are going to delay that June  date.

Portugal’s Covid- vaccination plan is accelerating, with a new daily record , jabs administered on Saturday.Around , people have died with coronavirus in Portugal.Canaries regional government leader Angel Victor Torres said yesterday he hoped the islands will be put on the UK’s green list “imminently” after lobbying to be treated dferently from mainland Spain. He is hoping May  will be the day tourists can . “The Canary Islands’ government is in permanent contact with the British authorities,” he said. “The UK’s decision to treat regions separately from nations is something that will happen. It’s something that could occur imminently.” British Airways chief executive Sean Doyle has called on the Government to reunite Britons with their families overseas by urgently opening up air travel to more low-risk countries.  He said data on vaccination and infection rates for countries including the US, Spain and Greece made a “compelling case” for putting them on the green list from early next month. Mr Doyle said the six million British expatriates around the world were desperate to see loved ones after “a very tough  months”, adding: “You’ve got people who have got elderly or frail parents they have been unable to see. ‘You’ve also got people who have suffered bereavements who haven’t been able to come back and grieve. People want to reconnect.” Yesterday Which  warned of a lack of clarity from travel insurers over how much protection their policies offer for Covid-related disruption. A poll found half believed they would be covered should the Government’s travel advice change after a trip was booked, and % thought their policy would cover them in the event that local or national lockdowns prevented them from travelling. But the watchdog analysed  travel insurance providers and found cover for those eventualities was very rare. Despite the skies opening up for flights abroad, £billion will be spent on UK holidays this year, according to a Travelodge study. It found % are still too scared to travel abroad and % have not had a holiday since the first lockdown, want certainty their money will not be wasted and see “staycations” as a more secure option to going overseas. For the seventh year Cornwall keeps its crown as the nation’s top coastal holiday destination. Brighton took second place and Blackpool was third. The Lake District, North Wales and the Scottish Highlands are the top rural destinations this year. Fasten your seatbelts and enjoy the flight – The Great British Take-off for sunshine holidays starts today. Since the dark, miserable days of winter lockdown, it’s been a long wait for Brits who have been dreaming of soaking up the rays by a beach or a pool in Europe’s hotspots. After a few squeaky-bum-time moments on Friday, when getaways to the mainland of Portugal looked in the balance, it’s all systems go for trips to green list destinations today. If it’s your first time to Portugal, do try a pastel de nata, I bet that you can’t eat just one. Atlantic island groups also top the green list booking charts, and while Gibraltar offers a great home-from-home break, I expect Brits will also want to try a getaway to Iceland. It’s spectacular volcanic scenery rather than sunshine we’ll soak up there. Just take an anorak and quite a lot of money, it’s not cheap. Wherever we go we’ll have to put up with the possibility of long queues at airports and whatever Covid tests, vaccination status and rules are required in the holiday ‘new normal’. Given these ongoing uncertain times, I recommend buying a package holiday with the added security of ATOL protection, which helps youyour travel company, airline or hotel goes out of business. Hopefully this is the beginning of a safe sunshine summer which will see more destinations added to the green list over the coming weeks.

Money was approved by councillors two and a half years ago.“A date for this work should be set immediately and the works undertaken as soon as possible.“The safety of pupils and staff should be of the utmost concern. There should be no further delays.”The aluminium composite materialknown as Reynobond meets current Scottish building standards, it is understood.However the UK Government may be considering a ban on this type of cladding in the future.It is made from polyethylene plastic sandwiched between two very thin sheets of aluminium and was sold by French-based firm Arconic Architectural Products.The  were installed on the sides of the Grenfell Tower flats – and on building projects across the world – to make it warmer and drier.But this type of cladding is considered highly flammable.The local authority committed to removing the insulation at St Paul’s following a devastating blaze at city school Braeview Academy in September .It was part of the council’s efforts to increase safety after a number of failures – which may have limited fire damage – were highlighted months before.The recommendations went unresolved by the time the flames engulfed the school, and we revealed that more than two years later, the school was still considered a “substantial” fire risk.Following the Grenfell blaze, an investigation by the Scottish Government found that schools in  local authorities were clad in Aluminium Composite Material , however it was not disclosed which schools were affected.St Paul’s is the only city school to be clad in the harmful material.As part of a series of freedom of information requests, the four local authority areas in Tayside and Fe were asked to confirm which schools used the aluminium composite materials.This could include other ACM insulation or the same materials used in the Grenfell Tower block.In Angus, while no school is entirely clad in these materials, two schools have small areas of ACM cladding.Just .% of the , square metre external wall of Timmergreens Primary in Arbroath uses a polyethylene cored insulation known as Alucobond, however this material was not used in the Grenfell flats.Warddykes Primary, also in Arbroath, has .% of its , square metre wall area clad with Alucobond.In both cases, the council says the  system meets Class O requirement in accordance with the Scottish Building Regulations and both schools have regularly serviced sprinkler and fire alarm systems.Fe Council and Perth and Kinross Council said the Grenfell cladding is not used in any of their school buildings."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/20119158-589x372.jpg ","title":"dundee 0 1 raith rovers agg 3 1 dark blues into premiership play

securing Premiership football next season after seeing off Raith Rovers in the play-off semi-final.The Dark Blues were in the driving seat ahead of the semi-final second leg after winning - in midweek at Stark#s Park.However, James McPake#s men were stunned when Rovers opened the scoring in the first half through Lewis Vaughan.Rovers had further chances against a nervy-looking home side but Dundee held on to progress to the final against either Kilmarnock, Ross County or Hamilton # although basement club Accies require something special on Sunday to get there, needing to beat Kilmarnock by nine goals.Rovers had an early chance in just the third minute with Dan Armstrong coming in off the right wing to send an angled drive towards goal but his shot was easily dealt with by home keeper Adam Legzdins.Dundee then broke from inside their own half, with Paul McMullan playing the ball wide to Jason Cummings but the striker#s shot was deflected for a corner.The home side had another chance as Charlie Adam fired a deep free-kick into the Raith box, with centre-half Lee Ashcroft shooting just over Rovers keeper Jamie MacDonald#s crossbar.However, it was the Fe side who broke the deadlock in the st minute when a ReganHendry shot fell to Vaughan inside the Dundee box, with the forward swivelling before producing a fine finish past Legzdins.Raith were on top and Dundee boss McPake could be heard screaming at his players to stop sitting so deep.In the th minute, the home side carved out a promising opening as the overlapping Cammy Kerr cut the ball back to Max Anderson but the midfielder#s shot was well saved by MacDonald.Just before half-time there was a big scare for Adam when he handled the ball # having been booked shortly before # but referee Don Robertson was content to just award a free-kick.There was a Raith claim for a penalty in the th minute when a Vaughan shot was blocked by Jordan McGhee, with the ball appearing to strike the defender#s hand but Robertson was not convinced there was a case to answer.Rovers continued to press and had another good opportunity as Kieran MacDonald teed up Armstrong but his shot was deflected wide for a corner.However, the Raith challenge finally ran out of steam, with Dundee going through despite losing on the night.Dundee v Raith Rovers: John McGlynn opens up on serious illness battle which makes him treasure this

has pledged to make bringing #future prosperity# to its citizens her priority after assuming sole charge.Labour#s Jenny Laing is now the single leader of the local authority after councillors voted not to replace Conservative co-leader Douglas Lumsden last week after being elected as an MSP earlier this month.Ryan Houghton, the Tories# group leader, had been nominated to take over the role.However, he withdrew his bid due to the fallout caused by controversial remarks dating back several years, saying the issue had become #political football#.It means the city council has one outright leader for the first time since , although Labour remain in a coalition with the Tories and independent councillors.Speaking for the first time since the decision not to appoint a second co-leader was made by the council#s urgent business committee, Mrs Laing outlined her mission to protect Aberdeen#s #social and economic future#.Key to that, she claimed, is a focus on issues such as the level of poverty in the city.“As a leader of the council I have always had a focus on the future prosperity of the city,# Mrs Laing said.#That’s why I have worked very hard through our community planning partnership to make sure our local outcome improvement plan is embedded.“The Covid situation has shone a spotlight, particularly on areas around social and economic issues, and we are working collectively to bring forward projects and proposals that will allow us to secure the social and economic future of the city not just for those who are here currently but for those who will live, work and visit here in the future as well.“My message is that as an administration, whether it’s in the last four years or the previous five where we had a similar coalition agreement, has always had the desire to deliver for the people of Aberdeen.“We have a good track record. We are seeing new council houses, new schools and transport projects.“Equally it’s about the investment in the people as well as the place. That’s the work we have done around community planning, things we have done around free school meals and tackling the poverty that exists in the city. All these things have been at the forefront of this and the previous administration’s plans.“We want to make sure we continue on that journey.#Despite being in power, Labour#s nine-strong group on Aberdeen City Council remain suspended from the party for entering the coalition with the Conservatives.However, Mrs Laing insisted the party#s principles remain at the heart of the administration#s decisions # and promised to deliver #prosperity# for the people of Aberdeen.#I stood for election on a Labour manesto, which is at the heart of the council’s strategic delivery plans, and I want to make sure that in the last year of this administration’s term we continue to deliver on that plan,# she said.“That is what will make the dference for the people of Aberdeen and will ensure there is prosperity for people across Aberdeen.

strategy, we are committed to funding work which helps to build skills and supports people who may lack access to support to enter or remain in the job market.“We were impressed with Ness’s track record of providing effective practical support across north-east Scotland.

She began her tenancy at the Creative Academy that same year.Evija#s photo series and accompanying video ‘The Hoarder’ is on display as part of the airport art. Her pieces illustrate what she called the #survival mode# mentality that led people to hoard toilet paper and other resources during the first wave of coronavirus lockdowns in .“It was very interesting during the first lockdown to notice a new way of behaviour that I hadn’t seen before, so I had the idea: WhatI exaggerated a lot and made an absurd situation ”Such as, for instance, a short film featuring a man methodically wheeling a toilet paper-laden trolley through the scenic Highlands. Fully garbed in PPE, he pauses to #sanitize# the streets and a few roadside stones along his way.Evija said that she takes a lot of inspiration from the countryside around Inverness. As she showed in #The Hoarder,# it gives her opportunities to contrast contemporary art with the rawness of nature.#With such a beautul landscape and such a completely everyday item: toilet paper. It was such a contrast. And it made me think, what are we worrying about when there#s so much that#s beautul and amazing.#Yelena Visemirska is another Latvia-born visual artist who moved to Scotland in . She arrived in Inverness in  and earned her BA in Fine Arts from Inverness College UHI in .After graduating, she became a tenant at Inverness Creative Academy when it first opened in . She said called her years of study at UHI the best time of her le and a decision she would repeat many times overgiven the chance.#I always wanted to do art and it was one of those things in Latvia that I never managed,# she said.#I enrolled myself into UHI and that was the best thing I ever did, because this is something I#m supposed to do I feel like.#The feeling of empowerment that she gets on her regular hill walks and climbing expeditions are what she tries to recreate in her paintings. When she thinks of Latvia, she imagines flat, urban scenes and so she still makes space in her work to take inspiration from back home.#I often start with industrial, geometric shapes,# she said. #It was very interesting to see how Scotland fed me with the environment. I feel like I belong here.#Louise Innes is a Scottish artist with a BA in Fine Art Textiles from Moray College UHI and a st Class BAin Contemporary and Contextualised Art Practice from Inverness College UHI. She graduated and moved into the Creative Academy in .Louise loves to make art that is rooted in memories. Either by using specic mementos or by creating something unique, she said she always tries to evoke the right emotion.#Since my mum and my gran passed a few years ago, memories became more important for me. My granny had these amazing photo albums. But because my granny had dementia,my mum didn#t write down who all these lovely people were then we would never know. And I thought that#s such a shame.#So my work takes family memories and tries to depict them in a sort of contemporary manner. Things that will trigger memories, so that when you see that bit of art you think about the memories from your childhood and happy memories.#Louise#s airport contribution features scenes of places around Scotland where she likes to visit.#It#s really just to encourage people to take time, step back and remember memories for themselves and future generations.#Over the course of the year, more students and alumni will be featured at the Highland Creative airport art exhibit, which is expected to run through October. Travel opportunities are opening up across Scotland as the nation moves into lower levels of coronavirus restrictions.Airport manager Graeme Bell said that the artists’ audience should only continue to grow in the coming months as traffic hopefully increases.“We are only too pleased to be able to help local artists and the wider creative community during such challenging times,” he said.“As travel restrictions ease, visitors can appreciate our region’s unique culture and visual identity through the artwork being exhibited. And, of course, it can be enjoyed by the Inverness Airport team too.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium

believe remote voting and debates should continue at parliament after the pandemic, according to a new poll.The survey, carried out for the John Smith Centre at Glasgow University, showed that almost two-thirds of people believed it helped rural politicians.Many MPs and MSPs have been carrying out their duties from their homes after social distancing measures and travel restrictions placed limits on their ability to attend parliament.It has led to a renewed focus on a debate over the way democratic institutions operate in Scotland and the UK.Former Caithness, Sutherland and Ross MSP Gail Ross had previously highlighted the “demands” of travelling between Wick and Edinburgh when she announced she was stepping down last year.The new Message House poll of , people across the UK found that % believed politicians should continue to be able to debate and vote remotely after restrictions are lted, with % saying they should be required to be in parliament to take part.Nearly two-thirds, or %, of those polled thought that remote voting and debating would help those in rural areas get more done.And % said that more women and people with caring responsibilities would be encouraged to stand for parliament as a consequence.Kezia Dugdale, director of the John Smith Centre, said: “As much as we all crave ‘going back to normal’, we should be asking ourselves and our leadersthat idea of ‘normal’ was really good enough.“Because it’s not really normal to line up in the ‘aye’ and ‘no’ lobbies of Westminster to cast a vote with your whole body.“Hours wasted passing legislation packed together like sardines.“Neither is it normal to demand MSPs travel from Stranraer and Stromness to the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh to electronically cast a tight budget vote that we now know could be easily done from a distance.”This new polling shows a desire to keep the new way of working that was brought in as a result of Covid restrictions, particularlyit aids rural representation and increases the chances of parliamentarians looking like the country they seek to represent.#The former Scottish Labour leader added: “This new polling shows a desire to keep the new way of working that was brought in as a result of Covid restrictions, particularlyit aids rural representation and increases the chances of parliamentarians looking like the country they seek to represent.“There’s much work to be done to enhance the effectiveness of parliament’s scrutiny s, but after the year of innovation we’ve had, making the impossible possible, it’s surely within reach.”For as little as £. a

daily updated charts and maps to track the coronavirus crisis in Scotland. The table below shows an at-a-glance view of the situation in each local authority. It shows new reported cases and deaths in the last day, as well as the total cases in each area since the pandemic began. After a second wave over winter, most areas of the country are starting to see figures fall again.The proportion of people who test positive every day was trending downward since December.The chart below shows local positivity rates. This is now a key metric that is considered when putting each area into tiers. The colour scales refer to the potential levels recommended by the World Health Organisation.Another key metric is the rate of cases per , people. The chart below shows the seven day rate in each local authority. Similar to the chart above, this chart is also colour coded by the potential levels as recommended by the WHO.In the early stages of the pandemic, cases were more concentrated in older generations. In the last few months this has shted towards cases being more prevalent in younger people – however, cases are declining in the more vulnerable age groups as the vaccine rollout progresses.As the number of daily new cases reduces, the cumulative totals for the health board areas become less important. The heatmap below shows the number of new cases by health board area.The chart below shows the daily number of deaths after a positive test as well as the cases where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certicate.The heatmap below shows the age demographics of the people who have lost their lives to the virus. The chart below shows a daily snapshot of the number of people in hospital and ICU with Covid-.

Thursday night is shinty night in Lochgilphead, with the club holding primary school age coaching from pm to pm and combined men#s and women#s training from pm to .pm.The practicalities of travelling to away matches under Covid rules do, however, give cause for concern. #We can#t use a minibus as things stand and will have to use inidual cars for a -strong squad,# said Angus.#With seven players under  years of age in the squad, we will have to rely on the support of parents.#Kilmory has been placed in the Mowi South A regional league alongside Bute, Lochside, Taynuilt, Ballachulish and Inveraray second team.#There is tough competition in the league,# said Angus, #so with the number of young players we have it will be a case of getting the best team we can on the pitch every week, learning against good opposition and building for the future.#Inveraray#s first team will compete in Mowi Senior League C with Aberdour, Glasgow Mid Argyll, Kyles Athletic, Oban Camanachd and Oban Celtic.Inveraray players were non-contact training twice a week as soon as the rules allowed and club chairman Andrew McMurdo is pleased with their attitude. #I didn#t know what to expect, but the boys have been great and conscientious about the way they go about it. And socially it#s been good for them,# he said.#Both first and second teams are in challenging leagues, but it#s a good challenge. And with no relegation, we can experiment a bit and plan for next season.#Like every other aspect of le, shinty has had to be flexible and adapt to the pandemic, so hats off to the Camanachd Association for having the plans in place and implementing them so quickly.#New volunteers at Kilmory and Inveraray shinty clubs would also be welcome, particularly with the additional burden of meeting Covid requirements.Andrew McMurdo said: #No matter how big or small the task, more hands lighten the load, so we would appreciate the help of new volunteers.#PICS:Inveraray’s Andrew Fraser in yellow and black during a friendly match with Glasgow Mid Argyll in February  # one of the last matches before lockdown.

Retailers in Scotland have invested tens of millions of pounds on safety measures including plexiglass screens, queue management systems, social distancing signage and floor markings, better ventilation, cleaning and hygiene. Shop workers have ensured the nation was supplied and fed throughout the past  dficult months.The reopening of non-essential shops and ability of food-to-go retailers to resume welcoming customers in-store will mark a crucial milestone for Scottish retail and the wider supply chain. Retail is Scotland’s largest private sector employer. So-called non-essential stores have been compelled to close in Scotland for  consecutive days. The SRC and Usdaw encourage shoppers to:Across Scotland, thousands of shops which have been shuttered for four long months are looking forward to getting back to doing what they do best, serving their customers.Re-opening is good news for our economy, for jobs and for our local communities. It has never been more important to play our part in keeping our towns, cities and retail destinations vibrant.Every purchase from a shop helps to support jobs in local retail and throughout the supply chain.Retailers and their colleagues continue to work around the clock to maintain a safe shopping experience, so customers can have the confidence toto their favourite stores.If we all follow the necessary physical distancing and hygiene measures and show consideration to those around us, including shop staff who are doing a dficult job, then everyone will be better off.David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail ConsortiumThe reopening of stores on Monday offers a leline for many retailers. That is good news in terms of helping to safeguard jobs, but the virus is still out there.We expect employers to conduct full risk assessments, follow the agreed guidance and ensure that customers are fully informed of the necessary safety measures.Shoppers need to play their part in helping to limit the spread of the virus and avoid further lockdowns by following the rules and respecting staff.Regrettably, throughout this appalling pandemic, incidents of abuse towards shop workers doubled and Covid safety measures have now become signicant flashpoints.Abuse should never be part of the job and shop workers – who played a vital role in getting food and medicine into our homes during the pandemic – deserve our thanks and respect.In January, the Scottish Parliament unanimously voted for a ground-breaking new law to protect shop workers.Usdaw campaigned for many years to secure these legal protections and we will continue to work hard to ensure that shop workers are protected and treated with the respect they deserve.Tracey Gilbert, Usdaw deputy isional officer for ScotlandSir,Oxfam’s shops in Argyll and Bute have an urgent need for volunteers to help deal with an anticipated deluge of donations as they prepare to re-open from Monday April .Sales from the first day of trading following the re-opening of its English and Welsh shops were up  per cent on  figures, with it being the most successful Monday ever sales-wise for the organisation outwith Christmas periods.Money raised by the dedicated staff and volunteers in Oxfam#s shops in Dunoon and Rothesay helps fight poverty and injustice around the world providing people with lesaving essentials like clean water and soap as well as the hope of a better future.We know from the last lockdown that people will have taken the chance to have a good declutter and we’re anticipating a deluge of generous donations.Volunteers are asked to give as little as a few hours a week of their time and can take up a range of vital roles, from serving customers to sorting donations and arranging window displays.Each shop typically relies on a team of  dedicated volunteers and one or two staff, with more than , volunteers required across the country.As well as volunteers, Oxfam stores are also appealing for good quality donations.Protecting staff, volunteers and customers from Covid- remains Oxfam’s priority, with shop teams continuing to implement strict protocol, including social distancing, readily available hand sanitiser, masks and gloves for staff, screens at tills, regular and frequent cleaning, closed changing rooms and encouraging contactless payment.In advance of shops re-opening, people are invited to register their interest online via www.oxfam.org.uk # just click on #get involved#.Tom Richardson, Oxfam interim head of retailSir,The demands placed on Scotland’s health service by the pandemic have intensied pleas for an increase in funding for Scottish NHS.NHS funding in Scotland comes from the block grant from Westminster. If huge sums of Scottish taxpayers’ money were not being used to pay Scotland’s share of renewing and maintaining Britain’s nuclear submarine fleet, there would be funds available to properly support the Scottish NHS. This will only be possible when Scotland is independent once more.Susan Swain, Dunbar"},{"url":null,"title":"the softer crofter a land of sustainability","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

So, it’s an easier morning round for us crofters with only the daft pigs to feed, who long ago foraged every root, acorn and pine-cone from their sizeable woodland.Their little forest is perfectly, porcinely ploughed, but they must still be finding some nourishment there as they seem less frantic at feeding-time, pausing their grubbling and guzzling for the occasional scratch and cuddle.The let-up in winter feeding has allowed much-needed attention to be given to the now stuffed-full Polycrub where every speck of soil, every hanging beam has been usefully employed in the mission to feed the family entirely from its harvest.Raspberry canes, lemon, orange and cherry trees should keep rickets at bay, while the plethora of weird and wonderful ieties of carrots, potatoes, asparagus, and squashes will nourish us throughout the season and beyond.Our newbie attempts to live off the land mirror the much more experienced efforts of families throughout theand breadth of this peninsula and in the village beyond. Thanks to those techie neighbours who set up email networks and social media groups there is a fantastic bank of information and expertise shared locally.Whether you want to learn how to plant oak trees, acquire foraging skills or find out how to run your home on renewable energy, somebody local has been there, done it and is happy to point you in the right direction.Over the last few months this valuable mine of knowledge and enthusiasm for environmental projects has been formalised into the Tayvallich Sustainability Plan, a  for sharing information and taking action to create a more sustainable community.The plan has grown organically from a pilot scheme run through the winter months with Keep Scotland Beautul to a website, action plan and monthly activities.Open to everyone with an interest in achieving a healthy, sustainable future for the village and its surroundings, the plan will work on the whole gambit: from food growing to flood mitigation foraging to forestry and heat pumps to bike pumps # a new cycle repair work-stand has been installed outside the village shop.Joining the online meetings throughout the winter, I was amazed to see not just the number of locals involved, but also the extraordinary talents and interests they share.We only entrenched ourselves full time on this wild wee bit of Argyll a month or two before lockdown so we’re not well-kent faces and, likewise, the faces of many villagers I’ve only ever seen strangely pixellated thanks to my dodgy connection to the Zoom meetings.Hopefully the same is true for wi throughout the area and that my, now ubiquitous, Zoom-accompanying glass of wine has stayed safely out of shot."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 30 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

That data is supported by further research, carried out specically in rural Scotland, which additionally showed higher support for onshore wind power among young people.#The question posed by the surveyor should, of course, have been: #Are you opposed to further development of onshore wind #In Scotland today we have , operational turbines# that#s more than the rest of the UK put together.We also have , consented  under construction and a further , in the planning system according to an FOI response from the Scottish Government.These figures change on an almost daily basis as applications continue to pile in unabated.How many people are going to continue to support onshore wind when they witness the total annihilation of this country It would also be interesting to know exactly where the data from #rural Scotland# was collected. Was it perhaps in an area where there were no wind farms in sight of  the local communities which were questioned but where they were still able to take advantage of any community benefit on offer If successful, the public petition recently submitted to the Scottish Parliament by campaign group Scotland Against Spin should help to clary exactly how much support there really is for further onshore wind development in Scotland.Aileen Jackson, Knockglass, UplawmoorSir,I have been contacted by a number of my justiably concerned constituents about the recent removal of a cattle grid on the Isle of Gigha from the road between the ferry jetty and the village.The space has been tarred over but I have been informed by residents that unfortunately the sub surface area was just grit and so the tar has subsided due to traffic including tractors and lorries. The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid which is now mangled metal has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged the roads department should replace them with new, fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last, but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials # such as this # left behind. If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads# management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,I am a GP in one of Argyll’s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I’d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH. I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had had an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local wi and  I cannot get G on my phone.Dr Carina Spink, MuasdaleSir,Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun’s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips, owners can help to protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun’s rays.Dr Sarah Elliott, Central Veterinary Officer, Cats Protection"},{"url":null,"title":"from cradle to grave","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

And their latest distancing act is to #temporarily suspend# public representation on its Integration Joint Board.I am coming to believe that this critical situation has overtaken long-held belief systems that need to be challenged.In NHS values, the first statement is #working together for patients.#That is well out of date increasingly the patient has been a participator in their care, and the duty of obtaining consent means you can’t have treatment without co-operation.This report goes on to make clear that #collaboration# is a key requirement. That means we are an essential part of the system.It seems clear that we are going to have to fight to get past the unconscious assumptions of decision makers.

We once again highlighted our concerns over a lack of immediate action on the crisis at the Rest and be ThankfulDear Roy and Hugh,I am writing in response to an official Transport Scotland email to the Rest and be Thankful Campaign on the April , where you have sought to answer several questions posed by us at our meeting with your officials and in subsequent emails to you both. We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states #we are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace# yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.We believe creating  options for consultation in November  and five further options for consultation in March was a time-wasting exercise. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report.A geological survey, which will take  months to complete, could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides.The email states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use#, yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for Transport Scotland which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in - weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay.It further declares that #we understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts#.While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment.This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside or people#s homes you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful. What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in Transport Scotland#s official reply or in recent press statements:If the next landslide, or subsequent ersion along the equally inadequate A, results in a fatality who will be held accountable Who is responsible for the social and economic impact on the people and businesses of Argyll while we wait another  years for something permanent to be done We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament.We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two km of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach.We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful.John Gurr, chairman, The Rest and be Thankful CampaignSir,Mental Health Awareness Week opened on Monday May  and we are inviting everyone to #ConnectWithNature to support their mental health.Spending quality time in and around nature can help to reduce stress and increase feelings of positivity, and you don’t have to be surrounded by fields or have to take a walk in the wilderness to feel the benefits.The Mental Health Foundation, which works to prevent mental health problems and has organised this awareness week for the past  years, encourages you to recognise and grow your connection with nature by sharing a photo, video or sound recording with your family and friends, and on your social media.Connecting with nature can really make a dference to your mental health, and now more than ever, it is time to look after yours.Julie Walters, actorSir,Alan Reid, Dunoon"},{"url":null,"title":"new crop of msps welcomed","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The content creator has a weighty , followers on Instagram, many of whom were gained over the last year alone. ldquoMy following grew massively during the pandemic, she explains, ldquowhereas it hadnrsquot grown that much in the last couple of years.One of the main reasons for this influx is Spiersrsquos dreamy, aesthetically pleasing interiors.ldquoI would think my niche, or my USP, is probably that I live quite a simple le ndash I view my content as being attainable but slightly aspirational.ldquoMy husband and I live in a three-bedroom tenement flat in the southside of Glasgow ndash itrsquos far from a mansion, but it has period detailing and wersquove done a lot of work to make it our own and inject our personality into it. Itrsquos also a style that is easy to replicate.ldquoIrsquom quite inspired by Southern Calornian style ndash lots of wood and greenery, earthy tones, and textures. I bring a lot of that into my home, I love rattan and a bit of s style. I think Irsquove created quite a colourful home that brings me a lot of joy.So, after being able to add TV presenter to her ever-growing CV, whatrsquos next for Spiers  ldquoWriting is my passion, she emphasises. ldquoI would love to write a book one day, a collection of essays, I think ndash thatrsquos something Irsquove always been leading up to.

So, throw open your windows, stock up on blossom-scented cleaning supplies and follow my steps for freshening up your home for spring hellipDeep clean and declutter:Spring is the perfect time to assess your home and see what you can donate or throw out. Irsquove made multiple trips to the recycling centre lately and it really has made a dference to my home ndash I know Irsquoll never be a minimalist, but it feels calming to have a little less clutter at least.Set aside an hour or so once a week to clear out your wardrobe, kitchencabinets and hallway cupboards.Reorganise sideboards and shelves, and get rid of anything you havenrsquot used or worn in a while ndash be ruthless! Then give everything a once-over as you go ndash spring cleaning is good for the soul.Have a room refresh:Changing the layout of a room and giving your home a bit of a rejig does wonders for making the space feel like new. Once or twice a year Irsquoll consider how I can switch up my spaces. Irsquoll move furniture, swap out soft furnishings, relocate the sofa to another position or change our spare room completely. Irsquoll even rework the gallery walls and artwork around my home. Itrsquos like redecorating but without spending a penny.Bring the outdoors:in Stock up on tulips, daffodils and peonies, and place bouquets around your home ndash on mantelpieces, sideboards, kitchen worktops and coffee tables. Irsquom a big fan ofgreenery in the home too ndash plants like Pothos, Monstera deliciosa and ZZ plants are so easy to take care of and really breathe a bit of le into a room. Irsquom all about the indoor jungle, so go wild with blooms and plants and your home will feel bright and breezy in no time.Consider a lick of paint:With so many fun paint brands launching lately , itrsquos easier than ever to add colour to your le. Opt for a fresh eucalyptus green to revive a bathroom, or pick a played-down pink for warmth. Go wild with it ndash paint a feature wall in your living room or section off a room with a dado rail and paint the lower section a bright shade. Bold colours never go out of style.www.katelavie"},{"url":null,"title":"10-best-museums-galleries-edinburgh-glasgow","story":"Kelvingrove Art Gallery And Museum, Kelvingrove, GlasgowOne of the gems in Glasgowrsquos art crown, Kelvingrove re-opens on Monday giving punters the chance to enjoy its world-beating collection.

Irsquove made multiple trips to the recycling centre lately and it really has made a dference to my home ndash I know Irsquoll never be a minimalist, but it feels calming to have a little less clutter at least.Set aside an hour or so once a week to clear out your wardrobe, kitchencabinets and hallway cupboards.Reorganise sideboards and shelves, and get rid of anything you havenrsquot used or worn in a while ndash be ruthless! Then give everything a once-over as you go ndash spring cleaning is good for the soul.Have a room refresh: Changing the layout of a room and giving your home a bit of a rejig does wonders for making the space feel like new. Once or twice a year Irsquoll consider how I can switch up my spaces. Irsquoll move furniture, swap out soft furnishings, relocate the sofa to another position or change our spare room completely. Irsquoll even rework the gallery walls and artwork around my home. Itrsquos like redecorating but without spending a penny.Bring the outdoors: in Stock up on tulips, daffodils and peonies, and place bouquets around your home ndash on mantelpieces, sideboards, kitchen worktops and coffee tables. Irsquom a big fan ofgreenery in the home too ndash plants like Pothos, Monstera deliciosa and ZZ plants are so easy to take care of and really breathe a bit of le into a room.

Opt for a fresh eucalyptus green to revive a bathroom, or pick a played-down pink for warmth. Go wild with it ndash paint a feature wall in your living room or section off a room with a dado rail and paint the lower section a bright shade.

Then, something caught his eye.He ran to Izzy: ldquoAunty, aunty, look what I found!He was holding a scarf.ldquoIt was hanging on a tree over there, he said.It was a short neck scarf, with Celtic interlacing design it looked new and unworn, possibly even handmade.ldquoI really love it aunty, can I keep it Izzy pursed her lips in thought.ldquoI dunno, Finn, someone may have dropped it and another person found it and placed it on the tree to keep it safe. Perhaps one of those walkers earlier. Maybe they will come back and look for it Finn wasnrsquot even half listening. He put the scarf on and rushed to the loch side to look at his reflection.ldquoIt would be safer round my neck surely  he called out.As he arranged the scarf, a folded piece of paper fell to the ground and landed by Finnrsquos feet. He picked it up, unfolded it and ran to Izzy, very excited.ldquoLook, the scarf is for me! he exclaimed.A worried look came over Izzyrsquos face as Finn handed her the piece of paper. There were beautully drawn Celtic designs, with images of what looked like faeries hiding in a wood.There was also a sleeping dragon curled round a heart shape in which there was handwriting: ldquoIf you have found me, and you like me, then Irsquom yours. Keep me safe, until itrsquos time to give me away.Izzy looked at Finn, nodded and smiled. ldquoSo it seems.ldquoI will never give this away! he insisted. He looked around at the trees and ed the gaze to his aunt.ldquoMaybe yoursquore right, aunty, maybe fairies do exist after all, at least here we are in the Highlands after all.He thought for a moment. ldquoOr maybe itrsquos just someone kind who likes to give presents.Finn headed back to the tree where hersquod found the scarf. He arranged twigs and broken bits of heather on the ground next to the tree and beckoned his aunt to come see.She looked down at what hersquod done. She didnrsquot immediately see it, but then realised that the twigs and heather formed letters.He carefully read it: ldquoThank you.ldquoThatrsquos lovely Finn, whoever left the scarf will see this and be very happy, Irsquom sure of it.Izzy looked up to the sky. The predicted rain was going to hold off.ldquoFinn, she said hesitantly, ldquowould you be up for a bit of an adventure ldquoYou mean a walk, donrsquot you ldquoKind of, aye, but this is to a place I have never been before, although Irsquove often seen it from a distance.ldquoHow far  asked Finn.Izzy pointed: ldquoJust there, where those old trees are. Itrsquos a small remnant of the old Caledonian forest, Irsquove often wanted to visit it but have never had the opportunity. Itrsquos not so far, but it might be a bit dficult to reach, Irsquove never explored it before.Finn wasnrsquot sure.Izzy helped him decide: ldquoIt might have a connection to the original Merlin.That sold it to him.ldquoWell, I have my boots, he smiled, ldquocan I lead the way So they set off in the direction of Coille Coire Chuic, a small remnant of the ancient Caledonian forest. Izzy let Finn decide on the route and as they neared the wood they arrived at the River Cononish. There was no obvious and safe way to cross, but Izzy was sure there was a small bridge downriver.The route got increasingly boggy and Izzy suspected Finn may want to give up, but instead he took the role of leader seriously and carefully planned each step, identying dryer patches and helping his aunt. They made slow progress, but with much hilarity as they balanced on small tufts of dry land surrounded by bog myrtle.Finn paused and listened. The noise of a waterfall could be heard ahead and he aimed for it. Izzy lagged behind to take in the beauty of the heather, which carpeted the ground with a blaze of purple and pink. The old Scots pines on the other side of the river looked magnicent, framed by the mountains beyond.She caught up with Finn, who was sitting on a rock watching the waterfall. It cascaded into a hidden pool, where the water twirled and bubbled asin a giant cauldron. Scots pine trees stood guard on the edge of it, one growing precariously from the overhanging rocks, its trunk curving upwards so its higher branches reached the sunlight. A gnarled rowan with vivid berries grew from the rocks on the other side, while on the opposite bank birch trees clung onto the steep side of the river, bent over like weeping willows.Finn wanted to sit awhile and so Izzy took it as an opportunity to make a brew for them both. He was beginning to understand that using her small camping stove was an important ritual for his aunt: the hissing sound, the waiting, the trail of steam, the anticipation it made a warm feeling, turned a wild place into home.They sipped tea together and shared well-earned snacks. Finn waited, expecting his aunt to tell a story. Finally, she did.ldquoSee that giant boulder over there, Finn, it was dropped by the giants who sculpted this land many years ago.ldquoLike with Samsonrsquos stone we saw Izzy nodded.Finn raised a cynical eyebrow and half a smile.ldquoHuge giants, Finn, a race called the Fomorians. The legend says they emerged from the sea long ago ndash grotesque troll-like creatures, incredibly powerful and cruel. Two of them made Rannoch Moor their home and they terrorised the people for miles around, destroying homes and taking livestock.ldquoNobody knew what to do, even the bravest and best warriors were defeated by them, ripped apart without mercy. Then a young lad about your age had his home destroyed by one of the giants, and in his grief he decided to rid the land of them.ldquoBut how could he do thateven the best warriors couldnrsquot Izzy gave him a wry smile, which he knew meant that was a good question and that she was just about to answer it.ldquoThe lad was wise. He had noticed how the two giants argued with each other about who was the stronger.ldquoSo he got them to fight each other ldquoKind of, he persuaded them to have a competition to see who could throw a stone furthest. They began hurling bigger and bigger stones, then they tore chunks of rock off the mountain sides. Soon the land was littered with boulders, and after three days the two giants were utterly exhausted.ldquoThen the young lad told one of the giants he had won, for he knew this would cause a fight. And so it did.ldquoThe giants fought each other with fury, using up what energy they had left. Finally, one gave the other a fatal blow, but it was the last thing he did, as he collapsed with total exhaustion.ldquoThey had killed each other ldquoYes, smiled Izzy, filling her cup with more tea and raising it. ldquoThatrsquos why the land around here is littered with all these huge stones.ldquoI know giants are mythological, aunty.Izzy sipped some tea.ldquoDepends what kind of giants you mean.Finn looked at the boulder.ldquoThe next tale is the gt of the sun, continued Izzy.ldquoAfter the death of the giants the land was bathed in sunshine, bringing new le.It became a green world, grass and plants grew, then trees arrived. The ancestors of this tree were first to arrive, she pointed to the nearby silver birch.ldquoOthers followed: the rowan, the aspen, alder and even oak. But it was these trees which made the forest canopy: Scots pines, also called Caledonian pines, an old name given to them by the Romans. Arenrsquot they a beautul tree Finn peered at the Scots pines around them.ldquoCreatures filled the forest with their songs, their roars, their grunting and howling the birds, bears, wolves, elk, deer and boar. Seven thousand years ago, where we sit we would have been amidst the Caledonian forest in its prime. Those trees over there are the descendants of that forest. If you sit with them and feel their presence, they will tell you their stories.Finn chuckled at his aunt, then explained why. ldquoYou are like Yoda! He defensively held up his hands to explain: ldquoNot the way you look, I mean the way you speak about things.Finn was a Star Wars fan. He had all three films on video at home and knew much of the dialogue by heart. He spoke to Izzy, mimicking Yodarsquos voice: ldquoSearch the force, le creates it, makes it grow, its energy surrounds us and binds us, luminous beings are we. Finn gently pinched Izzy on the shoulder, saying: ldquoNot this crude matter. You must feel the force around you, the tree, the rock, everywhere.Izzy laughed out loud, feeling rather flattered to be compared to one of Finnrsquos screen heroes. She thanked him for the compliment.Finn looked over at the old Scots pines on the other side of the river. He knew his aunt wanted to reach them and they were tantalisingly close, yet the river was too dangerous to cross.ldquoLetrsquos find a way to get there, he ventured.They packed up and followed the river, eventually finding a place to cross. They sat amidst the flowering heather under the canopy of old trees, near a clearing so a light breeze kept the midges at bay. As promised, Izzy spun legends of Merlin, but also other tales connected to the ancient forest: of Lailoken, the Picts and St Columba, and the sad tale of the last wolf. Finn added tales of his own, about Jedi Knights and what he could remember of the story of Tam Linn. The forest was both their theatre and audience. But there was a sense of melancholy in this wood, for something was missing: it was bereft of young trees. The old pines were missing their children.The walk back was much quicker and they arrived back at the car tired, but with a sense of achievement. It felt asthey had been in a dferent world.ldquoCan we camp tonight aunty  asked Finn. ldquoAnd have a campfire like the first night ldquoLetrsquos see how the weather holds and how we feel later, she replied, keeping options open.Food was now a priority and Izzy was keen to get away from the busyness of Tyndrum. Soon they were on their way, heading for Loch Tulla, where she planned to make their tea. She knew Ewen would already be at the Bridge of Orchy.

making it an lsquoancillaryrsquo centre which will only be used during major events or as back-up.The move will mean people arrested in East Lothian and Midlothian, who would have been taken into custody in the Midlothian station now face being transported to St Leonardrsquosin Edinburgh for lock-up.A meeting of East Lothianrsquos Police, Fire and Community Safety Scrutiny Committee, was told that the proposals would free up two additional local police officers for the county.However, concerns were raised by councillors about the additional journey time it would take for officers to transport people in custody to the Edinburgh station.Suzie Mertes, from Police Scotlandrsquos Criminal Justice Services ision, said that the number of people being taken into custody in Scotland had halved from , to , in recent timesand changes were being made as part of an annual review.She told the committee that providing custody services at St Leonardrsquos would be better for prisoners who might be vulnerable as more support services were available and would benefit local officers who were currently drafted in to ldquobackfill for custody officers when they were on leave.It was not made clear whether the decision to take custody officers away from Dalkeith would see opening hours of the station reduced or changed.However, Ms Mertes stressed that the custody facilities would not close completely and would be available for major events in the area or times when it was felt they were needed.And she said that current custody staff based at Dalkeith would be given the option to transfer their services to support local policing.She added: ldquoIn terms of Dalkeith, should someone need to be brought in for an interview it will be open.ldquoThis is a flexible model that will allow us to push and pull resources into Dalkeith when needed.Concerns were raised about the additional journey time for officers transporting prisoners to St Leonardrsquos for custody however, Ms Mertes said that the benefits outweighed the disadvantages, pointing out that officers could sometimes find themselves manning empty cells at Dalkeith when they could be spending time on local policing.Councillor Jim Goodfellow, committee convenor, said that the move could prove beneficial to those who found themselves spending a night in the cells as well.And the decision was welcomed by the committee convenor to downgrade Dalkeithrsquos custody centre from a full-time operation to lsquoancillaryrsquo.He said: ldquoThere are some concerns that there is movement towards the centre of Edinburgh but there may be some benefit for the poor souls taken into custody.ldquoIf they are released from Dalkeith, getting back to North Berwick is an absolute nightmare, whereasthey are released

It is a scenario that will be familiar to many Scottish voters, for this has been the  Days Later election for these pandemic times.Anything that involved coming within two metres of a stranger was out of the question . So cheerio doorstep debating, rallies, walkabouts, all the usual fun and games, and hello masks and Zoom.The battle began in routine fashion with the dissolution of the Scottish Parliament. Some MSPs were not seeking re-election, among them Ruth Davidson, who was leaving to spend more time with her ermine.For everyone  it was off to the constituency or region to prepare for government. Or,you were a Scottish Labour candidate, to prepare your excuses. With Anas Sarwar in charge there was a certain spring in the partyrsquos step, with the new leader even joining in with an outdoors exercise class dancing to Uptown Funk. Yes sir, he can boogie.Willie Rennie continued his quest to stage the most ridiculous photo op ever, with shots of the LibDem leader at a penguin parade, in a giant deckchair, and boxing. Not wishing to be left out, Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross continued his partyrsquos tradition of clambering on to the nearest military vehicle, in his case an armoured personnel carrier. And he wasnrsquot even campaigning in Castlemilk.Mr Ross received a lot of help from his predecessor, Ms Davidson, who even fronted the party political broadcast. Her omnipresence contrasted with the complete absence of Boris Johnson. Having said that wild horses wouldnrsquot keep him away, the Prime Minister preferred to stay in London and dodge questions about gold wallpaper rather than take his chances with rebellious Scots .Try as the parties did to generate excitement, the campaign was proving as empty and devoid of interest as Celticrsquos trophy cabinet. Then it happened. Cue movie trailer voice guy: ldquoThe sky darkened. Birds ceased singing. Jaws dropped. HE was back. And this time HE had brought a whole new party with him. After the initial shock of Alex Salmondrsquos , observers turned to more serious matters, like how to pronounce the Alba Partyrsquos name. Some said ldquoAlapa others ldquoWallopers. Mr Salmond came bearing the promise of a ldquosupermajority of independence-supporting MSPs who would make Johnson an offer he could not refuse.The media was delighted to see theof Mr Salmond, and reporters were soon asking SNP leader Nicola Sturgeonshe would work with her predecessor. Ms Sturgeon gave the impression she did not wish to be on the same continent as her old boss, never mind in coalition with him.The SNP leader conducted a lot of her campaign from her by-now-famous conservatory. FDR had his fireside chats, Nicola has natters in the greenhouse. Consensus had it that the election was in the bag for her. It only remained to be seenshe would win a majority, and which party would take second place to the SNP, the Conservatives or Labour.The TV debates gave voters a chance to see the party leaders in action.

But there doesnrsquot appear to have been any rebuke for the drugs deaths crisis, their failed education record, missed hospital waiting time targets, rising child poverty rates, the exam results scandal, or failures in local policing.The next Scottish Government has an opportunity over the next five years to make amends for past failures and getting caught up in an independence campaign will only take the SNPrsquos eye off the ball once again.However, the SNP did not win a majority in the election and as a minority government will require support from other parties to pass budgets and any major reforms.The Scottish Greens will likely prop up the SNP in future policy discussions, but this will requirepolicy trade-offs infor budget support.With COP firmly in the sights of both parties as an opportunity to showcase Scotland as a leader in tackling climate change on the global stage, will the Scottish Greens be willing to lend support to independence which could risk the SNP taking its focus off meeting its emissions reduction targets of % by  ndash which it has done for the past two years in a row.They have already said they want bold action from the Scottish Government and now they are in a position to bargain for this.Read more:Indyref and a blinkered green agenda could harm Scottish farmings futureDuring Sundayrsquos Andrew Marr programme, a suggestion of next spring to hold another referendum was put to the First Minister, to which, of course, she said she was contemplating. Nicola Sturgeon hasnrsquot officially committed to a timescale, other than the first half of the next parliamentary term, but it would appear that the media is setting the ball rolling by proposing such a timeline. As much as I have criticised the SNP for pedalling talks of Indyref during a pandemic, journalists are also guilty of fuelling the debate and diminishing print space or airtime for more immediate and pressing issues.Over the past week I have been moving into my new house, which has involved many hours of deep cleaning whilst tuned in to my radio and coverage of the election.Hats off to BBC Radio Scotland team for managing to fill three daysrsquo worth of election coverage with very little to report on other than the one major news story: would the SNP gain a majority Although they covered results and reaction across the entire country, the main topic on every reportersrsquo lips was whether the SNP would have a mandate to hold another referendum. So, for every listener tuned in, we are being told that this is the discussion we need to be having, this is the headline we should all be taking away.In between googling tutorials on how to sand kitchen worktops, I checked in to the community Facebook page for my local village and was struck by the fact that none of the members were remotely engaged in discussions over the election, let alone independence. Like many other communities across the country, this village is still in the grips of a pandemic, so quite understandably, most posts and discussions revolved around Covid advice and best practice, information about the local youth club reopening, as well as a series of church services.Read more:Scottish election: Indyref cant continue to dominate the next five years mdash there are bigger issuesMembers were posting aboutfitness camps and slots which had come available for hairdressers and beauty salons.

Entitled upside mimi #### u#op , it is her first permanent outdoor commission. It takes her familiar concerns and her traditional aesthetics into new territory. For once the video artistrsquos fantasies have been made concrete. Or plasterboard and wood at any rate.ldquoIt feels like an extension of what Irsquod done before, but the idea of making an outdoor sculpture is a challengeyou make videos, Maclean admits.Still, thatrsquos what she has done. Follow the hearts and you find a shop that,at first glance,is all primary colours. But then you see the dirt, the graffiti, the abandonment.ldquoI wanted a building thatrsquos a bit like a shop that has closed down, Maclean tells me as we take her creation in. ldquoI really liked the idea of a building in a forest, for it to have the Hansel and Gretel feeling of you coming across this candy-coloured building drawing you in, but then whatrsquos inside it is darker and more dficult than it seems on the surface.Well, indeed. Within is a building that is itself topsy-turvy and is home to an animated film about a character called Mimi, one which takes in fairy tales, magic mirrors , consumerism, fear of ageing and the corrosive effects of social media. Itrsquos asDavid Lynch directed a Disney cartoon.Maclean looks like she has just walked out of a cartoon herself. Over the years for her video work, she has dressed up as everything from anime characters, cartoon lions and unicorns, to germs. Today shersquos dressed in a yellow patterned coat and yellow boots. Her hair is blue, pink and yellow.ldquoI think whenever I come to sculpture parks and see permanent artworks I wonder, lsquoWhat that will look like  years from now  Maclean explains, ldquoOryou didnrsquot look after it. So, Irsquove almost worked that into it to an extent. It hopefully feels like itrsquos been here for quite a long time already.Filtered through Macleanrsquos baroque imagination, upside mimi #### u#op is a fairy tale for the Instagram generation. The work both feeds on and dissects the white noise of our social media-inflected world.ldquoI guess Irsquove been interested in what the internet does for quite a while, ldquoMaclean explains. ldquoI think there was a time for feminism when the internet seemed this really utopian thing. Disembodiment basically. You can go on and you can become something completely dferent, and you no longer need to be defined by your body and your gender and how you look. And that seemed great, a whole new conception of gender.ldquoBut the reality of the internet has bizarrely intensied our obsession with our bodies, despite effectively being a disembodied space.ldquoIrsquom interested in that feeling as a woman of visibility and invisibility, where sometimes therersquos a power to being visible and making non-conventional beauty something that is visible. But therersquos also a degree to which sometimes you feel like invisibility would be a comfort.Based in Glasgow, Maclean grew up in Dollar in Clackmannanshire, which looked at in a certain way, might be a fairy tale background in itself. ldquoI guess Dollar is an almost chocolate-box Scotland, Maclean agrees. ldquoItrsquos got the hills and the glens and the castle and all of that stuff that as a tourist you might expect to find in Scotland. There is a fantasy aspect to it as a place.Her love of dressing up was apparent from childhood. That didnrsquot make her a show-off, she says. ldquoIrsquom quite shy. But Irsquove always liked dressing up. One of my earliest memories was dressing up as a popcorn box for the Dollar Gala, which is maybe when I discovered some part of my personality that has been dficult and useful. I get quite obsessed with an idea and then Irsquove just got to do it. I just had to be the popcorn box and it was this obsession for at least a month and then I did it and I was like, lsquoOh, well, itrsquos okay.rsquoRead More: Jock McFadyen on sex and violence and ScotlandHer work has what you might call a gendered aesthetic it is drawn to textures and colours and ideas that draw on popular notions of femininity. But itrsquos an act of both interrogation and reclamation.ldquoI think I get beyond the surface of things a wee bit, especially with this kind of imagery, this feminine aesthetic, which is fed to children and little girls,ldquoArtistically, itrsquos often treated as being not serious enough, almost not masculine enough of an aesthetic to make work. For me I think itrsquos almost a political thing to take that world we are all familiar with and really delve into it a bit more. There is an aspect to it that works to suck you in, it does something to you that you just feel like, lsquoI want this.rsquo Or it does to me.The implication is that itrsquos imagery thatrsquos not taken very seriously because itrsquos girly, un-masculine in some way. This is something Maclean feels the need to battle against the idea that masculinity equals seriousness.ldquoI think I am aware as an artist thatyou are a woman and you make masculine work you are liable to be taken more seriously thanyou make more feminine work.In other words, masculinity is signicant, while femininity can be labelled silly or frivolous.ldquoI am politically interested in that because I think it challenges people to work out why they would normally dismiss that aesthetic. I think it can be dismissed as, lsquoOh, itrsquos silly.rsquoldquoButyou dig a bit deeper, itrsquos a larger dismissal of female experience and this idea that for women to have power they have to ape masculinity, and femininity needs to be abandoned.She has no intention of doing so. Indeed, Macleanwants to take it further. She is currently working on a script for a feature film, suggesting shersquos ready to follow in the footsteps of Steve McQueen who has alreadymorphed from artist to filmmaker.ldquoI at least want to try it once, Maclean says. ldquoIrsquove had to learn quite a lot about it. Video art is supposed to break rules. Thatrsquos what itrsquos there for almost. Thatrsquos the expectation you take to it.ldquoBut with a feature film you have almost got to fit it into a pre-existing structure or  people wonrsquot even recognise it as a feature film.

Sitting in the Macbobrsquos main auditorium with my sister-in-law I looked around to see two other people in the audience. Four seats filled in a venue that could hold, in pre-socially distanced times, . Such were the times.I didnrsquot really care much for the movie, an overengineered high-concept thing, to be honest. But it was good to be in a cinema again. Especially this cinema. This was where I did most of my student film-going back in the s. In more recent years Irsquove seen films in its smaller, custom-made cinema, but on this night we were in the larger theatre which was where my younger self had sat all those years ago.I spent a lot of time during Tenet thinking about the times Irsquod sat in this room before. The filmrsquos central idea ndash of two dferent time streams travelling in reverse directions and intersecting ndash only encouraged it.I found myself wondering thatI sat there long enough I might catch a glimpse of my younger self, sitting in this same cinema nearly  years before when I was a student, at a Saturday morning matinee of the s sci-fi movie Forbidden Planet, surrounded by kids, sitting beside a girl I was totally smitten with, who, in the timestream that was running forward from that moment, would later become my we.That thought ndash of being back in the same room in  with the person I loved most in the world but who had died in  ndash made the night worthwhile, evenI didnrsquot care much for the movie.In the absence of movie-going over the last year Irsquove been thinking a lot since last September about how cinema was at the heart of our relationship, and how our first days together were spent in the dark.The first time Irsquod ever had a proper talk with Jeanie was about the movies. A late-night conversation in the kitchen about an old screwball murder mystery wersquod both seen that summer called A Night to Remember, starring Loretta Young and Brian Aherne, a chat interrupted when a fellow student came in from a night out spent drinking Pernod and black and hiccupped up his evening all over the table. A few weeks later watching Paul Schraderrsquos Cat People at the Allanpark cinema in Stirling I watched Ed Begley Jr get his arm chewed off by a black leopard. In the film the blood washed across the floor and over Nastassja Kinskirsquos shoes just like the Pernod and Black across the table, I remember thinking.Those first few months with Jeaniewere spent at the movies. Afternoons and evenings all spent in the dark. Some days wersquod make a day of it, travelling through to Falkirk and the ABC cinema in the afternoon and then back to Stirling for an evening showing. We even watched the films now and then.Trashy horror was our favourite, though, thinking back, Irsquom not sure how appropriate The Entity ndash a lurid film in which Barbara Hershey is molested by an invisible demon, unmakeable nowndash really was as a date movie.Itrsquos a pretty normal pattern for a love story, isnrsquot it  Itrsquos what couples did, still do, . In Phantom Empire, his  book about cinema and its impact on us, the cultural commentator Geoffrey OrsquoBrien asks at one point, ldquoWhat did people do, anyway, before there were movies  Well, exactly.Cinema was our idea of fun. It was a pattern set in both our childhoods. Jeanie always told me that she had left the Brownies after she came home to find that her dad and her sister had gone to see Krakatoa, East of Java without her.Irsquod grown up in Northern Ireland watching Disney movies, James Bond films and Zulu at the local fleapit . I remember taking an Action Man pistol with me to see Jaws for reassurance.Irsquod go and see films and then rush back the next night to see them again. Good films, bad films, indferent films. Even the much-maligned  version of King Kong .Years later Irsquod tell its star Jeff Bridges that Irsquod seen it more than once. I think, I said, it might have been because of Jessica Lange. ldquoYeah, he agreed, laughing, ldquoit might have had something to do with her.Cinema was always a desire machine. The sex symbols of the th century were film stars . From Rudolph Valentino to Marilyn Monroe, and James Dean right up to Scarlett Johansson.Marilyn Monroe in Some Like It HotBut it was always about more than sex. The critic Molly Haskell writing in Film Commentrsquos new weekly newsletter the other week quoted Susan Sontag on the post-war embrace of the idea of the movies as art, ldquoborn of a conviction that cinema was an art unlike another: quintessentially modern, distinctively accessible poetic and mysterious and erotic and moral hellip That was still the case in the s and s when we started watching. In time, we fell in love with Chinarsquos Fth Generation filmmakersand the outrageousness of early Almodo.But cinema also offered what it has always offered a dream of escape, of lives unlived of glamour and aspiration at times. And also fear and anxiety and the thrill chill of the dark. A spectacle shared with other people sitting in the dark.Therersquos an electric thrill when a film is good to share it with an audience. The collective rush of it. Sometimes the audience are irritating, of course. Sometimes, they are the only fun. I remember watching some second-rate movie in New York. The rest of the audience were really into it, however, cheering and whooping at every action sequence. They made the movie more entertaining than it really was.And now here we are, after a year without movies, more or less . Therersquos a lot of hot air talked about how the pandemic might be the end of cinema. I donrsquot really buy it. It will take cinemas time to come to terms with the new situation as they are allowed to reopen, but audiences will .Cinema is changing, of course. In , Geoffrey OrsquoBrien could write with confidence, ldquoThe camera prowls around the room. This is how the eye works at the end of the twentieth century, after a hundred years of training.Does it still, nearly  years later  Do we have the patience to follow the camera around the room  Perhaps not. But then cinema has been changing throughout its history ndash from silent to sound, from movie palace to Cineworld box ndash and still it thrives. In , there were  million UK cinema admissions earning pound, million in box office takings. We may take some time to feel confident to , but we will. Because itrsquos a dferent experience to sitting in front of your laptop or TV screen.TenetThere are so many new films I want to see. Dune, Chloe Zhaorsquos take on Marvelrsquos Eternals, Baz Luhrmannrsquos Elvis movie , Edgar Wrightrsquos Last Night in Soho, Jessica Chastain in The Eyes of Tammy Faye, Jordan Peelersquos take on Candyman, Wes Andersonrsquos The French Dispatch, Jane Campionrsquos Power of the Dog, Celine Sciamarsquos Petite Maman. All will turn up on streaming services, sooner or later. But to see them in the cinema is still the ultimate viewing experience. Size still matters.The last film I took Jeanie to see, a few weeks before her death, was Crawl, about a Florida hurricane and man-eating alligators. She loved a good scary movie. I am inordinately fond of this film now because it was the last time I got to sit in a cinema and hold her hand.I will never be able to do that again. But I can go and sit in the dark again. I can go and watch a movie and dream about the past and the future and lives lived and unlived.

The Greens would exert such demand for their support that no responsible First Minister, which Ms Sturgeon most certainly is, could possibly agree to them.Furthermore, there is no way that Scotland could be viable economically on its own. Nor could Scotland be part of the European Union. For a start, Spain would veto such a proposal. Over the years Scotland has received enormous subsidies from Europe to develop its infrastructure. The EU, therefore, would hardly welcome a country which it would have to subsidise. Then again there would undoubtedly be a hard border with England. This would result in problems currently being encountered in Ireland and in England.However, the status quo may not be the only alternative. Clearly the time has come for the four home nations to get together and draw up a new constitution, probably on federal lines. Lets all get together and find ways of keeping together for the common good.W Findlay, Bishopbriggs.IS THE BORDER REALLY FIXED I READ with interest David Leasks article . Whilst it is debatable how realistic a threat this is , it is worth noting that in February , SNP MSP Christine Grahame called for Berwick upon Tweed to be given the opportunity to become part of Scotland, should Scotland become independent. Alex Salmond laterannounced that he would make the necessary representations to Westminster should this occur.It would seem that neither side considers the Scottish English border to be particularly \"fixed\".Gavin David Bell, Lanark.* I TAKE issue with Leaskrsquos mention of Orkney and Shetland remaining with rUKScotland chooses independence. The people of these islands, offered a democratic choice among Scotland, rUK and Norway, would probably opt for Norway. Look at an atlas this makes sense.The Declaration of Arbroath , a beloved icon of the SNP, was signed by Scottish barons ndash the posh people, many of Norman origin ndash when Orkney and Shetland were under Norwegian jurisdiction.William Durward, Bearsden.NO EVIDENCE ON IRAN CLAIMSI SEARCHED in vain for any evidence produced by Struan Stevenson in his article about Iranian interference in the recent Scottish elections . He posits only possibilities, rumour and comment as proof of such interference.The Henry Jackson Society has been discredited as a right-wing, neo-conservative outfit which suggests to me that, where Scottish independence is concerned, some bias might be evidenced in its findings.I also must question Mr Stevensons examples of the Scottish Government kowtowing to \"the mullahs\" ndash the use of this phrase itself suggestive of a less than neutral view being opined. It is strange that Mr Stevenson describes Alex Salmond in , in his role as SNP International Affairs and Europe spokesman, as somehow kowtowing to Iran whilst the record shows the UK Government trade deals with Iran amounted to some pound million during .Mr Stevensons assertions relating to the First Ministers invitations to participate in the ious Ahl Al Bait conferences merely highlight that no matter what decision she took, she was wrong in Mr Stevensons opinion.Whilst I appreciate it must be dficult for Mr Stevenson to accept the SNPs landslide victory, he really should check his facts before giving vent to surmise and gossip.Eileen Michael, Ralston.UNION BLINKERS SEEM TO BE ONI AM intrigued to observe that there appears to be a condition which could be described as blinkered vision suffered by those advocates of the Union which is the United Kingdom.I listened to Alister Jack, the Conservative Secretary of State for Scotland, listing the many massive benefits that Scotland gts to the UK. The list was long and the praise effusive. It merely confirmed to me the signicant assets which Scotland enjoys. These would of course benefit an independent Scotland and their loss would cause serious economic pain to an rUK state.However, when I read the contributions from the unionist supporters in the Letters Pages, I seem to see a completely dferent picture. It would appear that these unionists can only see a Scotland bereft of any assets perpetually going cap in hand to beg the largesse of the English-controlled Westminster Parliament. They see no connection between  years of belittlement of Scottish aspirations and what reads like obviously deep-rooted feelings of inadequacy.It is therefore apposite to point out that they also fail to see the major failings of the NHS in England which are at record levels while incessantly criticising the NHS in Scotland. There are many other instances which makes me think it is actually a definable psychological condition. Hopefully time will bring a cure.David Stubley, Prestwick.LET THE OTHERS VOTEIF we are forced by the SNP to endure yet another referendum regarding Scotlandrsquos independence from the UK I believe the following points need to first be considered.Nicola Sturgeon has repeatedly said that Scottish people should determine their countryrsquos future, so why does she not propose to allow Scots currently living in another part of the UKto vote for the future of their country  This exclusion is particularly hurtful given that non-UK citizens just arrived in the country would be allowed to have their say.If the union between Scotland and the rest of the UK is to be questioned in a referendum, it could well be argued that all UK citizens should be consulted. Scotland is not a British colony seeking independence but is a closely integrated partner within a highly successful union of nations. There can be few Scottish residents that donrsquot have family members living in other parts of the UK and surely everybodyrsquos view should count on whether they should be separated by a hard national border.Jim Duncan, Monmouth, Wales.Read more: Thanks for showing that Johnson and Patel do not act for us"},{"url":null,"title":"took-12-years-build-wall-tradesmen-even-worse","story":"No one could have taken the last named seriously. ldquoHail, Rab! ldquoAye, right.As usual with the irritating past, therersquos no definitive explanation as to how the wall came to be known as Graham. It seems to have started off, in medieval times, as Grymisdyke or Grymersquos Dyke, this being an older or northern version of Graham. If you were Graham, it was Grym up north.But who was Graham  Well, according to the medieval chronicler John of Fordun, he might have been the grandfather of an ancient king called Eugenius. There was a Gryme who allegedly stormed the wall in the th century AD, when it was still supposedly of use to those living south of it.One Robert Graham also crops up in an inscription dated rather dodgily to , and thought to be a forgery. Certainly, it has no connection to Roman times, as there werenrsquot any Rab Grahams around then. RAB:Billy Connolly: lsquoIrsquom the only guy I know who died in a f*****g Muppet moviersquoI was also discomfited to discover that Graham or Graeme was a nickname for the devil in parts of Scotland ndash kinda puts old Satanrsquos gas at a peep like being called Harry or Bernard ooh, scary! So, that would make it Devilrsquos Dyke. Griacutemr or Grim are also handles for Odin or Woden, who were considered devils by Christians.At any rate, as walls go, Graham is seen as a poor manrsquos Hadrian, with much of that perception due to the fact that little of it survived, which is what happens when you use turf and wood rather than stone like that big fancy effort  miles south.I should say this is more of a Roman than a Scottish icon. If yoursquove never heard of the Romans I can exclusively reveal they were a ghastly bunch of fascists who tried to militarise the world. Their only saving grace was that the peoples they conquered were often even worse, though hopelessly disorganised.Emperor Antoninus Pius ordered the wall to be built as a northern frontier against the barbarians . You might ask why the Romans decided to stop there rather than going the whole hog. If yoursquore a common or garden anti-Scottish Scot, you say: ldquoThey could have taken all of Scotlandthey wanted to but there was too much forest and stuff. Naw. They couldnae. It was an ever-expanding empire. They didnrsquot say: ldquoDrsquoyou know what, I think wersquoll just stop here. And the whole of Britain was forest. They built a wall there to stop themselves getting skelped. RAB:Declaration of Arbroath. Scottish icons by Rab McNeilConstruction began in AD and went on for  years, which sounds astheir tradesmen were even worse than ours until you factor in that it was  miles long, stretching right along todayrsquos Central Belt from Old Kilpatrick in the west to Borsquoness in the east.The number of forts along it is put iously as  or , and there were also nine fortlets, built especially for shorter people.The wall was ft high and ft wide, with a deep ditch on the northern side. It was constructed by the soldiers of three legions ndash the nd Augustan, th Victorious and th Victorious Valerian . Itrsquos thought that these fellows were mostly auxiliary troops, drawn from across the Empire, often from places with better climates. They must have had a blast, living in leather tents or wooden huts and singing morosely through the rain at the end of another dayrsquos labour: ldquoAll in all, itrsquos just another turf in the wall.There were around , soldiers stationed at the wall, and itrsquos not known what they did all day other than marching up and doon, like these goons guarding things that you see in movies. Some would be training or mending tools or just sitting about the bath-house gossiping. A board game was found in Bearsden, where many people still play bridge today. RAB:How did we end up with the Saltire as our national flag Other items have been found, such as altars and childrenrsquos shoes, which are more interesting than that usual standby from archaeology: pottery. They must have had a lot of evening classes in the subject back in ancient times.Some lucky archaeologists who get to examine ancient poop have found that the soldiersrsquo diet was mainly vegetarianand consisted of stuff like figs, herbs, berries and nuts. Ooh, yummy.They werenrsquot vegetarians on ethical grounds. A distance slab found at Bridgeness, West Lothian, depicts a bull, a pig and a sheep being led to sacrice, with musicians drowning out their screams.The Romans, precursors of western civilisation, believed that offering animals to their gods brought good fortune. This was because, like all people in the past, they were nutters. So were their gods.Another  shows Britons being trampled, speared and beheaded, the last thought to display contempt for the Celtic veneration of folksrsquo nappers.That distance slab can be seen in the National Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh, but most others are in Glasgow Universityrsquos Hunterian Museum. Theyrsquore said to constitute the best collection of sculpture from any Roman frontier.The wall didnrsquot stop the Caledonians from congregating outside shouting, ldquoCome and have a goyou think yoursquore hard enough, before legging it at the first sign of a door in the wall opening.Antoninus Pius died in AD and never even visited his stupid wall, which was abandoned just nine or  years after its completion, having been a monumental waste of everybodyrsquos time and effort.

Nevertheless, Irsquom increasingly concerned about the relationship between humans and animals. The unease has been sharpened by recent barbaric footage, released by Animal Equity UK, of piglets allegedly being hammered to death on the concrete floor of an Aberdeenshire farm. Hollywood actor Karen Gillan has shared the footage with her . million followers, first warning them it is ldquovery upsetting. A quick trawl of the internet suggests that similar mistreatment is not unknown at farms and abattoirs up and down the country.The current crop of farming programmes possibly presents a cuddly and sanitised version of modern animal husbandry. The stars of programmes such as This Week on the Farm, Our Yorkshire Farm, This Farming Le and Our Farm in the Dales unquestionably care deeply about their livestock and tend them well. Nevertheless, therersquos a lingering suspicion they are not entirely typical. None of the programmes feature the massive agri-businesses that rely on intensive methods that involve overcrowding and severely restricting the freedom and movement of animals. The programmes offer few,any, insights into the transport of cattle, pigs and lambs or the reality of what happens to them at the slaughter facility. These are sentient creatures that experience pain and fear just as we do. There are those in the industry who tell us the animals are cheerfully unaware of what is about to happen when they are at the abattoir. The obvious question being, how can they be so sure  The animals certainly canrsquot tell us. Foodies and restaurant reviewers paint equally unconvincing pictures of lambs and the like leading full and happy lives gambolling on the sunlit uplands. Aye right. There is a spectrum of philosophical argument about the rights and wrongs of raising and killing animals for meat. At one end are those who contend it violates the animalsrsquo absolute rights and interests. At the other, are those who argue without meat-eating humans, the animals wouldnrsquot be alive in the first place. Which dodges the slight ethical issue of the quality andof that le.Food and travel writer, AA Gill, had no moral scruples about eating meat. He famously declared that he would ldquoeat anything that didnrsquot have a birth certicate, which suggested he would have happily dined on dog or cat meat. In purely philosophical terms, therersquos no dference between eating a sensitive and intelligent pig and eating Rover or Kitty. They probably taste like chicken. If humans donrsquot buy into ethical arguments against meat eating, how about a bit of self-interest  In industrial-scale agriculture, antibiotics are routinely used to prevent the spread of disease amongst closely confined cattle. They are also used to breed larger and more quickly growing animals. Unsurprisingly, there is increasing evidence that over use of antibiotics in farm animals is contributing to their reduced effectiveness in the treatment of human infections. Only last year the World Health Organisationwarned, ldquowe are heading for a post-antibiotic era, in which common infections and minor injuries can once again kill.Read more:Old time politics were enriched by the lost art of hecklingOur track record in heeding such warnings is not good. We largely ignored the lessons of the  outbreak of Avian influenza, summed up in Dr Michael Gregerrsquos  book, Bird Flu: A Virus of Our Own Hatching. The Australian Animal Justice Party estimates that  per cent of infectious diseases are zoonotic, transferring directly from animals and insects to humans. Such transference may well have been linked to outbreaks of Ebola and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome . Itrsquos suspected the latter transferred from camels to humans. BSE, the so-called ldquomad cow disease, was linked to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. The WHO has warned, ldquowild animals are the source of % of all emerging infectious diseases in humans, many of which are caused by novel viruses. Professor David Benetar of Cape Town University writing in the NY Times has warned: ldquoSimply put, the coronavirus epidemic is a result of our gross maltreatment of animals.\" There is a similarity between SARS-CoV - and a virus found in pangolin, one of the worldrsquos most illegally trafficked animals. Pangolin were possibly the intermediary or amplier of the virus spreading between bats and humans.Read more:Covid recovery: Forget Eat Out to Help Out, it should be Get Out to Work OutThe WHO commissioned report, ldquoCovid-: Make it the Last Pandemic, has much to say about the ways in which poor communication, inadequate leadership and lack of transparency all contributed to the spread and extent of the coronavirus pandemic. It has disappointingly little to say about tackling the root causes of the pandemic, including human encroachment on the habitats of wild animals and the existence of wet markets in Asia and Africa. Affluent countries are playing Russian Roulette with zoonotic disease. We rely on our relative wealth and science to come up with ldquojust in time vaccines to respond to the threat they pose.

It really lays the biological foundation and structure for connecting to other people.A hug releases endorphins too Hugs can stimulate a particular set of nerves that trigger the release of endorphins - small molecules that are part of the bodys pain control system and produce an opiate-like analgesic effect. Robin Dunbar, Professor of Evolutionary Psychology at the University of Oxford, said: ldquoBecause our feelings of psychological pain are processed in the same brain regions as our feelings of physical painhellipendorphins dampen our psychological pain. Thatrsquos why a hug is comforting when someone is in tears.It goes back to primates Professor Dunbar added of research he conducted: ldquoWe used a form of brain imaging known as positron emission tomographyto show that light stroking of the torso triggers a massive endorphin response in the human brain - just as grooming does in monkeys and apes.Not everyone will be ready, though As the vaccine programme continues its roll-out across the United Kingdom and the lockdown restrictions gradually ease, confidence grows, but not everyone will be feeling ready to jump back out into the world andto the way things were.So, when do you knowa hug is acceptable Dr Wendy Ross, the director of the Center for Autism and Neuroersity at Jefferson Health in Philadelphia, told the New York Times a top tip is simply to ask: ldquoSome people like hugs, some donrsquot.

How  could the delay in imposing travel sanctions between the UK and India be explained,not by considering that BoJo was keen as mustard to fly there later that month to strike a post-Brexit trade deal with Prime Minister Narendra Modi As Boris sat on his hands, at least , people travelled from India to the UK before the brakes were applied.

But surely the fact that India was being ravaged by a catastrophic surge in coronavirus infections ndash much more than Bangladesh and Pakistan, which were placed on the red list in early April ndash should have been enough to raise alarm bells  Marr presented Hancock with a bar chart showing how much higher the number of Covid- infections were in India at that point compared to Bangladesh and India. ldquoThis data is the wrong way of looking at it, Hancock said, before explaining to us silly little laypeople that actually, according to his data, three times as many people arriving in the UK from Bangladesh and Pakistan were testing positive for Covid at the border compared to those coming from India.

The fact the former Swansea City and Liverpool manager joined a mid-table English outfit, not an Arsenal, a Cha or a Manchester United, simply exacerbated the pain. Hence the acidic mediocrity message.The past two and a bit years, though, has shown that Rodgers has actually swapped immortality for, er, even more immortality.:John Kennedy: Managing Celtic is dficult and exhausting - but its been the greatest honour of my leThe Northern Irishman has worked wonders at the King Power Stadium. He guided them to fth place in the Premier League and the Europa League during his first full season in charge. They are currently in third place in the top flight down south with two games remaining and have an excellent chance of reaching the Champions League group stages.Then on Saturday he became the first man in the  year history of the East Midlands club to lead them to FA Cup glory when his charges beat Cha - at Wembley. What was that about mediocrity again If the late, great Bill Shankly ndash whose famous comment to Jock Stein in the Estadio Nacional in Lisbon after Celtic had beaten Inter Milan - in the European Cup final in  has entered football folklore ndash had been present in the dressing room afterwards he might well have remarked: ldquoBrendan, yoursquore an immortal now.:Joy of six: John Kennedy hopeful Celtic sextet can make Scotland squad for Euro  despite trophyless seasonIt will be interesting to see what Rodgers does going forward from here. Has he hit a glass ceiling at Leicester  Will he feel he needs to move on again to achieve more of his ambitions in football  Or does he think he can make the Foxes into genuine Premier League and possibly even Champions League contenders It will be little surprisehe is targeted by an Arsenal, a Manchester United or a Spurs. The fluent French, Italian and Spanish speaker could potentially interest an overseas outfit too and may be tempted to go abroad. It all depends what offers he receives and what whets his appetite.Celtic fans were irked by the fact that Rodgers left before a third consecutive treble had been secured. That Leicester paid a cool poundm to lure him and his coaching staff away was ignored. For them, he was a traitor, a fraud, a rat.:Stephen Glass outlines when Scott Brown will start as Aberdeen player-coach after Celtic swansongBut he had grown frustrated by the financial restrictions he was working under here and the inability to take his side any further. Relations with the hierarchy were strained to say the least. A parting of the ways was best for both parties.He probably knew, too, he would never be considered by a major English club while he was coaching in Scotland regardless of his past experience. Leicester, as we have witnessed, was far too good an opportunity for him to turn down.The circumstances of his exit were certainly unfortunate, but the upward trajectory that both club and manager have been on since, not to mention the dficulties his former employers have encountered, have more than vindicated his contentious decision.AND ANOTHER THINGCongratulations to the Lowland League clubs for voting to allow Celtic and Rangers colts teams into the ision next season ndash a move that finally brings Scottish football into line with the majority of progressive European football nations yearsnot decades after it should have happened.The furore over this straightforward proposal has made you despair for the game in this country. Why should we develop kids for the Old Firm  This is an affront to all ambitious clubs in the pyramid set-up! What about sporting integrity  Aye been! The wailing and gnashing of teeth was depressing, pathetic and at times infantile.What possible chance do we have of improving the standard of player here or the overall productWorld War III breaks out whenever anyone has the temerity to suggest that, hey, perhaps we should try something just a little bit dferent and see how it works out.There is concrete evidence it will benefit Scotlandrsquos most promising prospects as well as lower league clubs.Would Rangers right back Nathan Patterson have made the same impact this seasonhe had not squared up to senior clubs in the Tunnockrsquos Caramel Wafer Challenge Cup  Exposure to that level of competition unquestionably helped him make the step up effortlessly. He is now being touted for a place in the Scotland squad for the Euro  finalsPatterson featured against in the last eight of that competition against Wrexham last season in front of , supporters. That was more fans than the other three quarter-finals attracted combined. In fact, it was nearly double. So it will increase crowds, generate much-needed income and could interest a potential sponsor. Whatrsquos not to like Nobody is suggesting this will be a panacea to all of the ills of the sport here. Playing an Edinburgh University student or a part-time Dalbeattie Star centre half is hardly going to turn an aspiring professional into Lionel Messi overnight.

The latest is the result of a collaboration with Smart DCC, one of CGIrsquos clients, and is designed to help children understand how homes are powered and how energy use can be reduced to help save the environment.An activity pack based on the theme of smart homes and smart meters may sound a slightly dry topic but, like all the packs, it introduces the subject in a fun way and lets children understand how using items like their consoles has a financial and environmental cost.CGI has involved other organisations and charities in the development of previous packs but this is the first official collaboration with a client. Three packs are planned with Smart DCC in total, with the first on smart homes going live a fortnight ago and the second on renewables expected early next month.ldquoThe first pack has gone down really well and it is good to work with Smart DCC because they offer a dferent perspective and a bit more in depth detail behind the processes involved in smart home technology, said content designer Luke Kittow of CGI.CGI has been working with Smart DCC for a number of years now, principally on the technology behind smart meters, the small digital dials that track the energy use of a household.ldquoThe main aim is to reduce energy use and help save the environment at the same time, and this is something that is really emphasised within the pack, said Kittow. ldquoIt shows how you can make your home smarter by monitoring what you are using.As well as the packs being created with Smart DCC, there are others planned on sport and BAME topics.CGI expects the collaborations to boost the reach of the packs further and engage an even wider audience. They are already used by schools on a regular basis.ldquoWe have had really good feedback from councils, primary and secondary schools and it is great to see the programme continuing with our clients becoming involved, Kittow said.He said the response to the packs was far greater than he had ever imagined when they were first conceived as a way of easing the monotony experienced by children stuck at home when the coronavirus pandemic hit the UK.ldquoThe response has been amazing andanything the programme seems to have been given a new lease of le over the last few months even though le is going back to normal, said Kittow.STEM from Home was born from the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathscamps that CGI had been running before the lockdowns in UK schools and communities to encourage students to think about a STEM career.When the first lockdown was announced, it was decided to try and recreate the camps online and, incredibly, CGI managed to have STEM from Home up and running within two days.It was initially launched internally but went down so well that, after just the first week, staff asked to share it with family, friends and clients.As the demand was there, CGI decided to make it accessible online for anyone to use, with new content released every week to keep kids engaged.ldquoAlthough we do community outreach this is on a completely dferent scale. The reach of it has been immense, said Kittow.Environment is a theme that comes up in the packs repeatedly and CGI is committed to achieving net zero by  with respect to carbon emissions under its direct and indirect control.DCCrsquos Chief Operating Officer, Penny Brown said: ldquoIf every household took action on energy efficiency today, we could achieve  per cent of the UKrsquos  carbon target, and I can think of no better way than to mobilise the people that will benefit most from this action ndash our children.ldquoWe worked with CGI to develop these educational packs to help children understand and get involved in the digital energy revolution today, in the hope that this work would inspire the next generation of green energy innovators. At the DCC we believe in making Britain more connected, so we can all lead smarter, greener lives.TASK- SMART HOMESTHE STEM from Home Smart Homes pack explains that what smart homes are, how a smart meter works and how homes are powered.The pack points out to children that their homes may already be smarter than they think ndash as they may already have smart speakers like Alexa, Google or Siri who can tell them facts from the internet, what the weather is like, play music and can also turn off the lights and close the blinds.Coffee can be brewed on an instruction from a smart phone and the house can be cleaned using robot vacuum cleaners.In this pack children learn all about smart meters, how they work and the benefits of having them in the home.In the activity section they are given examples of smart meter data and asked to find out how much money is saved by turning the lights off or how much is spent by watching TV.The pack then asks them to think about the advantages and disadvantages of using electricity and to find out how solar, water and wind power work.They are given a picture of a kitchen and askedthey can spot how the owner can reduce their energy use.Children are also asked to design their own smart home and think about the technology they will use, how it will be powered, how they will dispose of waste and what security they might use.Their designs can be hand-drawn, made as a model or designed virtually using software such as PowerPoint or Blender.cgi uk stem-from-home---------------------------------------TASK - SMART CITIESTHE programme also includes a pack on Smart Cities which explains how they work and the technology used to improve services such as transport and waste collection.They aim to reduce environmental impact and increase the quality of le for citizens and visitors.Children learn how technology such as smart sensors around the city gather data in real time in order for the city ldquoto understand the behaviour and needs of its residents. The insights collected from the data are then communicated with organisations such as councils who use them to create solutions and improve operations.The pack explains that car emissions are one of the biggest issues that cities face when trying to become more environmentally friendly.The activity included in the pack is to create a poster to encourage people to walk or cycle to work or school, instead of driving.Suggestions for the poster include listing the benefits of walking and cycling to the city and to the inidual, such as cost savings, improving the environment as well as physical and mental health.The poster can be created digitally using Raspberry Pirsquos HTML CSS Wanted activity or hand drawn.Children are also asked to find out all the major advantages of Smart Cities, whether there are any drawbacks andany exist already.The technical activity in the pack is to create a simple house from a single block.In order to do so, participants need a desktop or laptop computer capable of running Blender and will learn how to design basic D and D assets.cgi uk stem-from-home"},{"url":null,"title":"shetland-hold-first-pride-event","story":"The event which is being welcomed by the council is being seen as a chance for members of the LGBT in the isles to come together.A committee is being formed that will help organise the event which will see Shetland Pride registered as a charity before the event next summer.Speaking to the BBC, the founder of Shetland Pride, Kerrie Meyer said: \"For two years we had a float at the Shetland carnival.

on food, in a Northern Ireland Protocol document sent to the EU.The plan, which was circulated among the Northern Ireland parties at Stormont last week, suggests beginning checks on fresh meat products in October of this year.:European Commission launches legal action against AstraZeneca over vaccine contractThe Northern Ireland Protocol was designed to protect the peace process by avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.But it has angered unionists by effectively creating a barrier between Great Britain and Northern Ireland by leaving the region tied to a range of EU customs and regulatory rules.The Draft UK-EU Work Programme, seen by the PA news agency, refers to the need for arrangements to ensure that medicines may be licensed for Northern Ireland where manufacturers undertake regulatory activities in Great Britain.It states: ldquoAt a meeting between LordFrost and Vice PresidentSefcovic, it was agreed to look for a solution to enable regulatory requirements to be met in the UK where medicines are being supplied specically and solely for the Northern Ireland market.ldquoAn agreed approach is required urgently to avoid any restriction in the availability of medicines in Northern Ireland .ldquoFlexible approaches should be explored with future technical discussions.The road map contains detail on plans for the phased beginning of Irish Sea food checks.The UK has already unilaterally extended an initial three-month grace period which meant supermarkets did not need to comply with all the EUrsquos usual certication requirements.The road map says that supermarkets and their suppliers ldquorequire due time to adapt to certication requirements.:Boris Johnson flat row: Conservative Party staff given one week to hand over communication about refurbishmentIt states: ldquoThe UK is working with those retailers and their suppliers to support that readiness work.ldquoThis must be supported by further discussions.ldquoDiscussions are also needed on putting in place risk-based long-term solutions for certication requirements, recognising the low risk of retail movements by trusted traders that do not leave the UKrsquos internal market and the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland.The document suggest rolling out the checks in four phases.Phase  would be for fresh meat products and would begin in October .Phase , for dairy plants and seeds would begin in January .Phase , dairy plants and seeds, and phase , short-shelf le products, are not given a date in the document.The paper states: ldquoDelivery will be supported with the

This is an extended version of one of them.Michael Faraday was one of the world’s greatest scientists.He was also one of the first to recognise the importance of reaching a wider audience and he had the perfect venue for this, at the Royal Institution in London. The lecture theatre there is probably the most famous in the world, thanks to the Christmas Lectures he began in , which have been televised since . It was designed by an Orcadian, Thomas Webster.Thomas’s father Alexander was English, but his mother Mary was the daughter of Thomas Baikie, the minister at St Magnus Cathedral, and Thomas grew up in Orkney.According to his entry in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, he attended Kirkwall Grammar School, and then went to Aberdeen University in , where “he assisted Professor Patrick Copland, a populariser of science.” Professor Copland was a pioneer of public education, whose extramural classes ran from  to . He also pioneered the use of demonstrations in his lectures, so Thomas may have taken a few new ideas with him when he went to London.Thomas Webster enrolled at the Royal Academy Schools in London as an architectural student in , and had his own business by . He began “a school for mechanics,” and this came to the attention of Count Rumford, one of the founders of what became the Royal Institution. Rumford’s aim was to encourage the use of mechanical inventions and improvements, and to encourage “the Application of Science to the Common Purposes of Le.”At the age of , Webster was engaged as treasurer and secretary of the Institution and, as Clerk of Works, superintended the transformation of a house into a suitable building. In January , he was told to prepare plans for a new lecture room. Many years later he wrote:The theatre of the Royal Institution is pronounced to be the most perfect room of the kind in the kingdom for possessing the properties of allowing the lecturer to be well heard and seen by the audience and for affording them easy entrance and exit, c . . . it has been stated by Faraday, in his late examination before a committee of the House of Commons, to be ‘almost perfect as a lecture room,’ and that ‘although architects are continually measuring and drawing it to copy from, and many other rooms have been built in imitation of it in which he has tried his voice, yet none of them proved equal to that in question.Sir Humphrey Davy was the first scientist to draw crowds to the lecture theatre, which could seat  people. He also made good use of the laboratory which Thomas Webster had installed, using electrolysis to discover sodium and potassium. Webster wrote later: “The chemical laboratory in which so many valuable discoveries have been made was not only designed and built by me, but owes to me its very existence, for, though I inserted it in my plans, the managers did not at first consider it necessary.”Count Rumford had assured Webster that he was going to establish a science school for workmen and, as he wrote to a friend:It was through the prospect of being employed in this way, which would have been as agreeable to my habits of thinking as useful to my interest, that I was induced to give up the school which I then kept and the other business in which I was engaged, and to accept of a situation and salary in the Institution by no means equivalent to what I should have considered myself as entitled to under other circumstances.Eighty years before compulsory education, he had found that new techniques in building needed better-educated workmen.Knowing from previous experience what it was possible to effect in their improvement, I conceived the idea of giving to mechanics for this purpose a species of scientic education suited to their condition, and I believe I was the first person in this country who took active steps for effecting so desirable an object. I was not unacquainted with the political feelings of that time, but I did not think a little learning was a dangerous thingjudiciously bestowed . . . My idea was to make good mechanics, not to force them like hot-bed plants out of the sphere in which they are so useful.Webster succeeded in convincing the managers that the school was a good idea. News of the school was published, and was very well received. Sadly, after all the preparations were made, ideas changed.I was asked rudely what I meant by instructing the lower classes in science. I was told likewise that it was resolved upon that the plan must be dropped as quietly as possible. It was thought to have a dangerous political tendency, and I was told thatI persisted, I would become a marked man!Webster decided to leave the institution and embark on another career, as a landscape artist.This somehow led to work on textbooks and a commission in , to draw one of the first geological maps of England. Geology was a very new science the Geological Society had only been founded in . Sir Henry Englefield, President of the Society, commissioned Webster to survey and draw the geology of the Isle of Wight. This was published in .Ten years later, Webster became the secretary of the Geological Society and curator of its museum. Soon, he was back at the Royal Institution.Notices of lecture courses in the s include Faraday on chemistry and Webster on geology. He gave the Christmas Lectures, “suitable for a juvenile auditory,” in .University College London was founded in , and Webster became its first professor of geology in .He is described as the first professional geologist, because it was then still seen as a gentleman’s hobby. Unfortunately, this meant that he was poorly paid and, although he was awarded a government pension of £ a year for services to geology, he had to find other sources of income.For the last ten years of his le, he worked on a commission from Longmans Publishing. The enormous  Encyclopedia of Domestic Economy brought together all “the information useful to persons who have to superintend domestic establishments.” It begins with where to build your house, and goes on to cover everything from the dferent options for heat and light to the preparation of every sort of beverage, from gin to coffee.It is now well known that Isabella Beeton stole material shamelessly for her Book of Household Management, published in .Her main source was Webster’s Encyclopedia: on the Arrangement of the Kitchen and General Observations, on beverages, bread, etc. Thomas Webster was unable to complain about her plagiarism.He had died aged  in December . He was a man ahead of his time, so got neither the payment nor recognition that he deserved but his writing, though uncredited, has stood on more bookshelves than all other Orcadian writers put together.Mrs Beeton’s Cookbook sold two million copies in its first decade alone.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Subsequent site investigation works were undertaken, and confirmed the presence of oil contamination below part of the area, which falls within the council’s ownership.However, after writing to the MoD, it was in November  that confirmation came that OIC was unsuccessful in its request that the MoD foots the bill for the clean-up operation.According to the MoD, the evidence did not support them assuming liability for the contamination.The ambition to attract new businesses and industries to Lyness, transforming and breathing new le into the area with signicant new job creation, has been held by OIC for years.Its potential and the characteristics the area boasts have been lauded by the authority for some time, but aside from interested glances and preliminary works carried out by companies, nothing has come to fruition.The last of these was in , when plans to revitalise the area into a decommissioning base to serve the oil and gas industry failed to materialise.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There followed four years of painful negotiation Theresa May was anointed, became a lame duck, and departed as PM to be replaced by Boris Johnson.Johnson saw off Jeremy Corbyn and ‘got Brexit done’ as he said he would, but post-Covid he might yet be done for himself. As rumours rage that in preference to lockdown he said he would tolerate a virus # from which he almost died # spreading so severely that bodies could “pile high on the streets”, there is a growing sense that the public reckoning he has long escaped may finally be in sight.Meanwhile in Scotland, having survived the ugly fall-out from of an investigation into the handling of sexual harassment complaints against her predecessor and political mentor Alex Salmond, Nicola Sturgeon remains odds-on to become First Minister again in  # perhaps even with the overall majority she was unable to secure in .Whether victory leads to a second referendum depends not only on next week’s result but on whose ‘rights’ will take precedence in the eyes of the UK government who by law would need to sanction another vote.Because inescapably it is Covid-, how it is tackled and treated, and how we can recover as a country from it, that is the major issue facing all of us.It seems lamentable that, amid the constitutional flux and an increasing entrenchment of views, that there has been so little sign of a consensual approach – between both governments and parties # to steer the country away from the crisis.And that brings us back to the original point about the late Charles Kennedy.The landscape which he occupied has altered beyond recognition, but has changed politics meant better politics or brought improved outcomes  The jury is out, and it is a question voters should consider as they head for the booths.’ brought some encouraging news.Having seen the treatment Mr Kennedy received back in , the LibDems have called for a “a zero-tolerance approach to abuse and to lead a respectful campaign”.Their pledge calls for derogatory, untrue, or hateful messages on social media to be publicly denounced and challenged to treat political opponents and journalists with respect, and to run an honest campaign.The SNP, Tories, Labour and Greens – all of whom have members who have experienced threats and abuse in ious forms – have all signed up.It would be a fitting tribute to Charles Kennedythis is one electoral promise they can work together and fulfil."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Eoghan-MacLeod-scaled.jpg","title":"barra service superhub hundreds sign","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoinePublished on Monday, the petition has already gathered well over  signatures and was created by -year-old engine cadet Eoghan MacLeod from Vatersay.: “I started the petition to get a measure of how many people agreed with me that the hub plan as it stands needs big changes for it to meet the needs of the island.“I’d heard plenty of people in person talking about their concerns so I just put together what I’d heard and put it on the petition to seewe could make these concerns more visible.“My grandmother is currently in the old folks home at St Brendan’s as she has dementia and needs to be looked after around the clock. Before there was a space available for her I was away in college and my mother had to care for my grandmother as dementia caused her to become increasingly dficult to look after.“My mother had very little free time as she had to look after my younger siblings, manage the croft, work five days a week and care for my grandmother. Replacing the old folks’ home with ‘social care flats’ would not be adequate for looking after my grandmother.”Mr MacLeod’s ‘Halt the Hub’ petition on the  degrees website is addressed to the comhairle, Scottish Government, SNP election candidate Alasdair Allan and Western Isles MP Angus MacNeil.It states: “If the comhairle is going to spend £ million on a development on Barra they shouldn’t dismiss opinions expressed by the people living on Barra. The consultation with the local community where most expressed a wish to have separate buildings for dferent local services appears to have been ignored by the decision makers in the comhairle and the Scottish Government.”One petitioner, known as Jeanne C, stated on the  degrees website: “Nothing about this ugly hub is right and there has been insufficient representation from Barra. All facilities will be smaller – with Covid distancing  We will have no care home and Eoligarry [Primary] School will be closed.“The comhairle is spending millions on decanting pupils instead of building the new school just near the old one.

There was a huge amount of rope and all sorts of litter.“Beyond that there was general litter such as Coke bottles, beer cans, and a few face masks. The only odd thing we found was a massive oxygen tank.”Highlighting the volume of rubbish encountered during the clean, he added: “Nearly everyone who came along was from the community and they had seen this litter building up over the last two years.“The beach clean is an annual event we tend to do in April but we had to cancel last year’s so this year is basically two years’ worth including two winter storms’ worth.”When asked how much of the responsibility for the mess he believed lay with local people, he went on to say: “Some of the litter will certainly be from local industry but so much of it will be dropped from people on the island – whether locally or swept in.“The problem is not just local to here, it’s a UK-wide issue.”Addressing the challenges facing the village more broadly, Mr Watson said: “On Friday one of our contractors pulled up two trailers of fly-tipped metal down the side of one of the bridges away from the beach.“That has been years’ worth of local people dumping bikes, climbing frames and all sorts of bits and pieces. Both the Woodland Trust and the Uig Community Trust were speaking today about how we can make a bigger impact through this event, and how we can cover the whole of the community.“There is real potential for the event to be an Uig clean as a whole and not just a beach clean.“A lot of people were saying that it was the first event that they had been to in well over a year, while some of the older people hadn’t seen anyone for months.“It was a real feel-good event from that side of things.“There was a mixture of working-age parents through to retired folks.“It was great to see the kids there and have a chat with their parents. The children were appalled at the amount of litter on the beach, and we were talking about what they can do to help.

Personally I would think social housing should be a priority.”While Helen Grianan said: “Will these houses be £, or under  If not, they are not affordable housing for locals or key workers.”Calum J Morrison from North Uist was in favour of the scheme saying: “Sounds like a good type of thing in my opinion, the dude seems to know what he’s doing, good luck to him I say!”Annie B Campbell, meanwhile, highlighted broader issues with housing on the island, stating: “Key workers, like some NHS and teachers, are being outbid for most of the houses that come on the market in Skye.“They are not ‘officially’ homeless so do not have enough points to qualy for council housing.“Some are forced to skip between illegal short term lets. This is not simply a locals versus incomers issue.“Key workers coming to fill essential jobs on the island and local families need somewhere to live. There is a very real housing crisis.”Mr Garton Jones said the price of the houses could not be confirmed until planning permission was obtained.However, in the last few days, he took to social media to try to address worries that people on the island will be priced-out of buying the properties.“There has been a lot of focus on the larger family house we are hoping to build but  of the  houses we are building are smaller, three bedroom, houses,” he commented.Kevin McMahon simply asked: “Will there be a first refusal for locals and the children of local families ”In response, Mr Garton Jones said: “I am happy to confirm that the properties will not be sold via the Scottish ‘sealed bids offers over’ system but will be sold at a fixed price on a first-come, first-served basis.“Obviously until we have planning, we cannot sell the houses, but we have opened up a ‘waiting list’., which is the only place the houses have so far been mentioned or advertised – have emailed me to express their interest in the houses.“Many of them do, indeed, appear to be locals, although we will not be checking birth certicates as part of the sales process.”He added: “There are  houses in total, soyou would like your name added to the list, please email me via charlie@gartonjonesChisolm talked about his own chances of finding a home, questioned the effectiveness of the Highland Council in its current form, and underlined the importance of investing in smaller communities on the island.“I am living with my parents, and with my work I am fortunate to still live on Skye,” he said.“Saying that, I haven’t taken any steps to purchase a home as the prices do not justy the property, or are just too expensive.“I know people who have taken steps to purchase but were outbid either at the start or last minute.”Chisolm has worked for CalMac since  and says he has thought about moving to the Western Isles due to his poor prospects of finding a home on Skye.He said: “I have strong family connections to Lewis and Harris, and I might have the possibility of moving across as house prices haven’t been affected as much as on Skye in terms of second homes and holiday homes. However, it is now on the rise as on other neighbouring islands.”Chisolm believes a revamp of the local authority is needed to force meaningful change.“Skye is facing issues linked to the lack of investment and communications. That makes me question why are we governed by people in Inverness and not the people of Skye and the surrounding islands.“I look at the Western Isles, and I’m seeing housing developments across the islands in dferent areas with the goal of helping local people stay where they are from, sustaining school numbers — including Gaelic communities — and helping small areas grow.“That should be critical here and not just developing in Portree. Roads, housing, harbour investments are just a few aspects that link together and time is critical.”He added: “It’s very important for young people and young families to stay on the island with the support of affordable housing, whether that’s purchasing or renting.”Chisolm said he had been encouraged by responses to Iomairt an Eilein’s call to action.“Political responses ahead of the election have been very welcoming and we are grateful for the support,” he added. reported on plans to build a new -home private scheme on the outskirts of Portree.Commenting on the merits of the proposal, Chisolm said: “I welcome the new development in Portree, I’m sure many young people and families from Skye will benefit from thesethey are available at an affordable price.“That being said, I do question why we’re only developing in Portree. I can name many schools in surrounding communities that would benefit from even a half of a development like this.”Painting a stark picture of the dficulties facing townships such as Staffin, he said: “Smaller communities are missing out and our school numbers and Gaelic communities are suffering. This should be a wake-up call to our government and ‘our’ council that more housing investments in rural areas will have more of an impact and better outcomes.“We all have a right to articulate our viewpoints and opinions. Not everyone will agree but that’s what makes a community – having dferent voices for the benefit of our island.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3800606.jpg--.jpg?1620905531000\n","title":"beth backs foster fortnight with her deeds and words","story":"BALLYMENA Councillor Beth Adger can speak with some authority on the topic of fostering.Having fostered nearly  youngsters over two decades, she was the ideal person to voice Mid and East Antrim Council’s support for Foster Care Fortnight.

It truly is a wonderful place and there is nowhere  Id rather be at this stage of Jessicas Journey.”Jessica also asked her mum to share pictures of her with her frame on, saying it will give people the chance to see what she looks like now.Mum Julie recalls the day of surgery, describing it a “bit of a blur” for her.“The Team came to the Ward to see me. Professor Dunaway, the lead surgeon, was smiling, they all were. He said they were finished and all went exceptionally well. I sobbed, happy tears, tears of sheer relief that it was over. He went on to say that there had been absolutely no complications. In fact Jessica had sailed through the surgery. She hadnt even needed a blood transfusion which is almost always a given with this type of surgery. The team advised that it would be another two hours before Jessica would be in recovery.”Julie said those last two hours “were definitely the longest of the day.”“Around pm the nurse took me to recovery, nothing could have prepared me for what I was about to see. Jessica bruised, swollen and had wires, tubes and drains everywhere. But there in the middle of it all her little voice said Mummy can I have something to eat,” recalled Julie.Mum explained that over the next seven days they had “good days and not so good days.”“But the staff on the High Dependency Ward were nothing short of amazing. They looked after me as much as they looked after Jessica. They actually made us feel like we were the only family on the ward, They are very special people who go above and beyond every day for families like ours.”Jessica has amazed staff, surgeons and family with her recovery.On Day  Professor Dunaway told Julie in his entire career he has never seen a recovery like it, describing it as “amazing.”“I replied Our God is amazing, it really has been nothing short of a miracle,” said Julie.As the week progressed the Surgical Team gradually informed Julie of what they had done in theatre.They explained that because Jessica was coping so well under the anaesthetic, they decided to do a little bit extra to ensure that Jessica had the best possible outcome from the surgery.“They didnt just fit the frame as planned, they bone grafted her a new nose, they gave her a cheek lt and plated her forehead. So, in light of all of this it made her recovery even more of a miracle,” smiled Julie“It also re-iterated to me that these surgeons are very special people, who go above and beyond on a daily basis for children like Jessica. They want the very best for them and they will do everything in their power to improve their quality of le. Thank you just doesnt go far enough, we will be eternally grateful to that Team.”Husband Lawrie was able to join Jessica and Julie for the weekend - “to help us with the move”, quipped Julie.“We’ve managed to accumulate quite a bit of ‘stuff’ over the last seven days, but it was horrible having to say goodbye.”Julie reports that Jessica has started to eat and drink more orally so not requiring as many tube feeds, swelling is going down gradually and continuing to improve daily!Regarding her frame, the screws will be turned twice a day for the next few weeks, gradually changing the shape of Jessica’s face.Mum Julie is always very mindful to thank all those who have sent texts, cards gts and prayed for them.“It has been absolutely amazing and were so thankful to have the first week done with no major complications. As someone said to me ‘first week done , a road never to be traveled again’.“It was tough, there were tears . There were good days, there were not so good days but we’ve done it and know that God was with us and will continue to be with us in the days and weeks ahead,” said Julie.And Julie makes no secret of the fact that faith has got her through this very challenging time.“Obviously our faith has been a major factor in how we, as a family, have been able to cope with all of this. And the outpouring of prayer, practical and emotional support from our own church, Ballyloughan Presbyterian, Connor Presbyterian where Jessica attends GB and Youth Club and Woodlands Presbyterian in Carrick who have adopted us, along with many other churches and iniduals from every denomination has been special. And we would like to thank everyone whos been praying and offering practical support, it has meant so much to us and it has been wonderful to see so many people being the church.”Julie said they had every faith in the Surgical Team, and “and more importantly we knew that Jessica and that team were covered in prayer leading up to and for the duration of the surgery. Churches of all denominations, iniduals and groups of people from all faiths had prayer rotas going throughout the day, and so we had a peace about this surgery from the outset.”Indeed, a verse of scripture that was very poignant in the week leading up to this surgery was Isaiah : -  So do not fear, for I am with you, do not be dismayed, for I am your God, I will strengthen you and help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.“This verse was in my head as I walked out of the anaesthetic room that morning, it was the most dficult thing I have ever had to do. But I knew that God was in complete control and would carry Jessica, the team and me through that day and in the days to come,”said Julie.The Jessicas Journey Facebook and Instagram pages have been a real source of encouragement to them as a family over the last couple of weeks.“We currently have .K followers and so I think we have achieved our aim of raising awareness of Craniofacial conditions. The comments, well wishes, prayers and support of thousands of people on the page have carried us through the dark days - thank you to each and every person whos taken the time to comment or message, you really have made a dference and you have restored our faith in humanity,” concluded Julie.

You should be ashamed of yourselves and the BBC should be ashamed of yourselves for starting from that position,” he said. Read MoreEdwin Poots set to pressure Arlene Foster to quit First Minister post earlySuzanne Breen:OpinionEdwin Poots’ honeymoon won’t last long Mr Poots, a Free Presbyterian, is “entitled to be the leader and he’s entitled to have his faith”, said Mr Paisley.“He has never been in a position where he would try and force his faith down your throat or anyone ’s throat and he would not allow those things get in the way of how he engages in policy and policy-making.”A spokesperson from the BBC said on Saturday: “At no point did anyone on the programme mock religious beliefs.”Mr Paisley said as DUP leader, Mr Poots interest is “making Northern Ireland work”.“He has an excellent track record of working with Sinn Fein [and] other people across the board to make this place a better place.”Mr Poots will be an “authentic voice” for a community which currently feels “you’re not allowed to have an opinion that might offend someone in some other quarter, that opinion can now be voiced”, Mr Paisley added.“I’m reminded of the Frank Skinner line, you can be anything in Britain today except a Christian.”After Arlene Foster was recently overthrown by the party, Mr Pootswas named her successor on Friday after a successful leadership campaign in which his only rival was MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson.Mr Paisley, a supporter of Mr Poots, said his leadership of the party will be focused on several key issues, one of which is the Northern Ireland Protocol which he pledged to “fight”. Mr Paisley said on Friday night the protocol could be “fixed”.“The protocol with regards to business in Northern ireland is destroying business, whether you’re a Catholic businessman, a Protestant businessman a businessman or woman from any other tradition, it’s destroying business, lets try and fix it,” he said.A meeting has taken place with the Secretary of State Brandon Lewis to address the issue, he added. “Every single unionist in this country is opposed to it, it is not sustainable.“Within Article  there’s a lawful way of changing it, [it] allows us to ensure those elements that affect the society, the economy, which create destabilisation, those elements can be fixed and changed. Let’s fix them, let’s change them,” he said..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadSleazy married NI cop had sex with woman on dutyMeet Gary Fisher’s ‘Mr Big’ ...the man with the UDA cocaine connectionsFormer Miss NI Anna Henry on her romantic marriage proposalBBC accused of Edwin Poots ‘lambast’ over religious beliefsSave Barry’s campaign pulled over £k theft case backlashTop VideosPlayNew DUP leader Edwin Poots# full interview with Sunday LePlayVideo: Flock of Kerry sheep claim a fluffy dog as one of their own\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh cfbbbdadfeae.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh cfbbbdadfeae.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayCelebrations on the Shankill Road as Rangers win their th Scottish Premiership title.Latest Northern IrelandPolice watchdog clears PSNI of bias in handling Storey funeral saying force prioritised public safety over Covid lawsAgreed UK EU approach on medicines for Northern Ireland ‘urgently needed’NI officials to meet after cyber attack in RepublicDUP MLA Mervyn Storey not ruling himself out of First Minister roleWe must take Indian iant seriously, NI expert warnsLatestPolice watchdog clears PSNI of bias in handling Storey funeral saying force prioritised public safety over Covid lawsBrendan Rodgers switches Leicester’s focus back to Premier League after cup winHundreds queue as retail outlets reopen for first time in five monthsLive music ing ‘huge sign of things progressing positively’, musician saysNew Covid- vaccine study for pregnant women launches,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

One card shows the programme of the one and only game in the Irish Cup, turning out for Tobermore United in February  in their - home defeat to Ballymena United — George’s last ever competitive match.One of the men behind the card collection is West Midlands-based businessman Jim Cadman.He says: “There was no more skillful or charismatic footballer in the world, ever. And we want to focus on his talents. The  cards tell the story of every facet of his career.“We like to think of our initiative as a building block in celebrating his legacy. There needs to be a new light shone on George to remember him and to capture the myriad of fascinating stories surrounding him.“We were initially approached to write a book about George but we weren’t sure about the scope for another publication. I wanted to do something dferent and the idea came to mind of a collection of what might have been known as ‘chewing gum’ cards reflecting everything from the start to the finish of his career.”Jim is hoping that once Covid disappears he and his colleagues can bring an exhibition about George to the EastSide visitors’ centre in east Belfast where the footballing hero has pride of place in a massive mural on the wall.“I’ve been talking with the EastSide Partnership and we’re exploring ways of getting the exhibition together. They’re keen to promote a positive image of George and we have told them we would like to bring lots of memorabilia across to Belfast.“We have had a two year exhibition about George at the Manchester United museum and there were also displays at the National Football Museum both of which were extremely successful.“George is still idolised by United fans including many who never saw him play in a red shirt at Old Trafford.“The idea would be to tour the exhibition across the UK after Covid and we would dearly love to kickoff in Belfast,” says Jim whose new tribute takes centre stage in a quarterly publication for football card collectors.The Card Scene magazine devotes all  pages in its current edition to George and to the hundreds of collectibles featuring his exploits down the years including his never-to-be-forgotten part in Manchester United’s - European Cup final win over Benfica at Wembley in .The publication also reveals that a single football card of George which had been given away free with a packet of Barrett sweet cigarettes in  sold at auction recently in America for a staggering £,.However George never liked how he looked on the card and  years later the Cregagh star asked his friend and artist Paul Trevillion to design a new one to go alongside a newspaper column.“He asked me to loosen it up a bit,” says Paul. “He told me he thought he looked like a choirboy on the  card but wanted to look more like a Beatle. So that’s how I re-imagined him.”Jim Cadman says it was signicant that George asked the artist to paint him wearing a Northern Ireland jersey instead of the Man United one that appeared in the original. “And that’s because he loved playing for his country,” adds Jim.Replicas of the  Barrett card and Paul’s  portrait are included in Jim’s new limited edition collection which also commemorates other milestones.Jim Cadman says part of the proceeds from the sale of the card collection will help community charities in Northern Ireland as well as in England..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadSleazy married NI cop had sex with woman on dutyMeet Gary Fisher’s ‘Mr Big’ ...the man with the UDA cocaine connectionsFormer Miss NI Anna Henry on her romantic marriage proposalBBC accused of Edwin Poots ‘lambast’ over religious beliefsSave Barry’s campaign pulled over £k theft case backlashTop VideosPlayNew DUP leader Edwin Poots# full interview with Sunday LePlayVideo: Flock of Kerry sheep claim a fluffy dog as one of their own\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh cfbbbdadfeae.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh cfbbbdadfeae.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayCelebrations on the Shankill Road as Rangers win their th Scottish Premiership title.Latest Northern IrelandPolice watchdog clears PSNI of bias in handling Storey funeral saying force prioritised public safety over Covid lawsAgreed UK EU approach on medicines for Northern Ireland ‘urgently needed’NI officials to meet after cyber attack in RepublicDUP MLA Mervyn Storey not ruling himself out of First Minister roleWe must take Indian iant seriously, NI expert warnsLatestPolice watchdog clears PSNI of bias in handling Storey funeral saying force prioritised public safety over Covid lawsBrendan Rodgers switches Leicester’s focus back to Premier League after cup winHundreds queue as retail outlets reopen for first time in five monthsLive music ing ‘huge sign of things progressing positively’, musician saysNew Covid- vaccine study for pregnant women launches,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It was very dficult for me personally.“I just felt we were heading in a direction I did not want us to go and it was time for a change at the top. I am really, glad that colleagues have rallied around Edwin’s positive vision for the party and the country.“We are all good comrades we are all democratic unionists together and I hope that is the spirit which we can take the party forward...under Edwin’s new leadership,” Mr Stalford said..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadSleazy married NI cop had sex with woman on dutyBBC accused of Edwin Poots ‘lambast’ over religious beliefsMeet Gary Fisher’s ‘Mr Big’ ...the man with the UDA cocaine connectionsFormer Miss NI Anna Henry on her romantic marriage proposalSave Barry’s campaign pulled over £k theft case backlashTop VideosPlayNew DUP leader Edwin Poots# full interview with Sunday Le\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh cfbbbdadfeae.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh cfbbbdadfeae.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayCelebrations on the Shankill Road as Rangers win their th Scottish Premiership title.PlayVideo: Flock of Kerry sheep claim a fluffy dog as one of their ownLatest PoliticsPoots’ choice is the Union or a hard Brexit, SDLP warnsLord Frost is criticised over Brexit Protocol commentsAllison MorrisOpinionDUP’s Edwin Poots may be trying to be all things to all people Allison MorrisOpinionSF’s drastic solution to Derry meltdown may be its undoingEdwin Poots: I’ll meet loyalist terror groups in bid to end violenceLatestWe were in too much of a hurry to score: TuchelViewpointOpinionHoneymoon will be shortPoots fails to alter DUP’s trackTommy McCarthy hails Pete Taylor as ‘best coach in the world’ as gaze turns towards a world title fightCoronavirus cases surge in Thailand as spike is mostly driven by jail outbreaksJury sworn in for Croydon tram crash inquest,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Kelvin Boyes   Press EyeMartin BreenMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailEdwin Poots will challenge Boris Johnson over the Government’s plans to grant any form of amnesty over pre- Troubles investigations. With a request in to meet the Prime Minister to discuss the Northern Ireland Protocol, the new party leader confirmed the issue will also be raised in any talks.Last week the Government revealed it is to bring forward legislation in the course of the next year to deal with legacy issues related to the Troubles.Accompanying Government papers to the Queen’s Speech stated: “The Government will introduce a legacy package that delivers better outcomes for victims, survivors and veterans, focuses on information recovery and reconciliation, and ends the cycle of investigations.”Reports said the statute of limitations plan would end prosecutions of the vast majority of Troubles killings before the Good Friday Agreement, though an exemption would apply to war crimes, such as torture.Mr Poots said that while he believes there has been too much of a focus into killings connected to the police and Army in recent years the new plan is not a solution. He added: “What is being proposed is unhelpful.“I would have a signicant issue with a lot of the trials that have been coming up lately in that there is something disproportionate when % of the murders were carried out by non-state forces, but in recent years there has been a massive focus on incidents that the state was involved in.“We could literally count on two hands from  the cases that have been tried which were pre- terrorism activity.“That has created a real problem and certainly I will be standing up for the military and the police.“Many of them were put in awful positions and made split second decisions, didn’t always get it right and the tragedy of them not getting it right was somebody lost their le.“But to have this focus which seems to be targeting very heavily police and Army with so little focus on the terrorist activity is something that is unacceptable to me.“That, I think, is unacceptable to the Government as well. But I don’t believe that what they are proposing is the appropriate vehicle to deal with this. Therefore we will be reflecting that to them.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadSleazy married NI cop had sex with woman on dutyMeet Gary Fisher’s ‘Mr Big’ ...the man with the UDA cocaine connectionsFormer Miss NI Anna Henry on her romantic marriage proposalBBC accused of Edwin Poots ‘lambast’ over religious beliefsSave Barry’s campaign pulled over £k theft case backlashTop VideosPlayNew DUP leader Edwin Poots# full interview with Sunday LePlayVideo: Flock of Kerry sheep claim a fluffy dog as one of their own\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh cfbbbdadfeae.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh cfbbbdadfeae.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayCelebrations on the Shankill Road as Rangers win their th Scottish Premiership title.Latest PoliticsPoots’ choice is the Union or a hard Brexit, SDLP warnsLord Frost is criticised over Brexit Protocol commentsDUP MLA Mervyn Storey not ruling himself out of First Minister roleAllison MorrisOpinionDUP’s Edwin Poots may be trying to be all things to all people Allison MorrisOpinionSF’s drastic solution to Derry meltdown may be its undoingLatestLive music ing ‘huge sign of things progressing positively’, musician saysNew Covid- vaccine study for pregnant women launchesPierre-Emile Hojbjerg says Tottenham need an ‘ambitious’ new managerTommy McCarthy hails Pete Taylor as ‘best coach in the world’ as gaze turns towards a world title fightWe were in too much of a hurry to score: Tuchel,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Photo: ReutersREUTERS FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueNarrow win: DUP leader-elect Edwin Poots. Photo: ReutersAndrew Madden and Gareth CrossMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailMONDAYThe week kicked off with Edwin Poots setting out his stall for the job of DUP leader, vowing to end reactionary policy making.We can no longer sustain the ad hoc approach that has been a feature of recent years, with policy on the hoof and little regard to the wishes of the elected members who have to believe in and defend the policies of the party, he wrote in his manesto.During a debate on Northern Ireland’s first climate change bill in the Assembly, former nuclear submarine captain Steve Aiken acknowledged that he would seem an unlikely candidate to be an eco-warrior.He said that, while working in the Arctic while he was in the Navy, he observed a ,-year-old sea of ice. When he ed to the area a few years later “that ice had gone”.Jim Allister revealed to no one#s surprise that he isn#t a fan of the bill, pointing to its potential impact on the agri-food sector.“I am saying that the answer is not to take % of our animals and slaughter them or to take % of our production and export it to the depleting rainforests of Brazil and then sit back smugly and say, ‘Didn#t we do well # That is the ethos of the Bill, he said in the chamber.People, much as [DUP MLA Jim Wells] might not like it, will continue to buy meat. Do they buy the meat produced in north Antrim or the meat produced on land that has been stripped in the Amazon basin  That is an issue that politicians in the Western world have to consider.Ulster Unionist MLA Roy Beggs took issue with the emission targets in the bill, including a goal of zero emissions by . He said they are set over a compressed time frame and go way beyond UK Climate Change Committee targets.Green Party leader Clare Bailey, who tabled the bill, interjected. Does the member realise that his party#s manesto commits to net zero by , which is much faster and a much more compressed time frame  she said.I believe that that was a Westminster manesto, Mr Beggs replied.At a press conference addressing his resignation as UUP leader, Mr Aiken was asked which task was harder, commanding a nuclear submarine or leading the UUP. He wryly remarked: I think I#ll plead the fth on that one.TUESDAYThe climate change debate continued into Tuesday, with Jim Wells rounding on the Environment Minister, and his party colleague, Edwin Poots, over his opposition to the bill.Why are we giving planning permission for peat extraction and the development of peatlands when they have so much potential to store carbon  Why has the department not completed the area of special scientic interest, special protection area and special area of conservation designations  he said.The [conservation] Act came in in , and I am able to tell him how long ago that was because I was in the chamber when it passed. Here we are,  years later, and we still have not completed our [Areas of Special Scientic Interest] designation.Alliance#s Kellie Armstrong said: I thank the proposers of the motion it is an important debate. I will have to recommend myself for disciplinary action because I find myself agreeing with Mr Wells far too much.Oh no, replied Mr Wells.Sinn Fein#s Jemma Dolan raised a point of order later on in the chamber, saying she had secured an adjournment debate - a way of enabling the House to have a debate on a subject without considering a substantive motion - two weeks ago, but Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon released a statement on the same issue on Tuesday morning.That undermines the role of MLAs and the authority of the chamber to hold ministers to account. I ask the Speaker#s Office to look into this to see whether proper procedure and protocol were followed, she said.Speaker Alex Maskey sympathised: I say directly to the minister that, having seen that her statement was issued a number of hours ago, in advance of the adjournment debate that was scheduled for this afternoon in the order paper, I can understand why a member would feel aggrieved.It is not for me to judge why that happened, but I will write to the Executive again because I want to make sure that ministers reflect on when they issue statements, particularly on sitting days and when the minister is scheduled to come to a particular debate to make a statement.WEDNESDAYA potential sign of things to come was aired on Wednesday, when Edwin Poots no-showed a North South ministerial agriculture meeting. Nichola Mallon, the Infrastructure Minister, was also due to take part, stating it doesn#t bode wellthis is what the future holds. Powersharing requires leadership, she tweeted.It emerged Brexit minister Lord Frost and Secretary of State Brandon Lewis were in Northern Ireland on Monday meeting with the Loyalist Communities Council - but no one seemed to notice at the time.Independent MLA Trevor Lunn asked a Stormont officialshe knew Lord Frost was visiting.“It wasn’t wholly unexpected, but I wasn’t aware of the date in advance,” responded the official.Mr Lunn said: I think they must have smuggled him in and smuggled him out again.When the Assembly#s Economy Committee heard from Minister Diane Dodds on Wednesday, questions were raised around her own future.As she outlined her post-pandemic economic recovery plan Alliance MLA Stewart Dickson noted she might not be Economy Minister much longer.Edwin Poots has committed to reshuffling the DUP#s ministerial team.How do you see your successor, or a future mandate, taking forward your economy plan , Mr Dickson asked.Mrs Dodds replied: “What I do or I don#t do after this week or next week will be for the party leader and that is fine with me.THURSDAYThursday saw a meeting of the Health Committee, with members briefed on the topic of gambling addiction.Sinn Fein#s Colm Gildernew said he was “taken aback” before the pandemic to learn that one in  suicides “are linked to gambling addiction”.He asked an officialthere were any plans to develop services to tackle the problem, to which the official replied: There are no specic gambling addiction services.Nothing much gets past TUV leader Jim Allister. This week he received an answer to questions around why Union flags flown at Stormont to mark the birthday of Queen Elizabeth on April  were lowered before sunset. In a written response the Assembly Commission said the flags were lowered at .pm, ahead of the closure of the Assembly at pm, with restricted opening hours during the coronavirus pandemic. Previously the flags would have flown until just before pm.FRIDAYIt was a monumental day for unionism, with the DUP voting for their new leader. Outside party HQ in Belfast, Jim Wells was asked about the possibility of Sir Jeffrey Donaldson running as an MLA in his constituency in the next Assembly election.Mr Wells said Sir Jeffrey previously represented North Down and still has a lot of family there, however he is glad the Donaldsons on the electoral register voted for him the last time round.He hasn#t gone away, you know, he added.Alas, it was not be for Sir Jeffrey#s leadership ambitions, as he fell by two votes to Edwin Poots. The Agriculture Minister said during his acceptance speech he wanted to reach out to other unionists.Other unionists, it seems, aren#t going to give him an easy ride. Within minutes of the white smoke emerging from DUP HQ, outgoing Ulster Unionist leader Steve Aiken issued a statement calling for answers over the DUP#s Brexit dealings.Why did Edwin and ALL his colleagues endorse Boris Johnson’s proposals on October ,  for a regulatory border in the Irish Sea  Mr Aiken asked.“Why did Edwin and ALL his colleagues endorse Boris Johnson’s proposals on October ,  for border inspection posts to be establish at Northern Ireland’s ports Why did Edwin and ALL his colleagues endorse Boris Johnson’s proposals that all goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain must comply with EU rules and therefore be subject to the ongoing remit of the EU court Good luck, Edwin..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadSleazy married NI cop had sex with woman on dutyMeet Gary Fisher’s ‘Mr Big’ ...the man with the UDA cocaine connectionsBBC accused of Edwin Poots ‘lambast’ over religious beliefsFormer Miss NI Anna Henry on her romantic marriage proposalSave Barry’s campaign pulled over £k theft case backlashTop VideosPlayNew DUP leader Edwin Poots# full interview with Sunday Le\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh cfbbbdadfeae.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh cfbbbdadfeae.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayCelebrations on the Shankill Road as Rangers win their th Scottish Premiership title.PlayVideo: Flock of Kerry sheep claim a fluffy dog as one of their ownLatest PoliticsPoots’ choice is the Union or a hard Brexit, SDLP warnsLord Frost is criticised over Brexit Protocol commentsDUP MLA Mervyn Storey not ruling himself out of First Minister roleAllison MorrisOpinionDUP’s Edwin Poots may be trying to be all things to all people Allison MorrisOpinionSF’s drastic solution to Derry meltdown may be its undoingLatestWe were in too much of a hurry to score: TuchelViewpointOpinionHoneymoon will be shortPoots fails to alter DUP’s trackTommy McCarthy hails Pete Taylor as ‘best coach in the world’ as gaze turns towards a world title fightMany Britons think parliaments should still work remotely after Covid, says pollRAF Typhoons bomb Islamic State terrorists firing on Iraqi troops,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

A warm reply was received from Mr Heaney’s family after they asked to use the name.“The response to the setting up the club and publicity has been incredible,” club chairman Brendan Henderson, from the Creggan area in Derry , told the Belfast .Ulster University was in touch to offer balls and bibs, while dozens of others from back home have also sent messages of support  and offers of help. The club is still looking for sponsorship.Committee members are from Derry, Armagh, Fermanagh and Down, while players include former Belfast Royal Academy pupil Nikita McCoubrey,  from the Shankill Roa d .On trying to find a name for the club, the founders did not want it to be overtly political, and they were motivated by the fact that many are teachers.“Seamus Heaney was a name that stuck in my head,” Brendan told online publication Gaelic Le. “Obviously as he was from Derry as well and had an interest in Gaelic games. We did a bit of research and found that there was no club named after him.”He said they contacted the Heaney family in Bellaghy an         d asked for permission to use the name.  “They were delighted and sent a  really warm email back saying that they supported us and that it would be the first club to have used the name.“I thin k they quite liked the symmetry of having a club named after him and the fact that he had an interest in Gaelic games. It may have been a close second to poetry but there was an interest there! Our colours are blue and white after his home club and red for Russia.”While many have contributed to the founding of the club, he said the equally important members of the  team are the partners left to look after the kids at home, including his we Sasha. “Instrumental and very patient,” he said. “If mentioned, might get me back in the good books after all the hours dedicated to this!”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadSleazy married NI cop had sex with woman on dutyBBC accused of Edwin Poots ‘lambast’ over religious beliefsMeet Gary Fisher’s ‘Mr Big’ ...the man with the UDA cocaine connectionsFormer Miss NI Anna Henry on her romantic marriage proposalSave Barry’s campaign pulled over £k theft case backlashTop VideosPlayNew DUP leader Edwin Poots# full interview with Sunday LePlayVideo: Flock of Kerry sheep claim a fluffy dog as one of their own\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh cfbbbdadfeae.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh cfbbbdadfeae.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayCelebrations on the Shankill Road as Rangers win their th Scottish Premiership title.Latest WorldCoronavirus cases surge in Thailand as spike is mostly driven by jail outbreaksIndia braces for powerful cyclone amid virus surgeCourt clears way for Samoa to get its first woman leaderIsrael claims Gaza tunnels destroyed in heavy air strikesBill Gates #investigated by Microsoft over relationship# before he left boardLatestWe were in too much of a hurry to score: TuchelViewpointOpinionHoneymoon will be shortPoots fails to alter DUP’s trackTommy McCarthy hails Pete Taylor as ‘best coach in the world’ as gaze turns towards a world title fightCricket Australia requests more detail about sandpaper scandal from BancroftBT boss snaps up £m of shares after announcing investment drive,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Jade Bradley, who is originally from Hatmore Park in the Foyle Springs area of the city, is the founder of Restore Nutrition, a wellness company that specialises in helping people with their nutrition to deliver a better quality of le. Jade embarked on her own mental and physical health journey several years ago having struggled with anxiety. She used a blended approach which included yoga, meditation, music, therapy and the input from a kinesiologist that advised on food issues and intolerances. googletag.cmd.push Within two months of implementing these changes, Jade saw a massive change resulting in better sleep, more energy and a feeling of being more ‘restored.’ It was this that sparked her desire to educate herself in naturopathic nutrition. She moved to London and studied at the College of Naturopathic Medicine and became a member of the Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council. She launched Restore Nutrition in  and the company has since gone from strength to strength. working with over  private clients and organisations including, Seagate, Business in the Community, Hurt, Waterside Neighbourhood Partnership, Belfast Food Network, Hillcrest, Culmore Hub, Foyle Women’s Information Group, Derry Well Woman and Youth Action. googletag.cmd.push Speaking about her new programme, Jade said: “We are living in a stressed out society, and having the main pillars of health and wellbeing in place is essential to help deal with stress and anxiety. If the fundamentals aren’t in place, it is impossible for us to excel.” Jade said these fundamentals were more important than ever given the challenging times we are all in. She added: “I centre our work around four pillars which we delve into on the ‘Kick Start’ programme namely: hydration, reducing toxic load, restoring with whole foods and managing stress and sleep.” She said she has found most people want a quick fix or a magic pill when it came to their health and wellbeing journey.     “Unfortunately, this does not exist,” she said. “It is best to make small changes incrementally and embark on this journey in stages starting off with the fundamentals which is exactly what we do in our new programme. “Furthermore, it is so important to tackle mental health issues with an all-round approach and this is why I have worked with local mental health therapist, Caroline McMenamin, on many projects over the past two years and plan to do more collaborations throughout the year.” The ‘Kick Start’ nutrition programme is available for business groups, charities, community groups and inidual attendees and runs over four weeks in one-hour sessions.

He is one of four Glen men listed to start on Saturday. Danny Tallon, who started all  games last season, isnt included in the starting line-up. There is no place for Slaughtneil defender Karl McKaigue who has made a full recovery from the torn Achilles sustained on club hurling championship duty last summer. The only three members of the current  yet to make their debuts are Bellaghy duo Ronan McFaul and Conleth McShane, as well as Glen goalkeeper Connlan Bradley. googletag.cmd.push Goals from Patrick Kearney and Paul Cassidy helped Derry to victory when the sides met last season at Celtic Park. Derry and Longford have met eight times in the last two decades, in league and championship.

We performed fairly well...very well at times in the second half. It was a lot more comfortable than wed ever have expected, he added. An upbeat Derry boss said the victory was a great reward for the efforts of the squad in the off-season. After getting the full squad back on board after last seasons Derry county finals, he felt the build-up to the Armagh championship game pleased him, after which the squad were left in no doubt of the effort required before Christmas, ahead of their  promotion push. googletag.cmd.push They have done the work with Peterand with Anne Marieand I am delighted with the condition they are in, Gallagher pointed out. Derry were six points clear at half time of Saturdays clash in a rainswept Pearse Park, but Gallagher admitted it shouldve been more.

Eaacutebha Mullanand Ciaroacuten Mullan , from Ballerin, have written about the loss of their father Kieran Squealer Mullan in , when the siblings were just five and three years old. Ahead of a k sponsored run this weekend in aid of the Mental Health Awareness charity, Eaacutebha and Ciaroacutens mother, Collette, has shared her childrens plea to break the taboo around mens mental health. “On May  , it will be  years since Ciaroacuten and I last saw our Daddy. With cold shock, I realise that means hes been gone for  years longer than I knew him,” wrote Eaacutebha. googletag.cmd.push “We were only five and three when he took his own le. For many people, a period of time relieves much of the pain, and makes it easier to move on. “But for us, in many ways, its got worse. Losing a parent at five and three meant we didnt really understand death. I didnt even know it was suicide until I was in P. “Our Daddys death has left us with years of unsolved questions, new and fresh situations to face without a father. “Even from the day he died, we are still finding out new things about him to add to the tiny memories we thankfully have. Five years is no time to know someone well. googletag.cmd.push “I wish we could go back to those days when we were just a little boy and girl, too young to notice how down our Daddy really was. Eaacutebha has posted details of the sponsored runs route on social media. “I wish we could spread them throughout the rest of our lives knowing what people are thinking and going through, hoping we could help them in any possible way. “Why cant we swap the day he held us as a baby at our Christening, so he could watch us play Gaelic, win big matches and watch us succeed in le  “Ten years on and we are still listening to his favourite songs, watching the one existing video of him to remember his voice, crying on Fathers Day or his birthday, or any random day.     “We still cant let our Daddy go. Everyone thinks we might have moved on, because it happened such a long time ago. “But they dont know how it feels to look at the same few photographs, knowing there will never be any more. “They dont know how strange it feels to think we once had two parents. They dont know what its like to sit and talk to your Daddy at a gravestone at  and  knowing that he didnt want to be here. “If we let him go, hes gone forever, and we cant take that. The effect of suicide isnt just the loss of the person who left you behind, its the shadow always at your heel.” Eaacutebha and Ciaroacuten have shared their story in the hope it will help others to speak out about their mental health. “Ten years on, and suicide is still the leading cause of death for men under ,” said Eaacutebha. “Every day, men who feel like our Daddy did bottle up their feelings, try to appear strong, and drive themselves further into darkness. “Every day,  of them take their lives, leaving people like Ciaroacuten and I lost and heartbroken. And every day, we wish we could change what happened. “For our Daddy, the sun will never come out again, but the more we talk about it, the more we listen, the more others will live to see another day and the more the shadows will fade.”] The k sponsored run in memory of Kieran Squealer Mullan will take place on Sunday May , with all proceeds going to the Mental Health Awareness charity.

Brooke McEldowney, a Primary One pupil at St Brigids Tirkane Bunscoil Naomh Briacuted, has appeared in Three Families, which aired this week on BBC One. Three Families explores the emotive issues around womens rights and tells the story of the grassroots campaign to lt Northern Irelands restrictions on abortion. Brooke enjoying herself on set. Brooke landed the role after her mum Kirsty received an email from a casting agency. “When I opened an email about NI filming and how they were on the lookout for a young child, Brooke fitted the description,” she told Derry Now. googletag.cmd.push “It was all very overwhelming as the world was going through a pandemic and my daughter was now going to be part of a cast. It all felt like a dream.” For Brooke, the dream was very much a reality, and although she began filming at just four years of age, the young County Derry girl made light of the heavy schedule.  “She has been such a busy girl, taking everything in her stride and having so many dferent roles in filming and completely loving it all,” said Kirsty. “During the lockdowns while everyone was at home, I was arranging my other kids childcare and driving to our next destination for long days ahead. googletag.cmd.push “She had attended local drama and dance classes for a short while - pre-Covid - so this helped. She loved all the attention and getting chauffeured to each set, a few places I never expected to be.” Five-year-old Brooke has a central role in the drama as the daughter of actor Colin Morgan, previously of The Fall and actress Amy James Kelly, who has previously featured in Coronation Street. “When I met them and signed the contracts I knew that this was a big deal and how I had to keep everything a secret,” said Kirsty. “I had to travel myself to each set every couple of days prior filming to get a Covid test. Thankfully, they were all negative so Brooke could always continue with her role.”     The future is already looking bright for the Maghera girl, and she was handed a unique birthday present in February when she began filming on a CBBC musical drama series. “It was so perfect and fitting on her th birthday and the cast, producers and directors spoiled her,” said Kirsty. “Her confidence rapidly grew and has been even given spoken lines for on screen. She has gained multiple jobs since and has now been signed up by an agency.” Brooke on set with Colin Morgan and Amy James Kelly. Keeping her feet on the ground amid the excitement of her new-found fame will be an easy task with the support of her community and her school. “When ing to school after lockdown Brooke had days off due to filming but the BBC always liaised so well with the school,” said Kirsty. “Brooke is a very independent, intelligent girl and likes a good routine. She was thrilled when her teacher, Mrs Convery sent work via Seesaw and was always keen to get the tasks completed. “We are so proud and it has been an emotional journey as I have been involved in the Arts for many years and know how challenging it can be. “It’s all such an amazing experience and the opportunities it has opened for her have been remarkable. I am so privileged that we get to go on this journey together as mother and daughter. “We are bursting with pride.” Three Families is available to watch now on BBC iPlayer.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Government Boundaries Commissioner Sarah Havlin has outlined further details about her review of the  district council boundaries and the proposed timetable and process for public consultation. This includes publishing a short information video to outline the review process and highlighting why and how people can get involved. This also coincides with the start of a series of ‘Meet the Commissioner’ briefing events with council representatives from across all  councils. By the end of July this year, the Commissioner plans to publish provisional proposals, outlining any proposed changes to local government boundaries. googletag.cmd.push The closing date for written submissions about these provisional proposals will be September  this year. After this, a series of public hearings will be held to gather further feedback and these will be subject to the relevant covid- public health guidance at that time. Thereafter, there will be a period of analysis of the representations and public hearing reports, before the preparation of revised proposals which will again be subject to further consultation. The review is something that by law has to happen every eight- years and although the last review took place in   with the final recommendations from that providing the basis for the last review of local government boundaries which after legislation and elections etc, took effect from  when the new councils came into being. googletag.cmd.push The last review, which saw Derry City Council and Strabane District Council combine to make Derry City and Strabane District Council, coincided with the change in local government which saw the signicant change from  to  councils so was more substantial in nature. This review will take into account changes in electoral changes housing changes among other things since  and make recommendation on the boundaries of the  current districts and the ious wards that make them up. It’s hard to know what the initial proposals will show as modelling electoral analysis etc is ongoing but there may well be some local government boundaries changing.     The review will also examine the potential for changes to the names of local wards to reflect local considerations. The review, when completed next year, will then need to be legislated on before any actual boundary changes would take effect. Boundary Commissioner, Sarah Havlin, is encouraging everyone with an interest to get involved in what she described this important review. everyone with an interest to get involved. “We have also published an information video to highlight how and why people should get involved. The outcomes will inform the make-up of local government in the foreseeable future andwill consider the impact of electorate changes since  and other recent developments. “The process is about independently ensuring electoral equality and fairness across Northern Ireland, with the aim that all the wards within a district should, as far as possible, have a similar number of electors. “With that I mind, it’s important that we hear the views of local people and their representatives on these matters, and I would encourage people to regularly check our website and social media channels for more information on how they can have their voice heard in this process.” Review details can be found athttps:www. lgbc-ni.org.uk or via Twitter and Facebook @LGBCNI.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mourners at the service in Our Lady of Mercy Church in Lavey heard how Catherine showered the children she taught with love and was devoted to her family. Officiating at the funeral, parish priest Fr Eamon Graham said she was a beautul person. “If I was to mention this morning all the people who Catherine loved and who she in turn was loved by, we would be here all day,” he told the congregation. “The past few days I was trying to think how I would sum up Catherine she was beautul inside and outside, in every aspect of le. googletag.cmd.push “She loved all the good things in le. She always had her hair done and presented herself better than any of the rest of us. “Behind that, it wasnt a facade. It was a reflection of the goodness within her. She lived her le in a wonderful way.” Fr Graham told those gathered in the church how Catherine had doted over her many nieces and nephews, and encouraged them to keep her memory alive by following her example. Her love of both those in her family and the children she taught was central to her le, a le in which her faith was strong. googletag.cmd.push “You know every child she ever taught, because she brought all the childrens bothers and woes home. She loved the children she taught, particularly in Creggan,” he said. “She had a special love of her godchildren because her faith was important. She loved God deeply and many people are closer to God today because they encountered Catherine.” A proud Lavey woman, she was deeply involved in the local community. She attended the local primary school and was steeped in the areas GAA tradition. “In our own parish, Catherine was so involved in the GAA, the camogie. She was a pupil at our school and the teachers remembered her as a pupil and a student teacher,” said Fr Graham.     “When she was dealing with student teachers, she always went the extra mile. Teaching wasnt just a job for her, it was a vocation. “She was a perfectionist in every way possible, but she missed her mummy. It is our hope, prayer and belief that she is with her mother and with God.” Erins Own GAC led their own tribute to Catherine online. “Lavey GAC is greatly shocked and saddened to learn of the untimely death of our former senior camogie player, Catherine McCann,” they said. “Today and forever well remember Catherine McCann. Every team with Catherine on it was a better team.” Catherine taught for  years in Creggan Primary School, near Randalstown, County Antrim, and the school paid tribute to her kindness. “Miss Mc Cann taught in our school for  years. She was a model teacher in every way, always putting her pupils first,” they said. “An amazing friend to all the staff and parents and her displays of kindness to everyone she met came so naturally. “She always arrived to school dressed in the latest fashion and then quickly pulled the trainers on her to deliver sports lessons in her lovely pink trainers. “We cannot even begin to realise the void that is left in Creggan Primary School.” Concluding the homily at her funeral mass, Fr Graham said she had touched the le of every person she encountered. “I cant sum up Catherine – I wouldnt even try to – but the thought thats in my head is that she wove a thread of gold through le,” he said. “It touched every person she encountered and it was made out of love. Its up to the rest of us to take up that thread and bring it through le. “Thats the greatest tribute everybody can give.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mourners at the service in Our Lady of Mercy Church in Lavey heard how Catherine showered the children she taught with love and was devoted to her family. Officiating at the funeral, parish priest Fr Eamon Graham said she was a beautul person. “If I was to mention this morning all the people who Catherine loved and who she in turn was loved by, we would be here all day,” he told the congregation. “The past few days I was trying to think how I would sum up Catherine she was beautul inside and outside, in every aspect of le. googletag.cmd.push “She loved all the good things in le. She always had her hair done and presented herself better than any of the rest of us. “Behind that, it wasnt a facade. It was a reflection of the goodness within her. She lived her le in a wonderful way.” Fr Graham told those gathered in the church how Catherine had doted over her many nieces and nephews, and encouraged them to keep her memory alive by following her example. Her love of both those in her family and the children she taught was central to her le, a le in which her faith was strong. googletag.cmd.push “You know every child she ever taught, because she brought all the childrens bothers and woes home. She loved the children she taught, particularly in Creggan,” he said. “She had a special love of her godchildren because her faith was important. She loved God deeply and many people are closer to God today because they encountered Catherine.” A proud Lavey woman, she was deeply involved in the local community. She attended the local primary school and was steeped in the areas GAA tradition. “In our own parish, Catherine was so involved in the GAA, the camogie. She was a pupil at our school and the teachers remembered her as a pupil and a student teacher,” said Fr Graham.     “When she was dealing with student teachers, she always went the extra mile. Teaching wasnt just a job for her, it was a vocation. “She was a perfectionist in every way possible, but she missed her mummy. It is our hope, prayer and belief that she is with her mother and with God.” Erins Own GAC led their own tribute to Catherine online. “Lavey GAC is greatly shocked and saddened to learn of the untimely death of our former senior camogie player, Catherine McCann,” they said. “Today and forever well remember Catherine McCann.

The seven-acre site at Bay Road faces onto the River Foyle. The site has long been used as a fuel depot. However, last year a large number of people put their name to a petition objecting to a bid for a coal screening operation on the site. The site has now been placed on the market. Although zoned as ‘white land’ the fuel yard could have development potential, particularly with the progress on the nearby Fort George site. The Department for Communities decision to sell part of the site to the Western Trust in March marked the latest step in the ambitious project. googletag.cmd.push The land on the river front of the Bay Road coal yard was also recently acquired for the new cross border cycle network, which will include a new pedestrian and cycle bridge across the Pennyburn Inlet. The sale of the Bay Road site is being managed by TDK Commerical Property Consultants. In the sales brochure, it states: “The site measures approx. . acresand was previously used as a coal storage and distribution yard. The site benefits from  large warehouses, office building and a large covered storage area. “It has roughly  m of frontage on-to the River Foyle and this could be extended up the Pennyburn Inlet by around m.” googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Even so, he was also at pains to point out that he was not attacking the minister.ldquoThere are numerous issues regarding the Downe and Daisy Hill that need to be dealt with face to face with the minister, he said.ldquoWe have engaged with health trusts until we are blue in the face and we are getting nowhere. We need to put it up to the minister. We are in unprecedented times.Downpatrick councillor Oonagh Hanlon said she too was disappointed and urged Mr Swann to reconsider.ldquoThis is such an important issue, she said. ldquoWe are coming out of Covid and we need the restoration of services at the Downe. I am very disappointed, she remarked.Fellow Downpatrick councillor Gareth Sharvin said he acknowledged that Mr Swann was under pressure, but suggested that a virtual meeting could easily be arranged.ldquoThe Downe Hospital is extremely important to the people I represent, he said. ldquoWe need the minister to come out and say he is as passionate about the Downe as we are.His SDLP colleague, John Trainor, said the council needed to ldquoexplore every avenue, adding that councillors should ask the Stormont Health Committee to interveneMr Swann was to refuse to meet then a second time.Rowallane councillor Kathryn Owen, who nursed in a Covid unit at the height of the pandemic, said she wished to ldquoput on record her disappointment.She added: Knowing how important these two hospitals are and having worked in them, it was a weak response..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12thMay2021-45m.jpg","title":"£45m investment needed to upgrade Ardglass harbour  ","story":"INVESTMENT in the region of poundm is needed to upgrade Ardglass harbour to help maximise the portrsquos future opportunities, according to a major new report published on Monday.Stormont agriculture minister Edwin Poots has published the findings of the report which highlights the investment needed in Northern Irelandrsquos fishing industry and seafood sectors.The report was produced by the Fishing and Seafood Development Programmewhich was established by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairsto conduct a strategic review of the opportunities for developing the sea fishing and seafood sectors across the province, including the potential role of new public investment in infrastructure.Focusing on recommendations in relation to capital investment at the main fishery harbours, the report highlights a number of challenges and opportunities for the wider industry that could be addressed through a future fisheries financial support scheme.The recommendations for Ardglass include enhancing capacity at the harbour to provide security for fishing and processing businesses, while the development of Kilkeel harbour as a ldquopotential Irish Sea hub for the fishing and maritime economy by increasing port capacity and shore side facilities is highlighted.More generally, the detailed report highlights the need to create conditions resulting in investment in more modern fuel efficient vessels with low emissions and better facilities for crews, further reducing the environmental impact of the fishing fleet, adopting novel technology to expand marine aquaculture and taking advantage of EU exit opportunities to build exports of high value seafood.The report confirms that a recent survey of the harbour walls in Ardglass revealed that some repairs may be required within the next one to two years but their condition will not prevent the deepening of the harbour mdash to nine metres below the waterline mdashthey are stabilised and protected from undermining prior to dredging operations.It says the current water depth and quaysideprevents larger fishing vessels from landing at Ardglass with tankers transporting fish landed in Belfast to the village for processing. Mackerel and Irish Sea herring continue to be landed in Ardglass.The report says there is inadequate space for growing the inshore fleet at the port as the quayside is dominated by the larger demersal fleet and occasional visiting pelagic vessels, with the adjoining marina for the exclusive use of leisure craft.A constraint to the landside development of the harbourrsquos estate is the mixed ownership of existing properties which prevents the Fishery Harbour Authority from having full control over activities at the port and limits the ability to plan strategically.As a result, the Fishing and Seafood Development Programme proposes a poundm budget to purchase properties and prepare buildings and land within the harbour for redevelopment.With the cost of the work at the main harbour estimated at poundm, the report explains the figure can only be revised following the completion of a bathymetric survey.Ardglass councillor Dermot Curran said he was keen to meet with Mr Poots to discuss the detail of the report and the level of work required.ldquoThe report highlights the development of an lsquoIrish Sea hub in Kilkeel and I know that many in Ardglass will be keen to hear from the minister what exactly this means. Ardglass plays a critical role in the Co Down fishing industry and its contribution to this key sector must be expanded, he said.ldquoThere are two major processing factories in Ardglass and work to dredge the harbour to facilitate larger vessels is a critical component of the investment that is required.Cllr Curran said investment was required to meet the needs of the existing fleet and future vessels.He added: ldquoThe village fleet has increased over the years and those who work in the industry say while they are not necessarily expecting a huge increase in the number of boats, they do anticipate an increase in the quality of boats and for that to happen, the harbour must be fit for purpose.Mr Poots said he hoped the publication of the report ldquomarks the beginning of a new chapter in the history of the provincersquos fishing industry.ldquoThe report highlights the considerable investment that is required to help the industry adapt to the challenges it faces and grasp the opportunities presented following the United Kingdomrsquos exit from the EU, he explained.ldquoWe need to build a stronger and more resilient fishing and seafood industry that can adapt to change. Of course, this will not be easy but I hope that with government and industry working together we can build new infrastructure, become more prosperous, improve the marine environment and enhance our reputation as suppliers of quality sustainable seafood.Mr Poots said his department will be engaging with stakeholders to discuss the findings of the report over the next few weeks and hopes that the next phase of work towards harbour investment can proceed shortly.He also confirmed that later in the year DAERA will be consulting on plans for a future fisheries fund to address the wider needs of the fishing industry..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12thMay2021-Cara.jpg","title":"Cara opens first ever Irish Roots festival  ","story":"A CARRYDUFF schoolgirl was honoured at the weekend when she was asked to open the inaugural global Irish Roots online festival.Twelve year-old Cara Mailey is no stranger to appearing in television having appeared in several CBBC programmes over the last two years.However, on Sunday she became a storyteller for the festival which seeks to celebrate Irish people around the world with dferent skin colours.Along with Orla McKeating, the founder of Still I Rise Diversity Storytelling, Cara read two stories mdash Happy in Our Skin and I Am Whole.Both books celebrate dferent skin colours and celebrated the uniqueness of peoplesrsquo skin colours.Cara, who attends Assumption Grammar School in Ballynahinch, was born with achonlasia, a form of dwarfism.She also had the opportunity to share her story, what she likes about her skin and then she also talked about what it was like being dferent to other children her age.Orla also read a third book called the The Little Crayon, a childrenrsquos story book written by -year-old Amelia Kai, also from Belfast.The daughter of Tricia Mailey, a teacher at Cedar Integrated Primary School in Crossgar, Cara has a big personality and has appeared on CBBCrsquos Dengineers and Crafty Party.Tricia said: ldquoCara has read for Still I Rise now for about a year.

Interested developers have already been informed of the pending opportunity to submit their proposals.Councillors were told that all of the work to date has focused on site access via current access routes from Market Street and Irish Street, with officials reaffirming that as part of the feasibility study, one option that was explored mdash but subsequently rejected mdash was providing a road access linking Irish Street with St Patrickrsquos Avenue.ldquoTo explore the purchase of additional lands at this stage would mean that the development brief process would have to be suspended and the business case revisited in line with land valuations, councillors were told.ldquoThe development brief has been drafted in such a way to allow developers to bring additional lands that they may choose to acquire to enhance their plans.The council paper added: ldquoAs part of the development brief, car parking provision will have to be demonstrated and how it is achieved will again be up to the innovation of bids brought forward. Car parking will be a key requirement in the assessment process and indeed planning approval process.Moving forward, there is an acknowledgement that the current Irish Street car park is badly laid out and that the redevelopment proposal provides an opportunity to address this, paving the way for it to be used for future events, markets and festivals, with the DfC and local council prepared to provide additional funding to allow this to happen.Signicantly, developers interested in the prime town centre site are being asked to focus on how their chosen scheme can potentially contribute to Downpatrickrsquos night-time economy post Covid, providing a boost for residents and help attract visitors to Downpatrick.As part of continuing work on the Irish Street revitalisation programme, graphics recently appeared on the front of the former police base, while the archway at the entrance to the Irish Street car park will be painted.Downpatrick councillors say they are acutely aware that the opportunity to redevelop a huge area of town centre land will not happen again, with the redevelopment plan having the potential to provide a boost for existing traders who have been at the heart of the town centre economy for decades..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12thMay2021-DundrumCricket.jpg","title":"Dundrum thirds make historic league debut  ","story":"SUNDAY was a momentous day in the history of Dundrum Cricket Club.For the first time the club have been able to enter a thirds team into league cricket and the Meadow was the venue as Dundrum took the field against Ards seconds with a team packed with experience and plenty of youth too.Dundrum captain Neil Reilly won the toss and elected to bat on a super wicket that the ground staff had prepared for the seconds the day before, but had not been used due to bad weather.In the first over, opener Eoin Moag nicked a gooddelivery which was caught frombehind by the Ards wicketkeeper,.This was followed in the second over by a Jack Calvert drive catching the edge of the bat and flying straight up to be caught, leaving Dundrum on  for .The tricky start was made worse when the captain was run out by a sharp piece of fielding from Ards, leaving the hosts on  for .This brought together a partnership between Keba Butler and Kristofer McNeill which finally found traction and started to produce a decent score.By the time Kristofer had been bowled for , the score had risen to  for  with some cracking shots by both batsman which on another day would have produced even more runs, but on a damp outfield restricted the number of fours.Andrew Hammond came in and produced a fast hitting nine to supplement Kebarsquos continued run chase which culminated in a not out score of  by the end of the allotted  overs.Ards came into bat and had a fast start, reaching  without loss after only three overs,.The captainrsquos second over proved to be a turning point in picking up two wickets for just a single run. This fired up Eoin Moag to produce another fine over and clean bowl A Lawther.Ards were now well on the back foot at  for . Captain Reilly took another wicket in the following over before handing the reins to Keba Butler, who promptly took a wicket with his fourth ball.Newcomer Matthew Douglas was introduced into the attack to replace Moag and was soon also among the wickets with only his fourth delivery for the club.This was followed up by Kristofer McNeill coming from behind the stumps to bowl mdash his two overs going for  runs, but also gaining wicket.With Dundrum now firmly in the driving seat, the bowling was passed around with youngsters Andrew Campbell and James Wright bowling well.Experienced clubmen Andrew Hammond and James Orr came on with James taking his first wicket of the season and Ardsrsquo last batsman to give Dundrum victory by  runs.A massive result for the club made possible by a dedicated ground staff, driven committee and some excellent work with young people in the surrounding area which has enabled the thirds to field five U- players, all of whom will be vying for a spot next week and maybe even the seconds..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12thMay2021-CDiary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C May 16%2C 2001  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash The project to transfer one of Ballynahinchrsquos most prestigious buildings was officially launched last week.The historic Market House in Ballynahinch is to get a new lease of le and over the coming months will be transformed into a new civic building during a near poundm redevelopment project.The scheme will complete the Ballynahinchrsquos Regeneration Committeersquos plans to transform the heart of the town and complement the redeveloped square.Local planning chiefs are expected to give the scheme the green light within the next few weeks and preliminary work to strip plaster from the building has revealed ornate stone work and archways which are to be incorporated in the design of the new civic facility.The chairman of the Regeneration Committee, Mr Vincent Fullam, said the public launch of the Market House project marks the end of a long crusade which involved numerous meetings.KILLYLEAGH ndash The future of a multi-million pound marina and housing project for Killyleagh is expected to be known next month.Local planning officials are expected to announcethey are prepared to allow the controversial scheme planned for the Gocean area in the town when they meet local politicians.Speculation is mounting the poundm plan will be refused, but planners have confirmed they have still not reached a final decision on the issue, explaining they are still heavily involved in discussions with a number of organisations.They say it would be wrong to draw any conclusion at this stage as the consultation process is far from complete.It had been widely predicted a public inquiry would be ordered into the project but after its detail was scrutinised by senior planners in Belfast, they passed it back to planners based at Rathkeltair House in Downpatrick and told them there would be no public scrutiny of the scheme.DUNDRUM mdash A call has been made for a review of planning in Dundrum before the beauty of the village is ldquolost forever.The request has been made by SDLP candidate, Mr Charlie McGrath, who says the pace of new housing developments in the area raises a number of issues which need to be addressed.Mr McGrath, a candidate in the Newcastle area, has said it will be too late for locals to complain about the shape of the area after the developers and planners had finished with the village. He has called for a debate into the problem ldquobefore itrsquos too late.Mr McGrath, who is also concerned about the lack of facilities for local residents, said he has written to the local banks about providing cash points and is ldquovery encouraged by the response. He is also pleased that replacement pubic toilets are again to be provided in the village.He said that with the influx of young families in the area there is a ldquoglaring need for youths facilities

it will be widely used for a number of events for patients, staff and local people.SAINTFIELD mdash A Rowallane area councillor has said the development of a town park in Saintfield is still at the

But the obstacles in the way of any meaningful change to the protocol are massive.Boris Johnson agreed to a Withdrawal Agreement in late  that has such huge ramications that the UK itself, we are now learning, agreed to impliedly repeal part of the Act of Union. That is a breathtaking admission.The Act of Union is a foundational, constitutional piece of legislation. No part of it should ever be repealed except in the most extreme situation, and then only explicitly.This is how serious things are for unionism.Mr Poots has few levers. One is to disrupt North-South relations and see what comes. There will be much sound and furyso, but it was Ireland and the EU, facilitated by a weak UK, that decided that East-West arrangements could be torn up.Another is to refuse to implement the sea border, on similar grounds. If the courts force implementation, or the UK intervenes, then at least it is made clear that such an affront to the settled constitutional position, which we were told could only be changed by consent, will not be facilitated by unionists, but rather,it happens at all, will have to be imposed.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityVale of Glamorgan council put forward Aberthaw, a recently closed coal-fired power plant, as a potential site for a fusion prototype.The UK government last year called for suggestions for possible sites to pioneer the technology which could generate electricity with low carbon emissions.But opposition councillors on the Vale council have claimed the cabinet has ldquorushed through its decision to suggest Aberthaw as a site.More NewsCardf Tomasz Waga murder investigation sees two more arrestedFour coffee shops in Penarth for meeting a friend outdoorsThings to do in South Wales on May Bank Holiday weekend Plaid Councillor Ian Johnson said: ldquoIt was strange that the council leadership did not consult with other parties or ask a cross-party scrutiny committee to consider issues before making the expression of interest about a possible future use of the Aberthaw plant.ldquoEven though it is an early point, many people will have questions about the technology, the impact of the development and the process, and discussing this in scrutiny would open up the debate and ensure transparency.Fusion technology is still in its infancy and no fusion reactor has ever created more power than it consumes. But scientists say it could be cleaner and safer than fission, the nuclear technology currently used to generate electricity.If Aberthaw is chosen, the council is hoping the power plant could bring lots of high-tech high-paid jobs to the region. Westminster should decide on a site by the end of next year, and the power plant would be built by , costing about pound billion.But the Valersquos cabinet used controversial emergency powers last month to put forward Aberthaw as a site, without consulting the full council or any scrutiny committees. Council leader Neil Moore said this was due to the deadline for suggestions at the end of last month.     However, Westminster made the initial call for suggestions in December last year, meaning the council had four months in total to debate and scrutinise the decision to put forward Aberthaw. The council debated the issue in a meeting this week, after the deadline passed.Conservative Cllr Gordon Kemp said: ldquoThis is being dealt effectively without allowing any proper consideration or scrutiny. Itrsquos an extremely signicant matter, evenwe ignore the issue of public concern over such a proposal.ldquoWersquore looking at potentially a colossal, massive investment in the Vale. It could create many jobs, so I think itrsquos something that should have been discussed.ldquoI appreciate there are always deadlines on this. But Irsquom very concerned and surprised this wasnrsquot put before cabinet and scrutiny committees [earlier].Cllr Moore said the issue was ldquonot a debate, but promised to meet with the leaders of the opposition parties on the council, and to give a cross-party scrutiny committee a chance to consider the plans.He said: ldquoThis is just for noting. We used the emergency procedure because it had to be in by a deadline. This is not a debate about what we can do.ldquoBut Irsquom more than happy to have a meeting with the group leaders, and Irsquom more than happy to ask for an information report to go to the environment and regeneration scrutiny committee. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityNasir Adam - Plaid CymruRaised in Butetown, the son and grandson of merchant navy, Irsquove lived in Cardf South my whole le and itrsquos where I still work and live and itrsquos here Irsquom raising my family. During my  years as a community campaigner I have passionately campaigned for education, creating more opportunities for young people, tackling the housing crisis and the climate crisis. I was the regeneration officer for the Loudoun Square and Trowbridge redevelopment, and was selected as the Wales delegate for the International Association for Community Development and Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . Over the last  years Irsquove supported young people in Cardf South and Penarth to develop their skills in the arts and creative industries and to participate in a wide range of opportunities. I successfully gained the London  Olympic Cultural Inspire Mark for Butetown Community. I entered politics because of the increasing injustice around me - increasing food banks, homelessness, education, climate crisis, lack of opportunity for our youth, lack of affordable housing I was sick and tired of our communities being treated like second class citizens by the London elite. I want a fair deal for our communities for Cardf South and Penarth and for Wales.Alan Golding - Freedom Alliance. No Lockdown. No CurfewsRaised in Tonyrefail, Rhondda Cynon Taff, I have since lived in Brighton and Glasgow, moving to Cardf in . Since my early twenties Irsquove been interested in the workings of society and how we treat each other, animals and our planethellip and in the process Irsquove come to completely mistrust virtually all career politicians. I believe a new way of doing politics is needed in Wales with a new set of values across the whole system. I donrsquot believe the current political structure and its controllers have the interest of the people at its heart with regard to their mental and physical health, their quality of le and spiritual and economic well-being.     Paul Campbell - UKIPHello Im Paul Campbell and Im standing in the Cardf South and South Wales Central area for UKIP in the Senedd elections on MAY TH.Being. Born in Cardf and lived most of my le there I appreciate the Greatv Potential the pride and the Welsh Identity in Cardf and the Valleys towns. and I have seen how things have changed over the years with parts of the area unrecognizable from the place I remember.Areas of Cardf have become run down and standards have fallen with a loss of community spirit The surrounding Towns have been neglected with. A lack of investment and job creation initiatives.Mass immigration in the UK has put tremendous strains on cities like Cardf Newport and Swansea with wage depression and overstretched public services.. The Conservatives claim to be in control of immigration but they will only ever talk about it and under there watch in the in the last  years  million more people have come to our shires thats  cities the sthe size of Cardf . Increasingly they are choosing to come to Wales as Labour has encouraged them by a making Wales a Nation Of sanctuary.Helen Westhead - Green PartyOur current administration has ignored the climate emergency and has left so many people vulnerable and excluded. As we recover from the pandemic we have unique opportunity to create better ways of working - the influence of an elected Green in the room will be transformative.We see from across the UK, Europe, and beyond the incredible dference Greens make, holding government to account, speaking out against inequality, and representing real people and their communities, not political or corporate interest. Wales is long overdue that representation in the Senedd.We know that the way we recover from this pandemic and build back stronger is through investing in communities and public services, ensuring everyone has access to local facilities, and supporting small business. If elected, one of my main priorities would be better walking and cycling routes, connected to affordable public transport and green outdoor spaces that communities can enjoy. Advocating for a Universal Basic Income would ensure no one is left behind in our bold plan to transform Wales.With the more proportional voting system on the regional ballot in Wales, Labour cannot win regional seats. A Green vote on your second ballot is the only progressive option.Matt Friend - PropelPropel has led the campaigns on two of the most important issues affecting Barry, Penarth and Cardf.Wersquore the only party that has committed not to allow any nuclear mud to be dumped in our waters, including the mud dredged from outside Hinkley nuclear reactor in Somerset.And wersquore the only party that even mentions the scandal of dangerous fire risk cladding on so many of our flats and buildings. Through our Contract with Wales we have committed not to issue new building contracts to any housing developer involved in the scandal, until they have paid to fix the problem they created.Wersquoll also end the way leaseholders are getting rinsed by introducing a service charge cap, linked to the Retail Price Index. That will stop the double digit increases in service charges that leaseholders have had to put up with.Most importantly, wersquoll introduce a Coronavirus Recovery Act to end Welsh lockdowns, save lives and restore freedoms. We canrsquot just hope wersquoll get our freedoms back, we have to vote for them.The ten laws in our Contract with Wales will transform our nation. Wales needs champions. Vote Propel.Alex Wilson, Liberal DemocratsI live with my family in Penarth and I became involved in politics because of the widening isions that seemed to occurring our community. I feel that with the Liberal Democrat core values of tolerance and understanding we can bring people back together. We can cut through the shouting of partisan politics and once again listen to what people want in their community.The next five years is going to be critical and I feel the Senedd must put recovery first. That means recovering from the Covid pandemic, the recovery of our economy, better healthcare services and a happier community which can be achieved by better transport links, saving our environment and ato community values.Irsquove been around long enough to know a political status-quo without a strong opposition can breed complacency. Wersquove seen this in national and local government. If I am elected I will ensure that the voice of the people is heard. If yoursquove ever wondered how we almost lost the Kymin or how they plan to build over  homes on contaminated land at Cosmeston Farm in Sully, well itrsquos because our current political leaders often lack empathy with local communities.Other candidates standing are:Vaughan Gething - LabourAngus Hawkins - Gwlad The Welsh Independence PartyLisa Peregrine ndash Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party Alan Pick ndash Reform UKDavid Rolfe ndash IndependentLeighton Rowlands ndash Conservative article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Otherwise a coalition must be attempted.:Who can vote Anyone over the age of  can vote in the Senedd election provided they are:- registered to do so- living in Wales- not legally excluded from votingThis is the first time  and -year-olds have been eligible to vote. What impact that has on the result remains to be seen.How do I vote There are three ways - in person, by post and by proxy - however, the deadlines for latter two options have already passed.Voting at the polling booth with take place until pm today.Polling stations will be kitted out with hand sanitiser and distancing markers to help voters remain safe from coronavirus.Most crucially, voters are being asked to bring their own pen or pencil.Face coverings must also be worn, unless exempt.How does the voting system work Each voter will have two votes - one constituency vote and one regional vote.Youll be represented in the Senedd by five Members. One for your constituency and four for the region of Wales where you live.Constituency vote - this is for the person you want to represent you and your local area. Wales has  constituencies, with each being represented by one MS in the Senedd. Constituency votes are counted in a first past the post system - so the candidate with the most votes is elected.     Regional vote - This is for who you want to represent your region of Wales - South Wales East, South Wales Central, South Wales West Mid and West Wales and North Wales. There are  regional Senedd Members, elected by the additional member system.When will results be announced As with a lot of things this past year, the election has been hit by Covid restrictions.While voting will happen today, counting will not take place the same night as is usually the case on election night.Instead, the votes will be taken to the counting locations and kept secure until morning.They will then be veried - spoiled ballots removed - and counted.Due to Covid restrictions, this will likely take longer than in normal counts, but results are expected within two days of polls closing.Keep an eye on the Argus website for the latest, and results. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The modernisation plans will also support a further  jobs during construction and development. Located at the busy junction of Dromore Road and James Street, the store will occupy an entire space of , sq. metres – more than double the size of its existing store – which will include an expansive sales floor of , sq. metres. The planning application lodged with Fermanagh and Omagh District Council will see the demolition of a neighbouring pub and private dwelling to make way for the expansion on a site that will also incorporate a-space car park with two electric vehicle charging points and new, complementary landscaping. Construction plans encompass Lidl Northern Ireland’s bold ‘concept’ design which prioritises sustainability, spacious, wide aisles, long tills, restrooms, employee and baby-changing facilities which will dramatically enhance a high-quality shopping experience. The site will also include a large warehouse and improved employee welfare facilities. The application follows an extensive local consultation of the plans undertaken in September  which was positively received by local representatives and the wider community. Conor Boyle, regional director for Lidl Northern Ireland, said: “We are delighted to confirm plans for a replacement store in Omagh which will see the existing store at James Street in the town double in size to provide a dramatically-enhanced shopping experience and new jobs for the area. Centrally located in the west of the region, the Omagh store serves a burgeoning and thriving community base and is conveniently positioned next to the A which is a major primary route and commuter corridor. As a major investor in our communities and in our local economy, the Omagh store is an important location for us, and I am thrilled to reaffirm our commitment to the local area as part of this multimillion-pound investment. We hope to receive planning permission for the site in the coming weeks and we look forward to opening the brand new, state-of-the-art Lidl store later this year, bringing shoppers even more choice of quality products at unbeatable value.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cefafbaedd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bbbabbeabbdbdbcbf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
