[{"url":null,"title":"WHO chief says COVID 19 infection rate approaching highest pandemic far","story":"Share this article SAGE\u0027s R rate estimates suggest that England\u0027s outbreak is still shrinking.Their upper estimate was the crucial value of 1.0, suggesting everyone that has the virus is passing it on to one other person. It has been below one since the lockdown was imposed in January.The R rate is calculated using a number of indicators including Covid cases, hospitalisations and deaths. But it is a lagging indicator, with the current value reflecting the period up to two to three weeks ago.The R rate was only estimated to potentially be above one in London (0.8 to 1.1) and the South West (0.7 to 1.1), suggesting outbreaks may be starting to flatten off in both areas.The North West and the South East had the lowest rates (0.6 to 0.9), suggesting cases are shrinking fastest there.But SAGE said: \u0027Particular care should be taken when interpreting these estimates.\u0027They are based on low numbers of cases or deaths andor dominated by clustered outbreaks. They should not be treated as robust enough to inform policy decisions alone.\u0027  The ONS infection survey sends out more than 100,000 Covid tests to households up and down the country, asking participants to swab themselves for the virus.These are then posted back to a central lab where they are tested using PCR to see whether any are coated with the virus. The proportion that are positive allow statisticians to estimate the size of the UK\u0027s outbreak. Estimates suggested England had 112,600 people infected on any given day in the most recent week of data, with a positivity rate - proportion of swabs testing positive - at 0.21 per cent. But this was barely a tenth of the January peak.Scotland had the second highest prevalence with a rate of 0.2 per cent, equating to one in 500 people being infected, followed by Northern Ireland (0.14 per cent) and Wales (0.11 per cent). Every age group in England saw a drop in cases in the seven days to April 10 except over-70s where they remained level, according to ONS estimates.The oldest age group also had the lowest positivity rate (0.08 per cent) for the virus. Everyone in this group has been offered at least one dose of the Covid jab.Those aged 25 to 34 had the second lowest positivity rate in England (0.11 per cent), followed by 16 to 24-year-olds (0.15 per cent).On the other hand, 12 to 16-year-olds had the highest rate (0.42 per cent).Cases initially ticked up slightly among children with the reopening of schools, which experts put down to twice weekly swabbing in the group identifying cases that would have previously been missed. Classrooms were closed over early April for the Easter break."},{"url":null,"title":"Pregnant women Covid vaccines No10s jab advisory panel changes guidance","story":"Share this article When vaccines for Covid first started to be rolled out, the World Health Organization warned they should should not be used on pregnant women due to lack of evidence about their safety and efficacy. Later, the body walked back on its advice and said jabs can be administered to expectant mothers safely after more data emerged to show that pregnant women appeared to be more likely to fall very ill with Covid than their peers.Today\u0027s decision brings the UK into line with the US, where pregnant women have been able to get the Covid jab at the same time as their peers since last year.There is no evidence any Covid vaccine has any effect on a woman\u0027s chances of becoming pregnant. NHS guidance says there is no need to avoid pregnancy after vaccination.Professor Wei Lin Shen, from the JCVI, said: \u0027We encourage pregnant women to discuss the risks and benefits with their clinician - those at increased risk of severe outcomes from Covid are encouraged to promptly take up the offer of vaccination when offered.\u0027There have been no specific safety concerns from any brand of Covid vaccines in relation to pregnancy.\u0027There are more real-world safety data from the US in relation to the PfizerBioNTech and Moderna vaccines in women who are pregnant – therefore, we advise a preference for these to be offered to pregnant women.\u0027Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at Public Health England (PHE), added: \u0027The available data on the PfizerBioNTech and Moderna vaccines provide confidence that they can be offered safely to pregnant women.\u0027The Covid vaccines continue to save thousands of lives and it is important that we encourage as many people as possible to take up the offer when it is their turn.\u0027 Top UK doctors praised the move from the JCVI, claiming it would \u0027empower\u0027 pregnant women. Dr Edward Morris, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG), said: \u0027We are grateful to the JCVI for taking into consideration our evidence and updating the guidance around the Covid vaccine in pregnancy.\u0027Vaccination offers pregnant women the best protection from Covid, which can be serious in some women.\u0027We believe it should be a woman\u0027s choice whether to have the vaccine or not after considering the benefits and risks and would encourage pregnant women to discuss with a trusted source like their GP, obstetrician or midwife, or a healthcare professional in a vaccination centre.\u0027This move will empower all the pregnant women in the UK to make the decision that is right for them, at the same time that the non-pregnant population in their age group receive protection from COVID-19.\u0027Health chiefs advise women to be extra cautious about Covid if they are pregnant or planning to have a baby, and mothers-to-be are on the \u0027clinically vulnerable\u0027 list, but there is not much hard evidence on the specific risks they face. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists says pregnant women are no more likely to catch Covid than others, and that most have no symptoms or suffer mild cold or flu-like warning signs.But there are a small number who can become unwell with the virus, and may be at increased risk of becoming severely ill compared to other women.Some studies have suggested mothers-to-be may be twice as likely to be admitted to intensive care than their non-pregnant peers if they catch Covid. A range of jabs are already recommended for pregnant women in the UK, including ones for seasonal flu and whooping cough. Medics say the tetanus shot can also be given to those who are expecting if necessary. "},{"url":null,"title":"The picture happiness Queen reveals photo Prince Philip Scottish Highlands","story":"Share this articleShare this articleWe are here today in St George\u0027s Chapel to commit into the hands of God the soul of his servant Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.

We spoke to the experts to find out. Q: If I’m displaying symptoms, do I still need to isolate?“The most important thing is to follow the law, so if you’ve got symptoms you have to self-isolate for 10 days in your home and it’s really important people continue to do this,” says Dr Shaun Fitzgerald, director of the Centre for Climate Repair at the University of Cambridge and a member of the UK government Science Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE). “There may perhaps be people who think: ‘Well, why can’t I go for a walk outside in the countryside if I’m not going to see anybody?’, and I completely understand that argument. But there are millions of people living in apartments and if they were to venture outside, they’d be sharing corridors and stairwells and touching multiple surfaces. We can’t have one rule for one and another rule for others. It’s about the risks to the wider society and my personal view is that the rules are proportionate and very reasonable. Especially when you compare 10 days of isolation with the lockdowns we’ve already been in – it’s a small ask comparatively.” Q: Is it really safe to socialise outside?“When we are outdoors, thinking about the airborne route of transmission, the level of concentration of any virus in our vicinity is much lower and so the risk is lower too,” says Fitzgerald, who also specialises in airflow research. “The amount of outdoor air that’s sweeping away any virus being emanated from a person is enormous, and we can’t begin to practically replicate that kind of environment within an indoor environment.” Q: Won’t opening the windows have the same effect?“Opening the windows is great if you’re indoors but it’s nowhere near as good as being outdoors,” says Fitzgerald. “Think about it, when you’re stood outside, it’s very rare that it’s perfectly still – there’s usually a very small wind and when you run the numbers and figure out the volume flux of air passing you that’s not virus-laden, it’s enormous. When you’re outside, there are fewer surfaces for you to touch which, for example, somebody might have coughed on. Surface touching risks are also lower outdoors because things such as the rain and ultraviolet light from the sun can deactivate the virus more easily than in a dark, indoor environment.” Q: How safe is outdoor swimming or group sports?“Outdoor sports are relatively low risk but I would encourage people to also think about their overall wellbeing, including mental health, when it comes to the risks you’re exposing yourself to as you enter into society,” says Fitzgerald. She adds: “This isn’t purely about the virus – we also need to think about the wider impacts of isolation, loneliness and a lack of socialisation. It’s about balancing those risks.” Q: How can we keep safe as we start to socialise in larger groups?“One of the challenges as we start seeing friends and family is that it’s incredibly difficult for people to maintain a social distance from loved ones,” says Rogers. “And if you have young children it’s very difficult to explain to them why they’re not allowed to crawl over everyone or play with the other children. If you’re meeting up with another household or group, try to plan it in an environment that is as safe as possible. Have those honest conversations now – people are more willing and likely to stick to plans that are made in advance.” Q: If we’ve had the vaccine, do the rules still apply?“The vaccines are amazing and one of the biggest scientific breakthroughs of a generation, but they’re not a silver bullet,” says Rogers. “Think about somebody who has had bypass surgery because their diet and exercise were poor. They can have that medical fix, but if they don’t change their behaviours, they’ll never realise their full potential. I see vaccines in the same way – they’re a powerful weapon we can deploy against the virus but they’re only going to reach their full potential if we wrap these other behavioural elements around them.” Q: How can we make our homes safer for visitors when they’re allowed to pass through to gardens?“Keep the windows open and if you’ve got two bathrooms, have one toilet for guests and one for the household,” suggests Fitzgerald. “If not, can you provide two towels – one for guests, one for others? Ventilating the house before and after your guests have arrived is key – ventilating before they arrive is helpful in case you happen to have an infectious person in your vicinity, therefore reducing the risk to your guests. Ventilating after guests have left is important because if one of them happens to be infectious, this will reduce the risk to your own household.” And remember, it’s not permitted for people to meet indoors until 17 May – when six people or two households will be able to come together. Q: Is there anything else we should remember?“While we’re still in this reasonably precarious state, the most important thing is to think: ‘It’s not about me, it’s about others,’” says Fitzgerald. “It’s about the wider community. Certainly in the first lockdown, we got the sense of real selflessness in society and we need to try to remember these measures aren’t just in place to protect you as an inidual, it’s about thinking of others. Particularly as we emerge from lockdown – since, the more compliant we are now, the quicker the incident rate is going to come down and the sooner society can start functioning again. So it’s really about trying to get out of this as quickly as we can, which means complying with the rules as much as possible.” This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

I didn’t think about the terroir of grape-growing, the nose of whisky or what wine to pair with raw tilapia. On sunny days, I just thought about the most enjoyable way to quench my thirst. Now, the clank of a metal bottle opener and the hiss of a cold Thatchers Cider opening is enough to bring me back to the Meadows in Edinburgh, for a post-lecture picnic with friends. Stretched out on the grass as the rays warm my skin, the air is filled with the smoky smell of barbecue. Summer walks have been made all the sweeter with a sip of cider at the end. Arriving at a sweep of beach, blanket at the ready, or settling at the end of a pier as the sun sets. The cool fizz of cider tickling down my throat while the sky streaks violet and hazy pink is an unbeatable feeling. On an emotional level, clinking bottles with a friend at the end of the day is the perfect reward. On a practical level, a couple of bottles of ice-cold Thatchers in your rucksack on the way to the sea cools your back – ideal. Cider is the taste of a barbecue with my family – the only way we were allowed to see each other in summer 2020. My dad cooked venison burgers for the first time, an attempt to impress me, the “food and drink writer”, making jokes about not wanting a bad review. Despite the burger buns being a bit frozen in the middle, I gave it 1010. The sun was shining, family was gathered, the cider was flowing and for a brief second it felt like normality again. The epitome of the “better times” we’re all looking forward to. I can’t always suppress the drinks writer in me and did have to note that the iron-y tang of venison burgers goes particularly well with the light sweetness of Thatchers Katy. On the slopes of the Mendip Hills, Thatchers grows 458 different varieties of apple in perfect conditions – more than 25 varieties of them are used for ciders. The autumnal rain, summer sun and lack of winter frost combine to create juicy, flavour-filled apples. They have a cider for every taste bud: sharp and cloudy, sweet and pink. As a drinks writer, I’ve sampled more ciders than I care to remember. Thatchers Katy is the choice for sunny days and balmy nights. While Thatchers’ other ciders are made from a combination of different types of apple, Thatchers Katy is made from just one type. Red as a fairytale apple and sweet as strawberries, Katy apples are the pride of the crop and first to be run through the mill. It’s what you want to be drinking to get that real thirst-quenching moment, with only a hint of sweetness that doesn’t overpower. It sits between sweet and dry, with a crisp finish, so it’s incredibly drinkable. Being an apple-based drink, it goes best with anything pork. But its lightness also carries well with salads and summer food. Think charcuterie boards laden with spicy salami, salty prosciutto, and garlicky mortadella. The slight sweetness to Thatchers Katy cuts through the saltiness of prosciutto beautifully. Hand-held picnic food – scotch eggs, sausage rolls, and pork pies – tends to be savoury-heavy, so goes down a treat with a sweet cider, paired best with a sunset view, of course. But it also mixes well with fruity dishes – a salad sprinkled with glistening pomegranate seeds and topped with ripe avocado. The delicate fizz works particularly well with the creamy squish of avocado. Meat and salad, barbecues and picnic food it’s as though Thatchers Katy was designed for summer. So, it’s no wonder cider is the British summer drink of choice it pairs naturally with grilled meat and fruity salads, it’s easy to drink, and that hit of sweet apple sings of good times. For me, cider evokes memories of barbecues with friends and family, sunsets over the sea and picnics in the park, and Thatchers Katy is my cider of choice this summer, for its strawberry sweetness and crisp finish. If you need me, I’ll be sipping a cold cider in the park, or on my way to the shore, two bottles clinking away and cooling my back. To better times.

Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireAfter another week of reverses and confusion along with some gains in our pandemic odyssey, there is one truth that trumps all others.Vaccines work against Covid-19, and the sooner we get them to people the sooner this crisis will pass. The job of politicians and health officials is to get as many people immunised as possible as quickly as possible.The real-world evidence is there for any doubters. In Israel, with more than 60 per cent of the population vaccinated, the requirement to wear masks outdoors ends this weekend. The UK, well ahead of us in terms of doses delivered, opened up this week after cases and deaths fell to a six-month low.Ireland is behind overall but our early efforts have been concentrated in specific vulnerable groups, and these are starting to reap the benefits.There were no outbreaks in long-term care facilities last week, for the first time since July. You have to go back to August for a time when case numbers among healthcare workers and over-85s were as low as they are now.We have gone from a “glass half empty” to a “glass half full” situation in the space of a few weeks. Certainly, people’s willingness to continue limiting their social contacts has helped reduce case numbers, but wider vaccination is the factor that made the difference.Yet the week was dominated by concerns about rare reported side effects of the AstraZeneca and Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccines and the messy introduction of mandatory hotel quarantine.Concerns about these rare clotting events are real, but decisions about what to do were made without due regard for the practical fallout. Despite supposedly singing off the same data-sheet, regulators in Europe managed to arrive at multiple different decisions about the AstraZeneca vaccine – some carried on as before, Denmark stopped its use completely, while other countries including Ireland imposed age thresholds, which themselves varied from country to country.Strange scienceOur experts decided to stop using AstraZeneca in people under 60, even though your average 25-year-old was more than three times more likely to die in a road collision than to suffer serious side effects from the vaccine.Though it was not an easy decision make, it was surprising to hear acting chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn say the age threshold could just as easily have been lower than 60.Where is the science in that, or in the “abundance of caution” espoused by the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet), when the threat posed by Covid-19 is so much greater for most of us?The result is that AstraZeneca is now deemed fit for blanket use on the 60-69-year-old group alone, and many of in this group are sceptical. “Not old enough to be very vulnerable but not young enough to be very valuable,” said one doctor, describing the “reticence” felt by her family members about the vaccine.The cautious approach advocated by Nphet has saved lives, while forcing the closure of large swathes of the economy for months. But a resistance to change has led us down some strange paths, such as tolerating the arrival of Italian rugby fans in Dublin at the start of the first wave, or delaying the use of masks to protect against the virus, or refusing to believe Covid-19 is an airborne disease.Now, rapid antigen testing is being introduced in third-level colleges, but not until September, when hopefully it won’t be much needed.The fiasco of mandatory hotel quarantine shows real life is more complicated than any theoretical model. People were happy enough forcing nameless foreigners into a hotel room for a fortnight but when those affected were Irish people with dying parents or surrogate children, things took on a different complexion.Half-islandProne to evasion and already chock-full of exemptions, the system shows how hard a real “zero-Covid” policy would be to implement on our half-island.Was earlier talk of another surge warranted? Just a few weeks ago, unnamed Government Ministers were briefing journalists on the possibility of 1,000 cases a day, but this never materialised. Taoiseach Micheál Martin told us the UK variant (B117) was “significantly more dangerous”, but Irish figures and recent studies show it isn’t.B117, which is more transmissible, hit us for six after Christmas but since then it has been crowding out other problematic variants, an upside that is often overlooked.“Scariants”, as they have been named by one US commentator, have become a media trope. Every day brings a new report of some hair-raising mutation, such as the “double mutation” variant from India, reported on Friday.Ignore most of these reports. It is perfectly normal for a virus to change and for hundreds of variants to emerge. Only a handful of Covid-19 variants have been designated “variants of concern” – including those from the UK, South Africa and Brazil.The fact is the vaccines protect greatly against the risk of contracting the virus and provide excellent protection against serious illness, regardless of variant. They also seem to reduce transmission.Instead of feeding fear, we should be unwinding it. Rather than telling people what they cannot do, we should be planning for what they will be able to do. That means dates, risk stratification, clear targets and co-ordination with our neighbours.We can start by allowing fully vaccinated people to enjoy the benefits of their status.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker what s available in the republic of ireland and what else is coming","story":"It has been almost a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 200,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,000 people have died.Globally, over 100 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Scientists have been racing to develop a vaccine that would bring an end to the pandemic, and there are now 64 different vaccines in clinical development, with another 173 in preclinical development, according to the World Health Organisation.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspis also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva. 325,243 had received their second dose.Some 192,095 of these vaccines had gone to people in long term residential care facilities, while 347,313 had gone to frontline healthcare workers and 478,879 had gone to people over the age of 70. Some\u0026nbsp76,331 people in Cohort 4 - those\u0026nbspaged between 16 and 69 at very high risk of severe Covid-19 disease - received a dose.\u0026nbspGlobally, over 800 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine have been administered.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine. \u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and expects to have its first results by April 2021. On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?In December the HSE published the provisional order in which people in Ireland will be vaccinated against Covid-19. After over-65s in care homes and frontline health workers, people aged 70 and older and other healthcare workers are next in line to receive the vaccine.\u0026nbspPeople aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions will then be\u0026nbspthe fourth cohort to be vaccinated.On March 30th, the Cabinet agreed to change the National Vaccination Programme to an age-based system, once those aged 70 years and older, people considered vulnerable and those with underlying conditions are immunised. The original programme involved 15 cohorts of people based on age and profession, with key workers prioritised.The vaccination of people aged over 85 began on Monday, February 15th. Those in the 70-84 age bracket began to receive their first dose on March 8th, alongside people aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions.The HSE has said everyone over the age of 70 should have received their second dose by mid-May.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonald faces questions over sf s facebook practices and voter database","story":"Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has been called  to answer questions about the potential targeting of voters on Facebook and the online database maintained by the party. Photograph:  Gareth ChaneyCollinsSo far, Sinn Féin has declined to reveal where its Abú canvassing system is hosted on computer services in the European Union, who has access to the data, and what security procedures are in place.It has also not answered questions about a document in which party officials were told to use personal information posted on social media by members of the public to canvass a voters’ home address.The party has said that “all data is stored on servers based in the EU and handled in accordance with GDPR”. The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner has sought answers to questions it has posed to Sinn Féin.Calling for answers from the Sinn Féin leader, Minister for Higher Education Simon Harris said: “Social media is an important platform for public discourse and for debate and for politicians engaging.“It is deeply concerning that anyone would breach the trust of our citizens – including potentially young voters by allegedly using such information in a way it was never intended for.‘Absolute nonsense’“It is time for the Sinn Féin Leader to answer questions on this and to prove the clarity and information that has not been forthcoming since this issue first emerged,” Mr Harris told The .Joining the call, Fianna Fáil’s Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath said: “If the shoe was on the other foot and these questions were being raised by the State’s watchdog in relation to Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael or any other party, Sinn Féin would be shouting from high heaven.”Minister for Justice Helen McEntee said that she would expect that “Sinn Féin would respond in a quick and an efficient way to all of the questions that are asked of them”.Sinn Féin TD Pearse Doherty said on RTÉ’s Claire Byrne Show yesterday that it is “absolute nonsense” to say that the party was scanning people’s comments on Facebook and he said there is “no data harvesting” in relation to that.However, in an internal document, members were told that “Facebook is king” and that they should elicit more information from users so they can “tag them as social media engaged and follow up with a canvass on their doorstep”.Anyone with access to the system can record whether there is “hard support” from a person, “soft support”, “strong opposition”, whether it is “unknown” or whether they were not in during a canvass.Data experts have also generally queried whether holding information on a database about voters’ intentions is within the bounds of GDPR laws which generally prohibits this except for a small number of exemptions.A spokesman for Fine Gael said that the party does not have any such database.

Photograph: BBC Spotlight Jack Gray, who was interviewed for  Spotlight – A Contested Centenary The Gray family at Altnaveigh in 1907, 15 years before one of them was killed and their house burned downPeter Heathwood, who was  interviewed for Spotlight – A Contested CentenaryThe sight of Protestant and Catholic teenagers attacking the PSNI close to the Belfast peace line brought back memories of decades past. But which decade? The Belfast City Hall Union Flag dispute of 2012 and 2013?The Drumcree crises of the mid 1990s? The early days of the Troubles in 1969? Or even older days: the intense violence which accompanied partition of the island and the creation of Northern Ireland in the early 1920s?If I am tempted to cast my net back 100 years, that’s because – when the latest riots erupted – I was deep into an exploration of the violence of the 1920s and its aftermath for BBC Northern Ireland. Back in 1989 I made a film for BBC Spotlight about Northern Ireland’s contentious anniversaries. Then I had been able to talk to Orangemen as they set off on their marches and to visit schools to learn what version of history was on the syllabus. In 2021, that was clearly a non-starter, though I found youngsters who are part of the Newgate Arts Centre in LondonderryDerry’s Fountain Estate who marked the centenary with a socially-distanced performance. However, they were the exception. Most events are happening online, or delayed.Reading the history of the creation of Northern Ireland (Alan Parkinson’s A Difficult Birth was a great place to start), I was struck by the similarities between the violence of the 1920s and the Troubles I covered in the 1980s and ’90s.Some of Belfast’s sectarian flashpoints in the 1920s are the same street corners where I stood with camera crews 70 years later. Then, I had talked, too, to Protestants living close to the Border who felt the same fear and vulnerability their forebears had decades before. And then there were Catholic complaints in the 1980s and later about collusion between the security forces and Loyalist paramilitaries. In the 1920s, their ancestors had done so about the Royal Irish Constabulary and the Ulster Specials.Reprisal gangsRather than supplying information to others, sometimes they formed their own reprisal gangs willing to murder Catholic civilians in supposed retaliation for IRA attacks. Their superiors generally seemed to turn a blind eye.Initially, the fact that the present mirrored the past was just an academic observation. Soon, though, I began meeting people who put faces and names to what had previously seemed the dusty details of distant history. People such as Jack Gray, a sprightly 81-year-old who told me about what had befallen his own father Nevin and his Uncle Joseph. They were just 18 and 20 in June 1922 when the Dundalk IRA hammered on the door of their home near the hamlet of Altnaveigh on the outskirts of Newry. The family home was burned to the ground and young Joseph shot dead. A rare family photograph, taken in 1907, captures the boys in happier times petting their dog.His father was traumatised by witnessing the murder of his brother, but never spoke of if later: “There was never any hatred,” Jack recalls. “We lived in a mixed area, we played with everybody, our neighbours were mixed, they were friends of ours. There were never any signs of hate or vengeance.”The Altnaveigh massacre – in which five Protestant men and one woman were killed – hit headlines then. So, too, did the murder of five members of the Catholic McMahon family and an employee in March 1922. The brutal slaying of prominent businessman Owen McMahon and his sons at their substantial town house in North Belfast was the work of a notorious police reprisal gang. The horror that lay behind such deaths has meant that the stories have flowed through the decades. But outside of his family circle, hardly anyone has heard of Thomas Heathwood, a 17- year-old who was killed in the same month as the McMahons about a mile away in Carrickhill at the bottom of the Shankill Road. A butcher’s apprentice, he had been out on his delivery bike when he was gunned down by a loyalist sniper. When Thomas’s inquest was held it was one of 19 cases that day up for the coroner’s consideration. The book Facts and Figures of the Belfast Pogrom, written by a Belfast priest Fr John Hassan under the pseudonym GB Kenna, is the nearest 1920s equivalent to the Troubles’ celebrated testament to the dead, Lost Lives. However, the book actually gets Thomas’s name wrong, listing him as “Eastwood” not “Heathwood”. Even the street corner on which Thomas died is no longer there as the Carrickhill area has on two separate occasions been bulldozed and redeveloped. Mistaken identityThe only reason I heard about Thomas was that I got chatting to Peter Heathwood, a remarkable man who is both the curator of an extraordinary video archive of the Troubles and a campaigner for a pension for the severely injured.In 1979, a loyalist gunman left Peter paralysed, in a case of mistaken identity. Peter told me that, as he lay in his hospital bed, his uncle Austin had engaged in a bit of black humour, joking: “Why didn’t you get offside like I did?” Austin had escaped a loyalist ambush in the 1920s by urging his horse and cart forward at a gallop. Peter’s father’s cousin Thomas had not been so lucky.When we talk about “tit-for-tat” in Northern Ireland we normally mean short term retaliation – petrol bomb for petrol bomb, bullet for bullet. But as I talked to Peter I realised that bullets and unresolved arguments over Northern Ireland’s identity have ricocheted through the generations, blighting what should have been long lives and happy homes. So far I have not found a photograph of young Thomas, but I was able to show Peter documents from the Irish government archives which provided much more detail about what had happened to the teenager than Peter and his family had realised. The Heathwoods are not the only family to have their lives shattered once, only for it to happen again. On Spotlight we also hear from Valerie Lockhart whose great grandparents, Thomas and Elizabeth Crozier, were murdered in Altnaveigh in 1922. Fifty years later, Valerie’s cousin, Robert Chambers, was the youngest victim of the Kingsmills massacre when republican gunmen slaughtered a group of Protestant workmen. Valerie’s grandmother sensed something was wrong when Robert, who waved to her every evening on his way home from work, did not pass by her window at the usual time. “On both sides of my family,” Valerie told me, “we’ve had some sense of the atrocities that went on.”Examining a contentious landmark such as Northern Ireland’s centenary, one realises that it as much about the future as the past. The 1921 Border was deliberately drawn to create a 2-to-1 Protestant majority. This year’s Northern Ireland census could confirm that those days are over.Such a moment will fuel talk of a Border poll. Equally, there is a curious symmetry that 100 years on Unionists are now fretting over the imposition of an economic sea border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. However, believers in a United Ireland may do well to remember that in 1921 their predecessors thought a Boundary Commission would soon render the new Border a temporary construct, and it’s still there a hundred years on. With all this in mind, I spoke to those who may hold our destinies in our hands, including Taoiseach Micheál Martin, prime minister Boris Johnson and Stormont’s First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill.Flag waversMeanwhile, I found two people whose unionist ancestors had signed the Ulster Covenant in 1912, but who nine years later came to very different conclusions about Irish unity. In addition, we will unveil the results of a major cross-Border opinion poll on the future. Inevitably, though, it is the tragic human stories which stick in my mind. Reflecting on the loss of 17-year-old Thomas back in 1922, Peter Heathwood worries about this month’s rioting teenagers and what the future might hold for his own 14 grandchildren. Urging youngsters on both sides not to listen to “flag wavers” who want to “whip these young lads up”, he warned that “it’s never them that pays the price”. He hopes he will be proven wrong, but is pessimistic, fearing what a Border poll could bring.If unionism loses such a referendum, he fears for the consequences. “Do you honestly think that won’t cause violence?” he ask me. Then before I can attempt an answer, he adds: “No chance”. It’s a bleak assessment, a scenario which both the British and Irish governments hope will never be put to the test, but a concern many may share after this month’s rioting. Let’s hope that one hundred years on, we still will not be repeating our fractured history. Spotlight – A Contested Centenary is on BBC One Northern Ireland on Tuesday April 20th at 9pm.

It’s a pleasant half-hour as he spins around the picturesque middle-of-nowhere, stopping along the way to lapse into wooden set-piece interviews with local historians and musicians while he explores the storied past of these abandoned rural lines.The series has been described by some green-eyed politicians as one long pat on the back to Enda from Enda, who constantly prompts his interviewees to agree how the vibrant heyday of steam trains bringing business and opportunity to far-flung and overlooked regions is now being repeated in the 21st century with the success of the new greenway cycling and walking networks.And guess who was a leading light in getting them off, or on, the ground? That would be Enda Kenny, who misses no opportunity to talk about what a wonderful asset they are to local communities and to the world.“A lovely day on the first greenway in the country,” a windswept and shaggy-haired Enda told his viewers before setting off from Westport to Achill, a trail he launched soon after becoming taoiseach in 2011.In 2013, then Labour leader Brendan Howlin told the Dáil everyone was aware of the success of the great western greenway because the Taoiseach talked about it so much.But the Great Western Greenway was actually launched in 2010 by Fianna Fáil’s then transport minister Noel Dempsey, who opened the first phase from Newport to Mulranney. The completed route was launched the following year, to great fanfare, by then-taoiseach Kenny, with the enthusiastic help of his glamorous assistant Michael Ring.Unlike the old railway lines, the Fianna Fáil connection will never be abandoned if Eamon Ó Cuív has anything to do with it. He informed the Dáil in 2012 he was delighted to see Enda Kenny so in favour of the Mayo greenway “because I was the one who, as minister for community, rural and Gaeltacht affairs, first promoted the idea of using abandoned and disused railway lines, both those in State ownership and those where the land had been sold back to the people, as cycle-walk ways”.Five years later in 2017, he returned to the subject. “I proposed the development of the greenway along the line from Westport to Achill – I have the newspaper cutting in that regard from the year in question.”Success has many masters.Despite repeatedly emphasising he has no interest in running for the presidency, Enda’s return to the limelight has fuelled speculation.Are ye right there, Enda, are ye right? Do you think you have the Áras in your sights? Ye’ve been so long in denying That ye might be shrewdly tryin Still ye might go, Enda, so ye might . . .The Irish Parliamentary Women’s Caucus has written to the Dáil Business Committee ahead of its meeting on Tuesday urging members to adopt a new plan for the sitting week.It’s been a higgledy-piggledy pandemic for the Oireachtas, with Dáil and Seanad sittings taking place on different days in separate buildings.The current arrangement has the Seanad meeting in the Dáil Chamber on Monday and Friday, and the Dáil convening across the Liffey in the Dublin Convention Centre on Wednesday and Thursday. This solves the double staffing conundrum presented by the two Houses requiring the same level of support services but in separate locations.Committees are held on Tuesday, with members participating online from their offices in Leinster House.Back in the olden days before Deviris came on the scene and changed everything, the committees went about their work while the two Houses were in session.In an effort to streamline proceedings the Leinster House authorities have recommended changing the timetable to allow the Seanad sit on Monday and Tuesday, followed by the Dáil on the next two days. Committees would be accommodated in the new plan, and the Senators, particularly those who have to travel long distances to get to Dublin, wouldn’t have such a disjointed working week.The proposal has been outlined to the Business Committee, which oversees the Dáil schedule. The 10-man cross-party group (there are no women on it) has yet to formally decide whether to adopt it, but early rumblings indicate resistance to the move from some members who are worried that moving the Seanad sitting back to Tuesday would free up Friday, thus holding out the possibility of a third day of Dáil business should the need arise.Friday is a sacrosanct constituency day for most TDs, and it seems the mere thought of putting it in jeopardy has induced a mild case of the collywobbles among some on the committee.But in its letter the Women’s Caucus points to the newly-established Forum on Family Friendly and Inclusive Parliament, and says it makes sense for mams and dads to attend the Seanad on consecutive days rather than having to make travel arrangements at either end of the working week.Continuity is all well and good, but frontloading the parliamentary week with two servings of Senators discussing the major political issues – often with Ministers in attendance – while the Dáil remains silent may not go down well with TDs used to getting all the attention.Meanwhile, the caucus has had a busy few days of it. On Thursday night it hosted an event with its Northern Irish counterpart to mark the 23rd anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement.“Our Shared Island: Women’s Voices in Peacebuilding” brought together the chairperson of the Oireachtas Women’s Parliamentary caucus Senator Fiona O’Loughlin and the Northern Ireland Assembly Women’s caucus chairperson Clare Bailey alongside women’s coalition founders Monica McWilliams and Avila Kilmurray and Ireland’s UN youth delegate Tara Grace Connolly.Former Progressive Democrats minister Liz O’Donnell, who was part of the Irish government’s negotiating team in 1998, also took part in the discussion on women’s participation in politics and peacebuilding then and now, North-South co-operation and the barriers facing women who want to get involved.Over 200 people took part in the online event, facilitated by the National Women’s Council of Ireland, and afterwards the two caucuses pledged to work together on the development of a shared manifesto for women in politics in Ireland.It’s not all one-way traffic even if the heavy flow from media outlets in the direction of Government Buildings might suggest otherwise.Deputy Government Press officer Ian Carey, a former journalist turned Green Party communications head honcho, is stepping back from national politics “to mind the two kids and go back to being a councillor”.Carey, who is a member of Fingal County Council representing Swords, worked for the Daily Mail before establishing his green credentials with stints in the Brussels-based European Environmental Bureau, one of the largest environmental NGOs in Europe, and the Irish Environmental Network in Dublin.He went on to manage communications for the Greens in the two years before the party entered coalition.He described the move from the party head office in Nassau Street, where there was water leaking through the ceiling which they held back with Ciarán Cuffe posters, to the grandeur of Government Buildings as “a bit of a change”, but it heralded the start of “one hell of a whirlwind of a year”.Carey says working at the highest level in politics has been an honour. “I’m very lucky to have had a chance to be in here. It’s been a mad year but it’s been fantastic.”However, with his wife’s job gearing up again after a long pandemic lull he wants to step back and spend more time with his young family and give more attention to his council work.He won’t be leaving the Greens in the lurch though, and will stay on until a replacement is found.

Dear God, somebody could get killed in the avalanche of hacks stampeding to lob in expressions of interest.It’s been all of two weeks since Indo columnist Colette Browne departed for a job with the Social Democrats.So we are long overdue another defection.Speaking of county councillors and career moves, congratulations to Cllr Jackie Healy-Rae jnr who has just opened his first shop, following in the fine family tradition of multi-tasking on the business and political front.Jackie’s new venture in Killarney’s Scott’s Street is an American-style ice-cream parlour called Shake Waffle and Roll, and he threw open the doors on Friday.The 26-year-old son of TD Michael Healy-Rae and nephew of TD Danny Healy-Rae represents the Castleisland local authority area on Kerry County Council, and is employed by his father as his parliamentary assistant in Leinster House.“It’s been a long road but delighted to finally have it finished, just in time for the first weekend of full county travel. It also feels great to be creating 5 new jobs in a time of such doom and gloom, the shop will be one full of positivity and fun,” Jackie told his Facebook followers.The music themed menu offers a selection of shakes, waffles, smoothies, ice-rolls and sundaes.Doubtless more ice-cream shops are to follow, but Cllr Healy-Rae has some way to go before he reaches the millionaire bracket of Michael and Danny.It comes as no surprise to see this young politician branching out into business - he didn’t lick it off the cones, as the saying goes."},{"url":null,"title":"jennifer bray what s the story with sinn f%C3%A9in s voter database","story":"Sinn Féin has denied it is falling foul of data laws by maintaining a sophisticated database which records a person’s level of support for the party and when they last voted.The party has maintained its Abú canvassing system is merely the electoral register, which is made available to political parties and elected representatives for electoral purposes as a part of the democratic process.The difference between the electoral register and the Abú system is the fact it contains additional markings on a voter’s political leanings.Anyone with access to the system – and the party has not answered questions around who exactly can log in to the portal – can record whether there is “hard support” from a person, “soft support”, “strong opposition”, whether it is “unknown” or whether they were not in during a canvass.Solicitor Simon McGarr, a director of Data Compliance Europe, has pointed out that Article 9 of the GDPR creates a general prohibition on processing data on people’s political opinions.Political opinionsHe says that while the national law – the Data Protection Act of 2018 – allows for the processing of personal data revealing political opinions where it is done in the course of electoral activities, this goes much further than what GDPR allows for.In that instance, such processing of information is allowed only when “the operation of the democratic system in a member state requires that political parties compile personal data on people’s political opinions.”“The political system has, until now, taken a taken an identity approach: if you are a party or electoral candidate, it was suggested that you are exempt in all your political data processing. But, in fact, the GDPR only allows for a limited and purpose-based exemption,” he said.This is likely to be one of a range of issues that the Data Protection Commissioner will want to address in correspondence with Sinn Féin.One of the first questions that will likely be asked will be the legal basis that the party is relying on to operate the system. It is understood the office is also particularly interested in the issue of user consent and knowledge.Last week, the Sunday Independent reported that party officials are being told to use personal information posted on social media to identify voters’ home addresses.‘Facebook is king’Members are told “Facebook is king” and members should elicit more information from users so they can “tag them as social media engaged and follow up with a canvass on their doorstep”, according to an internal document.This is another area the Data Protection Commissioner will explore in these preliminary talks with Sinn Féin, with questions likely around how it uses the data and if users are aware how their public data is being processed. A decision on whether a further investigation is needed could come as early as next week.The  also asked Sinn Féin where exactly in the EU the database is hosted but the party declined to answer.“All data is stored on servers based in the EU and handled in accordance with GDPR. We have received correspondence from the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner in relation to this and we look forward to engaging with them,” a spokesman said.Liz Carolan, an executive director with Digital Action, said the lack of clarity around the issue shows the need for an electoral commission.“This type of campaign technology is in widespread use in lots of parts of the world, and it was only a matter of time before it became a part of politics in Ireland. The issue here is that we haven’t planned for it, established if and how we want it to be used, and set up consistent rules for transparency and for what can and can’t be done,” she said.Campaign tech could help with voter engagement and mobilisation, but there was far greater potential for misuse than in traditional campaigning, she noted.“It is also often not transparent by default, like door-knocking or posters are, and parties naturally enough won’t want to give away their trade secrets in an election unless they are compelled to. As it stands, expenditure and activity outside of Ireland doesn’t fall under electoral rules, which isn’t practical in a digital age,” Ms Carolan added."},{"url":null,"title":"under 30s may get vaccinated earlier to reduce spread of covid 19","story":"The Government will outline in two weeks’ time what restrictions will be removed over the month of May. Photograph: Getty ImagesPeople under the age of 30 may get vaccinated earlier in order to reduce the spread of coronavirus ahead of the wider reopening of society, under proposals currently being examined by the Department of Health.Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly has asked officials to examine the possibility of revising the order of age cohorts scheduled to receive the vaccine so that younger people in the 18-30 age group would get their shots before those aged 30-50, once those in their 60s are vaccinated.Some senior officials fear a spike in cases among younger people once society begins to reopen, as under-30s are more likely than other age groups to socialise together in large numbers.“I’ve asked the department to assess the case for vaccinating younger cohorts earlier, on the basis of reducing overall transmission as quickly as possible,” Mr Donnelly told The .The proposal comes as Government prepares to decide on further reopening after the May bank holiday.RestrictionsThe Government will outline in two weeks’ time what restrictions will be removed over the month of May “on the principle of what opens stays open”, a source said. This will include non-essential retail and personal services.Taoiseach Micheál Martin has indicated that the month of June could see the reopening of hotels and guesthouses. Sources said a plan for the resumption of outdoor hospitality is currently being worked on before indoor hospitality returns, but firm dates have not yet been set.Intensive discussions are taking place about further changes to the vaccination programme. Though it is understood there is significant resistance to the move from some public health doctors and vaccination experts, there is a push from the political side of Government to extend the interval between doses of the vaccine.This would enable more people to benefit from the protection offered by a first shot of the vaccine, an approach that has helped the United Kingdom reach huge numbers of people with an initial dose. The Department of Health is currently carrying out an impact analysis of widening the interval beyond the current four weeks.Meanwhile, amid ongoing frustration over the political and practical difficulties associated with mandatory hotel quarantine, some senior Government figures believe exemptions to the system may grow to include issues such as family bereavement, surrogacy, family illness and essential work, and that increased testing will go hand in hand with a greater role for home quarantine and less reliance on the hotel system.The Government is understood to be considering plans to recognise vaccine certificates from other jurisdictions as grounds for exemption from hotel quarantine – but only for vaccines approved by the European Medicines Agency.Earlier on Friday, it was announced by the department that the Red Cow Moran Hotel has been added to the locations to be used for the mandatory hotel quarantine.Hotel quarantineMeanwhile, the European Commission has given Ireland 10 days to respond to a letter outlining “concerns” about mandatory hotel quarantine.It comes after Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, Italy and France were added to the so-called “red list”, provoking a furious reaction from ambassadors.The commission has asked for clarification on how countries are selected for the red list, as the five are not the areas with the highest infection rates in the European Union.In a statement on Friday, the department said that the expert travel advisory group takes into account countries with outbreaks involving known variants of concern, countries with a very high 14-day incidence and countries with a high 14-day incidence.Ireland’s 14-day incidence of the disease now stands at 119 cases per 100,000 people nationally.A further 11 deaths of Covid-19 patients were reported by the National Public Health Emergency Team on Friday.

Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Brandon Lewis earlier this week dismissed the idea that the intergovernmental conference should meet to discuss recent unrest in the North, on the grounds that policing is among the powers devolved to Stormont. The intergovernmental conference was established under the Belfast Agreement as a forum for co-operation between the two governments on Northern Ireland. It has not met since Boris Johnson became British prime minister.Mr Coveney was in London holding meetings with key political figures including Lord Frost, in what Mr Coveney described as “a very good meeting . . . on a personal level” and “a good, honest engagement that explored in some detail some of the issues in terms of what’s possible and what’s not”.Brussels and London remain far apart on some issues, with Britain seeking flexibility while the commission has said pragmatic solutions can be found only if the Northern Ireland protocol is implemented fully.

During a family Zoom call with parents, siblings and various toddlers periodically summoned to wave into the camera, I broached the subject of Christmas.Should we have it at my parents’ house in Meath, or at my aunt’s in Castleknock in Dublin? What were the plans for Stephen’s Day?My usually loquacious mother was suspiciously quiet. Let’s see, she mumbled, moving swiftly on.Having been stranded in the United States since the pandemic began I was hankering to visit Ireland. Though the summer of 2020 saw a relentless increase in Covid-19 cases in Donald Trump’s America, people were on the move. Not us, however. The US travel ban introduced in March had prohibited inbound transit for most non-permanent residents. While there were exclusions for some visa holders, foreign journalists on specific visas were not exempt – not surprising given the former president’s views on the media. I was free to leave the US but not return. With an Australian husband desperate to see family in England and Sydney, our plight was even more acute.I enviously watched as my green card-holding friends flew to Dublin. All quarantined at home on arrival they assured me, but at least they could travel. Reported sightings of baseball hat-wearing tourists with American accents wandering around Kerry filled me with envy.I found my inner activist, taking it upon myself to write letters to ambassadors and ministers in Ireland and the US. Quoting Ireland’s history of emigration to the country, in one particularly passionate missive to the State Department I declared that nothing less than the US’s status as the bastion of democracy was at stake.Remembering my days as an EU correspondent, I seized on the Brussels strategy of aligning oneself with bigger, more powerful countries. Together with a Spanish journalist friend we co-opted a group of European journalists to make our case to the authorities, but to no avail.Irish and European diplomats in Washington ducked when they saw me coming, worried I would regale them with yet another detailed explanation of the injustices of the US’s visa system. Never had the plight of the undocumented felt so real.As the summer came and went I realised more desperate measures were needed. I triumphantly booked a 22-hour flight leaving from Dublin to Mexico City via Madrid on St Stephen’s Day – under the rules I could enter the United States if I spent 14 days in a country not on the travel ban list. I spent hours selecting lavish hotels in Cancún on offer for a snip, blithely ignoring the rocketing Covid case numbers in Mexico. Many hours were spent ruminating over how I could pack efficiently for Christmas in Ireland and a Caribbean beach holiday. It could be done, I assured myself.In October, partly to allow foreign journalists in to cover the presidential election, changes were made to the foreign media visa scheme. Holders could now apply for exemptions to re-enter the country. Gone were the plans for Mexico, as I frantically sought a refund from Iberia Airlines. Instead, my mind was filled with images of glasses of Baileys, Leopardstown festivities and sitting by a Bord na Móna fire dressed in a yet-to-be-acquired Aran jumper.\u0026nbspBut the mood at home was changing. With Ireland’s Covid numbers creeping up, I detected a growing disquiet on the weekly Zoom calls. Siblings were ided on the appropriateness of me travelling home. One mentioned the national interest as he urged me to reconsider. My mother’s silence said a multitude, as her mind worked overtime to work out ways of sequestering me from the citizens of Trim, in the fear I would be spotted in public having flown in from the US.Eventually, the decision was made for me. We both got Covid, me in the US, my husband during a long-awaited visit to the UK.“We’re thrilled”, my mother declared, as I announced that it meant I would not be travelling home, no doubt relieved that the prospect of social ostracisation had receded.And so it was with dismay that I absorbed last week’s announcement that travellers from the US would be required to quarantine in a hotel, even the fully-vacccinated like myself. But barely a week later there was hope once more, as the Minister for Health announced that exceptions for vaccinated people were forthcoming.

Allegations stretching back to the 1960s encompassed a wide spectrum of physical abuse, much of which had sadistic and sexual overtones, it said.Ten iniduals linked to the schools, mainly monks, have been cautioned or convicted over sexual activity or pornography offences involving a large number of children. It was feared that the “restriction order” - which was issued in November and prohibited any new students joining -  would spell a death warrant for the 200-year-old school.But on Friday night Ampleforth College was told that the ban has now been removed by the Education Secretary.The decision came after Ofsted inspectors visited the school last month and reported that they were satisfied with the school’s progress.In addition to this, DfE officials signed off on an action plan Ampleforth had submitted which set out their “long-term commitment to safeguarding excellence”.  Robin Dyer, headmaster of Ampleforth College, said he welcomes the news that they can admit students again.“However, notwithstanding the fact that our outcomes remain good - our students are happy and safe, and our parents overwhelmingly endorse the College - it is a simple truth that any criticism of our safeguarding policies and practice must be taken with the utmost seriousness,” he said.“We welcome scrutiny as an opportunity to improve. It is our intention to be the best we can be in all areas of education, to continually progress, and to work positively with all stakeholders to achieve this aim.“We are excited about the future and the prospect of equipping our students with the skills and attitudes that enable them to navigate the challenges of today’s society safely and happily.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"far right extremist convicted unacceptable views","story":"A far right sympathiser, who used social media to call for a race war, has been convicted of hate crime offences following an investigation by Counter Terrorism Police.Tobias Powell, 32, from Bognor Regis in West Sussex, published a series of tweets between July and October 2018 in which he showed support for the banned terror group, National Action.In one post he called for a “civil war to stop the ethnic suicide of white people” and shared picture of a Nazi tattoo he had.He was arrested at his home in February 2019 by counter terrorism police who seized various items including electronic devices and literature on white supremacy.Police later discovered that he had set up his computer username as Adolf Hitler and had written to Theresa May, the then Prime Minister, calling her a “snake” over the “Brexit stitch up”.In a tweet on 6 July 2018 Powell mentioned Jo Cox, the MP who was murdered by a far right extremist, describing her as a “traitor and enemy of the people”.Police said while the offences did not constitute terrorism, they showed that he held some “very unacceptable views”Appearing at Worthing Magistrates’ Court, Powell was found guilty of four counts of using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour intending to stir up racial hatred.Detective Chief Superintendent Kath Barnes, Head of Counter Terrorism Policing South East, said: “The evidence gathered during the investigation showed that Powell had some very unacceptable views. “Whilst this was not a terrorism case, the nature of the rhetoric Powell had shared on social media, meant that it was only right for specialist officers from Counter Terrorism Policing to conduct a thorough investigation. “We know there is a fine line between hate speech and terrorism. Showing support for terrorist organisations is not acceptable and if you do that, you should expect to be investigated by us.”Chief Inspector Jon Carter, from Sussex Police, added: “This case shows the importance of thorough investigation of any use of the Internet to spread hate and dangerous material. “The public can be reassured that there are systems in place to follow up all such reports, but it is also important to reassure local people that this was a very isolated matter for this area, and that however obnoxious Powell’s language was, there was no reference to or threat to the local community.”   Powell is due to be sentenced at Portsmouth Crown Court on 14 May. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day walrus snooze time svalbard","story":"A large male walrus sleeps on a piece of floating ice in Svalbard, Norway, lit by the midnight sun.

What’s perhaps less appreciated, though, is how much he enjoyed a gentle joke at his own expense.I discovered this for myself 15 years ago. In my role as the ’s front page cartoonist for the last 30-odd years, occasionally the subjects of my jokes will get in touch and ask for the original artwork. I’ve sent cartoons to prime ministers, celebrities and all manner of other public figures, but until April 2006, never to Buckingham Palace.That month, the Queen turned 80, and received some 20,000 birthday cards. I don’t often draw cartoons about the Royal family, but it felt appropriate to mark the occasion. And so I did, with this cartoon depicting two footmen perusing cards displayed on a mantelpiece in the Palace:I didn’t think much of it, though a reader got in touch to lightly admonish me for being disgracefully disrespectful in joking about the Queen’s age. Not long afterwards, however, I received a letter from the Palace, stating that they loved the cartoon and someone – I think the subtext was “someone very senior” – had requested I send the original. Enjoyably, I was able to tell the disgruntled reader that I was sorry they’d been offended, but if it was any comfort, the butt of the joke clearly felt otherwise…That moment was a thrill, but a while later I was invited to lunch at Buckingham Palace. It was me, five or six other people, the Duke and the Queen. I was petrified, as anyone in that position might be, but the nerves only lasted while we waited for their arrival. When they entered the room, the tension seemed to dissipate. I expect that’s the effect they have on a lot of people – in anticipation, they’re terrifying in reality, their great skill is putting a room instantly at ease.I was seated next to Prince Philip, who was exactly as you might imagine: funny, charming, relaxed, mildly cantankerous. Everybody else was served wine but, as was often his wont at lunchtime, he had a beer. I was a little jealous – I quite fancied a beer, too, but changing my order probably wouldn’t have been the done thing.Funnily enough, there was a boat stuck on a sandbank outside of Portsmouth that week – not unlike the recent Suez Canal logjam. The Duke, with all his naval expertise, was explaining at length just what the crew had done wrong, putting them straight on this and that, and generally proving that, even in his mid-80s, his maritime knowledge was undimmed.I also recall a wonderful rant about all the banquets he’s had to attend around the world. In some places, the Duke told me, the staff would even move his cutlery for him, and he found that infuriating. “I’m perfectly capable of moving my own fork when I want it,” he huffed. In a way, it would have been disappointing to lunch with Prince Philip and not hear him bluster.When lunch came to an end, I was asked if I would have coffee with the Queen. (I say asked at those sorts of events, who you speak to is largely based on instruction from staff.)In another room, as I gingerly drank a cup of black coffee, the Queen told me how the geese were ruining her lawn at Sandringham. I suggested she have William and Harry shoot them, which made her laugh. At the time, I hadn’t yet moved to Norfolk, which is a shame, as then I could have said: “We must have you to ours next…”The Queen later remembered my grandfather, VS Pritchett, to whom she awarded membership to the Order of the Companions of Honour in 1992, and seemed thrilled to have worked out that connection. I have been on a high ever since that day. I think I floated back to the office afterwards, but do remember bumping into a colleague in the street who asked if I’d been out to lunch. Had I ever…Throughout his life, Prince Philip was an enthusiastic supporter of cartoons. In 1949, he and the young Princess Elizabeth attended the Royal Society of Arts and listened to a speech by HM Bateman, the great Punch cartoonist, as he called for a national museum of cartoons. It must have left an impression since the Duke later opened the Cartoon Museum’s first permanent site in 2006, and was patron for over 20 years.He really did. He was a  reader, and while I made several jokes at his expense over the years – one, after he retired from public duties in 2017, was simply a plaque reading, “UNVEIL YOUR OWN DAMN PLAQUE” another, after his minor car crash the following year, showing a scrap metal dealer selling “Royal souvenirs” – he always seemed to like my cartoons.In 2018, when I celebrated my 30th anniversary on the paper, he even sent a short tribute.“Successful cartoonists do not only need to be able to draw, they have to think of subjects to illustrate,” he wrote. “Matt has shown that he has a genius for both, as well as the ability to think of wonderfully appropriate swipes at the idiocies of contemporary life.”It was already an amazing day, and I was already a big fan of the Duke, but the shock and honour of having him suggest he was even slightly a fan of mine left me a little lost for words. He was a man who knew the value of good humour, both to puncture the tension of a room and as a way of diluting the serious business of life, and he was a fine exponent of it.The country is far poorer for the Duke’s passing, but one way we might carry on his legacy is to keep on having a good laugh. He wouldn’t have wanted us to stay sombre for long.To own your own Matt print, visit telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178As told to Guy KellyMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"uk universities must pick side britain beijing","story":"In 2017, when Chris Heaton-Harris, then a Government whip, wrote to universities with an anodyne request for information about the content of teaching on Brexit, his letter was described as “sinister” and “McCarthyite”. But though British universities like to make a noisy fuss about accepting any interference from the democratically elected British Government - that, incidentally, funds and regulates them - they are perfectly happy to accept the most chilling interference from one dictatorial regime abroad.   Already, more than a dozen British universities have established Chinese-funded Confucius Institutes, where they agree not to participate in activities that are inconsistent with the Chinese state’s missions. And a 2019 report from the Foreign Affairs Committee found evidence of academics being pressured into cancelling events critical of China.    But China is no longer satisfied with mere silence from Western institutions.   Angered by the chorus of global condemnation for its genocide in Xinjiang, and other human rights abuses, the CCP has set to work extracting statements of support for its activities in the province. In recent weeks it has secured them - both from German fashion brand Hugo Boss, and the Japanese retailer Muji.  Meanwhile those that have not praised cotton forcibly produced by Uyghurs have seen their businesses in China crushed.  It seems impossible that British universities, which are just as financially dependent on China as these fashion brands, will be immune from such requests to act as propagandists for the CCP.   Indeed, some already seem to have acquiesced. In 2020, Jesus College Cambridge produced a report, funded by Huawei, calling for reforms to the global governance of telecommunications standards. And it is not only free speech that is jeopardised by our universities’ dependency on China. So too, is our national security.   Last month, the  reported that Chinese academics – including those with ties to the Peoples’ Liberation Army – have conducted research on behalf of MI5, the real-life Q-Branch, and the Ministry of Defence’s R\u0026ampD ision.  Likewise, we know British universities – including Oxford and Cambridge – have partnered with the Chinese armed forces on research into the most sensitive of military technology. Despite the damning indictment of such incidents, despite the countless column inches of bad publicity, so far university administrators seem unwilling to act.The UK government needs to do more to make sure that universities are spending their funds in line with British interests, not Beijing’s. The Government has at last taken some steps, such as increasing screening for Chinese academics in sensitive areas through the ATAS programme, and beefing up the responsibilities of the Office for Students. But it is not enough. Boris Johnson and his ministers need to set out unequivocally that universities are not free to dance to the tune of China while receiving British taxpayers’ money. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"another epidemic clueless beens clinging","story":"NewsopinionAnother epidemic of clueless has-beens clinging on to powerBrian Reade on the scourge of the Old Boys Network who believe the world would be a poorer place without themmirrorShareCommentsByBrian Reade:,  APR Newsopinionthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video meghan-markle-reveals-kate-made-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:MWomTa,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

Despite it being only .am in Washington he demanded to know why the US President hadn’t made public his sadness, claiming “Biden and the Democrats do not like the UK”. When, soon after, Biden offered his fulsome condolences he switched his anger to Harry and Meghan, claiming their tribute to the Duke showed “contempt” for the monarchy before telling them they would not be welcome in Britain for the funeral. After renting his gob to an American right-wing news channel on the back of this grief-judging, the next day he switched back to whipping up hatred of migrants. Meanwhile in Windsor, Prince Andrew came out of hiding to do a long TV interview thanking the nation for the support his family were receiving.Imagine the gratitude families of girls sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein would feelhe would agree to be interviewed by the FBI  Feeling secure back in the open again, the gormless golf-trolley then demanded his mum let him dress up as an admiral for his dad’s funeral to show the world what a Very Important Person he still is. Thankfully she told him to naff orf.  The most insulting part of David Cameron’s defence of his shameless lobbying of ministers for a scandal-hit money firm was his justication for meeting Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince: “I took the opportunity to raise concerns about human rights.” I doubt he did, because the only human he was concerned with was himself. When he was texting the Chancellor, drinking with ministers and camping with monsters, he still saw himself as a major global player, demanding the rewards that go with such status. Is there a sadder sight known to humanity than ageing men who have had a whf of power refusing to let it go  Look at Vladimir Putin passing a law that allows him to stay Russian leader until he’s . Or his Russia Today stooge, Alex Salmond, who’s rebranded himself as the new Robert The Bruce and formed a Scottish independence party despite there already being one.

That’s more than a quarter of the  Tories who left the Commons in the  and  elections. They include Andrew Bingham, the ex-High Peak MP who lost his seat in , who was made Head of the Government Car service, a role which can carry a salary of more than £,.

The Institute for Public Policy Research North says Britainaposs steel industry “is of national strategic importance”, with more than a third of jobs in northern regions like South Yorkshire, Teesside and the Humber. The think-tank estimates that “decarbonising steel in the North will require signicant annual investment to develop new technologies and encourage uptake”. The study comes amid mounting uncertainty over the future of Liberty Steel, which employs , staff at  British plants, after the collapse of its main lender, Greensill Capital.  Report author and senior research fellow Jonathan Webb said: “The steel industry underpins the economies and identities of so many towns and city regions across the North. “If we are serious about powering-up our regions, then we need to be serious about harnessing the incredible potential of aposGreen Steelapos, to build the low-carbon infrastructure we need to level up for ourselves, here in the North. “Everyone must play their part, andthey do, we will realise aon that investment that will more than deliver for all.” Publishing its -page report, aposForging the future: a vision for northern steel’s net zero transformationapos, today, the think-tank says costs of about £million a year up to  would need to be met by the industry and government, rising to £m by . Investment would mean the sector, which employs , UK workers, could become net zero by , the study believes. The report says that with “the pursuit of the right technologies now and investment to create a competitive low-carbon steel industry, northern steel, as a foundational industry, can be central to the country’s prosperity in the decades to come”.  The study adds: “This great transformation can offer something more hopeful a cleaner, greener future for the steel industry. “In turn, this will support prosperous towns and communities, providing the prospect of a good le for the people who live there. “If we are serious about levelling up, we must begin to recast steel as an industry of the future. “With a proper decarbonisation plan, the North’s steel industry can not only achieve net-zero emissions it can also transform its competitiveness to become a world leader in the low-carbon steel market.” Pressing the case for Whitehall cash, the report says that within the sector, “there remains a sense that central government could do more to support UK steel, both in terms of providing loans and other financial support to help the industry decarbonise, as well as by creating demand for UK steel domestically and by identying new export opportunities”. Welcoming the report, Community steelworkersapos union operations director Alasdair McDiarmid said the industry “is vital to Britain, and vital to the North”.  He added: “As the report shows, steel in North is a vital source of employment and with the right framework of support can support industrial communities for generations to come and play key role in decarbonising the UK.” UK Steel director-general Gareth Stace said: “Home to nearly % of the UK’s steelmaking capacity, three out of four of the UK’s electric furnaces, and well situated to feed into the UK’s future carbon capture and storage network, the North is ideally suited to become a hub for low-carbon steel production in the future.

The estimate for Scotland was around one in , falling from one in  and again the lowest since estimates began for the nation in October. The drop in infection levels across the UK marks a contrast to rising case rates in other parts of the world.  World Health Organisationdirector-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said coronavirus cases globally were rising at worrying rates and highlighted that the number of new cases confirmed per week had nearly doubled during the past two months. Speaking in Geneva, Switzerland, on Friday, Dr Tedros said the number of new cases is approaching the highest rate of infection that we have seen so far in the pandemic.

Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said it included two escape mutations which are causing people to be concerned, but added it was not known for certain what this meant for the effect of a vaccine. PHE has designated it as iant under investigation rather than a iant of concern and said there is currently no evidence to suggest it causes more severe disease or that vaccines are less likely to work against it. Downing Street has also defended the use of rapid lateral flow tests despite reports that officials have raised concerns about their accuracy.reported that it had seen leaked emails which indicated senior officials were considering scaling back extensive asymptomatic testing due to the number of  positives. Lateral flow tests, which do not need laboratory assessment and can give results in fewer than  minutes, form an integral part of the Governmentaposs mass testing efforts.  People in England can have two rapid coronavirus tests per week, with kits available free of charge at approved testing sites, pharmacies and by post. A No  spokesman told reporters: Lateral flow tests have been rigorously evaluated and we believe that they are both accurate and incredibly useful in terms of being able to spot asymptomatic cases of the virus. We know now this can be one in three people and it therefore allows us to identy possible contacts of those people and ultimately helps us to reduce the spread and the transmission of the virus. Meanwhile, the ONS said that the percentage of people testing positive for Covid- is estimated to have decreased in Yorkshire and the Humber and also in south-east England, while the trend was uncertain for all other regions.

A polished dark green carriage that the Duke of Edinburghaposs designed himself will make an appearance alongside ponies at the service in Windsor. The four-wheeled carriage, accompanied by two of Philipaposs grooms, will stand in the Quadrangle of Windsor Castle as the dukeaposs coffin is carried past in a procession on a Land Rover hearse. It was Philipaposs most recent carriage, which he began using at the age of  for riding around Windsor and other royal estates. With the aluminium and steel carriage will be the dukeaposs two black Fell ponies - Balmoral Nevis and Notlaw Storm - who were both were born in . Balmoral Nevis was bred by the Queen, with Fell ponies being an endangered breed. Philip had been designing driving carriages since the s and this one was was built to the dukeaposs specications eight years ago. The design draws on his knowledge of FEIdriving and can seat four people at maximum capacity and harness up to eight horses. It has two padded black leather seats and a clock mounted on brass at the front, which features an inscription commemorating the gt of the timepiece. The clock was presented to Philip by the Queenaposs Royal Irish Hussars on October   to mark his  years as their Colonel-in-Chief.  Philip, who died a week ago aged , was synonymous with carriage-driving. He loved nothing more than to go haring through the countryside at high speed, whip in hand, in a horse-drawn wheeled carriage. I am getting old, my reactions are getting slower, and my memory is unreliable, but I have never lost the sheer pleasure of driving a team through the British countryside, he explained in the book he wrote about the sport. Even when he was an octogenarian he continued to compete in demanding carriage-driving competitions. He was forced to give up polo at the age of  in  due what he called his dodgy arthritic wrist, and decided to find a new sport to concentrate on. I suppose I could have left it at that, but I have never felt comfortable as a spectator, he admitted. Tennis, golf and squash were no good for his wrist and sailing would have taken him away from home at weekends. It then suddenly occurred to me that this carriage-driving might be just the sport, Philip said. The duke, as president of the International Equestrian Federation, had initiated drafting the first international rules for carriage-driving in , which sparked an interest in the sport. In , he went to Budapest to watch the first European championship and then the World Championships in Germany in  to see how the rules were working. Philip began training himself, starting with five bays from the Royal Mews and a four-in-hand driver at Sandringham with help from Major Tommy Thompson, former riding master of the Household Cavalry. He began his competitive career in . In  he was a member of the victorious British team at the world carriage-driving championships held at Windsor and of the UKaposs bronze medal-winning team in the European championships in Switzerland the following year. Towards the end of the s, he ceased driving four-in-hand teams but continued to drive competitively with teams of ponies. By far his most famous convert was Lady Penny Romsey, now the Countess of Mountbatten of Burma, whom he coached. The countess - who was one of the dukeaposs closest friends - has been given the honour of being one of the  guests at his funeral on Saturday. He also taught his daughter-in-law, the Countess of Wessex, and his granddaughter Lady Louise Windsor, , has taken up the sport. The sport was a hazardous one and Philip had what he called his own annus horribilis in  with no less than eight disasters. I must have got a bit too close to the rails on the way off it. The next thing I knew I was out of my seat and flying through the air to the left, he wrote of one of the incidents in his aptly titled book  Years On And Off The Box Seat. He eventually retired from the sport in  in his early s when many his age had ceased to be involved with competitive sports decades ago.

The whopping  tonnes of unflushable waste was cleared from  miles of sewer pipes underneath Southend-on-Sea, Essex. The shocking fatberg is roughly equivalent in mass to two blue whales - the largest mammals in the world. It was cleared from the sewers in the town after a four-month operation. And Anglian Water, which began the clean-up operation in December, and completed it this week, said some pipes were found to be up to  per cent full of unflushable materials. The waste, once removed, was roughly the equivalent of two blue whales, the company said. The water company says that as well as plenty of the aposusual culpritsapos such as wet wipes and sanitary products, officials also found tools, toys, concrete, and even kitchen utensils blocking the pipes. But thankfully, only  small repairs were required and no major issues were found during the project. The work, which took place across the town centre, was completed to help prevent flooding in the area, which is often caused by a build-up of unflushables in the pipes.  Fat, oils and grease and other unflushables were detected across the network. These were at the highest volume within the town centre and at the pumping station, with  tonnes of fat being cleared from the pumps alone. Ben Hatfield-Wright, Water Recycling Network Efficiency Manager for Anglian Water, said: We have been astounded by the amount of unflushables found in Southend-on-Sea. In addition to the wet wipes and sanitary products which we find are the usual culprits for blockages we also found concrete, tools, toys and kitchen utensils. The water company will now be installing  sensors across the km network to monitor flow, levels and temperature, to ensure the pipes keep flowing.  It will enable engineers to identy any emerging issues before they cause problems. Any areas showing signs of deterioration will be investigated to find the source of the issue, and all customer connections to the mains in the area will be checked.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeIt was a word many heard on BBC hit Line of Duty but didn’t understand – “cuckooing” sounds quaint but it hides horric stories of terried people becoming prisoners in their homes. Organised crime gangs take over that person’s property – whether they are elderly, have learning dficulties or drug or alcohol dependency – and use their home for criminal activity. Just like with Line of Duty’s Terry Boyle. Now a Mirror investigation has uncovered a catalogue of cases across the nation and victims of cuckooing have bravely shared their stories. Our probe even found the names and addresses vulnerable people – potential cuckooing victims – are being used as a form of currency, bought and sold by criminals, often in jails. “You will find that prisoners are selling information for drugs on the inside about a vulnerable property in their area,” says Darren Burton, head of housing consultancy services for Forbes Solicitors, who works with the police and other agencies to prevent cuckooing and help victims escape. Cuckooing can have lasting effects on the victims – as well as having a devastating impact on the wider community. Darren explains: “They can feel suicidal, feeling like they have nowhere to turn. We have seen examples where they are having their money and benefits taken, withholding food, threats of or actual physical violence, destroying their belongings and the properties. “People don’t want to live there, there is a culture of silence, people don’t want to speak out, there can be a tense atmosphere particularlypeople live next door or on the same landing.” Mark – whose name we have changed for his own safety – was a victim of cuckooing in Oxford.  He had fallen into drug abuse and at first thought his dealers were his friends when they wanted to come to his flat. But he soon realised they had an ulterior motive – they wanted to deal drugs. He says: “It soon became apparent thatthings didn’t go their way what would happen.” Mark’s case worker from Oxford Council, Monica Walton, says that victims of cuckooing like Mark often don’t know where to turn for help. And that the practice isn’t always about using a property for drugs. She explains: “It is not just properties, it is people. There is a group of women that tend to go round and use older men for sexual pleasure to get money. I think the last time I went and did some visits it was connected to about  dferent addresses and these men are in their s.’ “These people don’t realise they are being cuckooed – and therefore their plight may go under the radar for years.” Liz Jones, Oxford City Council’s domestic and sexual abuse coordinator, explains: “I would say at the moment there are probably about  or so properties in Oxford at the moment where we suspect they are being cuckooed. “Sometimes people are cuckooing to get a bed for a number of nights. They have got vulnerabilities but they are exploiting an elderly person.” Police organised crime units have identied four dferent types. Parasitic cuckooing is taking over addresses by force and quasi cuckooing is exploitation of a person based on their vulnerability, often by drug users. Coupling is forming a sexual relationship to take over properties.  There is also local cuckooing which refers to local offenders who take over an address in the proximity of their home or their community where exploitation, violence and drug dealing can take place. It is a practice closely linked with county lines operations where gangs travel to dferent parts of the country to sell drugs, often using vulnerable youngsters as mules and dealers. There are around , dferent county lines operating across the country with each one making an estimated annual profit of around £, – a staggering £million. The gangs also use other forms of exploitation including coercion, trafficking, child sexual exploitation, gun and kne crime.  Mark became a victim of cuckooing after he fell into heroin and crack cocaine use. At first he thought the dealers were his friends and invited them in when they asked to come to his flat in Oxford to deliver his drugs. By the time he realised they wanted his flat as a base to deal drugs from, it was too late - Mark was in debt to them and trapped. He says: “All I cared about at that time was drugs. When I went to score they would always say can we come to your flat  It soon became apparent thatthings didn’t go their way what would happen. Sometimes there would be  lads in my flat. If any of their dealers got robbed they would come down with metal strips, hammers, knives, it was really intimidating. “They didn’t physically threaten me but I knew what would happenI didn’t do as they said. “They had made themselves comfortable in the flat and they would sit there all day. “I didn’t feel like I was a vulnerable person at the time. I just thought I was another drug user who was doing what he had to do to get through the day. I felt part of it although in reality I was being used.” Mark was only able to escape when a neighbour called police due to noise coming from the flat. Police and the council realised that Mark was being cuckooed and offered him the support he needed to get help. Mark says: “My case workers Monica from the council and Rob from the police were amazing. They didn’t want to throw me in jail.They offered me help and support. By that time I had had enough and I wanted to do anything to escape.They used to check on me everyday to check that the dealers weren’t coming back. Monica introduced me to the drugs service and got me into rehab.I did four months in rehab and then went to supported housing. I have been clean for two and half years, I’ve got a new flat and full time work. “If anyone  is in my position please reach out to the police or the council. There is help out there and it has changed my le.”  DI Mark Catney from Yorkshire and Humber Regional Organised Crime Unit says: “We recognise cuckooing and county lines crime as very serious threats. “Targeting vulnerable people is unacceptable. One place you are supposed to feel safe is in your own home.” Cuckooed houses are also used as places for gangs to carry out violence. In one case DI Mark Catney worked on in , a man who was involved in a dispute over drugs with a gang was taken to an apparently cuckooed address. He was stripped naked, had boiling water poured over his genitals and forced to sing and dance to Whitney Houston songs purely for his vile attackers’ amusement. The victim had previously been tortured in his own home and a kne was held to the stomach of his heavily pregnant girlfriend. Aimee’s home in London’s Camden was taken over by a gang after a man who she thought was a friend started inviting his friends over. But soon things spiralled out of Aimee’s control and her house was being used to deal drugs. On a video released by the politan Police, she says: “One of them became a really good friend of mine he was a really nice young man.But his friends started coming along and then more friends started coming along and they just started taking over the house and it just got worse. “I just started having a mental breakdown, started crying all the time. I mostly just stayed in the other room an they would come in and take over the rest of the house. They brought friends and would be drinking and ordering food all the time and getting people to wrap up drugs and started selling drugs and things like that from my home which I never allowed and never wanted but I just could never do anything about it and it got worse after that and they started getting worse towards me, being abusive towards me. “They’re not your friends they just want to use your home. They destroy your home, they haven’t got any respect for you. “There was a lot of help and support there for me which I was very shocked and amazed by and I still get help and support now. I’m a lot better in myself mentally, a lot better in myself. I’m a lot stronger.The police and the council have just been amazing to me I couldn’t have done it without them. The police are there to help and support you and they’re not going to judge you.”  Sakhawat Hussain, , of Batley, and Andre Clarke, , of Newsome, Huddersfield, were both convicted of affray, kidnapping, causing grievous bodily harm with intent and two counts of  imprisonment. They were jailed for  years each. And in February and March this year as part of a crackdown on county lines gangs, DI Catney and his team arrested four boys from Leeds, one aged  and three aged , who were believed to be staying with a vulnerable person in a cuckooed property in Harrogate. Officers recovered a signicant quantity of crack cocaine and heroin, phones, cash and a large hunting kne. In December last year, a pair of “cuckoo” drug dealers were jailed after taking over a vulnerable woman’s Devon home and using it as their distribution base. Tom Dwyer and Brandon Murray were caught red handed when police raided the house in Paignton and found them in the middle of bagging up heroin and crack.

But for some the prospect of heading out into the world again after a year of isolation is daunting. Post-lockdown anxiety is a new phenomenon affecting a growing number of people who are worried about dferent aspects of normal le from socialising, to ing to work or even picking up a faster pace of le again. Rosie Weatherley, Information Content Manager at mental health charity Mind explains: “Lockdown has been dficult for many people. It can feel stressful when things are changing quickly, and you may be feeling lots of dferent emotions. You might be feeling anxious and afraid or stressed and unprepared for any changes. Alternatively, you may have found that some aspects of lockdown have been positive for your wellbeing and that you’d like to protect your lockdown routine. “It’s important to remember that there is no ‘normal’ response to changes to lockdown and your feelings may be affected by lots of things that are outside of your control. Your feelings may also change day to day.” Dee Featherstone, , says she is worried about le ing to normal not just for herself, but also fears for her toddler son Alfie who hasn’t seen his grandparents for almost a year.  She explains: “I have suffered from anxiety for most of my le anyway. But after spending so much time in lockdown the thought of going out is a bit overwhelming now. “I left the military last February and all my medical stuff had been dealt with by them, so I now need to register with an NHS doctor but I can’t bring myself to go and do it. I know I have to as I will need the vaccine at some point but there is something stopping me. “I now only go outI absolutely have to, like going to the supermarket for example. My dogs’ vaccinations are due but I don’t want to go to the vets.” Dee works from home running the Little Sensory Box toy company, so that means she hasn’t had to leave the house to work either.  And she worries that Alfie, two, won’t want to cuddle his grandparents after a year apart. “I really can’t explain why I feel like this. I am not scared of catching the virus or being ill, it is more about social things and relationships. My family live in the West Midlands and I live in Peterborough so I have only seen them once in the last year. “I worry about what it will be like seeing them again, especially for my son who is only two. Whathe doesn’t know who they are and won’t go to them for cuddles  Annabel Standen, , had suffered from social anxiety in the past but it had improved drastically when she started university. So when lockdown hit and she had tohome toehold feelings ed.  Psychology student Annabel explains: “The thing about social anxiety is the one thing that makes it better is exposure, so the more people you see the easier it gets. But during lockdown you can’t meet lots of people and you have lots of time alone to think and dwell on what it might be like ing to normal le. “I didn’t enjoy school and sixth form, but when I went to university in Wales it was easier, as I didn’t know anyone and they didn’t know I was the girl who didn’t have any friends at sixth form.

It is dficult to pinpoint why it makes me anxious but it is almost like a feeling that people are going to be looking at me when I am walking around. “University really helped me with that. When I am studying a lot I find it really helpful as it makes me feel good about myself, which then lessens my anxiety. I am currently doing online lectures which I’m enjoying so I am not looking forward to going back to face to face classes.” It took logistics manager Phil Gorf, , years to come to terms with people staring at his facial birthmark and asking him questions about it.  Lockdown has given him a year of respite, and while he can’t wait to get back to the pub for a pint with his friends, Phil is bracing himself for the comments and stares to start again. Phil, an ambassador for charity Changing Faces, from Newport Pagnell says: “It was only about  years ago that I learned to deal with it. During lockdown I have spent a year working from my conservatory and when I have gone out we have all been wearing masks so I didn’t get the same questions and children staring. “I have thought about it a lot and I didn’t think I would be worried about lockdown easing, but I am actually a bit nervous. I know I will have to prepare myself before I leave the front door for the looks and questions. “With support from the Changing Faces charity I have learned mechanisms to cope like smiling at people who stare, or saying hello and starting a conversation with people. If my we is with me she always gives my hand a little squeeze of encouragement.”Natalie, , has vitiligo and like Phil is also a Changing Faces campaigner. Natalie has a growing Instagram following where she is an advocate for body positivity and championing visible dferences. But she is feeling anxious about ing to normal after lockdown. She says: My concerns with lockdown, aside from feeling anxious about being back in social settings, is showing my skin, especially during the summer.Itaposs something Iaposve found myself thinking about of late as the weather has got better. My skin has got worse on my body and I want to continue enjoying summer without feeling as though I should cover up. I went out a few times last summer without tights because it felt aposquietapos outside but after April this won’t be the case, so I feel like itaposs something I have to prepare for...There is definitely a dference between what we share online and when we are out in public because we have more control over what we share and show, whereas outside we donapost have that option. Also there are people that donapost use social media, so they are oblivious to the work many of us are trying to do to eradicate the negative stigma. Mum of two Katie Skelton says she will definitely ease herself back into normal le slowly to give herself and her children time to readjust after lockdown.

St Lukeaposs Hospital has now apologised for aposany distressapos caused but claimed that the staff member had merely offered a private room as they had been aposgenuinely concernedapos that she would be seen feeding in a breast clinic, where aposthere might have been women whoaposd had mastectomiesapos. However, Rebecca claims thatshe had been asked to go in a private room for these reasons she would have done so as she is aposnot horribleapos - but insists she was told she aposcould notapos breastfeed in the waiting room and it was later blamed on aposCovidapos. Meanwhile, maternity rights charity Maternity Action has branded the incident aposdisappointingapos. Rebecca, from Bradford, West Yorkshire, said: It made me feel really uncomfortable. Itaposs ridiculous. When I was called for my appointment, I was crying. One of the nurses said aposwhataposs wrong apos and I said aposI know my baby needs a feed and Iaposm not being allowed to feed him. Iaposm being told some people might not like it which doesnapost seem like a good reasonapos.  She just said aposI donapost know what to say to youapos. I felt Iaposd caused chaos just because I wanted to feed the baby.Iaposd leaked milk everywhere. My baby was poorly when he was born, he had sepsis, and being in a hospital and kept away from him was really stressful.Weaposve got a long way to go before women are given the support and encouragement they need. Rebecca had been referred to the breast clinic after four bouts of mastitis, after wanting to confirm there wasnapost something more sinister going on. After arriving with Kit and her husband Matt Harmon, also , Rebecca claims she was told the clinic was for apospatients onlyapos. The mum-of-three then askedshe could feed her hungry baby before going into the appointment and claims she was told she would have to use a private room.  Rebecca said: I didnapost really know what the appointment would entail but I knew itaposd take the afternoon. I didnapost have a choice but to take the baby with me because he doesnapost have a bottle.I had to take my husband with me as well. We were willing to do what we had to abide by the coronavirusguidelines.We went in and the receptionist said apositaposs patients onlyapos. I said aposthataposs fine, but the babyaposs breastfed and due a feed now. My husband will wait outside. Can I just feed him quickly then Iaposll hand him over to my husband so I can go in apos The baby wasnapost crying at this stage, he was just fussing, but I knew he was due a feed. She asked aposis he definitely due a feed apos I said aposyes, definitelyapos, then she said aposI suppose Iaposll have to find you a private room thenapos. I said it was fine and Iaposd feed him in the waiting room, then she said aposoh no, I canapost let you do that. Some people might not like itapos. I thought she was joking. If they donapost like it, itaposs their problem really. She then came out from behind her booth and said aposI donapost want to get any complaints so I canapost let you do it in the waiting roomapos.  I felt really upset and like everyone was looking at me. I was really surprised that no one in the waiting room said aposlet her feed the baby - I donapost careapos. They couldnapost find me a private room at first and made a big deal about clearing one, then I was called to my appointment and I had to leave him. I was quite upset by this stage. Even then I said aposI just want to feed my baby and I donapost know why Iaposm not being allowed toapos. I think the doctor realised it was all going pear-shaped. She said apositaposs just because of Covid that you canapost feed in thereapos. They probably should have said that initially. If Iaposd come into the unit and the receptionist said aposcan you go in a private room because some people might be a bit sensitive due to the nature of what goes on hereapos, I would have been fine. Iaposm not horrible. It was the way she said it. I donapost think it was Covid or that people might be sensitive about it because itaposs a breast clinic. I think she just thought some people wouldnapost like breastfeeding. Thataposs the impression I got. Distressed Rebecca then left her appointment without asking the questions she had prepared as she was so upset by Kitaposs cries - running into the private room to nurse him. According to the NHS website, aposit is illegal for anyone to ask a breastfeeding woman to leave a public place, such as a cafe, shop or public transportapos. It also states women should never be made to feel uncomfortable about breastfeeding in public.

A booster dose of the jab is likely to be required inside a year, the companyaposs chief Albert Bourla has confirmed. Data shows Pfizer is effective against a worrying South Africa strain of the virus. But a third vaccine may been needed months after a second, despite original suggestions claiming a booster wouldnapost be required for a year. “Protection goes down by time but still in six months it’s still extremely, extremely high,” Bourla said. “If you ask me, I think that there will be a need, based on these data, for re-vaccinations. “A likely scenario is that there will be likely a need for a third dose somewhere between six and  months and then from there, there will be an annual re-vaccination. But all this needs to be confirmed. In pandemics, you are as protected as your neighbour.A spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday that the Pfizer coronavirus jab is apossafe and effectiveapos against the South African mutation.A study at Tel Aviv University in Israel found the vaccine may struggle to fight off the worrying iant, but Downing Street has moved to allay fears. The Pfizer vaccine appeared to be less effective against the South African mutation, researchers said, and has the ability to aposevadeapos protection. Askedthere was any concerns with the efficacy of the jab against the iant in light of the study, a spokesman for the Prime Minister answered: No.  The Pfizer jab is safe and effective. People should come forward to take their jab when they are offered it. “We have seen a number of studies against a number of iants. As we keep seeing, these vaccines are incredibly effective at preventing hospitalisations and deaths so people should have full confidence in them and come forward to take them.” Last month, it was reported the South African strain was behind around  per cent of cases in Europe, and in the UK surge Covid testing has been deployed whenever cases of the South African, Brazilian and other mutations are identied.

She had tried to ensure all branches of the duke’s family were there, including three German relatives and a confidante who is linked to the Duke of Edinburghaposs beloved uncle who was murdered by the IRA more than  years ago. It was inevitable that there would be some notable omissions when the full guest list was revealed on Thursday, with Prince Andrewaposs ex-we and Philipaposs former daughter-in-law Sarah Ferguson, one of the Queenaposs cousins and the dukeaposs great-grandchildren among them. The Queen will sit alone and wear a face mask throughout the socially-distanced service for her husband, who died aged  on April . Feuding brothers William and Harry will not walk shoulder to shoulder during the procession. They will be separated by their cousin Peter Phillips, the only sone of Princess Anne, when the trio walk in a line behind their grandfather’s coffin at Windsor Castle. No members of the royal family will be in military unorm – the men will wear morning coats with their medals while the women will appear in day dresses. Here are some of those who did not receive an invite to the Duke of Edinburghaposs funeral or are unable to or have chosen not to attend.Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York  Philipaposs disdain for Fergie, , has been well documented over the years, especially after she was pictured topless and having her toes sucked by a lover in  after her split from Andrew. It was then that the duke decided enough was enough and he did not want or need to have anything more to do with her, his friend and biographer Gyles Brandreth wrote in the Daily Mail. Philip made no secret of the fact that he regarded Sarah, Duchess of York, as ‘simply beyond the pale’, Mr Brandreth added. Keep up to date with all the latest news from the Queen, Charles, William, Kate, Harry, Meghan, George, Charlotte, Louis, Archie and the rest of the family. Weaposll send the best Royal news directly to your inbox so you never have to miss a thing.to our newsletter here. It is thought that the Queen has remained fond of Fergie following the orce. Sarah and ex-husband Andrew, , have been visiting the Queen at Windsor Castle and going for daily walks with her following Philipaposs death, a source claimed to the Sun. But Fergie was never expected to be invited. Despite their orce, Sarah and Andrew still live together at nearby Royal Lodge in Windsor. The Duke of York stepped down from royal duties in  over his friendship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Philipaposs great-grandchildren  None of the Queen and the dukeaposs ten great-grandchildren received an invite to Saturdayaposs service. They include Prince William and Kate Middletonaposs children - future king Prince George, seven, Princess Charlotte, five, and Prince Louis, two. But this was expected given the young ages of the children and the strict guest limit. Earlier this week, William shared a sweet photo of Philip and George together in Norfolk. And the Royal Family released a picture of the Queen and the duke with seven of their great-grandchildren at Balmoral Castle in . Both previously unseen photos were taken by Kate. Prince and Princess Michael  Prince Michael of Kent, one of the Queenaposs cousins, and his outspoken and often controversial we, Princess Michael of Kent, a German noblewoman born Baroness Marie-Christine von Reibnitzare, are not on the guest list. Prince Michael, a -year-old business consultant, was the third child of Prince George, Duke of Kent, and is not a working royal. His website states: Although Prince Michael has formally represented the Queen on several state occasions abroad, the Prince does not receive the annual parliamentary allowances, which are received by other members of the Royal Family and then reimbursed by the Queen to the Treasury.Prince Michael, therefore, has the Queen’s permission to earn his own living. Katharine, Duchess of Kent  The Duke of Kent, another of the Queenaposs cousins, is attending the funeral, but his we, Katharine, , is not. She has reportedly suffered from ill health in recent years. Katharine married Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, , in , was a bridesmaid at Princess Anneaposs wedding and has taken numerous engagements on behalf of the Queen during her time as a royal. Edward is a first cousin of the Queen through their fathers - Prince George and King George VI, respectively - and his mother Princess Marina was a first cousin of Philip. Duchess of Gloucester  In a similar situation, the Duke of Gloucester, , is attending the funeral without his we Birgitte, Duchess of Gloucester, . The duchess, a Danish member of the Royal Family, and her husband Prince Richard were married in . Richard is the younger son of Prince Henry and Princess Alice. Meghan Markle  Prince Harryaposs we Meghan Markle and their son Archie, who turns two in May, did not travel back to the UK with him from Los Angeles, and are not attending the funeral. Buckingham Palace said the Duchess of Sussex, , has been advised by her doctor not to travel. Pregnant with a girl, she is expected to give birth this summer. Harry, meanwhile, was said to be self-isolating at Frogmore Cottage in Windsor after arriving in the UK on Sunday. It is his first visit home since he and Meghan quit as senior royals, and he is set to reunite with the Queen, dad Prince Charles and brother William for the first time since the coupleaposs explosive interview with Oprah Winfrey. Boris Johnson  Prime Minister Johnson decided not attend the Duke of Edinburgh’s funeral. He gave up his seat so a family member can attend. A spokesman said Mr Johnson will watch the service on television from his country residence Chequers, Buckinghamshire.He will observe the national minute’s silence, which will take place at pm to mark the start of the funeral, from the countryside retreat, the spokesman added. Who are the  guests  The Duke of Edinburgh’s carriage-driving companion – one of his closest confidantes – Countess Mountbatten of Burma will join mourners at his funeral. The -year-old countess is the we of Earl Mountbatten, Norton Knatchbull – the grandson of Philip’s beloved uncle the st Earl Mountbatten, who was murdered by the IRA in . The countess – Penelope “Penny” Knatchbull, previously known as Lady Romsey and later Lady Brabourne – will join the Queen and Philip’s four children and eight grandchildren and their respective spouses at the service in St George’s Chapel on Saturday.  Three German relatives – whose ancestors were denied a place at Princess Elizabeth and Philip’s wedding because of anti-German feeling after the second war – have been included. They are Bernhard, Hereditary Prince of Baden Prince Donatus, Landgrave of Hesse and Prince Philipp of Hohenlohe-Langenburg. Others on the guest list include the Queen’s first cousins Princess Alexandra, the Duke of Gloucester and the Duke of Kent, who loyally supported the monarch and Philip by carrying out royal duties over the decades. Also invited were the children of the Queen’s late sister Princess Margaret – the Earl of Snowdon and Lady Sarah Chatto and her husband David Chatto. The Queen is particularly close to Lady Sarah.  Guests also include the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall, the Princess Royal and husband Vice Admiral Timothy Laurence, the Duke of York, the Earl and Countess of Wessex, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the Duke of Sussex, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie and their spouses, Peter Phillips and Zara and Mike Tindall. A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: “At its heart it is still a family event. Here is the full list of guests who will attend the Duke of Edinburgh’s funeral: . The Queen . The Prince of Wales . The Duchess of Cornwall . The Duke of Cambridge . The Duchess of Cambridge . The Duke of Sussex . The Duke of York . Princess Beatrice . Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi . Princess Eugenie . Jack Brooksbank .

The Three Mile in Gosforth, Newcastle, says it is disappointed with the minority of people unhappy with the charge to reserve a table.A spokesperson told Chronicle Live the charge will be removed on  May when they are fully open again.The Three Mile opened its outdoor terrace this week, in line with lockdown restrictions easing, following a three-year transformation of the site. The Malhotra Group has spent £.m redeveloping the venue, formerly the Three Mile Inn on the Great North Road, Newcastle. Among the locals who ed to the bar this week was Michelle Leonard, who booked a two hour slot on Wednesday afternoon to celebrate her son’s th birthday with some family drinks.  The -year-old said that when she booked the table online, the website said a £ payment would be required up front. When the party arrived, Michelle says she asked about whether the £ would be deducted from the bill, and claims she was initially told by a member of serving staff that it would be refunded. After contacting the company the next day, she eventually received an email saying the payment was a ‘table charge’ and would not be refunded. Michelle said Malhotra have since changed their website so customers are told when they book the table that the £ is not taken off the bill or refunded. But she said: “I’m annoyed becauseI’d have been told that, I wouldn’t have booked. If you walk in off the street you don’t pay a charge. “I would have just turned up, or Iaposd have gone somewhere . “We were told to leave at pm because our booking was up. In that two hours we spent £ and they still charged us for the table, whereas you can walk in off the street, not pay and stay all day. “I’ve been going to the Three Mile Inn since the s but I’ll never go back.”  The charge also prompted some people to comment on the Gosforth venue’s Facebook page.One said: “It was great to spend a couple of hours in the sun at lunchtime today. Disappointed that the £ table reservation charge was not refunded or taken off the first round of drinks. £ to reserve a table for each visit is quite steep and not in line with other establishments.” Another said: “The £ deposit puts me off going. I completely understand the need to charge it because of no-shows, but most other places give you it back to spend.” A third wrote: “Get ityou don’t turn up butyou do you should get it off your first round!” The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening.

The Queen addressed the nation on the eve of her mother’s funeral in  to thank the country for their support and the love and honour shown to the -year-old. In a televised address, the monarch said she had been deeply moved by the outpouring of affection and the overwhelming numbers of people paying their respects since the Queen Mother’s death. It is not clear whether the Queen will deliver an address to the nation ahead of Saturday’s service. A palace spokesman said the Queen and her family are grateful for all the messages of condolence from around the world and have been touched to hear so many people – both young and old – sharing fond memories of the duke.  Details of the duke’s funeral were released by Buckingham Palace on Thursday. Feuding brothers William and Harry will not walk side by side in the Duke of Edinburgh’s funeral procession. The siblings will be separated by their cousin Peter Phillips when the trio walk in a line behind their grandfather’s coffin to the chapel. The future king will also be one step ahead of his brother when the coffin is taken into the chapel, moving ahead of Harry as the Royal Family, including their father Prince Charles, go forward in pairs.  Harry has spoken in the past about how he and William are on “dferent paths” and have good and bad days in their relationship. Their brotherly bond was put under further strain after Harry and we Meghan Markleaposs interview with Oprah Winfrey where they accused a Royal Family member of racism, something William strongly denied. Asked whether arrangements for the procession reflected the royal siblings’ relationship, a Buckingham Palace spokesman said: “This is a funeral, we’re not going to be drawn into those perceptions of drama, or anything like that, this is a funeral. “The arrangements have been agreed, and they represent Her Majesty’s wishes, so we’re not going to say anything more on that.” The palace has confirmed the Queen, like all the  guests invited to the service, will wear a face mask during the funeral which will last  minutes. A palace spokesman said the monarch had to make “dficult decisions about who would be there” due to Covid restrictions limiting mourners. The Queen will be sitting by herself in the Quire of St George’s Chapel, with all mourners following Covid guidelines and remaining socially distanced, but for the short car journey to the place of worship from the Castle she will be joined by a lady-in-waiting. Philip was the guiding force behind his funeral arrangements and reflecting his le-long association with the Royal Navy, Buglers of the Royal Marines will sound Action Stations during the service at the duke’s request. It is played on a warship to signal all hands should go to battle stations and is sometimes featured at funerals of naval men. A reduced choir of just four singers will feature during the service and the guests will follow Covid rules and not sing. Among the guests are all of the duke’s children and grandchildren and their spouses, the children of the Queen’s sister Princess Margaret and three of Philip’s German relatives, the Hereditary Prince of Baden, Prince Donatus, Landgrave of Hesse and Prince Philipp of Hohenlohe-Langenburg. Also invited is a close friend of the duke, Countess Mountbatten of Burma – Penelope “Penny” Knatchbull, previously known as Lady Romsey and later Lady Brabourne – who was Philip’s carriage driving partner.

The Duke died last Friday - just two months before his th birthday - and his funeral will take place in St George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle on Saturday. In the snap the royal couple are pictured as they are rarely seen – relaxing together away from public duties and enjoying the stunning scenery of the Scottish Highlands. Looking completely at ease and smiling warmly at the photographer, Philip and the Queen relax on the grass at the Coyles of Muick, a beauty spot near the town of Ballater in Aberdeenshire, Scottish Highlands. The duke lies back on a rug, propping himself up on his left elbow and has jauntily placed his hat on his right knee. Beaming at the the Countess of Wessex – who took the picture in  – the Queen, dressed in a tartan skirt, blouse and cardigan and a string of pearls, also sits on a rug. With the sun blazing down the picture is likely taken when the couple were enjoying their traditional summer break at the Queen’s nearby private estate of Balmoral.  The image reflects the private face of the Queen and her husband and gives an insight into how the Queen will remember her husband of  years. Coyles of Muick stands above the entrance to Glen Muick and rewards walkers with an uninterrupted view to the mountain of Lochnagar.  The area is clearly a favourite spot for the Queen as she has named a corgi puppy, recently gted to the monarch, Muick and it has a dorgi puppy playmate called Fergus – another Scottish name. The area has been painted by the Prince of Wales whose Scottish summer retreat of Birkhall is close to the area where the Queen and Philip were photographed.

Her Majesty is said to be aposbearing up wellapos and she yesterday released a touching image of her and Philip relaxing together at her Balmoral estate in .The tender image, which was taken by The Countess of Wessex, shows her with the Duke of Edinburgh at the top of the Coyles of Muick hills.

Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  A royal source said: “The cherished photograph is one of the Queen’s favourites and evokes many happy memories at one of their favourite places in the world. She will miss her beloved Philip forever.” Her Majesty last month named a new corgi puppy Muick after the beauty spot where she spent many happy times with Philip, who died peacefully aged  on April . His funeral will take place at St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle at pm. The duke’s children will walk behind a specially-modied military green Land Rover hearse he helped to design. The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby yesterday appealed to the nation to offer prayers and condolences to the monarch.  He said it would be a “profound” chance for her to say farewell to her husband of  years. Justin Welby said: “We really have to avoid judging from anything external. “She is the Queen. She will behave with the extraordinary dignity and extraordinary courage that she always does. “And at the same time she is saying farewell to someone to whom she was married for  years. “I think that must be a very, very profound thing in anybody’s le and I hope the whole nation,they believe in that, they pray for her, andthey don’t, they sympathise in their hearts, offer their condolences to her and they hope for her to find strength in what must be an anguished moment.” The monarch, , was yesterday seen for the first time since Philip’s death and was said to be “bearing up well”. She drove a green Jaguar out of Windsor Castle to take her dogs for a walk at around pm.  Typically, she later ed to duty, taking condolence calls from the Governor General of Australia David Hurley and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. And as final preparations were made last night, details of the Order of Service chosen by the duke himself were revealed. He picked the hymn Eternal Father, Strong To Save, a stirring sailors’ anthem sung at the funeral of his uncle Lord Mountbatten. Philip’s mentor had a huge influence on his le before he was murdered by the IRA in . A bugler from the Royal Marines will sound the call of Action Stations at the duke’s personal request. The wartime alert, a tradition associated with naval funerals, is typically announced on warships. It will honour Philip’s distinguished Royal Navy service in the Second World War, when he was mentioned in dispatches.  A royal source said: “The personal choice of hymn also shows how important the Navy was to him. “If he hadn’t met the Queen he would have continued as a naval officer and was tipped to rise to the very top. “He sacriced that for duty – but naval le remained close to his heart as did the lessons his beloved uncle taught him.” Philip’s “unwavering loyalty” to the Queen and “courage, fortitude and faith” will also be hailed as he is laid to rest. The Russian Kontakion of the Departed will also be sung. The chant, with its origins in the Russian Orthodox sacrament, was added to signy Philip’s roots in the Orthodox church and his Greek origins. Crowds are being urged to stay away from Windsor and just  mourners will attend the service.Prime Minister Boris Johnson will watch on television from his country residence Chequers, in Buckinghamshire, Number  said.He will observe the national minute’s silence at pm to mark the start of the funeral. Heathrow Airport said no planes will land or take off for six minutes. Prince Edward and Sophie, Countess of Wessex, were yesterday touched by “sweet” tributes left at Windsor Castle. The couple, who were joined by their daughter Lady Louise Windsor, , spent time looking at hundreds of flowers and wreaths outside St George’s Chapel, including from Johnson, Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and the Royal Navy. The Wessexes, along with other members of the Royal Family, have been supporting the Queen since Philip’s death. When the clock strikes three and the nation is called to fall silent, the Queen should look back with pride at a job well done. Long held plans ravaged by the coronavirus crisis, tortured decisions on who should attend and the pressures of by the minute details will all be over. No doubt she will wonder what this new dawn which has been thrust upon her will look like. But one hopes, bolstered by the unity her family has shown in recent days, the burden will be eased. Controversies within her family will still rage, just as they have always done, but the central force must be towards togetherness to herald a new age after their patriarch has departed. The senior members of The Firm have a duty to the Queen to not only help her through, but to heed her call to contribute to healing the country after more than a year of turmoil. When the eyes of the world are upon us, with celebrations of births and marriages in this family, there is cause for celebration. But perhaps today we could all pause for a moment of reflection to honour the le of a man who devoted his le to service and the woman forced to say her final goodbyes."},{"url":null,"title":"sickening photos show how chemicals","story":"NewsSickening photos show how chemicals used to cut cocaine rot your skin and genitalsWARNING GRAPHIC IMAGES: Sales of the Class A drug cocaine are expected to soar as lockdown restrictions are lted - but shocking images showing the results of using the dangerous drug may cause some to think againmirrorShareCommentsByRyan MerrieldReporter:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsThis woman had been taking cocaine before noticing the skin on her face was rotting \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Leonie Baigan, , took her own le last month, two days before a gender reveal party to celebrate her mumaposs pregnancy, and was excited to become a big sister. Devastated mum-of-one Stacey Baigan, , said Leonie had sought help for mental health and was signed off work from her job at a bank, but the family had no idea she was suicidal. Leonie, from Edinburgh, had spoken to her GP about her mental health but had not indicated she was thinking of taking her own le, which she did on March . Stacey, who is six months pregnant, said mental health had become another pandemic in the course of lockdowns, and many young people were feeling isolated. Leonie had a job at Bank of Scotland, a doting boyfriend and friends as well as a supportive family, and Stacey said the tragedy showed mental health needed to be taken seriously. Gym instructor Stacey said: Iaposve been planning a funeral when I should have been planning a st birthday. It was just so unexpected, we had been trying to get help for her mental health but never in a million years did I think this was going to happen. We were trying to get her help for about two or three years, in December she started to speak about it more saying aposI canapost explain this feeling in my head, I just want peaceapos. On December  Stacey called the NHS to seek help, and on Christmas Eve Leonie was prescribed antidepressants - but was not keen to take them. In February she was signed off work and given access to five private counselling sessions on the phone, but she was so shy she couldnapost phone a taxi herself or order a takeaway.  She missed all the phone calls, and her mum said she felt face-to-face support should be given to people in crisis despite the pandemic. Stacey said: In the pandemic everything is done by phone, Leonie was so socially introverted she couldnapost phone a taxi. She used to get her nails done at the same salon for about six years but she couldnapost phone to make an appointment. For someone to speak to a complete stranger about their mental health on the phone, it is quite sensitive and personal. On the day she died, Leonie had a aposdown dayapos but Stacey said there was nothing unusual about it. She had tried to encourage Leonie to buy some paint to redecorate the kitchen cupboards of the flat in Edinburgh she was renting, and to buy a notebook to record her feelings.  Stacey said: She had best friends, she had a boyfriend, she had a good job with a great career, she wanted to do a mortgage advisor qualication. She was making plans, Iaposm six months pregnant and Leonie was going to pop the balloon at a gender reveal party. She was so excited, she was more excited than us, she was planning to pick up cupcakes. It didnapost seem to me like it was planned.

Residents in Polandaposs Krakow were reportedly refusing to open their windows because they were afraid that the aposanimalapos would go into their homes. A local resident called the Krakow Animal Welfare Society and reported the mysterious figure to authorities. The concerned resident reportedly said the unidentied aposbeastapos was brown and sitting in a tree, before adding that the dangerous creature had been lurking outside for two days.In a post on Facebook, Adam, the inspector who visited the scene and took the call, said: I tried to guide the woman, her voice seemed to be growing hysterical. The unnamed resident said in her report that she believed that the figure in question was an iguana.The iguana theory was quickly disproven by officials as the weather in Poland is too cold for reptiles to survive outside.Officials then wonderedthe unidentied aposanimalapos was a lost pet that had wandered off due to boredom. The welfare team also suspected that the animal was an abandoned pet as they had recently responded to reports of a sick cat left in a garage, as well as rats and hamsters which were left in the bin. After taking the call, the team arranged a visit and when the animal welfare officials arrived, they discovered that the scary animal was in fact a croissant.

Fregon, in the countryaposs Outback, was thrust into the spotlight when a nurse was brutally raped and murdered in . The body of Gayle Woodford, , was found in a shallow grave three days after she disappeared. A coroner has now submitted a damning report criticising the town following an inquest into the mum-of-twoaposs death. Ms Woodford was killed by Dudley Davey, who pleaded guilty to her murder in . South Australia Deputy Coroner Anthony Schapel painted a shocking picture of Fregon with his findings, which were released on Thursday. He recommended that a local police presence be established to deal with the lawlessness of the town. The evidence of those witnesses who were called and who expressed a view about police presence in the Fregon community having regard to the level of lawlessness within it, would suggest that a permanent police presence would be essential, Mr Schapelaposs reports said. The proposition that a community in which certain of its members need to be protected by cages does not require an immediate police presence within that community would, I think, strike the ordinary man or woman in the street as perverse. Mr Schapel added that it was hard to determine whether a police presence in the town would have prevented Ms Woodfordaposs death.  But he said it would act as deterrent for other crimes. Ms Woodfordaposs death shocked Australia, after it emerged she was lured into a trap, abducted, raped and murdered. It also led to a number of questions being asked about Fregon, an Aboriginal community located in Anangu Pitjantjatjara YankunytjatjaraLands. According to reports, police have a presence in other locations in the APY Lands - but often take around an hour and a half to reach Fregon.

Ms Woodford covered the APY Lands as part of her patch for nearly five years before she was brutally killed, attending many callouts. Davey is currently serving a sentence of at least  years for his crimes, which also included the theft of Ms Woodfordaposs ambulance. A court heard during his trial how he had assaulted another nurse in Fregon back in .  The coroneraposs report adds: The violence in Fregon was described by a medical practitioner of several years’ standing in remote communities such as these as aposongoingapos and aposcontinualapos, and thatthere was no violence in the Fregon community on a given day it was a aposgood dayapos, circumstances not helped in her opinion by the lack of a police presence in the community. The practitioner described Fregon as aposcompletely lawlessapos and the most violent place in which she had resided and worked while employed by the NHC in the APY Lands, to the point where she believed that serious consideration needed to be given to the withdrawal of services from this particular community so as to bring it to its closure.

Short-range misses were fired into the Sea of Japan and the Yellow Sea during weapons test in March, for the first time after US President Joe Biden took office.The UN Security Council has banned North Korea from testing these powerful weapons, but it has ignored that order on numerous occasions. There are growing concerns about advances in North Koreaaposs military technology and experts believe the country is ramping up its nuclear programme.A worrying report published by aKorean think tank, called the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, states North Korea could have  nuclear weapons and several dozen intercontinental ballistic missiles by . The report states the United States and South Korea are not prepared to deal with the developing North Korean nuclear weapon threat. It also states their attempts to stop the rogue state from expanding its nuclear arsenal, through a series of negotiations, has failed. It says Mr Kim appears to be building a nuclear weapon force capable of enabling peninsula dominance and the US and South Korea need to develop enhanced defences to sustain deterrence now. In January, country revealed it had a new submarine launched ballistic missile, which the state media described as the world’s most powerful weapon. The missile was unveiled at a parade, that was overseen by Mr Kim, weeks after he described the USA as his countryaposs “biggest enemy”.

Up to  branches of Semichem will close.John Brodie, chief executive of Scotmid, addressed the Tayside closures as the co-operative’s annual results were announced.He told The Courier: “It’s always a dficult decision and a last resort – our aim is to keep stores open.“But sometimes we have to face into tough decisions.“It was based on the fact there were structural changes happening on high streets before the pandemic hit. The pandemic has accelerated some of those changes.“Some footfall driving stores in high streets, in shopping centres, they just don’t exist anymore.“We had a look at the locations we are in and assessthey are viable for the future.“Then we tried to make arrangements with landlords to help rental costs. We explored every opportunity before we took the tough decision that a store would have to close.”Mr Brodie said staff would be offered positions in other parts of the Scotmid group, which includes convenience stores, funerals and property.“There is a normal level of staff turnover in Scotmid food stores,” he added.“We anticipate that will create some opportunities for us to accommodate as many people as possible.”He said the company was satisfied that its other Semichem shops would continue to trade profitably.Scotmid Co-op Society delivered a £. million trading profit for the  weeks ended January  compared to £.m last year. Turnover increased by £m to £m.Mr Brodie said that while food sales increased as more customers shopped locally, there were also higher costs.There was also more demand for funeral services, but profitability was down partly due to social distancing restrictions.Meanwhile the company’s property arm saw some tenants default on payments.“This was a year dominated by the pandemic and the signicant but ying impact it has had on our dferent businesses,# Mr Brodie said.“Changes in consumer behaviour during the pandemic resulted in an increase in local essential shopping in Scotmid’s food convenience stores.“Customers visited less frequently, spent more each visit but the costs of operation were signicantly more than usual.“Like many other non-food retailers, Semichem was signicantly impacted by the pandemic due to low footfall on high streets and a long period of closure in the first wave.”“Scotmid Funerals conducted more funerals but at a reduced income per funeral due to safety and social distancing restrictions.”Mr Brodie said that even as the vaccine rollout continues apace, there was “considerable uncertainty” looking forward.He said management would adopt a “flexible approach” and focus on matters under its control.“We are an organisation that’s been around for  years and we will continue to follow our core purpose of continuing to serve our communities and improving people’s every day lives.“I’d also like to praise our society members for the fantastic work they have done in the past year.“They are unsung heroes for keeping going in uncertain

up to new terms and conditions which some claim represent a % pay cut has said he felt #bullied# into agreeing to the change.Engineers from the company who refused to accept new terms and conditions have effectively been sacked this week.Centrica, who operate British Gas, have been engaged in a months-long dispute with trade union GMB over the matter.Under the new terms, engineers are required to work three hours extra every week for no payment, as well as losing benefits for evening and weekend call-outs.GMB has said this amounts to a % real-terms pay cut.Now, one Fe-based engineer, who asked to remain anonymous, said he #wasn#t brave enough# to risk his job and fight the change.He told he how felt #bullied# into accepting the new conditions.#I have a family, I couldn#t have walked away from my job evenit was the right thing to do,# the engineer said.Another engineer, Fe-born John Cleary, is just one of the engineers who found themselves jobless on Thursday after choosing not to sign the contract.He said the week had been #heartbreaking# after he was forced tohis van and all his equipment.John is now looking into starting his own business but said this wasn#t what he hoped for at .#It#s heartbreaking,# he said.#There#s a lot of experience just walked out of the door at British Gas.#The company said they would give us information on pensions, but I#ve not heard a thing. We#re just locked out.#It#s just devastating. My manager was probably feeling as bad as what we were feeling, but they didn#t raise their voice about the bad decision.#I#m , this is the last thing I wanted to do.#He said that a lot of people have been in touch to support those who fought against the new terms, and customers of British Gas have said they would cancel their boiler care packages as a result.But he also wants to see politicians take action to end the practice of fire and rehire, which allows employers to sack workers and offer them their jobs back on reduced terms.#If the politicians had stopped fire and rehire before Easter then we#d still be at the table with British Gas and I#d still have a job,# he said.Union GMB, which represents the major of British Gas engineers, promised further action in response.Gary Pearce, GMB London energy officer, said: “That British Gas doesn’t  give a toss for either customers or staff is shown by the mass sackings of engineers it so badly needs for customer services that it has suspended the sale of boiler insurance cover.“There is sadly nothing in law to stop corporate bullying by companies of their own staff to sign terms they don’t accept and sacking those who don’t submit to this bullying.“But GMB members won’t accept the outcome of the bullying.GMB members won’t accept the outcome of the bullyingAsked about claims an engineer felt #bullied# by the company, a Centrica spokesperson said: #We care about all of our colleagues. That’s why we’ve had to make changes to ensure the survival of the company # to reverse our decline and protect the future of all our employees.’’They added: “We are changing the way we work to give our customers the service they want and protect the future of our company and , UK jobs.#The changes we need to make are reasonable and % of the entire company has accepted new contracts. We have not cut base pay or changed our generous final salary pensions.

He was tempted more, I’m sure, by his admiration for Jim McLean and love for Dundee United than a night out with his wee sister.I have distinct memories of him heading off with a group of mates to Europe in the s, following United in those glory days.A play about Tannadice’s most legendary figure would mean more to him than me even though, final card on that table, I’m a Dundee United supporter.So with the memories of the great live theatre night still fresh, it’s easy to come to this new filmed version, the first by the new Rep Studios online , with a little trepidation.The “live” version was such a powerful two-hander that it seemed almost impossible to bring that level of energy to film, particularly when there would be no shared audience experience of laughter.It has been more than possible, however, through taking a step back and looking at the play dferently. There’s no one-camera static approach here.The camera work is dynamic and the close-ups mean we can enjoy all the nuances of the performances by Barrie Hunter as Jim McLean and Chris Alexander as Jimmy, the character that guides Jim through the reflections on his le.It also means that the dynamic opening where Jim, fresh from a touchline tantrum and thundering into the dressing room for his team “talk”, is even more explosive.Hunter’s portrayal of the man was rightly praised at the time, but this version means that we see the smaller moments more clearly, we see the thinking of the man rather than the manager.It also allows us to get better acquainted with Alexander’s Jimmy character, which could easily be lost in the breadth of Hunter’s performance.Philip Dfer’s play, still directed by Sally Reid, is told through the football of course, but is a much wider examination of a man who had depths that he thought it was none of our business to see.The character is key. Michael Sheen’s Brian Clough in The Damned United is another example of what a le immersed in football and a hunger for success.Now that it’s committed to film, Hunter has done the same for McLean.Unlike Sheen he doesn’t go for the uncannily accurate impersonation, he gives us the spirit of the Jim we know and thanks to Dfer’s script, which was worked on with the help of McLean’s family, he provides a glimpse behind the door of the Broughty Ferry family home.Jimmy gently guides him through his rollercoaster relationships with football, the media, the fans, and his family.When Jim talks about his we Doris were lump-in-the-throat moments on stage, even more so now, knowing that she lost him on Boxing Day last year.Of course there is plenty for the fans, but there are only a couple of references that might go over the heads of the uninitiated.Most are explained, thankfully without any clunky exposition. Even his uneasy relationship with Duncan Ferguson.Filming has also allowed some special effects – nothing that takes away the theatricality but slight enhancements that help to tell the story for the smaller canvas of a screen.I decided to cast it to the TV rather than watching on a laptop for a fuller experience. Even the set design, which signied his last years living with dementia works well on film at this size.One word of warning for watching at home. It feels much swearier in the living room at home than it did in the safe space of the theatre! Maybe watch where little ears are when you press play.If this is an indication of what Rep Studios will be able to offer alongside its live performances, it will enhance its reputation even more. I know of United fans in Australia, Canada, and around the world who have already bought tickets.Smile itself is up there with some of the Rep’s great productions.Buy tickets to see it online until Sunday, May  at www.dundeerepNewsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"new-bbc-documentary-series-jamie-genevieve-great-indoors-air-week","story":"SOCIAL media star Jamie Genevieve will feature in a new documentary series this week."},{"url":null,"title":"list-glasgow-shops-administration-lockdown","story":"GLASGOWS prominent shopping streets will look very dferent post lockdown with many major retailers calling in the administrators."},{"url":null,"title":"grew-glasgow-margarets-sweet-shettleston-memories-pokey-hats-candy-apples","story":"Earliest memory of Glasgow  I was second youngest in the Gillespie family of  ndash seven brothers and two sisters, and my mum and dad.

It shows new reported cases and deaths in the last day, as well as the total cases in each area since the pandemic began. After a second wave over winter, most areas of the country are starting to see figures fall again.The proportion of people who test positive every day was trending downward since December.The chart below shows local positivity rates. This is now a key metric that is considered when putting each area into tiers. The colour scales refer to the potential levels recommended by the World Health Organisation.Another key metric is the rate of cases per , people. The chart below shows the seven day rate in each local authority. Similar to the chart above, this chart is also colour coded by the potential levels as recommended by the WHO.In the early stages of the pandemic, cases were more concentrated in older generations. In the last few months this has shted towards cases being more prevalent in younger people – however, cases are declining in the more vulnerable age groups as the vaccine rollout progresses.As the number of daily new cases reduces, the cumulative totals for the health board areas become less important. The heatmap below shows the number of new cases by health board area.The chart below shows the daily number of deaths after a positive test as well as the cases where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certicate.The heatmap below shows the age demographics of the people who have lost their lives to the virus. The chart below shows a daily snapshot of the number of people in hospital and ICU with Covid-.

Even though the Reds have won their last two games against St Johnstone and Dumbarton, the performances haven’t been great.Livi aren’t in the red-hot form they were earlier in the campaign, so this is a good chance for Aberdeen to progress.The Lions, however, won’t make it easy, they are always well organised and hard-working.Aberdeen have come unstuck against them previously and they will need to match the visitors’ work-rate and earn the right to play.If the Reds can get past Livi, they will be at home to either Forfar Athletic or Dundee United in the quarter-final.There is a great chance for Aberdeen to reach at least the semi-final of the Scottish Cup.If the Dons could go even further than that and win it, then it would be a dream start to Glass’ time in charge.Glass has said that he wants to play attacking, entertaining football, so hopefully we can see some of that tomorrow.You can’t expect an overnight transformation in how Aberdeen will be playing.But I’m hopeful, and I’m sure the Red Army will be as well, that we’ll some positive signs of what the future may hold.Things aren’t just going to improve instantly, but between now and the end of the season, Glass will be looking to improve on what has gone before this season and it’s not unreasonable to expect some improvement before the end of the campaign.But overall, patience needs to be shown, because coming in at this stage with games still to play Glass doesn’t have the time to implement all his ideas.He’s also working with a squad he has inherited.In the summer Glass will be able to make alterations to the squad and bring in players he feels can make Aberdeen better.He will also have an extended period in pre-season to try to get his ideas across and fully bedded in.It will be interesting to seeAllan Russell can improve Aberdeen’s goalbetween now and the end of the season.The England striker coach is No to new manager Stephen Glass.I’m not expecting miracles in the closing weeks of the campaign when it comes to the impact Russell can make.But things do need to improve in front of goal and hopefully his knowledge and coaching can make a dference.Coming into Pittodrie, Russell is working with strikers who might not be at the Dons next season with loans for Callum Hendry, Fraser Hornby and Florian Kamberi expiring in the summer.If Aberdeen are to finish the season well in the Premiership and the Scottish Cup, they need more at the top end of the pitch.St Johnstone loanee Hendry has netted two goals since arriving at the end of the January transfer window.But fellow deadline day additions Hornby and Kamberi have drawn a blank so far – hopefully Russell can change that.Bringing in someone who is a specialist striker coach is something I think is a good move and something the Dons and other clubs should have looked to do years ago.You have specialist coaching for goalkeepers for example, but striker coaches have been pretty much unheard of.So bringing in Russell is an innovative move from Glass and hopefully it can make a dference for the Dons.Cove Rangers have the chance to move level on points with League One leaders Falkirk at the Balmoral Stadium.Victory for Paul Hartley’s side against the full-time Bairns would a great result and could set up a thrilling closing few weeks to the season.Whatever the result tomorrow the Aberdeen outfit will still be in a good position with fives games left and possible play-offs to follow.Cove have had fine season stepping up to League One and have given themselves a chance to win a third successive promotion.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week march 19 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Please help us raise awareness and raise funds. Whilst we are all fighting coronavirus, Target Oian Cancer is putting the needs of women with oian cancer before all .In  my mother, the actress Marjie Lawrence, was diagnosed with oian cancer just three weeks before she died. Had we and her doctors been aware of the symptoms, Marjie might be alive today. If diagnosed at the earliest stage, nine in  women will survive. But two thirds of women are diagnosed late, when the cancer is harder to treat.This March, for Oian Cancer Awareness Month, I’m writing to ask your readers to take just two minutes of their time to learn the symptoms and spread the word to their families and friends.The main symptoms of oian cancer are: persistent bloating, feeling full or having dficulty eating, tummy pain, and needing to wee more often or more urgently.If you believe in a future where every woman diagnosed with oian cancer has the best chance of survival, please show your support and visit www.targetoiancancer.org.uk MarchSarah Greene, Target Oian Cancer PatronSir,We welcome the latest announcement from the Scottish Government that communal worship can potentially resume from March  with the possibility of up to  people in attendance, assuming physical distancing of two metres can be in place.Christians are Easter people we live with hope in all circumstances, and the church will be providing guidance to congregations to help them ensure that buildings are re-opened in a safe and responsible manner.While some congregations will adopt a cautious approach regarding the reopening of our buildings # and others won#t have the practical means to do so # everyone will be very glad at this news and will already be looking forward to how most appropriately to celebrate Easter .In whatever we do, we#ll be remembering that the God who raised Jesus from the grave has been faithful to us throughout the whole of this last year.Rt Rev Dr Martin Fair, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of ScotlandSir,The first Citizens’ Assembly of Scotland has submitted its final report to the Scottish Parliament, with its  powerful democratic recommendations aimed at improving the wellbeing of Scotland#s people and governance.I personally would have loved to be a participant in this new democratic exercise, meeting and sharing with, speaking and listening to, a wide range of our people, many very unlike me and with very dferent perspectives, opinions and lived experience.To be informed by a range of expert, evidence-based perspectives, to explore and discuss implications and reservations, and to move towards a rough consensus on a range of key questions that will affect ourselves, our children and grandchildren, and that will shape the future of our country – that’s the exemplar of the active, responsible citizen of st century Scotland.There#s a climate assembly also currently working towards its conclusions, and I await its recommendations with interest and anticipation.Recommendation six of the first assembly is: #That in order to ensure that citizens can make informed decisions in relation to rebuilding their communities the Scottish government and parliament should: establish community-based citizens# assemblies to assess what is happening in our communities , identy gaps and recommend actions, including through digital technology, that can bring people together and make our communities more inclusive.#We have a Scottish election coming up in May, and I hope to see a good turnout as a good majority of Scotland’s electorate, from age  upwards, make sure to vote in this most critical exercise of our moment of power and responsibility.Subsequently, I hope to very soon look forward to a renewed interest in local democracy, as an Argyll and Bute Citizens# Assembly debates and decide the shape of Argyll and Bute#s future for the coming decisive decade.Perhaps that future will include enhanced interest and participation in some version of our current powerless and voiceless community councils.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"longing for a rest","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This is mainly due to massive insecticide use and habitat loss caused by intensication of agriculture.Up to  per cent of flowering plants and  per cent of commercial crops require insects for pollination, with honeybees and hoverflies most often doing the job.But with declining numbers of these species, farmers may employ hives of bees to prevent crop yields falling.Wild honeybees forage within three miles of their nest, and onthey perform the #waggle dance# that advertises the location of productive foraging sites to other bees. Also, odours from scented flowers picked up inside the nest while unloading pollen act as cues to guide nest-mates to specic flowers.Now scientists have articially imprinted bees with flower odours in an attempt to improve crop yields*.In trying to establish long-term memory for flower odours, the scientists offered bees in three separate groups of hives alternative odours:  sucrose solution scented with synthetic sunflower odours,  sucrose solution scented with jasmine odours,  sucrose solution alone. They then relocated the hives to a sunflower plantation and compared the foraging activities of bees exposed to the three solutions.First, scientists decoded waggle dances to identy sunflower-specic dances. Using this information, they observed bees from hives fed with sunflower odours performing sunflower dances one hour after hive relocation.Contrastingly, the control bees fed jasmine odours took - hours and control sucrose-fed bees took  hours to perform sunflower dances.This resulted in the sunflower odour-imprinted bees performing signicantly more sunflower-specic waggle dances during the first day of relocation, peaking at  per cent increase over control hives preferentially visiting sunflowers and bringing in more sunflower pollen loads than the control bees.The scientists then measured the all-important crop yields in five plots containing dferent sunflower hybrid plants pollinated by sunflower odour-imprinted compared to control bees.Seed yields in all five plots were highest when pollinated by sunflower odour-fed bees, with increased production up to  per cent above control bees.They conclude that providing bees pre-programmed to forage on specic crops could circumvent wild pollinator shortages and signicantly increase crop yields.*Current Biology , -.

Especially when option one, the Glen Croe route, was the chosen option from the A Trunk Road Study # summary report published by Jacobs in .Surely, after nine years of consulting, the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland can choose the best solution rather than going through a y and expensive consultation process.Based on this, our members would like the permanent solution fast tracked, which is well within the Scottish Government’s power and we would ask for this to be seriously considered.Our other comments and feedback to last week’s announcement are as follows:The timber road route should be upgraded as a short-term solution this summer and not in the suggested  months.Argyll businesses have faced the issues of landslides for many years. However, the situation has worsened over the past year and in our opinion it has now become a national emergency and requires immediate action.The , tons of unstable material could swamp any further mitigation measures put in place on the A and Old Military Roadand make the roads impassable. This could easily happen when we next have an extended period of rainfall.Savings in further mitigation work could go towards upgrading the forestry road.The long-term solution should be selected from the  The A Trunk Road Study and based on the delivery of the most sustainable outcome.Any well-developed permanent solution needs to be open  without fear of being buried under tons of rock and mud, and will have less environmental impact than the landslides, catchpits, netting and OMR bund we are currently experiencing.Our understanding of costs and timescales from similar schemes in Norway show a tunnel could be built in three years at a cost of £-m, and not the £-m stated by Transport Scotland.Members of The RABT Campaign group represent a cross section of business sectors and we would welcome the chance to meet with your officials to discuss how we might help cut through the y timescales and fast-track decision making.John Gurr  Sir,I heard that there was work going on in Lochgilphead town centre, and that some people were complaining, about mess and upheaval.

But some ongoing measures could continue to be barriers to their independence and confidence.People with sight loss can sometimes find it dficult to judge space, so we’re asking everyone to maintain their own distance, be patient and be helpful.Just getting out and about can be more hazardous for those without sight. The government#s #Spaces for People# initiative has already transformed many of our streets and thoroughfares. We must take care that this doesn#t inadvertently create new obstacles for those with disabilities.Let#s make one positive legacy of this crisis a resolve to make sure we re-emerge as a society in which no one is left at the margins.James Adams, director, Royal National Institute of Blind PeopleScotland, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures march 26 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

While saving in some areas of expenditure, it has incurred extra costs in tackling the pandemic and faces an uncertain funding future while the national economy tries to recover. The drive to save money in services where bringing in a little more through, for example, parking fees and fines, is understandable up to a point.But when the economy is on le support after a pandemic, surely the relatively paltry sums to be made are not worth the potential damage to Inveraray#s recovery, as seems to be the view of locals Perhaps councillors could look at this a little dferently. If they are determined to push this through for control traffic purposes, why not donate the proceeds, which would be a by-product of well-behaved traffic, to the town  The pier fund could certainly use it. Both the community council and Inspire Inveraray would no doubt welcome the cash and find many uses for public benefit.Just a thought.Congratulations to Cameron on his award. This is a huge achievement among a group of young people who each work hard for others.It is also  a great achievement for MacLeod Construction to be shortlisted for a national award.

However, on further reading, this was yet another unsurprising disappointment. The preferred corridor through Glen Croe is still to be announced and there is still no timetable for completion.Landslips at the Rest and be Thankful have frequently seen much of Argyll isolated from central Scotland, or journeys delayed by endless roadworks or convoys along the old military road. Most of these problems have occurred during the SNP’s  years in government and the continued failure to provide a permanent solution is yet more proof of how little the SNP cares about or understand the needs of people and businesses outside the central belt.It was clear long ago that patchwork schemes were not a solution but, rather than provide a new corridor which would have resulted in major capital expenditure, tens of millions of pounds have instead been wasted on years of ineffective schemes which nature evades in next to no time.In the meantime, the SNP has had no dficulty finding money to prop up central belt vanity projects like the Edinburgh trams.Mike Russell, SNP MSP for Argyll and Bute, has been far more concerned with Indyref and Brexit than the day to day concerns of his constituents and has done nothing to ensure that providing a reliable road connection to Argyll is a top priority for Michael Matheson, the Cabinet Secretary for Transport.The Holyrood elections on May  are an ideal opportunity for the residents and business owners in Argyll, whose daily lives are affected by such an unreliable road, to voice their dissatisfaction and vote for anyone other than the SNP or the Greens who oppose any road building on principle.A dferent government might not guarantee a speedy resolution, but after  years of failed sticking-plaster attempts to patch up the existing road, it certainly couldn’t be worse.Donald McCallum, Strathaven.Sir,Across the Kintyre and the Islands ward I continue to receive complaints about the rather shoddy condition of road signage.In some cases the signs are faded and covered in dirt and in many other cases they are falling to pieces.One example of this is the road signs above the footpath outside Port Ellen Primary School on Islay and sadly there are many other examples. In my opinion in the future Argyll and Bute Council must be more diligent in maintaining our signs.Road signs help to regulate traffic, provide crucial visual guidance and give drivers important previews, especially during night-time conditions.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I write further to correspondence on Lochgilphead#s expensive new pavements.When they are finally finished, could somebody seethey have a bucket or two of tarry stones left over that could be chucked into the tank trap that passes for a roundabout, next to the Tesco garage David Hay, MinardSir,I have immense pleasure in communicating to your readers our new address following our successful relocation of our main office premises.Our email, website and telephone numbers remain the same as before.Email: info@abcab.org.uk and phone  .We have had no break in service and continue to provide advice and support to clients across Argyll and Bute, with our advisers all working from home under current government guidance.We are also available to provide advice to those who find themselves in a vulnerable position and require face-to-face advice by appointment in our Helensburgh and Lochgilphead offices.We commence our second volunteer adviser training programme next month and look forward to welcoming our new trainees.Jen Broadhurst, Bureau Manager, Argyll and Bute Citizens Advice BureauSir,Following the Scottish Government#s pay offer of four per cent across the board for all NHS workers, Unite will ballot its members on the offer over the next few weeks.Unite represents workers in every pay band across the entire NHS structure and recognises that while this offer will put money into the pockets of our members, any monthly pay uplt will y considerably between iniduals. For this reason Unite will be putting this offer to our members without recommendation.The offer includes an opportunity to revisit any settlement including an intention by the Scottish Government to allocate additional funding through Barnett Consequentials. Unite will demand that any additional payment made to the Scottish Government by Westminster through this formula, is passed on to our members.Workers across the NHS have been described as #heroic# in what has been an exceptionally challenging year. Now is the time to reward those workers with the pay uplt they deserve, not just for their work during the Covid pandemic, but also for the pay cuts they have endured through years of austerity.For Unite, other pay potential remains on the table in the form of additional Barnett Consequentials and we will pursue any additional pay that is intended for our members through further negotiation with any future Scottish Government.James O’Connell, Unite regional officer for Scotland.Sir,I work for a TV company called Five Mile Films and we are making a new documentary series this year for Channel .We are looking for people to apply to take part who are wanting to live a simpler le. The filming will take place over a number of months this year in rural Britain.The idea behind the series is about saying goodbye to smartphones, Zoom calls, social media # all the distractions and pressures of normal le # to go and live a simpler le, experience the #good le# fantasy and think about what our modern le and its multitude of choices has really given us.

When we hear of something that is dficult to believe, we want the evidence of our own eyes.Jesus#s disciple Thomas was like that. It was the week after the crucixion had destroyed their dreams. The disciples were huddled indoors in fear of their lives when suddenly the resurrected Jesus was there among them.Thomas hadn#t been with the others when it happened. He just could not bring himself to believe without seeing him for himself. Thomas gets a bad press because of this.We often react to this wee excerpt from Thomas#s story aswe would have been less reluctant to believe. We carry our willingness to believe as a badge of faith. Poor old Doubting Thomas.But is doubt a weakness  Or is it simply an opportunity, a space, a fertile ground in which faith might grow and ultimately blossom A week later, the disciples were gathered again in the same house where they had last seen Jesus. This time, Thomas was with them. Once again, Jesus came and stood among them. He greeted them again, #Peace be with you,# before turning and addressing Thomas directly.He said to him: #Put your finger here and see my hands. Put your hand in my side. Do not doubt but believe.#Jesus#s words are aimed not only at Thomas, but at everyone who encounters this story, and struggles to believe that God is capable of doing the very thing that God has promised — call our world into new and unending, resurrected le.#Do not doubt but believe.#"},{"url":null,"title":"american dream continues for bob","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

You can also plant the first early potatoes, weather dependent.For beginners, some of the easiest fruits to grow are berries. Strawberries and blueberries love containers or open ground and both will crop heavily once established.A simple garden solution for April is to create your very own veg patch. Mark out the area well, prepare the soil, dig in compost and then sow a iety of seeds that will provide you with veg all year round.It’s a common misconception that you need a lot of space to be able to grow vegetables. You can still achieve real success with container grown plants. Tomatoes will thrive in pots and grow bags and can also be grown in the ground.Another plant that loves container leis Lavender – and it’s the perfect time to plant it so that you can enjoy it throughout the summer. It’s a favourite with gardeners not just for its beautul form and fragrance but also because it attracts essential pollinators such as bees and butterflies.It’s considered a romantic flower that most gardeners get the urge to plant in their garden sooner or later and can add real value with its scent and shades of purple flowers and silver leaf backdrop. To successfully grow lavender, it needs to be planted in a warm, well drained soil with full sun. It is often planted as an edging plant with roses or grown as an informal hedge. However, lavender does not like ‘wet feet’ as it promotes root rot and dampness is often the reason that it doesn’t perform well.

We are also looking for volunteers to support the service.There are an estimated , armed forces veterans in Scotland, with an average age of .  The Comradeship Circles also welcome their partners, widows, and widowers.Participants simply dial into the weekly chat, with a facilitator on hand to assistnecessary. The service is popular with those who are unable or find it dficult to enjoy social connection online.Our Comradeship Circles has been a social leline for many over the last six months, so we’re delighted this funding means they can continue. Even before the pandemic, thousands of older veterans still felt isolated because of health conditions, disabilities, or living in a rural location. Although restrictions are now easing, we know that many are feeling lonelier than ever before.While more and more older people are getting online, there are still hundreds of thousands who are unable or prefer not to use the internet. This telephone service has been especially valued by older veterans who have a disability or health condition which means they struggle to use the video conferencing apps.Comradeship Circles mean they can enjoy banter and share stories and memories of military le. It’s been inspiring to see the care and support that the veterans’ community give each other, helping each other through dficult time. Many participants have told us that they’ve rekindled old friendships or made new ones, or look forward to a natter to get them through the week.If you or someone you know is a veteran aged  or over, we’d encourage them to give it a try.A call to the Age Scotland helpline     can open the door to camaraderie and extra support for older members of the ex-service community.Brian Sloan, Age Scotland chief executive "},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures april 9 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It underlines the fact that it is communities who know best what is best for them.Argyll and Bute Council was at the centre of ensuring our resilience teams got support and Scottish Government funding dispersed quickly and efficiently.That is why I find the decision of the Tory Lib Dem Independent ruling administration to remove the recycling service from Kintyre Recycling Ltdand taking it in-house as short-sighted. And giving them only six months notice is disgraceful.KRL has provided a reliable service for the community since  and given employment opportunities to people with barriers to work. It has a committed board and management team who have ersied the projects it does to ensure sustainability. But this decision leaves a gaping hole in its business plan and a workforce unsurethey will still have jobs.There is a projected increase in cost of £, to supply recycling bins across Kintyre. But this does not take account of the possible social and welfare cost of the impact on the workforce. This is yet another blow to the community already hammered by unemployment.I urge the council to work closely with KRL to find a solution that ensures that all of the KRL employees at risk of redundancy are found suitable employment and that this valuable organisation can continue to employ vulnerable people providing services from which everyone benefits.In , the SNP published a coloured map showing options for the route of the A at the Rest and Be Thankful. Nine years later, all they have done is colour in the map slightly dferently. We are no further forward.Whoever is in government after the election must stump up the money needed to construct a road protected from landslides. This must be done a lot quicker than the  years the SNP say it will take them.Without urgent action, many businesses in Argyll will not survive.Across the Kintyre and the Islands ward I continue to receive complaints about the rather shoddy condition of road signs.In some cases the signs are faded and covered in dirt and in many other cases they are falling to pieces.One example of this is the road signs above the footpath outside of Port Ellen Primary School on Islay and sadly there are many other examples.In my opinion, in the future, Argyll and Bute Council must be more diligent in maintaining our signs. Road signs help regulate traffic, provide crucial visual guidance and give drivers important preview especially during night-time conditions.I will continue to campaign for more frequent road sign maintenance for every corner of my ward.Following the Scottish Government#s pay offer of four per cent across the board for all NHS workers, Unite will ballot its members on the offer over the next few weeks.Unite represents workers in every pay band across the entire NHS structure and recognises that while this offer will put money into the pockets of our members, any monthly pay uplt will y considerably between iniduals. For this reason, Unite will be putting this offer to our members without recommendation.The offer includes an opportunity to revisit any settlement including an intention by the Scottish Government to allocate additional funding through Barnett Consequentials. Unite will demand that any additional payment made to the Scottish Government by Westminster through this formula, is passed on to our members.Workers across the NHS have been described as #heroic# in what has been an exceptionally challenging year.Now is the time to reward those workers with the pay uplt they deserve, not just for their work during the Covid pandemic, but also for the pay cuts they have endured through years of austerity.For Unite, other pay potential remains on the table in the form of additional Barnett Consequentials and we will pursue any additional pay that is intended for our members through further negotiation with any future Scottish Government.I work for a television company called Five Mile Films and we are making a new documentary series this year for Channel .We are looking for people to apply to take part who want to live a simpler le. The filming will take place over a number of months this year in rural Britain.The idea behind the series is about saying goodbye to smartphones, Zoom calls, social media # all the distractions and pressures of normal le # to go and live a simpler le, experience the #good le# fantasy and think about what our modern le and its multitude of choices has really given us. We will explore the idea of whether, in fact, less is more.We are looking for people of all ages to apply families, couples, single people # to take time out from their normal le and step into a dferent way of living.If any of your readers are interested in finding out more, they should email simplele@fivemilefilms, telling us briefly why you would like to live a simpler le.Since the UK was first officially plunged into lockdown, we have lived through what is probably the most extraordinary year in most people#s letimes.Blind and partially sighted people have had to adjust like everyone  to the daily challenges this has created. Thankfully, there#s now light at the end of the tunnel. But some ongoing measures could continue to be barriers to their independence and confidence.People with sight-loss can sometimes find it dficult to judge space, so we#re asking everyone to maintain their own distance, be patient and be helpful.Just getting out and about can be more hazardous for those without sight. The government#s #Spaces for People# initiative has already transformed many of our streets and thoroughfares.We must take care that this doesn#t inadvertently create new obstacles for those with disabilities.The Covid crisis has given all of us a sense of uncertainty and vulnerability, of what it#s like to depend more on others. So let#s make one positive legacy of this crisis a resolve to make sure we re-emerge as a society in which no one is left at the margins.Following publication of his poem #On Distant Shore# in last week#s Courier, Jim McRobert, originally from Campbeltown but now living in Musselburgh, has sent in another one of his self-penned verses.

It is not depression it is more subtle and has spiritual overtones – I would say it is most profoundly a spiritual phenomenon.Looking into it, I clearly identied aspects of it in myself today! It appears to be the most #underdiagnosed# and unacknowledged spiritual illness of this age.I found that Pope Francis also came across it. Commenting in the context of healing the paralytic by the pool, he said the #first illness# is the one afflicting the paralysed man. He had #resigned himself to it,# the Pope said, #perhaps saying to himself: #Le is unfair, others are more fortunate than I am#. There is a plaintive tone in this way of speaking # there is resignation but there is also bitterness.#He added that it is an attitude reminiscent of #many [Christians] who lack enthusiasm and who are bitter#, who repeatedly say to themselves: #I go to [church] every Sunday but it is better not to become involved! I believe for my own sake, but I don#t feel the need to give it to others: each one peacefully at his own home.#These people, the Pope added, also take the attitude that # you do something well in le, they#ll reprove you: so, it#s better not to take the risk#.Good Friday, Easter Sunday # excellent days to take the risk and resolve to do something well in le, to set sensible goals to be better than I am now. But really, any day is a good day to do that."},{"url":null,"title":"vice presidents team takes the honours in tarbert opener","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

In summary, the society was to promote the study of the archaeology of Kintyre and adjacent islands, to investigate the history and antiquities of the area and to preserve and publish relevant records and documents.The office-bearers were: President, Macdonald of Largie Vice-presidents, Sherf Macmaster Campbell, Colonel Mactaggart and Thomas Lindsay Galloway Hon secretary and treasurer, Duncan Colville Council, Mrs T L Galloway , Latimer MacInnes, Dean of Guild Neil McArthur, Major W Macalister Hall of Torrisdale, Mrs Macneal of Lossit , Archibald Dunlop Armour and Rev Norman Mackenzie.Of these, Macmaster Campbell, Mactaggart, MacInnes and Colville would power the research engine of the society in the early decades of its existence with studies on archaeology, history, place-names and local dialect.The scholarly talents of two of the founder-members, Macdonald of Largie and Lindsay Galloway, were almost immediately annulled by the time of the society#s first annual general meeting on November  , both were dead.Macdonald, a product of Eton and Oxford, was the author of a three-volume History of France, and Galloway, a distinguished mining engineer and protégé of Lord Kelvin, in  graduated MA at Glasgow University with first class honours in mathematics and natural philosophy, #a very rare distinction#."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday april 9 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Sadly we have all heard of someone who has been affected by stroke and many people like me have tragically lost someone too.Almost five years ago, my wonderful mum, Diana, suffered a severe stroke. She died four weeks later. My mum was the most active, #full of le# person I knew. She LOVED le. She was my best friend and I miss her every day. That#s why I want to ask your readers to take part in the Stroke Association#s A Walk to Remember.This wonderful event is a special way to celebrate the le of your loved one whilst raising money in their memory.Simply pick a special place that is filled with memories, create your route, and on June  take part in your own walk to remember to raise funds for the Stroke Association.Stroke strikes every five minutes in the UK, and there are around , survivors in Scotland living with its devastating effects who really need our help.Like so many charities, the pandemic has drastically affected the Stroke Association#s income.However the charity has still been supporting stroke survivors as much as they can with support and advice, while continuing to fund vital research into the condition.Please join me and do something amazing in your loved one#s memory by taking part in A Walk to Remember.It#s bound to be an emotional but amazing day for all of us that have lost someone to stroke. Walk in their memory and raise funds to rebuild more lives after stroke.To sign up, please visit https:www.stroke.org.uk fundraising a-walk-to-rememberChildren#s lives have been turned upside over the last year due to challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic, with many spending extended periods of time out of school and behind closed doors.The NSPCC#s Childline service has heard from thousands of children who have found this time really challenging.Some have felt overwhelmed with home schooling and struggled to access their learning due to a lack of technology, whilst others have missed their friends and family and many have seen their mental health deteriorate.The NSPCC and Childline adapted during the pandemic so our frontline staff could continue to be here as a vital source of support for those children who felt like they had nowhere  to turn.Even though many children in Scotland are now back at school, it remains vital that we are still here to support those who are struggling with the impact that the pandemic has had on them.To help us be here for children and to remind them that Childline is a source of support they can turn to, we are encouraging schools across the country to get involved in the NSPCC#s Number Day.This annual fundraising day, which is based around fun maths activities, will take place in primary and secondary schools across the country on May  in aid of the children#s charity.As part of the day, schools can sign up to enjoy puzzles, games and challenges to raise vital funds.There are a range of activities for dferent age groups and teachers will also be provided with resources including information on supporting their school#s safeguarding.It#s now more essential than ever that children aren#t left alone, isolated and unsupported with their worries, and the money raised from Number Day will help the NSPCC in its mission to make  a better year for children.To sign up, visit the NSPCC#s website and search for Number Day and fill in your school#s details using the registration form.Age Scotland has won a £, grant for an innovative telephone friendship service which links older members of the ex-services community.Our Comradeship Circles service has helped to connect hundreds of older veterans for regular group calls since the pilot scheme was launched six months ago.The funding from the Armed Forces Covenant Fund Trust#s Tackling Loneliness Programme will enable our service to expand and continue until autumn , reaching even more older people. We are also looking for volunteers to support the service.There are an estimated , armed forces veterans in Scotland, with an average age of . The Comradeship Circles also welcome their partners, widows, and widowers.Participants simply dial into the weekly chat, with a facilitator on hand to assistnecessary. The service is popular with those who are unable or find it dficult to enjoy social connection online.Our Comradeship Circles has been a social leline for many over the last six months, so we#re delighted this funding means they can continue.Even before the pandemic, thousands of older veterans still felt isolated because of health conditions, disabilities, or living in a rural location. Although restrictions are now easing, we know that many are feeling lonelier than ever before.While more and more older people are getting online, there are still hundreds of thousands who are unable or prefer not to use the internet.This telephone service has been especially valued by older veterans who have a disability or health condition which means they struggle to use the video conferencing apps.Comradeship Circles mean they can enjoy banter and share stories and memories of military le.It#s been inspiring to see the care and support that the veterans# community gives each other, helping each other through dficult times. Many participants have told us that they’ve rekindled old friendships or made new ones, or look forward to a natter to get them through the week.If you or someone you know is a veteran aged  or over, we#d encourage them to give it a try.A call to the Age Scotland helpline     can open the door to camaraderie and extra support for older members of the ex-service community.I have been contacted by many of my constituents about the concerning condition of Ballymartin road on Islay.It has gradually been getting worse over the years but is now as bad as it has ever been and is getting to the stage that it#s nearly not passable for a small car without risking damage.I have raised this with our roads department and although funds are stretched, this road is clearly in need of some desperate repairs and,left unmaintained for any longer, will only end up costing the hard-pressed council taxpayer more to fix in the long-run."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week april 9 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The disciples were huddled indoors in fear of their lives when suddenly the resurrected Jesus was there among them.Thomas hadn#t been with the others when it happened. He just could not bring himself to believe without seeing him for himself. Thomas gets a bad press because of this.We often react to this wee excerpt from Thomas#s story aswe would have been less reluctant to believe. We carry our willingness to believe as a badge of faith. Poor old Doubting Thomas.But is doubt a weakness  Or is it simply an opportunity, a space, a fertile ground in which faith might grow and ultimately blossom A week later, the disciples were gathered again in the same house where they had last seen Jesus. This time, Thomas was with them. Once again, Jesus came and stood among them. He greeted them again, #Peace be with you,# before turning and addressing Thomas directly.He said to him: #Put your finger here and see my hands. Put your hand in my side. Do not doubt but believe.#Jesus#s words are aimed not only at Thomas, but at everyone who encounters this story, and struggles to believe that God is capable of doing the very thing that God has promised — call our world into new and unending, resurrected le.#Do not doubt but believe.#"},{"url":null,"title":"two pairs triumph at dunaverty","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

These devices have blocked an estimated , calls, of which , will have been scam phone calls prevented at least  scams and saved vulnerable households an estimated £, in NHS and health and social care costs.PC Laura Evans of Argyll and Dunbartonshire Policing Division said: #The most common types of scams at the moment are telephone and internet scams whereby the caller or person emailing, pretends to be someone , for example, someone from your bank, BT, Amazon or Sky.#We have a large number of telephone frauds where the caller is told their bank has set up a new account for them and has asked them to transfer their money to this new account. Your bank will never ask you to do this and I would encourage people to simply hang up the telephoneyou think you are being scammed or,you are concerned about someone  receiving scam calls, then consider a call-blocker device.#The most common calls being blocked by trueCall units are misleading sales of insurance for white goods, appliances or Sky equipment and attempts to sell cover for domestic home repairs.As more people signed up to streaming services during lockdown, there was an increase in scam calls purportedly from Amazon Prime, where cold callers said that the recipient#s subscription was due for renewal or that their account had been hacked.Another type of nuisance call which emerged towards the end of  was the sale of timeshares, possibly in response to widespread issues with travel and accommodation during the pandemic.An Argyll and Bute Council spokesperson said: #Scammers are unscrupulous with the sole intention of identying and exploiting the most vulnerable in our communities by obtaining people#s personal data and to encourage them to give the caller their bank details. This is often achieved by implying that urgent action is required – a tactic which particularly targets elderly and more vulnerable people.#The trueCall call-blocking unit can give our residents peace of mind, knowing thatthe phone rings it will be someone they want to talk to.#If you are being pestered by nuisance calls or you know a family member or friend that could benefit from having a call-blocker, please contact Argyll and Bute Trading Standards on    or tradingstandards.office@argyll-bute.gov.uk to apply for a free device.#"},{"url":null,"title":"announcements april 16 2021","story":"ProductionUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

There was mention the flat had not been used much for the purpose of respite for islanders.However, a report before IJB members said the lack of consultation over it closing had caused community concern. The meeting was told there had been #a mix up# over communicating what was happening with islanders.Councillor Mulvaney said he did not feel the flat merited still being in the budget. #We should have saved this [the money] a number of years ago,# he said.Councillor Currie said: #The flat has been used, not much, but it has been used. Everyone is accepting it could have been advertised better.#It was Mid Argyll councillor Sandy Taylor who asked for the service level agreement for the advocacy service to be spared from the savings option list as #a contribution to mental health.#MID ARGYLL AND ISLAY:People across Mid Argyll and Islay have had their mental health boosted thanks to the innovative #Take  Challenge# which began in Kintyre.Inspired by Campbeltown Tesco manager David Brown#s personal K-a-day challenge in , mental health network ACUMEN, in conjunction with Kintyre Link Club, organised the initiative encouraging more people to #take five# each day –  five minutes of walking, five deep breaths of fresh air or a five-kilometre walk or run – with the aim of boosting wellbeing.After success in Kintyre, ACUMEN mental health development worker Sarah McFadzean rolled the challenge out across Mid Argyll and Islay, where people are encouraged to support one another in their challenges by way of a dedicated Facebook group.Where possible, people have been able to meet in twos and, as restrictions change, it is hoped opportunities for groups to Take  together will increase as the initiative moves to the Oban, Lorn and the Isles area in June.Sarah said: #Being involved and enjoying the challenge is as important as the activities themselves.#I would like to thank everyone who supported and got involved in Take  for their enthusiasm and assistance.#We are in the process of developing a Mental Health Forum and Lived Experience Group in the Mid Argyll, Kintyre and the Isles, the purpose of which will be to gather thoughts on current service provision, listen to others# experiences and inform future planning, along with providing information from a range of services and peer support.#For more information contact sarah.mcfadzean@acumennetwork"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane april 16 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Meantime, however, with the exception of the magazine, all society activities remain in a state of suspension."},{"url":null,"title":"from our files april 16 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

And now, more than a week later and despite updates in the interim about the reopening of schools, they#re still waiting – and it#s not acceptable.Like everyone , islanders are desperate to know when they can reconnect with family and friends. Island businesses are equally frantic to know when and how they can make plans for the weeks ahead.But, unlike everyone , our islands are at a complete disadvantage. They still don#t know what is happening, or when. They deserve better. The Scottish Government needs to respond to our islands# call for clarity and let them, like the rest of the country, start to think and plan ahead.Now in its nd year, the Big Garden Birdwatch is a chance for people of all ages to count the number of birds that visit their garden helping the Royal Society for the Protection of Birdsto build up a picture of how they are doing.This year, more than a million people across the UK, including more than , in Scotland, took part, counting  million birds.The event, held over the last weekend in January, revealed the house sparrow held on to its number one spot. But  out of the top  bird species showed declines in average numbers in Scotland compared to last year.Starlings remained in second place, but numbers were down  per cent compared to . Goldfinches saw the greatest decline in Scotland’s top , falling four places from sixth position last year, with reported numbers  per cent fewer than .I am absolutely delighted with the number of people who have taken part, making it the biggest year ever for RSPB Scotland.This has generated a massive amount of data which will help our scientists with important conservation work, but it also shows how many of us have turned to nature after what has been a dficult  months.We need every voice raised to stand up for nature. The wildle that brings us so much interest and solace is now just a fraction of what should be there.Big Garden Birdwatch has shown that people across Scotland have a real passion for their wildle. We now need government to take the global leadership, policy and legislative opportunities open to it this year to reverse the decline and restore nature.It#s no exaggeration to say that when a dog goes missing or is stolen, it is heart-breaking.Dogs for Good has put together some tips to reduce the likelihood of your dog being taken.If the unthinkable happens and your dog is taken, remember, you are not alone. There are plenty online groups and pages offering guidance and support. DogLost is an excellent charity which provides a free lost and found service.You should also noty police, dog wardens, vets and local rescue centres.Tables for Dementia UK#s annual cake and tea event, Time for a Cuppa, have been reset.Dementia UK is the only charity dedicated to supporting the whole family through dementia specialist Admiral Nurses.The charity#s annual fundraising event takes place between May  and May .Since its launch, it has raised more than £ million with the support of fundraisers, Dementia UK staff and celebrities.One of the highlights of last year#s event was celebrity supporters dressing up as much-loved characters to recreate tea party scenes from the world of film. Phyllis Logan was Mary Poppins, music producer Naughty Boy was Jay Gatsby, Emma Barton was Holly Golightly and Jess and Natalya Wright were Alice in Wonderland and the Queen of Hearts.Families with dementia have been adversely affected by lockdown for just over a year now. Care home visiting restrictions, the closure of support and respite services and the resulting social isolation and loneliness have disproportionately affected people living with dementia and their family carers.Whilst Time for a Cuppa will be slightly dferent this year, we know dementia support is needed more than ever. We are so grateful to all our fundraisers who will be whipping up treats, enthusiasm, funds and who are giving their time for others – in a socially distanced way of course – in what will be a special and important Time for a Cuppa.For more information about Time for a Cuppa and how to host your own tea party with our free fundraising pack, visit the dementiauk.org timeforacuppa webpage."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week april 16 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We have celebrated birthdays, weddings, Christmases, Easters and any day we can! There has been laughter and sadness, fun, hope and joy.It was  when the seeds were planted at the South Kintyre Fit Communities about the need to develop a shopping service to help older people on discharge from hospital, no longer able to drive or to carry heavy bags.Since then, we have provided not just a shopping service but a number of social activities and housekeeping throughout Kintyre. We have developed the #Making Kintyre Dementia Friendly# project to help all parts of the community to have an understanding of dementia and how it can be managed. We have worked with children of all ages, meeting and helping the older generation and look forward to doing so again.Covid- has changed all our lives and we have had to adapt to dferent ways of keeping in touch and keeping busy. Phone Buddies was set up and we had a monthly virtual tea.However, our plans – started last year – to celebrate our th anniversary with parties has had to be cancelled but we are marking the occasion with a specially made mug by Simon Rochford of Campbeltown Pottery.Thanks to everyone who has been involved in any way with Shopper-Aide – it has been and, I hope, will continue to be, a help to the older generations in Kintyre.So here is to the next  years."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week april 16 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

In our desire to understand it, we have created starry patterns in our minds like the Plough, the Bull and so on, however, the signs of the Zodiac were already known to the Babylonians in  BC so that is not something new.Today, constellations like Aries, Gemini and others continue to fascinate followers of both astronomy and astrology.One of the most interesting star formations is the Pleiades, better known as the Seven Sisters. Positioned a little to the right of Taurus, they are an unmistakable sight in the winter sky.Even a modest pair of binoculars will reveal that there are many more stars in that cluster than the naked eye can discern. The Pleiades along with Orion, are even mentioned in the bible, in the Book of Job, chapter ..With the aid of binoculars these stars are a truly dazzling sight.The bible is a collection of books coming from the pens of many dferent authors over a long period of time.

a mark of respect for HM The Queen and the Royal Family.Prince Philip was a remarkable public servant and we will again suspend campaigning on Saturday for his funeral to reflect on his contribution to public le.Before campaigning was suspended, Scottish Labour unveiled its recovery plan for the economy and jobs.At its heart is a pound. billion jobs recovery plan, the biggest job creation scheme in the history of devolution.This recognises the scale of the looming jobs crisis the country faces.It includes guaranteeing a job or training for every under-, as well as those over- who are long-term unemployed, , new apprenticeships and a skills revolution.The party also launched plans for an ambitious climate recovery, something Scottish Labour believes should go hand in hand with our economic recovery.This includes investing in green transport, safer walking and cycling routes, free bus travel for under-s, making all homes energy efficient to reduce living costs, create jobs and help to reduce our carbon emissions.These innovative national plans will translate well to a local level, providing a framework to support East Lothianrsquos recovery.However, Irsquom very clear that our local recovery, while backed by national guidance and funding, must be designed and delivered locally, not by ministers and civil servants in Edinburgh.Over the last year, our communities have demonstrated how they can come together in times of need and look after each other.Local communities, businesses and organisations should be empowered to show the same drive and determination in recovering from Covid- that they have shown throughout the crisis.Finally, on a more personal note, I have pledged my support for several important campaigns and initiatives so far during the campaign.Among them are the Teach the Future pledge on making the climate emergency part of the curriculum the More for Scotlandrsquos Animals pledge on animal welfare the Walk, Wheel, Cycle, Vote

Trade Deal being negotiated with the USA leaves our NHS vulnerable and available for sale.Our SNP MPs proposed an amendment which would have ensured that our NHS remained in the public ownership.The Westminster Government rejected that safeguard.Since GP surgeries are independent contractors, not run by the NHS, they are vulnerable to being sold to the highest bidder.This is how the system was set up in .It may have made sense at the time but no longer.We must review the deal with doctors and ensure that creeping privatisation cannot take place.In Scotland, we have control over our NHS.However, the UK Government passed the Internal Markets Act, which allows UK Government ministers to arbitrarily enforce a lsquolevelling outrsquo of regulations and dferences between the nations

of the Duke of Edinburgh ndash a dedicated public servant.I send my condolences to Her Majesty The Queen and her family.The quality of our social care system should be a key issue at this election.The speed with which the failings of our social care system were exposed last spring was ghastly.The Covid crisis didnrsquot bring about the crisis in social care, it was already there.It simply brought it to the top of the agenda.The challenge of Covid- has made the crisis in care even more acute.The movement of people from hospital settings, without consultation and without being tested, into care homes to accommodate Covid patients was a human rights scandal.This contributed to the devastating reality of care homes becoming the epicentre of the pandemic and almost a third of deaths across the country being people from care homes.Scotlandrsquos social care workers have also been on the frontline in the fight against Covid.Their commitment, alongside all our other frontline workers, to help keep us safe during this public health emergency has been heroic.Scottish Labour has been calling for a National Care Service for some years now, a service that will include local governmentrsquos social care staff as partners in the service delivery.It will put the dignity of iniduals and the quality of services before profit.We must address the inequalities in the sector as it deals with the shortcomings highlighted in the recent Feeley Report, which I donrsquot think goes far enough.Scotland urgently needs a plan to transform social care. Scottish Labour knows that urgent reform and investment is needed and thatrsquos why we are working with the public to make our vision for a National Care Service a reality.We donrsquot want to just talk about the problems, we want a plan for how things could be better.Charles Dundas A QUESTION which I keep being asked during this campaign is what will the Scottish Liberal Democrats do for those in our communities who are struggling to make ends meet, especially those with children I know that all parties are committed to reducing child poverty, but here is what I want to do about it.Willie Rennie and the Scottish Liberal Democrats will commit to doubling the Scottish Child Payment.This is currently available at pound per week to eligible children under six.This will rise to take in under-s in the next few years and we will pay pound per week.We are also keen to listen to campaigners who want to extend the payments to include disabled children or those with disabled parents.It was Liberal Democrats who reintroduced free school meals and targeted extra money to schools who needed it most in England, and in Scotland we will extend free school meals to cover all primary school pupils all through the year, including school holidays.This will also help these children with their education since a hungry child finds it dficult to focus and learn.The Scottish Lib Dems also pledge to increase the amount of free childcare Scotland offers, increasing it to a full , hours for every two-year-old.At the moment only some twoyear-olds are eligible, and takeup of the places is very low.By expanding the scheme, wersquod hope it would be more useful to more and more working parents, helping them get back to work and all the benefits that brings to society and the economy.We will also extend the number of summer clubs on offer to eligible children to help parents on low incomes with the costs of childcare during the school holidays.Plus, our manesto pledge on fuel poverty will also help us with child poverty.Warm homes with lower heating costs undoubtedly help the families who need it most, and I think that Midlothian North and Musselburgh would benefit from more Liberal Democrat policies like these in place after the election.Iain Whyte AS PART of my campaign, I have been highlighting the need for more local policing and ato locally based crime prevention across the constituency.This should be backed by visible local police patrols in our neighbourhoods to deter and detect crime.So, it was disappointing to read news articles this week highlighting police advice to Musselburgh householders about securing their garden sheds due to a spate of breakins.The crimes seem to have been concentrated in the Stoneybank area but the advice is valuable for everyone.Police say you should make sure your shed is secure and should fit an alarmthere is anything valuable inside.The alarms can be provided free to elderly and vulnerable residents: email MusselburghWestCPT@scotland.pnn.police.ukSince Police Scotland was formed, there has been a centralisation of our policing that I want to see reversed.During that time, public awareness of police patrols fell from  to  per cent.I know from my time as chair of Lothian and Borders Police Board that locally based crime prevention had a really positive impact.Crime fell and communities felt far more connected to their local officers, who they knew were working on their priorities.Thatrsquos why I want to see beefed-up neighbourhood policing teams and theirin the parts of the constituency where they have been reduced or removed.These teams work well on a preventative agenda.They solve problem issues and work with the community sorting things like housebreaking sprees and anti-social behaviour.I also strongly support the wider Scottish Conservative campaign to introduce a Local Policing Act to boost local police patrols and increase community engagement with policing decisions.This goes alongside our plan to tackle more serious crime by introducing a Victims Law to end the SNPrsquos soft-touch justice system.This would give judges the ability to put the very worst criminals behind bars for le.It would also end automatic early release, so that criminals must earn parole.Musselburgh residents need to see a more visible, local and responsive police service.That would be my aimyou elect me as your MSP."},{"url":null,"title":"puppet-set-go-storm-fringe-sea","story":"Country’s largest puppet coming to Fringe by the SeaStorm ahead of her debut in Glasgow was visited by some pupils from Macmerry Priltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtmary School.

It focused, almost immediately, on Lets try to uncover who this person was.\"We already know who the artist is, we know his great works, we know his works as a philosopher and as an engineer, anatomist, botanist - it goes on. But who was he behind all that  Who was he at the core  What motivated him as an artist, as a person  What were his vulnerabilities \"The story focuses a lot on Da Vincis very unorthodox upbringing with his grandparents, and how that may have influenced him.Interestingly, the drama also explores the pioneers sexual orientation, portraying his relationships with men.Starring alongside Turner as Leonardos \"muse\" Caterina da Cremona is Matilda De Angelis, who many will recognise from one of the biggest TV events of last year, HBO series The Undoing.The Italian actress, , shares it was the passion that director Daniel Percival had about the character and the story - which weaves in a murder mystery - that initially drew her into the role.\"I really like the thriller part of it,\" she follows. \"It was important to add something a bit spicy to the story, and the thriller part is so clever and so interesting.\"And the relationship between them was also very beautul and pure, and Im a romantic person so I like this kind of impossible relationship.\"When it came to research for the role, Turner had an experience \"that just felt really special. It felt like, This shouldnt have happened.\"It was the chance to visit the Louvre Museum in Paris, and have a private viewing of Da Vincis work, which includes the iconic Mona Lisa.\"I got to spend a couple of hours with his paintings on my own and it was extraordinary.\"I mean, there are so many things that strike you.

Theyre like high-definition photographs. You get as close as you can safely get to the painting, which is close enough, and its just perfect. Theyre perfectly preserved, theyre perfectly executed.\"He read biographies as part of his preparation, too .Plus, there were workshops on set, which saw the star witness real-le painters replicating Da Vincis work - and then he would have to try to do it himself.So, just how good is Turner with a paintbrush \"I dont knowgood is the right thing Im brave,\" he says, laughing.\"Leonardo worked very slow, because his work was very precise work, obviously. So, as an actor on set, you cant make any huge mistakes, when youre working a very fine brush - you can almost count the bristles on it - and youre applying a small amount of paint.\"He has actually played a painter before Dante Gabriel Rossetti in the  BBC series Desperate Romantics. But while on that production, he would use a nish over the paint, to allow for mistakes, it was dferent for Leonardo.\"We didnt have that luxury. We were quite authentic we would use pigments and apply the paint. So, yeah - no room for error!\"One of the interesting ideas about Da Vinci is how obsessed he was with attaining perfection.Nowadays, with social media a part of our everyday lives, theres an argument to be had that there is even more pressure on us as humans to be perfect.But \"its not something that Im interested in,\" suggests De Angelis. \"I think perfection, its rather boring and it doesnt exist.\"I think Leonardo da Vincis portraits are perfect. But perfection, for me, is not something that I look for.\"Turner, however, seems to have trouble with the suggestion that Leonardo was a perfectionist.\"I think he was an incredible observer, and it was important for him to observe nature and the way he saw it and try to replicate that on a canvas, or a sculpture, or whatever it might be,\" he notes. \"And he always talked about in his writing how dficult that was - the fingerprint of God and how impossible it is to emulate something like this. So, he always knew he wouldnt even get close, but his idea was to get as close as he possibly could.\"As for the topic of social media, the actor says: \"Theres only so many people who can get into a gallery to see a piece of work, or to have it with them. And these days, theres Instagram for an artist, and your work is judged on a global level immediately.

We spoke to dog welfare charity Dogs Trust to see what people can do to ensure that their four-legged friends are both safe and comfortable when out and about in the car.\"When lockdown restrictions lt, one of the things dog owners may be looking forward to is a road trip with their canine companion, to go somewhere further afield for walkies,\" a charity spokesperson said.\"Not all dogs love travelling in the car, so please be aware of this before embarking on a trip. If youre unsure, avoid journeys while you seek the guidance of an experienced behaviourist. If you know your four-legged friend enjoys a car ride, its important to make sure they are safe, comfortable and feel confident.\"Dogs Trust also advises that should you see a distressed dog in a vehicle, always call .Keep things secureThe Highway Code stipulates that dogs need to be properly restrained in the vehicle. It means that dogs should be kept in a properly-fitting seat-belt harness, pet carrier, dog cage or in the boot behind a dog guard. Theyve got to be securely fitted, too, to ensure that your dog cant get loose and interfere with whoever is behind the wheel.Many car companies offer their own dedicated dog accessories, such as those for Land Rovers Discovery Sport. Its always worth checking to seetheres a bespoke option for your car, as it could make elements such as installing and using them a bit easier.Dont leave your dog alone in the carThough it might be tempting to leave your dog in the caryoure quickly dashing in somewhere, its something that should definitely be avoided. Leaving your dog unattended in the vehicle increases the risk of them being stolen, so you should always take them with youyou can.If youre filling up with fuel, then ensure you lock the vehicle when you pay, or ask a passenger to take them on a quick walk in the meantime.Keep them coolYou should make sure that you keep your dog cool when travelling. Keeping non-spill water bowls to hand can help, as can factoring in short walks or exercise breaks during the journey.Try to avoid travelling during the hottest part of the day, and consider fitting window blinds to keep the cars cabin as cool as can be. And remember, never leave your pet alone in the car on a hot day. They can be very vulnerable to the heat, and sadly pets do die in hot cars often far more than people realise.Stay calmDogs Trust says its important to keep your dog calm and ensure that it is paying attention to you before they get in or out of the car. Allowing your dog to exit the vehicle immediately after you stop could cause them to expect this each time you come to a halt, which could prove to be dangerous in the long run.Dogs should ideally be taught to wait for you to attach their lead properly before being allowed to carefully exit the car.Positive reinforcementFor many dogs, travelling in a car can prove challenging. After all, its a new and somewhat scary environment for many. Its why drivers should try and help their dogs to become familiar with car rides by undertaking several shorter trips first, before setting out on a longer one.By doing so, youll be able to reward them for being calm in the car, or even for just being near the vehicle.Take suppliesIts worthwhile keeping a supply of your dogs usual food in the car. It means that, should you get stuck in traffic, youre not left high and dry with a hungry hound.Keep a lead close to handEnsure you keep your dogs harness and lead close to the hand when youre driving, just in case you need to quickly exit the car in the event of an emergency."},{"url":null,"title":"brian-taylor-loathing-election-dont-blame-politicians---fault","story":"That giant beast  Scotlandrsquos underwhelming economic performance, with output and productivity lagging behind that of comparably sized nations such as Denmark and Norway.The shadow of the mammoth was delineated once more this week in an Oxford Economics report for Sir Tom Hunterrsquos foundation. It told a familiar story.Yes, Scotland does better than other areas of the UK, London apart. However, we have problems with our birth rate, both in terms of population and business start-ups.Further, those businesses which do get going tend not to grow rapidly or signicantly. Our productivity is a concern: we need to ersy our economy, not least in the North Sea where oil and gas are declining assets.:Sturgeon versus Salmond. Here are the game plans for the socially distanced electionDo I see the mammoth twitch its ears at these comments  Perhaps, like the canine world, it is alert to the high-pitched whistles which customarily sound at such points.Dog whistle one, directed at supporters of opposition parties. It is all the fault of the incumbent Scottish or UK governments. If only they would adopt our policies.Up to a point, Lord Copper. Underlying economic problems in Scotland predate the present administrations. Indeed, they predate devolution.Dog whistle two, aimed at supporters of independence. The problems rest solely with the Union. Political independence would liberate our economy, permitting us to match the performance of our Nordic chums.The Oxford Economics report does say that some of the remedies to the problems they diagnose rest with UK action, notably on taxation. Further, they argue that Brexit has made the situation worse.However, they add that devolved Scotland needs to pay more heed ndash and cash ndash to the issue of economic development, while removing obstacles to growth.Perhaps we might consider that the solution need not lie solely with constitutional change. Supporters of independence do not have to take my word for that: they can read chapter and verse in another report, this one produced for the SNP.In , the partyrsquos Growth Commission, chaired by Andrew Wilson, produced a y and thoughtful study.Mr Wilson noted then that independence was no ldquomagic wand: that there was a need to be ldquocandid about the challenges, in addition to optimistic about the opportunities. He said hope must conquer fear but must also be ldquogrounded in clear-sighted reality and a rigorous plan.This largely presaged the diagnosis set out in this weekrsquos Oxford Economics study but went on to generate a composite cure of its own making, focused upon the need to grow GDP through ldquoproductivity, population and participation.Tell me this. Are you hearing much in this election with regard to the economy which is either clear-sighted or rigorous  Are you hearing much in the way of detailed discourse at all Are you hearing instead voluble,inevitably inconclusive, argument about the date of the next independence referendum  From both sides of that debate.In the corner of the election room, the rough beast shakes its head, slowly and ponderously.When we hear such unalloyed promises, pests like me tend to ask ldquowhere is the money coming from  Such was always my habit and I am revisiting it in a podcast series being prepared for The Herald.From experience, replies y but, mostly, they range from unspecied growth to ldquoefficiency savings . If pressed, my interlocutors may argue that ldquowe cannot afford NOT to spend this money.:Independence and the SNP mdash The dream that hesitates to speak its nameIncidentally, they will always talk of ldquoinvestment, rather than ldquospending. Somehow, that irks me. I know, I know, pitiably petty, but there it is.Look, I get the concept. I know the notion is that we are investing in future generations. I applaud that endeavour. But let us not fool ourselves. Politicians talk of investment, rather than cash, because they know it is a comforting euphemism for the taxpayers.There is another element to this debate. This weekrsquos report presumes that we want to grow GDP, that it is an agreed objective,the methods remain disputed. But is that entirely true The Greens, for example, question the value of Gross Domestic Product as a touchstone. Nicola Sturgeon, too, has advanced the concept that we might need a dferent set of values, encompassing human well-being rather than financial growth.Again, I applaud this endeavour. It is right and proper to examine the basis upon which we found our polity.However, as Ms Sturgeon and others have recognised, we need to do more than to restate our objective as well-being. We need to define that objective itself and to specy policies which might generate advancement in pursuit of that aim.Otherwise, we risk substituting a warm glow for rigorous governmental policy, precisely as Andrew Wilson warned in his  report. We risk copying Voltairersquos Pangloss and believing that we can all too easily create a situation in which ldquoall is for the best in the best of all possible worlds.Again, to some extent, we are collectively culpable of pushing our politicians in a Panglossian direction. We say we want the hard facts: give it to us straight. But do we  Really Would we not rather hear of more for the NHS, more for schools, what about transport, and donrsquot forget the pensioners  Do we not groan, inwardly,a candidate starts talking about tax policy The great philosopher John Stuart Mill pursued his principle of Utility, arguing that happiness is the only true object, that actions must be judged by the extent to which they generate such contentment.The danger is that we only want to hear about happiness ndash gaun yerselrsquo, JSM.

It demands little in the way of originality and much in callousness: somewhere an old woman is mourning the loss of a man who had been her le companion for the last  years. Sympathy costs nothing and enhances us vindictiveness reduces us.Angela Haggerty, the left-wing media commentator who springs from a working-class tradition, encapsulated this best when she tweeted: ldquoHaving lost my Dad in June and watching him become so frail, my emotional instinct at the death of Prince Philip is to feel sad for his family. Having a political view on the role of monarchy doesnrsquot require you to sacrice your personal humanity.

Irsquom not surethere is a template somewhere that dictates the protocols for greeting the death of a long-standing prince consort. If such a concordat exists it surely didnrsquot envisage what we have witnessed over the two days.Itrsquos been reported that the Duke of Edinburgh didnrsquot want too much of a fuss to be made of his death and this seems to have been of a piece with his general approach to le. So, itrsquos probably safe to assume he would have greeted whatrsquos followed it with that grimace perfected by the male royals whenever they encounter something avid . Thus, an event that called for quiet and proportionate dignity was turned into something brash and braying. And the death of an old man became less of a tribute to whatever personal qualities he possessed than an opportunity to convey triumphalism.In recent years we have seen something of this in the way that the poppy, once a universal symbol of humble sacrice, has been distorted into a vampiric caricature. The weeks prior to November  now ring to the cries of poppy vigilantes hunting down those not deemed to be sufficiently enthusiastic about wearing this little red emblem of hope.Our publicly-funded broadcaster became BBC Windsor as it made a graven image of this man who, though essentially decent probably didnrsquot achieve much more than many otherstheyrsquod had access to the resources and personnel of the statersquos largesse. Their simpering coverage actually insulted those qualities they were eager to associate with him: dignity duty selflessness and a desire to make a quiet contribution.It was also tone deaf to the losses borne by , of us who have seen loved ones perish as coronavirus has moved through the land. The BBC has been an exemplar of fine public broadcasting in the way itrsquos conveyed the quiet dignity of many ordinary families who have endured grief in this pandemic. Many harbour a measure of affection for the royal family and the stability and fortitude they believe this institution still represents. I suspect though, that many too will be among the thousands who have registered complaints about the BBCrsquos gross lapse in editorial judgment.Read more:The British elite has failed utterly. Its time for Scotland to break freeThroughout the course of Saturday BBC presenters were made to wear black as a procession of plummy-voiced, public school Astors filed in to recreate what s deference sounded like. Here was the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby describing Prince Philip as ldquoa prophet. And over there a chaise longue of Tatler socialites describing him asa David Attenborough prototype an icon of religious unity and a pioneer of feminism: this for not making a fuss and stamping his feet at being made to walk two paces behind the Queen.The old fella, doubtless stf with boredom, simply did what most of the rest of us would have chosen to do ndash given the resources ndash at the prospect of a le consorting with myriad Trumpington-Llewellins and Sharpington-Dinsdales: he developed a rapid interest in exotic animals and wild places hellip the remoter the better. He wasnrsquot looking for medals, though.But medals are what he got from the BBC and an assortment of establishment lickspittles. By the time his funeral comes along on Saturday I fully expect a couple of miracles to be ascribed to his heavenly intervention and archbishop Welby to be naming a book of common prayer in his honour.You suspect though, that much of this stemmed from something more than the establishment getting carried away in a fugue of royalist fervour in readiness for the end of lockdown. They have made golden calves of these dysal German aristocrats, not because they hold them in anything approaching genuine admiration, but because their very existence sancties and reinforces the class system that underpins English society. In normalising this with daily obeisance to the House of Windsor it becomes embedded in the collective consciousness of those who, in other countries, would consider such an arrangement bizarre and unacceptable.In these countries they treat their royal families as mere state ambassadors who get to wear ceremonial dress occasionally as long as they donrsquot get too many ideas above their conferred status. In the UK they have been made into something much more insidious: the casual rendering of inequality and unearned privilege into something benign.This is what has been going on these last few days.

She grew up in a big house with servants in Cha and might have been expected to become a Tory indeed, when she first started campaigning for Labour, she was accused of being a traitor to her class. However, her father, George Catlin, was a Labour candidate and pushed her to party meetings in her pram, and her mother, Vera Brittain, wrote about the pain and pointlessness of war in her memoir Testament of Youth. For Shirley, it was a kindergarten of radicalism and compassion.But she was never really a socialist. She was a radical liberal. She was a social democrat and an internationalist. She was pro-European, anti-nationalist and anti-authoritarian and she was uncomfortable with the extremities of both the Left and the Right. At one end was the big-state socialism of Michael Foot and at the other end the free-market conservatismof Tony Blair and in the middle was Shirley. She was in the centre. She was a centrist.We know now, of course, that the centre got squeezed when Mrs Thatcherrsquos fortunes recovered after the Falklands War, and the search for the middle ground goes on. In writing the obituary for Williams, I read some of her speeches and her guiding principles were clear: social liberalism, internationalism, a desire for equality, and concern about the authoritarianism of the rightand the authoritarianism of the left .Looking back, you can see that Williams was a voice of common sense in the middle of it all, but her death raises the question of why there is still no obvious home for people who agree with her, particularly in Scotland. For a long time, there was a tradition of radical, passionate liberalism in the Highlands and, in the cities, voters gathered round the party of Keir Hardie there was also a vein of lower-case conservatism in the Borders and Aberdeenshire. But all of it, pretty much, circled round the same point: the liberal centre.So where has Scotlandrsquos centre gone  Many voters may feel it lies somewhere, deep down, in the bosom of the SNP but their record in government tells a dferent story. Where are the radical, or even effective, policies aimed at reducing inequality  Policies like the introduction of comprehensive schools in the s, which Shirley Williams helped steer through. Therersquos also an unpleasant authoritarian streak in the SNP that Williams would surely hate: the ldquonamed person proposals, for example, or the Hate Crime Bill.Ordinarily, voters who think like Shirley might find their home in some of the smaller parties andyou look at the policies of the Scottish Greens, therersquos much for liberals to like: more powers for councils, an end to fox hunting, and an end to the so-called ldquowar on drugs. The same applies to the Lib-Dems and particularly Labour under its new leader Anas Sarwar, who speaks the kind of language Shirley would applaud: compassionate, internationalist, liberal.But sadly the centre has been squeezed again. In the s, it was squeezed between Thatcherism and socialism and in Scotland in , itrsquos being squeezed between nationalism and unionism. Vote for the Scottish Greens and get nationalism. Vote for the SNP and get nationalism. Vote for the Lib-Dems in a seat thatrsquos going to be won by either the SNP or the Tories and get nationalism. Radical, internationalist liberals have no home. Who on earth do they vote for  Where on earth is the centre Forty years ago, Shirley Williams thought, or hoped, she had found the answer in the SDP. She was wrong, but perhaps there is some hope to be found in how her story ended. The SDP imploded, but its creation was the first chapter in the story of a dferent centreground: New Labour. The brand may be tainted, but the hope must be that something similar could happen in Scotland. Political extremes burn intensely, but they donrsquot burn for long.

Obviously its true that they wont remember Thatcher, but they might reasonably be expected to recall the Conservative governments of the last decade, when civil servants were pressurised into sanctioning as many benefit claimants as possible, when disabled people were subjected to a hostile review process that found dying men and women fit to work and hounded many people to their graves and when members of the Windrush generation were subjected to Theresa Mays hostile environment. The list could go on, but to be attracted to the Conservatives youd have to be comfortable with all this and more.Where does it come from, this notion that the Conservatives being the nasty party was something that happened in the s and that todays Conservatives are a cosy, empathetic bunch  I remember the Thatcher government very well and didnt like it, but in my opinionyou examine the actual record then David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson, for all their smiling faces, have been worse than Thatcher ever was.David Clinton Jr, Hamilton.EMOTIONAL REBELSTHERE is no doubt about it, The Herald is a wonderful paper.

I am old enough, sadly, to have been alive when the betrothal of the Prince was announced and the general public reaction was ldquoPrince whohellip. Far from giving up a \"glittering naval career\" to walk three steps behind Princess Elizabeth, Philip grabbed the opportunity to be catapulted from total anonymity into the centre of the wealthiest, most influential royal European family of the time and siring generations of kings. From being a stateless, penniless, rootless minor royal he then enjoyed a letime of unadulterated opulence, luxury and deference.True he had a chaotic, dysal, at times loveless, childhood with a mother who had serious mental health issues and a distant playboy father who didnrsquot let his lack of money affect his lavish lestyle in the South of France with his mistress. Good training, I would have thought, for joining the British royal family.The only fly in the ointment for Philip was his fury at being denied passing on his surname to his children.

While they might argue the two are not connected, letrsquos call it what it is.

I had been tipped off that an unscheduled and very encouraging announcement from the First Minister on the easing of Scottish lockdown restrictions was imminent.The tip-off was that, due to the continued success of the vaccine roll-out and the signicant reduction in the prevalence of coronavirus, and, letrsquos not kid ourselves on here, the joyful scenes of mobbed English beer gardens which had turned many a Scot putrid green with envy ndash and possibly also the fact that one million postal ballot papers will be dropping through letter boxes ndash the lting of Covid travel restrictions would now be accelerated. It would be brought forward by  days and the easing, a major policy reversal, would also include the licence trade, live music and the night-time economy.Unethical, impractical, and unnecessary: we donrsquot need passports for clubsI shouldnrsquot have bothered! It was again all too good to be true. As has become the depressing norm throughout this pandemic, once the Big Brother ldquonewspeak of the First Ministers briefing had been fully digested, it became very clear that there was to be no light at the end of this business-destroying tunnel, certainly not this side of the summer or possibly even autumn.I had perked up when the First Minister said that she knows \"many people that want to see venues, like, nightclubs, open again\" and that she was more optimistic and hopeful that all of that would be possible over the summer period. I wanted to believe this was true, share her optimism, but the cold and brutal reality was that this hollow announcement had changed nothing. There would be no ldquoFreedom Friday\" for any of these struggling sectors today, tomorrow, or for months to come,at all.And, with my hopes again cynically and cruelly crushed by a government to which I had once given my full support, believing in my naivety that they actually cared about Scotlandrsquos live music and night time economies, I trundled home feeling as let down and deflated as my worn tyres.I wasnrsquot alone. A spokesman for the NTIA, which represents nightclubs and entertainment venues, was equally disappointed at the vague talk of loosening restrictions sometime in the future and said, ldquountil there is a complete end to all legal restrictions on capacity, activity and operating hours, our sector simply cannot trade viably.They say the devil is in the detail. Well, I wish that were true, because there really has been no detail given, only the contentious and iniquitous reality that for non-scientic reasons known only to Scotlandrsquos all-powerful Covid eliminator Professor Jason Leitch , this multi-billion pound sector, a colossal contributor to Scotlandrsquos GDP and a major employer, as well as a pivotal component of our world-renowned live music industry, has not been deemed important enough to be granted the lowly status of Level  in the governmentrsquos strategic reopening framework.That is a shocking state of affairs and the FM and Scottish Government, and their hectoring gaggle of dictatorial mask-wearing and social-distancing health experts should all hang their heads in collective shame.

When it become clear he hadnrsquot, we all relaxed and enjoyed the sideshow.Then, after a bit more thought, she added: ldquoOn the whole Irsquod say Alba has removed some of the more embarrassing trouble-makers in a way that is not unpleasing.Some SNP activists have been transfixed by Alba, like motorists rubbernecking a car crash. But a few more cynical souls are starting to see more than a spectacle, they scent an opportunity for the national movement to finally jettison its more chauvinistic and counter-productive fringe.How Burdiehouse has been revealed as ground zero for a rediscovery of Scots lsquoexonymsrsquoIt is still not really clear what kind of party Mr Salmond is building: he has attracted several dferent clans of contrarians of social conservatives of leftists, of nationalists who are more flaggy than civic and, bluntly, of online conspiracists. Itrsquos quite the eclectic mix.It would be unfair to portray Alba purely as a problematically nationalistic project. Its membership is ied ndash as are the reasons why they have become disillusioned by the SNP. But there are signs some of its candidates and supporters feel, well, disinhibited.One campaign video this week starred the actor, Angus MacFadyen, who played Robert the Bruce in the s patriotic shlock gorefest Braveheart. Narrating pictures of saltire-waving protestors, he talked of ldquobreaking the spine of English superiorityrsquorsquo. Sturgeon backers winced, but almost gleefully. Itrsquos like the party has had a political enema and feels the better for it.But how,at all, will the SNP change without those members ndash and handful of politicians ndash who quit for Alba Not by much, insist those loyal to leader Nicola Sturgeon. Why  Because Mr Salmondrsquos backers had already been routed after trying to stage an insurrection inside the party. They left, in short, because they had lost.Even before the SNP civil war, Salmond supporters were already marginal, according to this line of thinking. ldquoThere are no lsquowharsquos like usrsquo nationalists in the leadership and not many in the membership either, said one party figure, talking about national chauvinists.But such nationalists, eventhey are a minority, do exist. And they can certainly make themselves visible. Some of them have proved incredibly off-putting to wavering indy-curious voters, especially on social media.Could Alba help detox the SNP of such ldquocybernats  Has Mr Salmond, like a pied piper, played a tune to march all of them away from the political front line James Mitchell is not sure. The professor of public policy at Edinburgh University has spent much of his career studying the anatomy of Scottish nationalism.ldquoDetoxication is just rhetoric politicians use when people previously seen as valued members leave, he said. ldquoThere may have been some desire to see some of Albarsquos people go but most of them were previously more than welcome.Mr Mitchell also stressed how hard it is to pigeonhole the kind of people who have defected to Alba and those who have stayed behind.Blair McDougall echoes this. A Labour strategist who led the pro-UK Better Together campaign ahead of the  independence referendum, he smells hypocrisy. ldquoThe same people who told us a few days ago that the aggressive, abusive ethnic nationalist minority didnrsquot exist in their party are now telling us that fringe has left, he said. ldquoSome have, some havenrsquot.Inside the SNP there is another answer to whether their movement, their party can detox: it depends on how well Mr Salmondrsquos party does.Alba, for them, could be the bin lorry that takes the SNPrsquos trash to the tip, to be forgotten forever. Or it could deliver the old rubbish right in to the chamber of the Scottish Parliament.Would that put a smell on the entire independence project  Maybe. Mainstream nationalist sources hope Ms Sturgeon could wave her hand under her nose and point towards Mr Salmond. It is not her stench, after all.Her former mentor was once also a part of the great sht of the SNP away from being unelectable eccentrics to what appears, for the time being at least, to be the natural party of devolved government. But that was before Mr Salmond lost the  indyref, lashed out at the media and wound up fronting a chat show on Vladimir Putinrsquos premier western mouthpiece, RT.It does not look like Ms Sturgeonrsquos opponents will let her forget Mr Salmondhe was lurking on the back benches. But would the SNP have to look and sound more impatient about independence to shore up its more nationalist flank Mr McDougall senses that Ms Sturgeon is already being dragged away from the constitutional centre ground to try and protect her more nationalist flank.ldquoThe cautiousness on timing of attempting another vote has been replaced by an urgency that isnrsquot shared by the swing voters who are much more lsquonot never, but certainly not nowrsquo, he said.SNP sources, on the contrary, expect their leader to be pragmatic and to put as much clear, saltire-blue sea between her and Mr Salmond as possible.Right now it is hard to know how Alba will perform next month. Most pollsters suggest the start-up is dead-on-arrival, not least because of the personal approval ratings of its leader.However, two surveys, by the same firm, give Alba just enough votes to deliver some MSPs and, potentially, cost the SNP its overall majority.Leading Scots fishing skipper facing fines of pound, for illegal dredgingDefeat means less exposure, especially on TV.

Last weekrsquos polling had them at anything from seven to nine points behind the Conservative government, which by any measure is unimpressive against a mid-term government which has already locked the Labour Party out of power for  years.In normal times, with numbers like these, some might question whether Sir Keir is up to the job. Indeed, some are. But these are not normal times. Polling has proven to be exceptionally fluid. It was not altogether long ago that Sir Keir entered his sixth month of beating Prime Minister Boris Johnson in head-to-head polling .From Labourrsquos perspective, Sir Keir is in the eye of the vaccine storm. For every journalist, commentator, citizen lamenting the UK governmentrsquos handling of the Covid pandemic in its early stages, there is now one lavishing praise on its world-leading vaccine rollout.Boris bet the house on the vaccine, and won.It is an inevitability of human behaviour that the public will be, to a degree, beholden to the leader who oversees a route out of the most calamitous event of their lives all the more so when they see near neighbours across the English Channel moving in the opposite direction.For Sir Keir, however, all is far from lost. Were there an idiom for Labour, it would be ldquowhere there is time, there is hope. And there is time.Sir Keirrsquos ultimate electoral test may not come for three-and-a-half years, during which much can change. By then, we assume, the acute pandemic will be over and Covid, as Professor Chris Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer, has indicated, will be treated much like the annual influenza.Furthermore, we will be locked into what will inevitably be a hugely painful recovery. Unemployment will be higher. Taxes too, probably. Interest rates, perhaps. In other words, our Potemkin economy will have lost its facade.And there is little doubt, at least in my mind, that Sir Keir is the right person to take advantage of that political and economic environment when it emerges. His move to Downing Street is far from locked-in writing off Mr Johnson is a foolrsquos errand, and he is at least as deserving of the Comeback Kid moniker as its more famous owner, President Bill Clinton.However, it seems to me that those in the Labour Party who doubt it made the right choice seem to believe they live in a country inhabited by a mythical population of committed socialists. They donrsquot.It is unclear what more empirical evidence is required to make them understand this. Tony Blair won three elections for the first time in the partyrsquos history, because of centrist politics and economics, before the party gradually deteriorated over the following  years as it steadily moved further and further to the left. A centrist resurgence in the form of Sir Keir immediately flipped the polls. Some things in politics are simple. This is one of them.In Labour land, Sir Keirrsquos job is not the only one occupied by the right person. Enter Anas Sarwar, the star-so-far of the Holyrood election campaign, having clearly won the first leadersrsquo debate, and emerged from the second with at least a score draw.Much like Sir Keir, Mr Sarwar is a man with time on his hands. The worst possible thing he could have done, having replaced his predecessor so soon before an election, would have been to over-promise before inevitably under-delivering.He has assiduously avoided taking that well-trodden path, so much so that he appears to have already started telling his - story, ready for a tilt at Bute House in five years time.That is by no means a fancul prospect. For the Labour Party sits on electoral gold, which can be cashed inand when the second independence referendum is called, and can accumulate value after it is over.We are currently locked in constitutional polarisation, with the two poles occupied by the SNP and the Tories. This will change, particularlythe SNP wins a majority next month. The denial of a democratic request, for a second referendum, will see the Tories become as isolated as they were in the s Labour will surely avoid falling into that hole alongside them, and will endorse a referendum.At that point, Mr Sarwar will be in a position to grasp the leadership of the pro-UK lobby, with he and Sir Keir advocating the sort of enhanced devolutionary agenda which historic polling has always shown to be the likeliest vote winner.A third way on the constitutional question, sensible economic policy, a partnership with an equally sensible Labour leader in London. In a post-referendum environment, those are enviable attributes, and could see Mr Sarwar with a realistic prospect of being First Minister in , by which time the SNP will have been in power for almost two decades.And whilst Scottish Labour has a distance to travel in terms of voting intention, it has much less far to go in terms of voter trust. This monthrsquos Ipsos MORI polling for STV showed Labour, again, recording very solid figures on whether the people trust them to run public services and the economy, and to stand up for Scotlandrsquos interests. They remain well behind the SNP, as we might expect, but on each of these measures they are ahead of the Tories, despite trailing them in voting intention.In other words, people are ready to, and want to, vote Labour again, when they see sensible, relatable leadership , and when they see a credible position on the constitution .Not so long ago, many commentators, me included, wondered out loud whether Labour was dead, north and south of the border. We were wrong. They are not. The rose is still wilted, but this is Labourrsquos spring.Be patient, I say.

However, there have to be rules, strict rules, so those who govern us are not unduly influenced by malign forces.Companies, of course, like the kudos of having an ex-senior minister on their books.They believe it impresses others and, when the time comes, may give up some useful inside intelligence or, as in the case of Mr Cameron ndash who insists he has not broken any rules on lobbying ndash a handy hotline to Downing Street.One of the many surprising aspects about what has now been branded a scandal is that the former PM, a multi-millionaire before, during and after leaving office, felt the need to work for Lex Greensill at all.But, clearly, the prospect of trousering an extra poundm in share options working for a former No  aide in his finance company was too good an opportunity to miss.Back-scratching, it seems, has become a lucrative art form.The problem with ministers becoming lobbyists is, post their time in government, a suspicion always lingers that during their final months in Whitehall their focus was not on the public job in hand but on the private one to come.It would be shameful enoughthis sorry saga was just about an ex-premier trying to line his pockets but the collapse of Greensill Capital could well lead to thousands of people losing their jobs in the steel industry.Founded by the Australian financier, the company specialised in supply-chain finance, settling business bills immediately for a fee and so helping eliminate the problem of late payments.Indeed, in  Greensill won a poundm contract from the Cabinet Office that gave pharmacies the option of being paid early for NHS prescriptions.Astonishingly, it has now emerged that Bill Crothers, a former top official responsible for overseeing billions of pounds in the UK Governmentrsquos commercial contracts, was employed by Mr Greensill part-time while still working in Whitehall.He formally left in  and subsequently became a director of Greensill, where he is said to have held a stake worth poundm.Now, Simon Case, the Cabinet Secretary, has issued an urgent demand that any moonlighting civil servant should come forward. This, incredibly, suggests the head of the civil service has no idea what might be going on in the workforce he runs.Politically, Lobbygate has come just at the right time for the UK Governmentrsquos political opponents as people consider who to vote for in a raft of elections in Scotland, England and Wales.Keir Starmer clearly relished announcing to the nation that our old friend Tory sleaze was back and during PMQs sought to connect the dots to a web of Conservative cronyism.The Labour leader even managed a witty reference to the BBCrsquos popular crime drama Line Of Duty, telling Boris Johnson: ldquoThe more I listen to the Prime Minister, the more I think Ted Hastings and AC- is needed to get to the bottom of this one.Labourrsquos attempt to get a fully independent inquiry to take a comprehensive look at lobbying was always set to fall foul of the Commons arithmetic. Yet House committees are now falling over themselves to probe the subject, which must be causing nerves to jangle in Tory circles at Westminster and beyond.Whatever the Government-appointed lawyer Nigel Boardman recommends in June must command public confidence and support. The current system clearly has too many holes and needs a substantial overhaul otherwise we will be back here yet again in a few yearsrsquo time.Voters must feel they can trust not only those who govern them but also the systems of government.The wily ex-minister Lord Pickles, who chairs the toothless Advisory Committee on Business Appointments which advises ex-ministers and civil servants on outside employment, told MPs yesterday, with a deal of understatement, there were ldquoanomalies in the system that required ldquoimmediate address and that the Crothersrsquo case showed there did ldquonot seem to have been any boundaries at all.Conspicuous by his silence in this whole affair is Mr Greensill.

But Irsquom also really excited for everyone to see what everyone worked so hard on to make.MORAL COMPASSWestworld actor Barnes,  ndash who is also known for The Chronicles of Narnia film series, and Marvelrsquos The Punisher ndash acknowledges he has become known for a certain type of role.ldquoI found this sort of strange niche for myself, which was vaguely morally ambiguous manipulative characters who are revered by some and feared by some ndash but still somehow find themselves entangled with the young heroines.But General Kirigan ndash whorsquos known as the Darkling to his enemies ndash felt dferent from the coming-of-age characters hersquos played in the past.ldquoHe [General Kirigan] is at the top of the hierarchy, in terms of status in this world, someone whorsquos powerful, who, when he walks into a room, everyone immediately falls silent and sort of hangs on what hersquos got to say. And I think that that was just a new angle to approach.The general is the head of the Second Army mdash the kingdomrsquos magical military elite of Grisha soldiers ndash and is determined to see his nation freed from the Shadow Fold, no matter the cost.Hersquos also a Shadow Summoner, which means he has the ability to gather and manipulate darkness.Interestingly, Bardugo had mentioned Barnes in connection to the character in a tweet nearly a decade ago ndash and hersquos certainly mastered the complexity of the villain.ldquoIt was important for me to find the sort of the gracefulness with which hersquos described through Alinarsquos eyes in the books, but also with some of that Machiavellian kind of threat to him, he elaborates of his portrayal.ldquoBecause the books are first-person, I think that it was important to really pull out the humanity in characters like The Darkling, and see what their vulnerable side is.ldquoIf hersquos powerful, why is he vulnerable  If hersquos stubborn, where is he open  I think finding those balances, in all the characters, was what was exciting about it for me.PERSONAL MATTERSWhen adapting the books, a decision was made by Bardugo, plus showrunner, creator, and writer Eric Heisserer, to make Alina half Shu Han ndash the Asia-inspired land that Ravkais currently at war with.Reflecting on the prejudice Alina experiences across the episodes, Mei Li says she was able to bring her own le experience to her portrayal.ldquoI grew up in a predominantly white area, in a white school where I was very much lsquothe Chinese onersquo, and I would speak poorly pronounced Cantonese to my friends but then be with my Chinese family and not really be able to speak to my grandma.ldquoAnd so you never really feel like you belong anywhere. And itrsquos really weird because itrsquos never really seen as a big deal itrsquos not something that people talk about, being constantly othered. So it adds so much to Alinarsquos character.ldquoShe is really strong, because shersquos had to stand up for herself and shersquos had to grow this thick skin, but she also is very gentle, and I think that comes from the fact thatshersquos being told every day you look like the enemy, shersquos saying lsquoNo, Irsquom not. Irsquom gentlersquo.The star adds she likes the way Alinarsquos mixed heritage has ldquoreally shaped her personality but that ldquoitrsquos not her story.ldquoShersquos a mixed-race character, but thatrsquos not all she is. Shersquos also the Sun Summoner, [she has the ability to bend and summon light], the Sun Queen ndash and shersquos just a girl trying to work out where she belongs in the world. So I really like that and it felt very authentic to my le.

The most striking feature is the patch of white at their rump. Males are slightly smaller and pale grey with black wingtips. Both have a round, owl-like face.Hen harriers are the UK#s most persecuted bird of prey relative to its population size. Their Scottish population is of global importance, yet it remains far from stable largely as a result of illegal killing by humans.The RSPB’s Jenni Burrell said: “We are calling on the public to email our Hen Harrier Hotlinethey believe they’ve seen a hen harrier. This helps us build a picture of where these birds are. Please don’t hesitate to contact usyou see them # we welcome any sightings and appreciate your time.“Hen harriers are beautul and elusive raptors and, unlike peregrines and kestrels, they are rarely seen in urban environments. Soit’s perched on your fence, it’s probably a sparrowhawk,it’s in a tree by the roadside, it’s probably a kestrel or a buzzard… butit’s over rough pasture or moorland, and matches the description above, then you might have seen a hen harrier.“Sadly hen harriers are a long way from reaching a healthy, self-sustaining population, and this is largely down to persecution by humans. Particularly where land is managed for the purpose of driven grouse shooting, natural predators like hen harriers can be viewed as pests and, despite being legally protected, the shooting, trapping and poisoning of hen harriers is a serious and ongoing problem.”If you think you’ve seen a hen harrier, you are asked to email henharriers@rspb.org.uk and to include the date, time, location grid reference and a description of the bird.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He locked the door and deprived her of access to a key.Donald pinned her against a wall and grabbed her throat. On a number of occasions he repeatedly punched her head and body, all to her injury.Exerting control over her, he destroyed her mobile phone and her passport, repeatedly calling her abusive and degrading names, threatening her with violence. He forced entry into a locked bathroom where she was hiding, and repeatedly monitored and controlled her communications with family and friends.In  Donald became abusive to another partner.As well as regulating the communication she had with others, he also controlled the amount of money she had access to.He was abusive to her, calling her degrading names, and ly accused her of infidelity.Then, in September of that year, he repeatedly struck her body with a kne, causing injury.

Yetwe continue using coal, oil and gas at the current rate, estimates show that reserves will be gone in around  years. But this is the least of our worries. If we want to slow rising global temperatures we need to stop burning these fuels their combustion, and subsequent release of greenhouse gases, is the main driver behind global warming.In , the Scottish Government pledged to end the use of all fossil fuels by  in order to reach their zero net emissions target. And in their place  Renewables.The traditional options such as wind farms and hydro schemes have now been joined by green hydrogen. Although still in its infancy, this renewable gas is expected to be a leading source of future energy production. Naturally occurring hydrogen is obtained by passing electricity through waterthis electricity is renewably sourced the gas is labelled as ‘green’ hydrogen, as opposed to ‘grey’. Once extracted it can be used in existing gas pipelines to heat and power homes, fuel vehicles and drive heavy machinery.And unlike traditional gas, when burned it produces no harmful emissions, only water.Keith Masson, climate change and energy team manager at Highland Council, said: “We’re in the process of recruiting a project manager to lead on the delivery of new hydrogen and low carbon heat strategies, to ensure that the council and the wider Highland region benefits from the energy-systems transformation that these technologies will bring.”In Highland region, plans are underway for a ‘hydrogen hub’ in the Cromarty Firth. Electricity generated from wind turbines in the area will be used to produce hydrogen gas for use in local industries.But progress towards the net zero emissions target is also happening even closer to home. In the last few months plans have been confirmed for two community hydro developments in Skye and Lochalsh.Construction of a community owned kW micro hydro development in Sleat is due to begin this month. Electricity produced will be sold to the national grid with over £, expected to be generated in the first  years. All money generated will be used to fund sustainable projects in the local community.Kenny Nicolson, project officer for Sleat Community Hydro, said: “Despite the Gàidhealtachd being a huge exporter of renewable energy, we pay the highest prices for electricity with some of the worst rates of fuel poverty in the UK. On Skye we have issues with inequality, young people unable to find secure employment and housing, and a dying language and culture.“Community-owned renewable energy projects are not just a means for reducing carbon emissions, there is a massive potential to create community wealth and address some of these underlying issues.”We as iniduals can also take steps towards installing renewable energy sources. The process may seem complicated or costly but thanks to an initiative launched by the Scottish Government, homeowners can apply for  per cent cashback, up to £,, for a renewable heating system. Small and medium sized businesses are also eligible for a similar cashback grant scheme. And the options for renewable heating systems are vast, from biomassboilers to solar  and ground source heat pumps.Iain Stewart and Shelagh Parlane have a ground source heat pump which sits just below the surface in their garden in Edinbane, extracting warmth from the ground to heat their radiators, underfloor heating and water. Shelagh said: “I would absolutely recommend it. It is certainly a very efficient system. If you were trying to heat water in a standard way I think it would be much more expensive.”Renewable heating systems can also be a source of income with the UK government’s Renewable Heat Initiative scheme. If you install, or have installed in the last year, an eligible system you could receive quarterly cash payments over seven years.Of course, no energy source is completely harmless. Whether it is birds flying into wind turbines or the destruction of fish spawning grounds with a hydro scheme, everything has a cost. Butwe want to continue using electricity, fossil fuels are not the way forward.No birds or fish will be able to survive at allwe continue to exacerbate the greenhouse gas effect by burning coal, oil and gas.Green alternatives are no longer trials for the future of energy production, they are the future."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MV-Glenachulish2.jpg","title":"glenelg ferry back in service in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine• Bittersweetafter death of founding directorFerry company directors took the decision not to operate the service for the  season in the interests of public and crew safety during the Covid pandemic.The vessel, MV Glenachulish, which normally runs from Easter to mid-October, has been tied up at the Kishorn boat yard since the autumn of .This week, general manager Jo Crawford from Glenelg said the boat was undergoing final checks and it was hoped to resume the service on Saturday st May.“It was a big miss last year, for locals and visitors alike,” said Ms Crawford.“We have put in additional measures to comply with Covid regulations including sanitising stations at both slipways and all the crew have been issued with PPE.“We have secured some grant assistance for opening up again and the ferry’s  employees will be taken out of furlough.

To date almost £, has been raised for the Glenachulish Preservation Trust with donations pouring in from all over.Ms Crawford added: “We’re really grateful to them for that support. It’s wonderful. The Glenachulish is the last manually operated turntable ferry in Scotland and at  years old is always needing work done on it.”The ferry will run seven days a week, am to pm, and to pm in June, July and August."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/thumbnail_IMG_0001.jpg","title":"scottish radios voice of sport with his roots in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineAlastair Alexander of BBC Scotland was one of the names and iconic voices which dominated the Scottish airwaves for a signicant generation. What is not as well-known about Alastair though, is that he had strong family connections with Skye, which he never forgot.Alastair MacPherson Alexander, to give him his full name, was born on th November , in Parklea, Port Glasgow. He died on Sunday th March, aged .Alastair was intensely proud of his home area of the Port and wider Inverclyde but was also acutely aware of his roots in Skye. He is one of a long list of people in that area who could trace his lineage to the island and the remarkable tale of serendipity and genealogy which eventually saw him commentate on Skye Camanachd’s greatest day in  bears further examination.Alastair’s maternal grandmother Jessie MacPherson was born in Skye in . His mother, Marion Smith, was born in Skye and lived at Tarskavaig in Sleat where her father was a shepherd. Following a well-trodden path, they moved to Kilmacolm in Renfrewshire for work.And it was farming and work on the land which brought Alastair’s parents together. Walter Alexander’s family had Bogston Farm in Greenock and eventually Marion and Walter met and married. Walter was to live with sight and hearing loss and they were, understandably, huge influences –clearly demonstrated in Alastair’s subsequent voluntary work with the Rex Blind Parties, while he developed a remarkable affection for shinty through his connection with Skye.Incidentally, Marion’s father moved to Renton, won the football pools, bought the show house in Dumbuck Crescent, Dumbarton and called it Tarskavaig. It was there that Alastair’s grandmother Jessie died in  when he was seven years old. Her sister Annie MacPherson , whom Alastair Alexander visited in Skye, was known locally as ‘Annag Alasdair’ denoting her father’s identity, and was single all her le. She lived at No. Tarskavaig, and is well remembered by people in the area today.Alastair met his family circumstances head on with a resilience and fortitude, marking him out as a thoroughly decent human inidual, as well as a consummate professional in more than one area of le.He went to the Glasgow School of Art to train as an architect and pursued a career in the building industry, while maintaining his other interests – moving seamlessly in all his dferent spheres of activity.Forty years of Alastair’s le were spent commentating on more than , football matches and describing bowls, hockey at the Kelvin Hall, and athletics for BBC Scotland, as well as the shinty. He first started commentating for people with vision loss at Love Street, Paisley in .Six years later he asked the BBC for an audition and was on television the following week.It was a great privilege to share commentary duties with the great man in my own early days as a commentator, beginning in  in Oban on a blisteringly hot day. I learned a great deal from him over the next few years and he was fantastic to work with.Technology, or more accurately a digger, failed us together one famous day in  when Fort William scored a goal in less than ten seconds and went on to win the Camanachd Cup -. Few in Fort William were aware of the outcome until much later in the day —there were no mobile phones — as a digger had uprooted the cable which connected Old Anniesland to the BBC studios at Queen Margaret Drive. Alastair and I blethered away for the whole match not knowing that only a few minutes had been broadcast and Tiger Tim had filled the rest of the afternoon with records.One of Alastair’s cousins, Ann McCarron, recalled: “My brother and Alastair spent a lot of their youth together on the Skye holidays and at Gran and Grandpa Smith’s in Dumbuck Crescent. Apparently my brother Alistair had a Subbuteo football game and when they played he [Alastair] used to do the commentating, so he must have had the commentating in his blood!”Such was the family’s affection for Skye that Ann’s brother Alistair’s ashes were scattered on Skye following his death a few years ago.Tributes have been fulsome and sincere. The plaudits and anecdotes could fill Hampden. Alastair was a “gentleman and a true professional” according to Ken MacQuarrie who made the formal presentation to him on behalf of the BBC in .It was singularly appropriate that he commentated on Skye’s greatest triumph in . In that famous final Alastair described Skye’s Calum Murchison on the radio as “leaping around like a salmon”. That of course meant an awful lot more to anyone knowing the shape and size of Calum and also his family’srelationship with the local salmon fishing river in Bernisdale.Alastair was a great man and is a huge loss to our collective knowledge of our history, sport and broadcasting. Meticulous in his presentation and fastidious when it came to detail, he was a total professional. The BBC bid him farewell with the traditional microphone presentation in October  when he retired.We shall not see his like again and we know that Alastair will of course be most sorely missed by his daughters Shirley, Susan and Joyce, her husband Mark, granddaughter Alex and grandson Callum."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/POT-HOLES-KYLE-1-scaled.jpg","title":"kyle womans petition targets","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineIona MacLachlan says people are being forced to drive in the opposite carriageway in Kyle’s Main Street to avoid huge potholes and believes a bad accident is waiting to happen.Ms MacLachlan, of Heathmount, is asking people to sign her petition on the change.org online petitions , urging Highland Council to improve the roads in the busy village.The health and social care frontline worker said: “I’ve raised this petition because of an experience I had at the weekend as an L-driver.“I was driving down to the village and I was confronted with this car in the middle of the road. I nearly hit it. I understand why the car was there – the driver was trying to avoid the massive potholes all along the street. I was able to avoid the vehicle but it gave me a scare and this situation could easily result in a bad accident.”Ms MacLachlan has reported the potholes in the road to Highland Council on multiple occasions.She said: “All you get is for the potholes to be filled with gravel and with the bad weather we’ve had over the past few months that lasts only two or three days and then they’re as bad as ever. The road needs to be properly repaired.“I’ve had to replace coil springs and tyres on my car because of the state of the roads in Kyle and I’m fed up with it. I hope as many people as possible will sign the petition to send a strong message to the council.”Ms MacLachlan’s petition is on the change.org site and calls for “All B roads in Kyle of Lochalsh to be repaired”.Local Highland councillor Biz Campbell said she was aware of the petition and agreed the road was in a poor state.“I don’t blame people,” said Councillor Campbell. “The roads are horrendous. We fight for funds for roads all the time and make the case when the budget comes up, but council doesn’t have the money.”However, she said councillors in Ward  — Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh — had been allocated an extra £, for local projects and members had discussed buying a “hot box” tar machine.She explained: “Currently the potholes in this ward are filled with cold tar and it’s a complete waste of money because the tar is simply washed out and the repair doesn’t last.“This machine would allow hot tar repairs to be made to potholes and it would last longer. We have discussed it at a meeting and I think this could achieve better road repairs which would help road users at least in the short term.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3746987.jpg--.jpg?1618485362000\n","title":"martinstown post office temporary closure for modernisation work","story":"Martinstown Post Office will temporarily close for modernisation.

Worth poundm, the low emission diesel buses will be destined for the streets of Hong Kong and Japan. It marks a signicant move for the Ballymena-based business, owned by green entrepreneur Jo Bamford, which sees the orders as an opportunity to grow the profile of the Wrightbus brand as far afield as Australia. Chief Executive Buta Atwal said the news was proof that Wrightbus was leading the way in bus technology regardless of the fuel. “Whether it’s our world-first hydrogen bus, our near-zero emission diesel or our single-deck electric, the Wrightbus name stands for excellence in the bus world,” he explained. “Although we have endured a complicated year like so many manufacturers across the world, these orders will help us emerge from the pandemic with confidence.” Wrightbus, which launched the world’s first zero-emission hydrogen double decker bus in , recently announced the creation of  new jobs in preparation for increasing production of the vehicle this year to assist global net zero ambitions and support the PM’s pledge for at least , new Zero Emission Buses to be produced during this parliament.The recruitment drive will welcome new members of production and office staff, including coachbuilders, spray painters, welders, electrical engineers, technicians, accountants, sales staff and a project manager. Nineteen of the positions will be apprenticeships, giving a boost to opportunities for young people in the region. And an international project engineer role has also been created as the firm looks to increase sales around the world.Nathan Hodge, who heads the Wrightbus international ision, said there was growing global optimism. “While it hasn’t got to the tender stage yet, we are having some really good discussions in Australia about hydrogen buses,” he said. “While Australia is seen by many to be among the leaders of hydrogen technology, there is only one hydrogen bus in the country so there’s a huge amount of potential. “Countries like Malaysia, which exports oil, will always find the cost of hydrogen or electric buses prohibitive, yet that’s where our near-zero diesel comes in.” Mr Hodge explained that the ASEAN free-trade agreement signed last year would ensure tarf-free movement of goods from the Wrightbus factory in Malaysia. “Naturally having a factory in the Far East enables us to be part of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnershipwhich provides tarf-free trade to the Southeast Asian Nations as well as Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1618581284924.jpg--covid_19___fri_16th_apr_figures.jpg?1618581284000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20210416newscovid 19 fri 16th apr figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows One further coronavirus related death and  new positive test results.

Thankfully, retail, close contact services, hospitality, leisure and tourism businesses now have clear reopening dates that are signicantly better than those mooted in the media yesterday morning. They can now plan and prepare for trading again in just a few weeks# time.We welcome the Executive#s decision and the fact that Ministers have listened to and responded positively to the concerns expressed by businesses and the genuine fears they had about their futures and the jobs of their staff. We now look forward to working with departments and the council to deliver a safe reopening of our city#s economy.Simon Hamilton is chief executive of Belfast ChamberNo, says Conor BrowneI do not have a problem with outdoor activities being increased in Northern Ireland. There is no issue with outdoor table service in bars or restaurants, as long as social distancing is maintained.However, the Executive announced an indicative date for eating and drinking indoors on May .We have known for a long time in the biosecurity community that the single most dangerous place and activity that you can engage in, is groups of people inside and not wearing masks. That indicative date is a little bit too close. Whenever you release restrictions from a lockdown, you should do it in a slow manner.If you make a big change like opening close contact services and outdoor hospitality, what you want to do is wait and see what that does to the number of people who get infected with the virus and also to the number of hospital admissions.I want the economy back but my concern is thatwe move too quickly on everything, then we run the risk of infection rates spiking again and we end up going back into another lockdown of some description.I do not want to go back into another lockdown and neither does the business community but, for me, the big issue is hospitality indoors. I would like to see a little bit more time passing before we start thinking about getting people indoors.We are doing exceptionally well with our vaccination programme but the problem is there are some iants of the virus - in particular the South African iant.The vast majority of people going out will be young people, who will be unvaccinated, and could potentially lead to a spread of the South African iant in Northern Ireland.Conor Browne is a biosecurity consultant specialising in Covid- business continuity, forecasting, and analysisBelfast Most ReadNoah Donohoe inquest: PSNI may not have probed Dr Jordan Peterson line of inquiry to its #satisfaction#, coroner toldWatch: Video tour of £.m Dromore property that’s sparked online frenzyMichelle O#Neill#s Facebook page no longer run from SerbiaStormont considers Covid vaccine passport trial as DUP man hits out at cautious reopening approachLoyalists parades planned in widespread acts of defianceTop VideosPlayCanadian MP caught naked on camera reprimanded in ParliamentPlayPrince Philip’s personalised Land Rover hearse is unveiledPlay#Landmark day# for Northern Ireland as coronavirus restrictions easedLatest CoronavirusQuarantine #packages# for those arriving into Northern Ireland from #red list# countries now liveLisa SmythOpinionOfficial line on #vaccine passports# remains vague... but they will help get lives back on trackCoronavirus Northern Ireland: One further death and  new cases reportedMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageBelfast restaurateur Michael Deane: #Don#t make hospitality pay for supermarket free for all#Latest from Belfast Elliot Page describes US transgender bills as ‘upsetting, cruel and exhausting’Pupils at Duke of Edinburgh’s boarding school to lead tributes in ScotlandTwitter confirms outage and says users will ‘be back on timeline soon’Karlie Kloss reveals son’s name one month after giving birthHayley Hasselhoff ‘overwhelmed’ by response to her Playboy cover,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Loyalist paramilitary sources say while they are not responsible for orchestrating the protests they will also not do anything to stop them.

Despite the Loyalist Communities Council releasing a statement calling for calm on Friday, there are still those within the organisation who refused to condemn the violence, leading to a dispute among senior members of the umbrella group.The LCC, which represents the UVF, factions of the UDA, and Red Hand Commando, said none of their associated groups have been involved, either directly or indirectly, in the violence.However, the Belfastunderstands that members of the paramilitary organisations and affiliated bands will be participating in the protests.SDLP MLA and Policing Board member Dolores Kelly condemned the plans as reckless.We are still in a Covid pandemic, I have sisters who work in nursing and I don#t know that NHS staff could go through a third wave, bringing crowds onto the street at this time is totally reckless.This brings flashbacks to the worst days of the Drumcree protests, that spiralled into violence, including - some people forget - the murder of a policeman, Frankie O#Reilly.Mr O#Reilly, an RUC constable, was injured by a blast bomb thrown during clashes with loyalists in Portadown in , He died from his injuries after spending four weeks on a le support.Mrs Kelly added: There really is a real need for leadership within unionist parties, not upping the ante about the Protocol, or talk of two tier policing or myths around deprivation, whenever there is very little dference for those living on the Falls or the Shankill in terms of deprivation.Belfast Most ReadNoah Donohoe inquest: PSNI may not have probed Dr Jordan Peterson line of inquiry to its #satisfaction#, coroner toldWatch: Video tour of £.m Dromore property that’s sparked online frenzyMichelle O#Neill#s Facebook page no longer run from SerbiaStormont considers Covid vaccine passport trial as DUP man hits out at cautious reopening approachLoyalists parades planned in widespread acts of defianceTop VideosPlayCanadian MP caught naked on camera reprimanded in ParliamentPlayPrince Philip’s personalised Land Rover hearse is unveiledPlay#Landmark day# for Northern Ireland as coronavirus restrictions easedLatest Northern IrelandFears Indian Covid iant could ‘scupper’ road map as UK cases dwindleDuke of Edinburgh#s #unwavering loyalty# to the Queen and #courage, fortitude and faith# to be hailed at funeralMandatory hotel quarantine introduced in Northern IrelandQuarantine #packages# for those arriving into Northern Ireland from #red list# countries now liveFans praise Line of Duty star Adrian Dunbar for Have I Got News For You performanceLatest from Belfast Pupils at Duke of Edinburgh’s boarding school to lead tributes in ScotlandTwitter confirms outage and says users will ‘be back on timeline soon’Karlie Kloss reveals son’s name one month after giving birthHayley Hasselhoff ‘overwhelmed’ by response to her Playboy coverWhat the papers say – April ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Loftus Hall has established itself as a popular attraction, with tours operating throughout the year.It is being sold by Keane Auctioneers, whose ghostwriter describes it as possessing some of the most beautul architectural design that can be found in any property of its kind and absolutely oozing with potential for possibly a boutique spa, country guest house or many other commercial applications.Its other claim to fame is the ornate staircase in the main hall which was just one of three with the same design in the world. The other was the grand staircase on the Titanic while there#s a similar one at the Vatican.This could be the retreat of dreams, for the house offers unrivalled views all over the Hook Peninsula, St George#s Channel and Dunmore East, the auctioneers said. It is situated on  acres overlooking the sea in what the auctioneer describes as a one-off, unique setting.It is steeped in history, originally built by The Norman Knight Raymond Les Grosand portrays some of the most beautul architectural design that can be found in any property of its kind.From the magnicent entrance driveway, which leads to the front door, its truly captivating gardens, stone buildings, excellent car-parking, private beach and top quality multi-purpose lands - the house sits on overlooking all of these and takes in unrivalled views.Described as having the potential to make one of the most stately homes in the country, it has  bedrooms on three floors,  bathrooms, reception andareas, although it is in need of some extensive refurbishment.Irish IndependentMost ReadNoah Donohoe inquest: PSNI may not have probed Dr Jordan Peterson line of inquiry to its #satisfaction#, coroner toldWatch: Video tour of £.m Dromore property that’s sparked online frenzyMichelle O#Neill#s Facebook page no longer run from SerbiaStormont considers Covid vaccine passport trial as DUP man hits out at cautious reopening approachLoyalists parades planned in widespread acts of defianceTop VideosPlayCanadian MP caught naked on camera reprimanded in ParliamentPlayPrince Philip’s personalised Land Rover hearse is unveiledPlay#Landmark day# for Northern Ireland as coronavirus restrictions easedLatest Republic of Ireland‘Alarming’ KBC decision intensies need for banking forum to be establishedEU chiefs call on Irish Government to use ‘less restrictive’ quarantine measuresNolan sisters open up about double cancer battle Ministers accuse DUP of ‘obstructing’ north-south relationsMary Robinson joins around  ex-heads of state in call for ‘people’s vaccine’Latest from Belfast Elliot Page describes US transgender bills as ‘upsetting, cruel and exhausting’Pupils at Duke of Edinburgh’s boarding school to lead tributes in ScotlandTwitter confirms outage and says users will ‘be back on timeline soon’Karlie Kloss reveals son’s name one month after giving birthHayley Hasselhoff ‘overwhelmed’ by response to her Playboy cover,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

pipe band by Her Majesty in .Lis Kaerr, principal, said: “Throughout the whole of the last week we have had the opportunity to reflect on how proud we are in shaping what was important to the duke.“We can’t have large-scale gatherings at the moment, but to be able to have a smaller tribute to him which is still an appropriate scale is great.“For us to put together this tribute felt like the right thing to do in these circumstances – it represents his love of the Moray Firth, Hopeman Harbour and Gordonstoun.”Opportunities to hold official commemoration events across Scotland are limited due to coronavirus restrictions.Meanwhile, the th Regiment Royal Artillery will conduct ceremonial gunfire at Edinburgh Castle to begin and end the National Minute Silence immediately before the funeral service.It comes as part of nine locations that will be taking part in the event.The guns will fire at pm and then .pm.The Scottish Government has told the public not to go to Edinburgh or any other Royal location to pay their respects, due to the risk of spreading coronavirus.This is despite travel restrictions across the country being lted.There will be no opportunities for the public to lay flowers at any official location in Scotland.PAMost ReadNoah Donohoe inquest: PSNI may not have probed Dr Jordan Peterson line of inquiry to its #satisfaction#, coroner toldWatch: Video tour of £.m

Communications between Foyle MLA Sinead McLaughlin and the Health and Finance Ministers demonstrates that even those heading government departments have been confused about what Covid restrictions were in force and when. Localised restrictions were put in place in Derry and Strabane on October  following a surge in positive Covid cases. As part of those restrictions no indoor gatherings were permitted between people from dferent households. That specic restriction prevented barbers and hairdressers from working. In an Assembly response Health Minister Robin Swann acknowledged that fact saying close contact services were not permitted to open from October  because of the restriction on indoor gatherings. googletag.cmd.push But, he states, official regulations were only in effect between October  to November , November  to December  and those from December  are ongoing. The Localised Restrictions Support Schemeopened to businesses in Derry and Strabane council area on October , . However, SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin has questioned why some of her constituents have been left unable to access support for the period between October -. She also asked Finance Minister Conor Murphy why his department is ‘recovering’ money from Derry workers who had received support. Sinead McLaughlin said: It has been dficult for businesses in Derry to understand the restrictions which govern when they were allowed to trade, and when they werent. googletag.cmd.push “What we have now learnt as a result of my questions in the Assembly to the ministers is that it has also been dficult for the departments that issue the regulations to understand them. The result is that close contact businesses such as hairdressers and barbers in Derry and Strabane which believed they were unable to trade between the th and the th October now find they are not entitled to financial support for that period from the Localised Restrictions Support Scheme, operated by minister Conor Murphy and his Department of Finance. “Some of these businesses were initially given this financial support and are now having it recovered through reductions in ongoing support payments.”     She added: The minister for health initially told me that close contact businesses in Derry and Strabane were not able to trade between th and th October because of the lockdown restrictions, but that the regulations had not been in place that confirmed this. “Now a revised Assembly answer from the minister says they were able to trade between those dates. To explain six months later that close contact businesses in Derry and Strabane could, after all, have traded in early October is absolutely no good at all. “I am appalled that businesses here are now suffering additional hardship because of the lack of clarity and co-operation between the health and finance departments in the setting of Covid regulations. “It is up to Conor Murphy to resolve this and I am very unhappy that, to date, he has failed to do this. The Finance Minister stands over his department’s decision saying that Covid regulations imposed by the Department of Health on October  did not require hairdressers and other close contact services to close during the period to October .

Amongst easements announced this week, there were changes to the number of people allowed to play sport outdoors. From Monday, groups of up to  people, were permitted to train and play sports together. Speaking to the Derry News, Patrick Simpson of Bay Road Soccer said the past year has been ‘tough’ mentally as well as financially. Like many businesses, uncertainty hung over every decision as lockdowns were put in place and then lted again. The ‘next generation’ outdoor soccer centre on the Bay Road reopened over the summer to the delight of service users but was forced to close a few months later. googletag.cmd.push Mr Simpson hopes lockdowns have now been resigned to the past and that people can get back to some form of normality. People of all ages use the facility for recreation. Coaches make use of the all-weather G pitches to train young football teams such as the Oxford Bulls and it hosts soccer camps during the summer. Mr Simpson said: “Every time we’ve opened there has been a great appetite for people to get back outside and to play football again. “A lot of people are saying it’s like Christmas again for them, some people are there three or four days a week. That is their hour of exercise and the hobby they enjoy.” googletag.cmd.push He added: “I hope this is the last lockdown because it really is having a detrimental affect on people’s mind when they can’t get outdoors to take part in activities that really give them a lt. “It’s about children as much as adults. “People are delighted to be back now. There’s a big smile on their faces.” Regular user of the facility, Kevin McGowan , has missed playing badly. It’s rumoured that Bay Road has a special video archive containing the Derry man’s best finishes.  Kevin, who works as a Peer Support Volunteer at ARC Fitness, is an untiring advocate of the physical and mental health benefits of playing football.     He explained: “The Bay Road to me is like meditation. Its a place where you can forget about everything  going on for an hour where its just you, your mates, two nets and a ball. “It is a great way to get rid of stress and after one session Im already reacting to things in a calmer way. “Its great to be back at it and the usual slagging has already started with the football WhatsApp group. “I forgot how much I missed that. Everything just seems easier to handle when you can have that hour away at the glorious Bay.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There are smiles on the faces of the few people who are moving up and down the pavements. Approaching midday, the sun,not quite splitting the stones, is definitely causing them some discomfort. Traffic is almost constant. It comes through at a steady pace, the roar of passing lorries reverberating off Dungivens roadside shops and houses. A green and white ice cream van emblazoned with Super Mario rolls through the town. I can almost hear the theme tune in my head. googletag.cmd.push Dungiven Main Street curving down the hill. As I make my way up the hill, there is construction work going on in a few of the estates off Main Street. One man carefully removes paving stones in front of a set of flats. Further on, McReynolds Bar sits in forlorn darkness, mourning the loss of another sunny day in the beer garden. The towns other Covid-abandoned pubs would no doubt concur. The ornate gates of Gaelcholaacuteiste Dhoire are closed for Easter, but the sun illuminates the castle like a scene from a postcard. Across the street, the Kevin Lynch memorial has been spruced up, with Easter just around the corner. Political posters adorn street corners as parties jostle at the starting line ahead of next years Assembly election. googletag.cmd.push At the top of the town, traffic grinds to a halt, stled by road works that have created a narrow corridor of cones and warning signs. Heading back towards the town, I spot two people on a narrow laneway, seemingly in heated discussion. Both have puffy coats and woolly hats on, despite the strong sun, and there is a lot of finger-pointing. I decide to give them a wide berth. Passing through the town again, I notice the door to Inner Beauty is open. A glance in on the way past reveals a woman sitting cross-legged on the floor, with products strewn around her.     I have to go back. Road works at the top of the town are currently causing disruption. Claire McGill, who runs the skincare specialist salon, tells me she is preparing goodie bags to leave outside the salon for local children in place of their usual Easter celebrations. “Every Easter Saturday, we usually do an Easter egg hunt through the town, but Ive been closed since Christmas Eve,” she explains. “My customers are really running out of products now. Ive been doing deliveries, but to be honest, there is no profit in it, between time, effort and road works. “I did a delivery yesterday that was just to the top of the town and it took me over an hour. I only spoke to her for about two seconds at her front door too. Its a nightmare. “My phone hasnt stopped with people askingIm open today, because Ive had the shutter up doing this.” Claire says the latest period of lockdown has been a hard pull. Forced to seek the help of a local councillor in accessing government grant support, it still took a number of months. “I didnt get any grants because I dont have a rates bill in my name, so he got it all sorted. It took months, I only got my first one there in the middle of February, from October. ” she says. “I know everybody thinks getting pound a week when closed is fantastic, but firstly, its all taxable, so its only pound a week. “I have girls furloughed, so theres nothing left. My landlord is so decent, which is just as well, otherwise wed all be closed by now. “Were very lucky in the town that were in that everybody is very close,” she adds. Karen Groogan is looking forward to welcoming customers back in store. In an example of that close-knit community, Claire sends me across the street to meet Karen Groogan. Karen runs Groogans, a boutique clothes and fashion shop on the towns Main Street, and agrees with Claire that community support has been vital during this time. “In the run-up to Christmas, this year more than any other year, the town really got behind shopping local and it was brilliant,” she says. “Ive found this one has been harder for several dferent reasons. The weather has been a real downer and regarding shopping, I think people have been better prepared this year. “Last time I was able to help them out and ersy, selling things I wouldnt normally sell, whereas this time round, theyve had a houseful of stuff for their kids already.” Finvola keeps a watchful eye on Dungivens Main Street. As well as the dficulties associated with Covid, Karen is in two minds about the effect the new bypass will have on trade in the town. “I really dont know how its going to affect us. A lot of locals think its going to be a great thing for the town and encourage people to shop local,” she tells me. “I hope thats the way, but is there enough for them to shop local  We could really do with a good bakery, a good fruit and veg shop, but all those shops have closed because of the high rates. “Now were going to make the road to Derry even shorter. There is a feeling that when the town quietens down it will make people shop local, and I really hope thats true. “I do really well from passing trade though professional women going between Derry and Belfast for their work. They dont have the time to go shopping at the weekend and nor do they want to. “Whenever they come here, they know theyre going to get what they want. The girls that have come over the past four years know Im here, but its going to be hard to get any more girls like that. “Thats what I really worry about losing the passing trade. I really enjoy the company of them as well, so Im on the fence about whether or not it will be a good thing for the town.” Karens online trade has been good, but it doesnt replace the rapport she builds with her customers. “We do have a website, but I prefer to be open and able to sell things to people,” he says. “My shop is the kind of shop that you come in for one thing and you come out with more. Its a treasure trove. “Its got all sorts of dferent things school wear, home wear, childrens and ladies clothes, whereas it can be a bit limiting online.” The Roe sparkling in the March sun. Moving past the empty shop fronts at the bottom half of the town, your reward is the sight of the sun shimmering on the clear waters of the Roe. A young couple appear along its banks, ing from a ramble in the nearby fields. Throughout lockdown, people have rediscovered the beauty of their immediate surroundings. While the fine weather intensies dreams of normalitys , many will be hoping ambivalence to local nature spots will notwith it. In Dungiven, the community has pulled together, and they will look to harness that spirit of regeneration after Covids bitter chapter is finally drawn to a close.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The rain of the previous night has given way to a sun strong enough to elicit steam from its surface. Entering by the crossroads at the boxing club, there appear to be a lot of closed doors. A sign informs the public that Granaghan Fireplaces will be back on Monday, April . There is almost giddy optimism around the date, and by the time you read this, well be on the far bank of that particular Rubicon. Some non-essential retail will have opened, schools will be back and group training, albeit not in its full form, will have resumed. googletag.cmd.push In keeping with the general theme of this series, as soon as I gather my stuff and leave the car, the heavens open. Hailstones this time. By the time I reach the deserted play park at the bridge, it has receded to a bitter mizzle, only a stf breeze propelling it into my face. A quiet Swatragh last Friday afternoon. The Drumbane Road climbs towards the North Sperrins Scenic Route away to my right as I make my way up the hill past an empty St Johns Primary School, closed for the Easter holidays. St Johns chapel towers over the cars that pass by on the main road. That all of the gravestones seem to face in that direction only enhances the effect. googletag.cmd.push A single car sits outside the open doors of the chapel. Inside, an elderly lady has lit a candle and is praying at the foot of the altar. On the way out, she tells me Ive just missed mass. I head back towards the village. A triangular sign advertising Friels to Go sits outside the school, offering local flavour to an exploding mobile catering industry. Light snow begins to fall as I head back over the bridge. A pink Fiat brings a splash of colour to the street as grey clouds swell overhead. Outside McGuigans Garage, Kieran McGuigan says the pandemic has taken on a personal edge for him and his family.     “I had Covid myself, and so did my family, but we have all recovered. Its been a strange time. Once you get that [positive] result back, you just dont know whats in front of you.” he tells me. “Other families havent, and its been a tough time for everybody. Business-wise, were just tipping away and doing what we can. “Covid affects dferent people in dferent ways. I was off my feet, in bed for a week with the fatigue and no energy or appetite. “My we and the kids had it too, and my mother-in-law had to go into hospital with it for ten days, but thankfully shes okay now.” McGuigans garage has adapted to the restrictions as they have been introduced. Kieran pauses to wave a customer around the one-way system introduced with the onset of the pandemic. McGuigans have had to adapt like everyone . “Its all one-way and its appointment only now,” he says. “Its easier managed, you dont want too many people on the premises at the same time. Ive a routine every morning and evening where I wipe everything down. “You have your signs up, you do what you can and you bring as little people inside as possible. Were managing it and doing what we can. “The car sales will be open on Monday morning again. Vans and pick-ups have been very busy, but its going to be great to get opened up to do test drives again and meeting people face-to-face. “People enjoy the process, its part and parcel of the business. When theyre spending that amount of money, its a big step and you cant take them for granted.” Kieran admits not being able to physically meet up with friends has been tough, but says last years lockdown had a galvanising effect on the community. “There are boys I havent seen since the bars shut. Youd be texting boys, but its not the same having the craic in a WhatsApp group,” he says. “Having the banter over a beer or even getting to a football match is missed. Last year, Swatragh had five games and I was at every one of them. “The year before, I was only at a few of them, but it was just the fact you could get out, so you made a point of going to them. “The local GAA club did a lot for the community throughout the  months. They were offering to pick up groceries for people that were isolated and delivered meals. “My mum is  years of age and got it a few times, and that was done by Davitts. Its the heart of the community. Everything revolves around it and it brings everybody together.”  Sineacutead McErlean and Fran OKane from SM Filling Station on the Kilrea Road. After indulging in the glamour of being a reporter on the road and conducting a Zoom interview in the car, I head down Kilrea Road to SM Filling Station. A few minutes of to-and-fro with Sineacutead and a phone call with Sean and Im chatting to Fran OKane, who tells me the ongoing vaccination programme is lting peoples spirits. “I think people are more hopeful now because of the jab, theyre more upbeat as its been rolled out,” she says. “I have had the first one. It was a bit of a relief, but itll be better when I get the second one. Youre meeting so many people in here all the time.” The busy service station found itself with the responsibility of being essential retail, but Fran says the extra regulations quickly became part and parcel of doing business. “Its busier now again than it had been. It was very quiet early on in January but things have really picked up now and were a lot busier,” she says. “You always had that bit of nervousness and were very aware not to stand too near, or to sanitise your hands, especially with handling money and everything. “It was dficult, but as time went on it just became matter-of-fact and you just do it now every time you serve somebody. You adapt and get used to it. “Even outside, youre still inclined to pull back. Id say % of customers are wearing the masks, but you do get that odd one that doesnt wear it.” Daffodils signal Spring is well underway in Swatragh. Fran has noticed an upturn in people out walking, but is already turning her attention to more trivial matters as normality draws nearer. “I would walk the dog anyway, and you used to meet nobody out, but now youre meeting people a lot more,” she says. “Im looking forward to getting back to normal,there ever is such a thing, but Im most looking forward to getting my hair done. “I need a trim and a colour done,” she adds. The stay at home message has now officially been discontinued by the NI Executive, but it has been moot for weeks. Ato group training will come as a welcomed relief to sportspeople throughout the county, and summer feels a lot closer now than it did last week. At the weekend, the Department of Health announced over one million vaccines had been administered, between first and second doses. As Kieran McGuigan shows customers around the garage courtyard this week, Swatragh will be one small step closer to the end of the pandemic. It might feel like one giant leap.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The rain of the previous night has given way to a sun strong enough to elicit steam from its surface. Entering by the crossroads at the boxing club, there appear to be a lot of closed doors. A sign informs the public that Granaghan Fireplaces will be back on Monday, April . There is almost giddy optimism around the date, and by the time you read this, well be on the far bank of that particular Rubicon. Some non-essential retail will have opened, schools will be back and group training, albeit not in its full form, will have resumed. googletag.cmd.push In keeping with the general theme of this series, as soon as I gather my stuff and leave the car, the heavens open. Hailstones this time. By the time I reach the deserted play park at the bridge, it has receded to a bitter mizzle, only a stf breeze propelling it into my face. A quiet Swatragh last Friday afternoon. The Drumbane Road climbs towards the North Sperrins Scenic Route away to my right as I make my way up the hill past an empty St Johns Primary School, closed for the Easter holidays. St Johns chapel towers over the cars that pass by on the main road. That all of the gravestones seem to face in that direction only enhances the effect. googletag.cmd.push A single car sits outside the open doors of the chapel. Inside, an elderly lady has lit a candle and is praying at the foot of the altar. On the way out, she tells me Ive just missed mass. I head back towards the village. A triangular sign advertising Friels to Go sits outside the school, offering local flavour to an exploding mobile catering industry. Light snow begins to fall as I head back over the bridge. A pink Fiat brings a splash of colour to the street as grey clouds swell overhead. Outside McGuigans Garage, Kieran McGuigan says the pandemic has taken on a personal edge for him and his family.     “I had Covid myself, and so did my family, but we have all recovered. Its been a strange time. Once you get that [positive] result back, you just dont know whats in front of you.” he tells me. “Other families havent, and its been a tough time for everybody. Business-wise, were just tipping away and doing what we can. “Covid affects dferent people in dferent ways. I was off my feet, in bed for a week with the fatigue and no energy or appetite. “My we and the kids had it too, and my mother-in-law had to go into hospital with it for ten days, but thankfully shes okay now.” McGuigans garage has adapted to the restrictions as they have been introduced. Kieran pauses to wave a customer around the one-way system introduced with the onset of the pandemic. McGuigans have had to adapt like everyone . “Its all one-way and its appointment only now,” he says. “Its easier managed, you dont want too many people on the premises at the same time. Ive a routine every morning and evening where I wipe everything down. “You have your signs up, you do what you can and you bring as little people inside as possible. Were managing it and doing what we can. “The car sales will be open on Monday morning again. Vans and pick-ups have been very busy, but its going to be great to get opened up to do test drives again and meeting people face-to-face. “People enjoy the process, its part and parcel of the business. When theyre spending that amount of money, its a big step and you cant take them for granted.” Kieran admits not being able to physically meet up with friends has been tough, but says last years lockdown had a galvanising effect on the community. “There are boys I havent seen since the bars shut. Youd be texting boys, but its not the same having the craic in a WhatsApp group,” he says. “Having the banter over a beer or even getting to a football match is missed. Last year, Swatragh had five games and I was at every one of them. “The year before, I was only at a few of them, but it was just the fact you could get out, so you made a point of going to them. “The local GAA club did a lot for the community throughout the  months. They were offering to pick up groceries for people that were isolated and delivered meals. “My mum is  years of age and got it a few times, and that was done by Davitts. Its the heart of the community. Everything revolves around it and it brings everybody together.”  Sineacutead McErlean and Fran OKane from SM Filling Station on the Kilrea Road. After indulging in the glamour of being a reporter on the road and conducting a Zoom interview in the car, I head down Kilrea Road to SM Filling Station. A few minutes of to-and-fro with Sineacutead and a phone call with Sean and Im chatting to Fran OKane, who tells me the ongoing vaccination programme is lting peoples spirits. “I think people are more hopeful now because of the jab, theyre more upbeat as its been rolled out,” she says. “I have had the first one. It was a bit of a relief, but itll be better when I get the second one. Youre meeting so many people in here all the time.” The busy service station found itself with the responsibility of being essential retail, but Fran says the extra regulations quickly became part and parcel of doing business. “Its busier now again than it had been. It was very quiet early on in January but things have really picked up now and were a lot busier,” she says. “You always had that bit of nervousness and were very aware not to stand too near, or to sanitise your hands, especially with handling money and everything. “It was dficult, but as time went on it just became matter-of-fact and you just do it now every time you serve somebody. You adapt and get used to it. “Even outside, youre still inclined to pull back. Id say % of customers are wearing the masks, but you do get that odd one that doesnt wear it.” Daffodils signal Spring is well underway in Swatragh. Fran has noticed an upturn in people out walking, but is already turning her attention to more trivial matters as normality draws nearer. “I would walk the dog anyway, and you used to meet nobody out, but now youre meeting people a lot more,” she says. “Im looking forward to getting back to normal,there ever is such a thing, but Im most looking forward to getting my hair done. “I need a trim and a colour done,” she adds. The stay at home message has now officially been discontinued by the NI Executive, but it has been moot for weeks. Ato group training will come as a welcomed relief to sportspeople throughout the county, and summer feels a lot closer now than it did last week. At the weekend, the Department of Health announced over one million vaccines had been administered, between first and second doses. As Kieran McGuigan shows customers around the garage courtyard this week, Swatragh will be one small step closer to the end of the pandemic. It might feel like one giant leap.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Businesses will be allowed to resume click and collect services from today. All children willto school this week. Outdoor sports training is also allowed to restart from today, with some limitations. However, unlike other parts of the UK, retail and hospitality businesses in the North do not yet know when they can re-open. The Northern Ireland Executive is due to meet on Thursday to discuss their plans in terms of further easing of the current lockdown restrictions. Retail NI Chief Executive Glyn Roberts described the resumption of click and collect services as a long overdue and welcome development. googletag.cmd.push “It is a step toward the wider reopening of our high streets and will provide a much-needed leline for many local independent retailers whose businesses are on their last legs. “This Thursdays Executive meeting will be one of the most important ever for thousands of local small business owners. “With over million vaccinations, falling hospital admissions and decreasing new cases of the virus, there is absolutely no reason why the Executive cannot greenlight the safe reopening of non-essential retail, hospitality and close contact services for thApril.” Mr Roberts said his organisation was also concerned that the Executive is not doing enough preparation for the wider reopening of our high streets. googletag.cmd.push “Public hand sanitisers, Covid marshals and agreed Covid compliance signage for businesses, all need to be in place ahead of reopening. “These next few weeks will be make or break for thousands of local small businesses.” Meanwhile, Derry City and Strabane District Council has said that its outdoor sports facilities are now available to be booked following the latest phase of the easing of the lockdown restrictions. These include facilities at the Foyle Arena Ryan McBride Brandywell Stadium Templemore Sports Complex Brooke Park Bishops Field Caw G and all council-owned grass pitches.

The colony was one of several built under the terms of the  Irish LandAct to cater for ex-servicemen ing from the First World War. Fty-seven cottages were erected on a .-acre patch of land in the Shantallow area, which had been purchased from Sir John McFarland of Aberfoyle on the Strand Road. The land was bought for £,-- - £, in today’s money - and featured a mixture of semi-detached cottages, blocks of four cottages and one detached cottage. A memorial plaque erected by Derry City Council in . Nigel Henderson, a researcher with History Hub Ulster, has been documenting the locations of the , ex-servicemen’s cottages built in Northern Ireland. “The largest colony or collection of cottages in County Londonderry are the ones at Messines Park,” he said. “I’ve been going through the records trying to get details of the styles of the houses, how many rooms they had, whether they had toilets and bathrooms and things like that. “Once a family was installed in them, they tended to stay there for le, but there were some issues with evictions due to non-payment of rent. “A lot of the guys coming back from the war weren’t able to keep up employment so they may not have been able to pay the rents. “The rents weren’t exorbitant for their time or the standard of the houses, but the ISSLT , were strict at taking people to court for non-payment of rent. “You had guys who were evicted in the early s and then another ex-serviceman might have moved in again. In Belfast, there were guys on the waiting list as far on as the s.” Early plans show the layout of the ex-servicemens three-bedroom cottages at Messines Park. Initial rent for the houses, designed by Roland Ingolby Smith, chief architect for the NI Ministry of Finance from  to , was nine shillings per week, around £ per week today. On the night the Luftwaffe bombed the city, all  fatalities occurred in a row of houses facing onto the Buncrana Road. Nigel Henderson said the attack on Messines Park was unlikely to have been in the Germans’ plan. Instead, it is thought the nearby docks were their intended target. “What I understand is that they were aiming for the docks. During the Second World War in Derry, there was a naval base there,” he said. “It was a base for the Royal Navy going out on patrols in the North Atlantic, but they overshot and Shantallow was not that far from where the docks would have been. Ten members from the Richmond and Murray families died in the attack, along with -year-old James Collins, his -year-old daughter Ellen and William Alexander McFarland. The youngest victim was -month-old Sheila Murray. Their loss was keenly felt within Messines Park, where a strong community spirit had grown since the houses were erected in June . A map showing the location of the cottages at Messines Park. Residents established a local British Legion branch and an accompanying hall was built just outside the development in . A colony of ex-servicemen being settled in Derry has the potential to be controversial when looked at through a contemporary eye, but an atmosphere of co-operation prevailed in the aftermath of the First World War. “I don’t think there was any sectarian sentiment against the houses, because for the guys who had moved in, religious affiliation was not a factor,” explained Nigel. “What was taken into account was how big a family they had, whether they had employment, whether they were wounded or gassed in the war, or the standard of housing they had. “Some of those who died were Protestants and some were Roman Catholics and because it was on the edge of the city, they formed almost a small community of their own. “The attitude was that it didn’t matteryou were a Catholic or a Protestant, a unionist or a nationalist, the guys served together. Both communities had been up for participating. “When those guys came home, the religious affiliation of their ex-servicemen neighbours would not have been a major factor or a cause for concern. “They had served together through a nightmare and living close to other ex-servicemen provided an opportunity for them to talk about their shared experiences. “This was something the veterans seldom did inside their homes or with their families.” While not their intended target, the German bombers would no doubt have felt a sense of schadenfreude at how things panned out. Nigel Henderson is struck by the tragic irony of the ex-servicemen’s demise. “It’s the only part of Derry that was hit in the German air raids, but it just happened to be men who had fought in the First World War who were the principal victims,” he said. “That is the irony of it. They survived the Germans in the trenches of the First World War to then die during the Second World War from aerial bombing.” The victims James and Ellen Collins Father and daughter, James and Ellen Collins, lived at  Messines Park. Sixty-year old James was the oldest victim of the bombing and was originally from Eglinton. He was stationed at Finner Camp in County Donegal when he met and married Elizabeth Doherty in  at Glendermott Parish Church. Their daughter Ellen was born in  and was just  when she died. Both were buried in Glendermott Parish Church. William McFarland Born at Fountain Street in Derry City, William Alexander McFarland had been working as a fitter before he enlisted with the Royal Engineers in . He served with Fortress Company at Salonica for over three years and was living at Hawkin Street in the city before he was transferred to Class Z Army Reserve in . William married Elizabeth Reid in  at St Augustine’s Church of Ireland and worked after the war in the Employment Exchange. A member of the Messines Park branch of the British Legion, he was serving as a sergeant with the Local Defence Force when he died, aged , in the bombing raid. The Murray Family Six members of the Murray family, who lived at  Messines Park, lost their lives in the bombing. William , was born on Donegal Street and married Omagh woman Molly Gormanin  at St Columb’s Catholic Church. William had served with the Guards during World War One and was serving as a sergeant with the Local Defence Volunteers when he died. Four of their children Ita , Kathleen , Philomenaand Sheiladied during the attack. Sheila was the youngest victim. The Richmond Family The  German bomb claimed the lives of four members of the Richmond family. John Richmond was born in  in the Waterside and had been right at the thick of the war. Stationed in China with the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, he landed on Y Beach, Cape Helles, at the start of the Gallipoli land campaign. After being taken prisoner at Bertencourt, he was held in prisoner of war camps in Le Quesnoy Limburg and Dulman, before being discharged as ‘no longer physically fit for war service’ in .

A colony of ex-servicemen being settled in Derry has the potential to be controversial when looked at through a contemporary eye, but an atmosphere of co-operation prevailed in the aftermath of the First World War. “I don’t think there was any sectarian sentiment against the houses, because for the guys who had moved in, religious affiliation was not a factor,” explained Nigel. “What was taken into account was how big a family they had, whether they had employment, whether they were wounded or gassed in the war, or the standard of housing they had. “Some of those who died were Protestants and some were Roman Catholics and because it was on the edge of the city, they formed almost a small community of their own. “The attitude was that it didn’t matteryou were a Catholic or a Protestant, a unionist or a nationalist, the guys served together. Both communities had been up for participating. “When those guys came home, the religious affiliation of their ex-servicemen neighbours would not have been a major factor or a cause for concern. “They had served together through a nightmare and living close to other ex-servicemen provided an opportunity for them to talk about their shared experiences. “This was something the veterans seldom did inside their homes or with their families.” While not their intended target, the German bombers would no doubt have felt a sense of schadenfreude at how things panned out. Nigel Henderson is struck by the tragic irony of the ex-servicemen’s demise. “It’s the only part of Derry that was hit in the German air raids, but it just happened to be men who had fought in the First World War who were the principal victims,” he said. “That is the irony of it. They survived the Germans in the trenches of the First World War to then die during the Second World War from aerial bombing.” The victims James and Ellen Collins Father and daughter, James and Ellen Collins, lived at  Messines Park. Sixty-year old James was the oldest victim of the bombing and was originally from Eglinton. He was stationed at Finner Camp in County Donegal when he met and married Elizabeth Doherty in  at Glendermott Parish Church. Their daughter Ellen was born in  and was just  when she died. Both were buried in Glendermott Parish Church. William McFarland Born at Fountain Street in Derry City, William Alexander McFarland had been working as a fitter before he enlisted with the Royal Engineers in . He served with Fortress Company at Salonica for over three years and was living at Hawkin Street in the city before he was transferred to Class Z Army Reserve in . William married Elizabeth Reid in  at St Augustine’s Church of Ireland and worked after the war in the Employment Exchange. A member of the Messines Park branch of the British Legion, he was serving as a sergeant with the Local Defence Force when he died, aged , in the bombing raid. The Murray Family Six members of the Murray family, who lived at  Messines Park, lost their lives in the bombing. William , was born on Donegal Street and married Omagh woman Molly Gormanin  at St Columb’s Catholic Church. William had served with the Guards during World War One and was serving as a sergeant with the Local Defence Volunteers when he died. Four of their children Ita , Kathleen , Philomenaand Sheiladied during the attack.Sheila was the youngest victim. The Richmond Family The  German bomb claimed the lives of four members of the Richmond family. John Richmond was born in  in the Waterside and had been right at the thick of the war.

At present, food and garden waste are collected separately. However, under a new system, householders will be asked to combine food and garden in the larger garden waste bin for collection. This change was approved by councillors at a meeting yesterday of Derry City and Strabane District Councils Environment and Regeneration Committee. The new collection system has been run on a pilot basis in Strabane but is now to be extended to other areas across the council. Councillors were told at yesterdays meeting that the change will only be introduced where practical to do so and those properties without gardens – terraced housing, maisonettes etc – will continue to receive a weekly food waste collection using existing collection methods. googletag.cmd.push A council spokesperson said: “If you have a big brown garden waste bin youll be permitted to put bagged food waste in it from now on. “Make sure that youve got the food in a compostable bag like you would have done when recycling food using your outdoor caddy. “Collections will be fortnightly on the same day as your existing garden waste collection.” The spokesperson added: “Well be letting everyone everyone affected know about this change in more detail over the next few weeks and will be providing handy tips on recycling at home.” googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Planning permission was this week granted for the conversion of the former Officers Mess building at Ebrington, known as Building , into offices. However, SDLP councillor John Boyle questioned whether offices were the best use for the fascinating building which was built in . Planning permission was also granted at a meeting this week of Derry City and Strabane District Councils Planning Committee on Monday for another historic building on the Ebrington site base to be turned into office accommodation. googletag.cmd.push The former guard house building, known at Building , will be remodelled and extended. The works will provide new office accommodation incorporating meeting rooms and other associated facilities. Building  is a Grade  listed building, located along the southern side ofEbringtonSquare. Building  will undergo internal alterations with the addition of a lt shaft and a flat roof extension, transforming the building into a modern office space. Cllr Boyle told the meeting that he supported planning permission being granted for the respective plans for the two Ebrington buildings. However, in relation to Building , he said he believed the building could have been put to better use. googletag.cmd.push “Sometimes I do consider that buildings like this as office space, perhaps that is not the ideal use,” he said. “I actually know this building and some years ago a friend of mine was carrying out some remediation work inside it and I happened to call over and have a look around it. “It is a fascinating building, it really is a first class quality building and I just regret a little more imagination around what this building could have been used for has not been applied in this particular instance. “But office space can be useful and provides for employment opportunities and jobs and progression of local people and the economy here locally but we are where we are.     “I am also conscious of the fact that something can obviously then be reconverted back into something  as well.” Sinn Fein councillor Christopher Jackson, chair of the councils Planning Committee, said he could understand Cllr Boyles comments in relation to a perceived lack of imagination. However, Cllr Jackson said many of the Ebrington buildings had been unoccupied for too long and he said the new office accommodation was a major step for the site. “We are starting to see businesses whatever their nature having the confidence to invest in Ebrington Square and relocating to Ebrington Square and inevitably it will lead to an increased footfall and along with that we hope to see the real ambition for Ebrington Square fulfilled.” In response, Cllr Boyle agreed that many of the Ebrington buildings had been unoccupied for too long and he welcomed the new plans for the Building  and Building . This weeks meeting was told that a local company, GLA Surveyors, had indicated that they plan to move into Building . A planning officer told this weeks meeting that he did not knowthere were prospective tenants for Building . Cllr Jackson said he was delighted to see work continue to progress at the site. This is just the latest step in the complete transformation of the site atEbringtonSquare and the journey towards achieving its potential as a hugely important business and cultural hub for the city. “The site is unique in bringing together both Derrys past and future stories. During the pandemic, people have really been making use of the space with its beautul panoramic views of the city and open walkways and recreational areas. “As the work continues and more businesses choose to locate to the site,Ebringtonwill become the vibrant, attractive and buzzing heart of the Waterside community. “I look forward to seeing this area continue to develop and improve over the coming months,” added the local councillor.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The upgrade of the Buncrana Road was first mooted some  years ago. Hopes that work would commence in the near future rose this week after it emerged that traffic lights are to be erected at the Springtown Road junction of Buncrana Road. However, Dfi has quashed those hopes by stating the new lights were being put in place to facilitate an expectant increase in traffic due to the construction of a new Lidl supermarket due to open in  weeks time. googletag.cmd.push In a statement to the Derry News, a Dfi spokesperson said: “Planning permission was granted for a new Lidl store on the Buncrana Road which includes for the upgrade of the Springtown Road Buncrana Road junction to a signal controlled junction prior to the opening of the new store. “This measure is to assist the mitigation of the impact of traffic generated by the new retail outlet in the interests of road safety and traffic progression and will incorporate a pedestrian phase.” The spokesperson added: “In June , Minster Mallon announced her commitment to fund the continued development of a number of Strategic Road Improvement schemes including the A Buncrana Road, as part of her plan to aid economic recovery and community transformation while addressing regional imbalance. googletag.cmd.push “Consistent with wider priorities, Minister Mallon is committed to ensuring that this scheme is future-proofed to help stimulate green recovery. “The Department is continuing to progress the A Buncrana Road scheme in line with the objectives which include improving transport links, road safety, traffic progression and contributing to the regeneration of the area. The spokesperson concluded: “Officials will continue discussions with all affected landowners and other stakeholders over the coming months and to progress scheme development.” Sinn Fein Foyle MLA Martina Anderson said it was vitally important the upgrade took place as soon as possible. “The full upgrade of this road is crucial to ensure that it is fit for purpose as a main gateway into our Donegal hinterland and feature in any future expansion of the Fort George site.     “And it is also vitally important to make sure that happens as soon as possible for all the residents and businesses along its entirety as it’s estimated that over , vehicles use itdaily.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Offices of Mid Ulster District Council in Cookstown were vandalised in the attack, with the words Fly the Flag spray painted on the wall. The grafitti is thought to be in reference to an earlier decision by the council to reject a motion calling for the Union flag to be flown at half-mast to mark the passing of the Duke of Edinburgh. DUP leader on the council, Paul McLean had called on council Chair Cathal Mallaghan to explain to Mid Ulsters constituents why the flag would not be flown. googletag.cmd.push We requested that the Union Flag be flown at half-mast to mark the passing of the Duke of Edinburgh but the Council Chairman has declined that request, he said. We disagree with the decision and have requisitioned a meeting for the Chairman to explain to those in Mid Ulster who want to show their respect for the Duke of Edinburgh why this position has been taken. The chairman has seven days to grant the meeting.Unionists may only make up  of the  members but we have a right to be heard and to receive an explanation. It is extraordinary that the Sinn Fein Speaker in the Northern Ireland Assembly can have the Union Flag flying at half-mast on Parliament Buildings but here in Michelle O’Neill’s constituency another Sinn Fein councillor has refused to fly the Union Flag at half-mast as a mark of respect.” googletag.cmd.push Council Chair Cathal Mallaghan condemned the grafitti, saying it was completely unacceptable. These are civic offices where we our residents come to register births, deaths, marriages, he said. Its where we provide crucial public services, from building control to economic development and from where we also operate our local bin collection services. “To see the offices defaced in this way is completely unacceptable. This should be a safe, shared space for our residents and for our staff and such vandalism is an attack on local public services, as well as local democracy. “I condemn it and I call on all elected representatives to do likewise”.     SDLP councillor Malachy Quinn said the vandalism was pathetic. MUDC has since the very start held a no flags policy to stop them becoming an issue, he said. All our staff have the right to come to work free from harassment and will continue to make that the case. Sadly we have sad inidulas who are out their trying to whip up sectarian hatred through defacing public buildings, violence on our streets and wrecking their own towns and trying to drag a new generation down with them. They wont succeed. John Hume always said You cant eat a flag and unionism should take heed and tackle the real issues in our society instead of talking flags.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Offices of Mid Ulster District Council in Cookstown were vandalised in the attack, with the words Fly the Flag spray painted on the wall. The grafitti is thought to be in reference to an earlier decision by the council to reject a motion calling for the Union flag to be flown at half-mast to mark the passing of the Duke of Edinburgh. DUP leader on the council, Paul McLean had called on council Chair Cathal Mallaghan to explain to Mid Ulsters constituents why the flag would not be flown. googletag.cmd.push We requested that the Union Flag be flown at half-mast to mark the passing of the Duke of Edinburgh but the Council Chairman has declined that request, he said. We disagree with the decision and have requisitioned a meeting for the Chairman to explain to those in Mid Ulster who want to show their respect for the Duke of Edinburgh why this position has been taken. The chairman has seven days to grant the meeting.Unionists may only make up  of the  members but we have a right to be heard and to receive an explanation. It is extraordinary that the Sinn Fein Speaker in the Northern Ireland Assembly can have the Union Flag flying at half-mast on Parliament Buildings but here in Michelle O’Neill’s constituency another Sinn Fein councillor has refused to fly the Union Flag at half-mast as a mark of respect.” googletag.cmd.push Council Chair Cathal Mallaghan condemned the grafitti, saying it was completely unacceptable. These are civic offices where we our residents come to register births, deaths, marriages, he said. Its where we provide crucial public services, from building control to economic development and from where we also operate our local bin collection services. “To see the offices defaced in this way is completely unacceptable. This should be a safe, shared space for our residents and for our staff and such vandalism is an attack on local public services, as well as local democracy. “I condemn it and I call on all elected representatives to do likewise”.     SDLP councillor Malachy Quinn said the vandalism was pathetic. MUDC has since the very start held a no flags policy to stop them becoming an issue, he said. All our staff have the right to come to work free from harassment and will continue to make that the case. Sadly we have sad inidulas who are out their trying to whip up sectarian hatred through defacing public buildings, violence on our streets and wrecking their own towns and trying to drag a new generation down with them. They wont succeed. John Hume always said You cant eat a flag and unionism should take heed and tackle the real issues in our society instead of talking flags.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

After  years in Asia,  of which have been in Thailand, John is now nearing  years of age and is finally taking a step back from an adulthood that has revolved wholeheartedly around the growth of gaelic football in Bangkok and beyond. The magnitude of the Asian GAA community cannot be underestimated. The Asian Games are massive in this part of the world, with over  teams involved – men and women, and over  people coming together in friendship and competition. There are  clubs in Asia and the popularity of the sport, amongst Irish exiles and locals is growing year on year. googletag.cmd.push At the heart of this growth was, and is, Derry native John who founded Thailand GAA in . Since then, John has slowly but surely built something lasting, ever since agreeing to a request from the Asian County Board to set up a gaelic football team in Thailand. That set in motion a chain of events that has resulted in a thriving club – Thai GAA – but also a gaelic community that extends far beyond the limitations of the game itself. With three South Asia Championships to their name, Thai GAA is not just there to make up the numbers – it has ambition, not just for growth, but for success, and winning the men’s section of the Asian Gaelic Games remains the ultimate goal. googletag.cmd.push It is a far cry from kicking a ball about with Oxford United back in the late s. “I would never have thought  years ago when I was in Derry that I would end up in Thailand,” John admits. “I had one of those fork in the road moments. I was working for two years in England and was itching to get back home. I wasn’t that satisfied with my career and wanted to do something dferent. It was in July ’ that my boss rang me and asked ‘How do you fancy going to Thailand next week ’. The very same day I got a job offer back in Derry. I thoughtThailand didn’t happen, I would take the job in Derry. A week later I was in Thailand. That taste in travel, it opens your eyes to the world and I have never looked back.”     John left St. Columb’s in  and was accepted into Loughborough University for a degree in Chemical Engineering. Loughborough’s fine sporting pedigree was a key factor behind his choice but that side of it didn’t work out as he hoped and it wasn’t until his final year that he kicked a ball regularly again. He started playing gaelic – not his strong suit – in Leicester, before moving to Reading where there was a strong Irish community, and plenty in the way of soccer and gaelic. His job took him all around the world, but a trip to Taiwan in  ultimately changed his path and his le, completely. Now married to Jessie, with children Shannen, Cara and Caolan, John remembers when he discovered just how popular gaelic was in Asia. “I went to Taiwan in  on a project and discovered gaelic football team there,” he recalls. “They were competing in Asian Gaelic Games. It was just amazing to see  Irish people playing Gaelic football in China. “I had the opportunity to meet with Micheal OMuircheartaigh who was the honorary President of the Asian County Board. He comes over year and commentates on the games pitch-side. I didn’t watch a lot of gaelic growing up but I always watched the All-Ireland final. His voice was legendary and to actually meet the guy and have dinner with him and get to know him, was inspiring. “I ed to Thailand in , the County Board asked Johnhe could set up a team in Thailand. I managed to get a few Irish people and a few non-Irish people together and we got a team together and we played in our first Asian Games in Singapore in . In our first match we were lined up against Singapore Rugby team and I was in midfield and was lined up against a guy called Phil Green, who used to be a hooker for the England rugby team. “That was our first participation as Thailand GAA. Since then, every year, except , we have entered a team into the Asian Gaelic Games.”  Responsibility For a man who preferred soccer, and even a bit of golf, John was suddenly thrust into a position of responsibility, and, admittedly stubborn, he was not about to give his new role anything other than %. It was not easy however, and a lot of dficult days passed for a club which started out with five showing up for training to a club and city which has now hosted the Asian Games on three occasions, in ,  and  as well as hosting the South Asia Games on four occasions. “It was very dficult to be honest,” he admits. “The first thing I did was put an ad in the Bangkok Post and I got maybe four or five replies. The first training session had four or five people with a few girlfriends watching on. Because of my background with Oxford United, fitness came first so I told the guys they wouldn’t see a ball until they were fit, and I think because they had a dferent background from me, they thought this wasn’t for them. I probably scared people away. “Near tournaments it’s easy to get people to commit, but during the year and you’re running training once a week – I have a -hour commute to get out to training – you’re not sure what numbers you’re going to get. It’s very frustrating and the number of times I questioned myself ‘Why am I doing this ’ It was dficult, but I’m quite stubborn as well, and when I start something, it takes a lot for me to drop it because I want to make it a success. I persevered and I persevered and in  it really started changing.” The foundations of Thai GAA really started to take hold thanks to a talented group of girls, who came to the club, not just wanting to play, but to compete at the highest level. As defining moments go, this was signicant for John and his hopes of what Thai GAA could ultimately be. “I got a batch of girls in who were all natural athletes,” he explains. “Only two of them were Irish, one from the North and one from the South and neither of them had played gaelic before. One of them had played soccer for Northern Ireland but had no background in gaelic football. I had this group of girls for six weeks – all teachers from international schools before the  Asian Games in Malaysia, trying to get the basics. “In the first games they were asking ‘Where do I stand  Where do I go ’ They won six out of six at that tournament and won their ision. That was unbelievable success. Their hardest game was actually the semi-final against the Japanese Ladies. We beat them on Sudden Death Golden Goal. The same bunch of girls came back the next year in  and they won their title again that year. The following year they lost in the Upper Division, but that set the basis. This group of girls was committed, they loved their sport and we were giving them an opening to play competitively. “ was when we really bedded in as a club and that was on the back of our girls’ team. In , my girls won the South Asia Championship, so that was a regional tournament involving Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan and Shanghai. That was quite an achievement.”  Sustained success On the back of the girls’ success, the club got this influx of Irish men in  and that has since helped sustain the club over the last  years. The first men’s trophy soon followed – the Plate at the South Asia Games, and from there the club has gone from strength to strength. Better quality players joined – some with county experience, and fresh ideas and new energy began running through Thai GAA. “I was trying to remember things I learned playing with Doire Colmcille  or  years ago, but then these guys come in with fresh ideas and I was happy to let them coach,” John laughs. “The club is in a really strong place right now. We probably have about  members. What’s important is that there is a really good social side to the club as well. Most of the players would be late ’s, and early to late s, but there is room for everyone and it’s just a home away from home for a lot of people. It’s a good social network as well and you’re giving people a chance to play competitive sport as well as keeping fit. “Something I’ve picked up from the last  years of playing gaelic in Asia is what gaelic football means to people as a community. Most major cities in Asia have a gaelic team and it really is a home away from home from Irish and Northern Irish people, and people from both sides of the community in Ireland.” Only recently, John gave up the Chairmanship at the club, as he finally takes a back step from the day to day running of Thai GAA. It has been a labour of passion for the Carnhill man for  years, and he is proud of what it has become. He is not about to drt away into the sunset however. He might be turning  but he wants to keep playing, and doing whatever he can to ensure longevity and success for the club in the future. “I am very proud of what we’ve achieved in Thailand,” he says. “It’s also helped me stay connected to Ireland to be honest. This connection with gaelic football has given me more of an identity and a connection with Ireland being overseas. I have been able to meet a lot of people through gaelic football. The GAA certainly connects people and you can see the impact it has overseas. “I’m realizing that Father Time is marching on. I still want to be involved with the club, but I have work and family commitments. I used to be very heavily involved in making all the decisions but I have got a good bunch of people in there now who can share the load. “The next tournament maybe in Bangkok next year as it will host the South Asia Games and then at the end of  for the Asia Games, so maybe I can have a final swansong at those. There are guys older than me still playing so there’s a level for everyone. I’ll still be involved.”  Home away from home John s to Derry every summer with his family but for now, and for the past  years, his real home has been over , miles away, where he has helped build not just a team, but a club, a community and a legacy that will last long into the future. “It makes you realise the world is a small place and that the opportunities are out there,” he reflects. “It wasn’t something I sought out. I am proud of what I have achieved and what the club has achieved, but there has been a lot of good work that other people have done out in Asia around gaelic football. “It’s not just about gaelic football, it’s about Irish people and how we fit in around the world. We have no real baggage, we are able to adapt and fit into the communities we find ourselves in, and make a positive impact with our culture and with the welcome that we can bring to other people. When you are a teenager you have no idea where the future is going to take you. I had no great expectations or any great career plan. It was all by chance and by opportunity and here I am, sitting in Thailand.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Candystripes are one of just two teams without a victory so far this season, with Tuesday night’s - defeat to Shamrock Rovers the latest disappointment for Declan Devine and his players. There is now signicant pressure on City to get a result against Drogheda United at the Brandywell tonight to avoid the club’s worst start in their League of Ireland history. Victory however, could see them climb a few places, and Coll believes that a win would be huge for the club in a number of aspects. googletag.cmd.push “There’s a wee bit of pressure coming into it,” he admitted. “It’s not nice coming into a game under pressure so we have to try and take it away, and, on our home patch, start making it our patch. There are a few faces looking over the walls looking in watching us and we have to put a smile on their faces again. Hopefully Drogheda comes thick and fast and we can get the three points and get up and running.” Despite the defeat to Rovers, Coll saw a number of positives, particularly the performances of youngsters Ronan Boyce and Brendan Barr, who started Tuesday’s game. In all, six players who came through the Academy represented the club against the champions. googletag.cmd.push “They deserve their minutes,” he said. “If you look at Caoimhim Porter coming on, and Ronan Boyce, Brendan Barr, Caolan McLaughlin and Dixie Ferry, these players deserve their chance, because in pre-season they have stepped up to the mark and they know that Declan, Paddy, Conor and Mark will give them a chance. That’s exactly what they’ve done and hopefully they can keep driving on. “It’s hard to take and it’s four from four but there were some positives from the game. We conceded two disappointing goals, butyou look, we had Brendan Barr coming into the team and Ronan Boyce, and then the other young lads who came in. They were all brilliant and they are a credit to themselves. They were very good but the rest of the team have to step up to the same mark they are trying to reach.”     ‘Stick with us’ Coll has urged the fans not to fret despite the poor start to the season, promising that the players will turn it around soon. City have home games against Drogheda and Dundalk coming up in the next five days and a goodof points could change everything according to the experienced full-back. “Don’t be panicking too much because it’s a long season and we’re only four games in,” he insisted. “We have experience in this team look at Will Patching and Eoin Toal and others, we will be able to turn this around. Hopefully that’s on Friday night. We just have to regroup and that’s what we have to do. It’s our job. Tonight is another game so hopefully we can turn it around.” “You see the boys coming in after games and there’s nearly tears in their eyes. It’s not that we’re used to winning every single game or anything like that. Shamrock Rovers haven’t lost a game in the last year. We just want to get three points on the board and get off the bottom of the table because this club does not belong where we’re at, at the minute.” Defender Danny Lupano is set tofrom suspension after missing the Shamrock Rovers game due to his red card at St. Patrick’s Athletic last week, while Darren Cole should be fit after a recent injury.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It is imperative that this report is published and consulted upon so that we can see the stark reality of what key strategists in health here are thinking.ldquoAre we to take the threat of having the Downe and Daisy Hill in Newry reduced to dferent grades of urgent care centres  If we are, then we need to maintain solidarity as a district and not allow this to happento either of our two beloved hospitals.Cllr Savage said the local authority could not get into a ldquoide and conquer approach that saw ldquoone end of the district get more crumbs from the health service table than the other.ldquoWe need to fight to protect and enhance the services at both hospitals. We want services retained and enhanced for our people, he said.The Newry councillor pointed to the -year community campaign for a new Downe Hospital, suggesting that since its foundation stone was laid ldquoit has been a constant battle to retain services, commending the Down Community Health Committee for its work in fighting to retain local services.ldquoWe in this district should not have to constantly look over our shoulder in fear of the centralising grim reapers within the Department of Health attempting to swing the axe again at our cherished local hospitals to enhance services within a cluster of hospitals within the greater Belfast area, declared Cllr Savage.ldquoElected representatives have an obligation to speak up for our people and ensure that we are not treated as second class citizens when it comes to access to local hospital services and first class health care.ldquoThe Department of Health should be looking to enhance local hospitals and a strategy needs to be looked at regionally with the emphasis on fair access to local health services.Highlighting the need to fight to protect the health rights of rural communities across the district, Cllr Savage called for a ldquofair share of specialist services across all hospitals, suggesting thatthe Downe is good enough to provide cataract surgery, it is good enough to provide other services.Cllr Savage added: ldquoWe need to look at the challenges we face in health and ask ourselves are the current engagement structures we have capable of holding decision makers within health to account into the future and could they withstand the body blow of a potential decision to halve the number of current hospitals ldquoWe need to review those structures and a good place to start would be enhanced engagement with the Down Community Health Committee and Daisy Hill Pathfinder Group, inviting these groups to meet with us to discuss their concerns for the future of our local hospitals in a post-Covid world.Cllr Savage said local people required an ldquounequivocal statement from the health minister that there are no plans to reduce the number of hospitals and a ldquocast iron guarantee that there are no plans to downgrade the Downe HospitalHe added: Only when we get a response will we know  the rumours are just rumours.

The post-Christmas lockdown presented yet another challenge to the council and the DfC to target help where it was most needed.The County Down Rural Community Network , Newry Confederation of Community groups and others were asked to set up three brand new distribution centres and allocated over pound, worth of food and essential hygiene and household goods to the area.The Journey Church stepped up to assist in the Downpatrick area and week after week, dozens of their volunteers received the supplies from Lynas Foods, which they made into the ious orders and dispatching them to the ious groups in need. Down Community Transport helped with the bulkier loads.The Clanrye Group were tasked with coordinating the scheme and Kilkeel Development Association looked after the Mournes area. Clanrye collated orders for food and supplies each week and Lynas foods delivered pallets of supplies to this part of the world.Orders were placed each week by local food banks, the St Vincent de Paul Society, Home-Start, Sure Start and other organisations.Nicholas McCrickard, manager of CDRCN, said: ldquoOn behalf of the strategic stakeholder forum, I want to thank Journey Church and all the other groups involved in this gigantic effort.ldquoThe general public may never fully grasp the scale of the operation to keep our foodbanks and SVP stocked and able to answer the great need which has been brought on by the pandemic.ldquoWhile many of us have seen our lives as relatively unaffected, thousands of people have seen their normal weekly incomes and their day to day struggles take a turn for the worse.ldquoThis food pallet scheme and other financial and food security systems have been a leline for many. I want to thank the Maria Keenan from the Clanrye Group in particular and my colleague Daniella McCarry for going well beyond their normal jobs to help people most in need.Daniella said: ldquoWe could not have done this without the volunteers from the Journey Church in Downpatrick. They selflessly gave up days of their own time and rallied to the warehouse to get the vital supplies out to those that needed it most.ldquoThe foodbanks, SVP and our other partners are also to be commended for getting their orders in every week and for getting food and nappies and other products quickly out to local families.Thomas Leavy, from the Journey Churchrsquos leadership team, was the person who co-ordinated the local effort.He said that the church volunteers represented all generations distributed food to Downpatrickrsquos Fountain food bank, St Vincent De Paul in Strangford and Killough, Newcastle and Ballynahinch food bank.ldquoThis is the second time we have partnered with County Down Rural Community Network, he explained.ldquoIn the first lockdown we delivered food parcels, this time we delivered straight to agencies so that they could get the supplies out.ldquoDown Community Transport assisted with the use of several of their buses to deliver supplies furthest away while we did more local deliveries.The church hired the former Down Sports Centre premises in order to have room to break down the thousands of pounds worth of food which came each week on pallets..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/14Apr2021-Backing.jpg","title":"Council backing ban on conversion therapy  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has called for a ban on so-called conversion therapy and increased protection for those in the LGBT+ community.The decision was taken at last weekrsquos monthly meeting of the local authority with the debate including a powerful and moving contribution from Slieve Gullion councillor Pete Byrne, who highlighted the issues that those in the gay community like himself face.Tabled by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown, the motion was not agreed unanimously, with Independent Unionist Henry Reilly voting against it on the grounds that he did not know enough about the issue to make a judgement. The DUPrsquos Glyn Hanna and Kathryn Owen abstained.Cllr Brown urged the local authority to oppose the harm caused to the LGBT+ community in the past through the denial of rights and equal treatment and to recognise that discrimination still occurs today.Councillors have also supported a call to three Stormont ministers mdash Deirdre Hargey, Robin Swann and Naomi Long mdash to introduce an effective ban on conversion therapy within Northern Ireland, supported by a programme of work to help tackle these practices in all their forms.Cllr Brownrsquos motion, which urged the NI Executive and UK government to ban conversion therapy, called on the council to highlight and promote the continued support, counselling and advocacy local groups provide to members of the LGBT+ community.ldquoConversion therapy is a horric practice that has no place in todayrsquos society, Cllr Brown declared.ldquoConversion therapy is a term used to refer to ious dangerous and discredited practices aimed at changing an inidualrsquos sexual orientation or gender identity.ldquoThat could include attempting to change someonersquos sexual orientation from lesbian, gay or bisexual to straight or their gender identity from transgender or non-binary to cisgender.Cllr Brown said this disgraceful practice should not be accepted and permanently banned through legislation.Cllr Byrne mdash who is the SDLP group leader mdash said the fact that the issue was being debated in  was ldquobeyond distressing and as conversion therapy was still openly being practised.ldquoWe canrsquot look at the LGBT community and ask us to speak about it without your support, he told colleagues. ldquoWe need everyone in the chamber to support it and I hope they do.ldquoWe have heard the disappointing and weak response from the equalities minister on the conversion therapy debate in early March and we have waited almost , days since the UK government announced its intention to ban this therapy and we should not have to wait any longer.ldquoItrsquos long past time that the NI Executive stood up together to ban what I think are abusive practices in Northern Ireland and right across the UK, banning all interventions that have the intention of changing, suppressing, converting or cancelling sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression.Cllr Byrne said that growing up as gay, he found it incredibly dficult, explaining to his colleagues that he could not express how dficult it had been.ldquoMentally, you torture yourself, you question yourself and you close down, block out your feelings. You literally wear a mask every single day, praying that you donrsquot say something that will give you away.ldquoYou endure enough mental anguish to last a dozen letimes so, to me, when I look back, that is you internally practising a form of conversion therapy on yourself. It is shameful, but that is how you feel growing up, suppressing your own sexual orientation and every LGBT+ person knows the damage that it does, he said, emphasising that allowing conversion therapy to be practised openly or signposting people towards it is ldquobeyond depressing.Cllr Byrne said for most of those in the gay community they ldquogenerally breathe for the first time when they let it all out and to be true to yourself, explaining that the dficulties do not stop there.ldquoYou are confronted as a gay person by many situations that challenge you mentally and while people say lsquothat is the cross you have to bearrsquo it should not be, he continued. ldquoThere is nothing about my sexuality that needs fixed, nothing about it that needs intervention.Cllr Cathy Mason, who seconded the motion, said the practice of conversion therapy sought to ldquodenormalise or completely eradicate a personrsquos sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression and was deeply rooted in ldquointolerance and bigotry.She said those who conducted the therapy regularly exploited the vulnerabilities of young people struggling with their sexuality.She described conversion therapy as a ldquodeeply harmful and regressive practice and that there must be no loopholes on the legislation governing it.Cllr Hanna said the DUP would abstain on the motion, making it clear he had no problems with anyone and takes everyone as he finds them and that conversion therapy was ldquosomething that he would not wish on anyone.Cllr Willie Clarke said no one had the right to question another personrsquos sexuality, while Cllr Reilly askedpeople were ldquoforced into conversion therapy, explaining that he did not know about the issue.However, he suggested that to ban something because ldquoyou did not like a personrsquos ideology or philosophy was the start of a dark path.He said there was a wider context to the issue and that he had a lot of respect for Cllr Byrne.

He has also sold two to the US market.Michael, who is a full-time wheelchair user, has designed Changing Places in order to give disabled people confidence and privacy when using the bathroom at outdoor spaces, pop-up events or festivals.He recently received a pound, grant award from UnLtd, the UKrsquos foundation for social entrepreneurs, to further develop his design.Michael, who is also chair of the Centre of Independent Living NI, said: ldquoThe awardrsquos funding and tailored business support will signicantly help us to widen the positive social impact for the disabled community across the island of Ireland.ldquoDuring lockdown over the past year, we have utilised the time in research and development to be able to extend the products and services we are able to offer.ldquoAs well as our mobile Changing Places for outdoor and pop-up events, we have been able to develop a modular Changing Places.ldquoThis will offer a cost effective permanent solution to breaking down the barriers that disabled people face when trying to access public toilets. We are also able to extend this to installation of Changing Places is physical buildings as they are almost identical to the modular units that we are manufacturing.Each Changing Place will come a toilet and wash basin that can be lowered or heightened depending on the userrsquos needs, along with a changing table which can also be lowered.

I thought he did it excellently, he had such short time but he had the room laughing and I think everyone really appreciated it.While Mr Lindsay also met him at St Jamesrsquo Palace in London, it was another Hillsborough Castle event that Prince Philip shared his robust opinion.ldquoThere was only the one time that I talked to him for about two minutes at Hillsborough gates and there was a statue there that he didnrsquot think very much of and he told me, which was quite funny, recalled Mr Lindsay.ldquoI was once lucky enough to have a short private conversation with the Queen but that was all I managed with the Duke unfortunately.Mr Lindsay commended the Duke for the positive impact and benefit his award scheme had on young people.ldquoI do strongly support the Duke of Edinburghrsquos Award scheme, as I support all groups who help develop and support young people, said Mr Lindsay. ldquoThere is no doubt about it, these groups who help young people make a huge dference as to how people develop as adult and help keep the more vulnerable children away from undesirable habits.ldquoI take my hat off to him being behind a scheme which has been an outstanding success and copied around the world as well.He revealed that previous plans for the aftermath of the Dukersquos death had advised there were to be no memorial services for  days after his death which subsequently had been changed to  days.Mr Lindsay said: ldquoAll along the Duke said that he did not want any particular arrangements and I agree.

I had been told it was good for anxiety which I have struggled with, so I thought I may try it myself, said Lorna.ldquoOnce I tried it for the first time, I was hooked. It sends sensations up your body and brings an overwhelming sense of calmness to you. Itrsquos a complete form of tranquility.Cold water swimming has been reported to help people who struggle with depression and anxiety as well as slowing down the onset of dementia and help with the effects of menopause. It also has been reported to increase happiness, give your body better circulation and to help build your immune system.Although an advocate for cold water, Lorna also stressed the importance of safe swimming, especially when the temperature s to near freezing.ldquoItrsquos a good place to be when yoursquore in the water. I think the colder it is then the more benefit you get from it, she said. ldquoHowever, you obviously have to be careful when yoursquore going in, especially during harsher weather you have to limit your time.ldquoIf you go into it and yoursquore not used to having your breathing under control, your body can go into an uncontrollable shock. Start slowly and get your body into control. Irsquove seen people walk in and run out again almost immediately, but once you get used to the process you just feel happy, calm and relaxed and you want to stay in longer.After stressing iables which must be taken into account before hitting the waters, Lorna also lists some essential tips for beginners thinking of giving it a try.ldquoAlways take someone with you in case something goes wrong. Try and find a safe beach, which I know could be more challenging as we have to stay local she said.Since lockdown, Irsquove been restricted so I would travel to the end of the quay in Killyleagh and swim down there. You have to consider the effects of rip tides as they can come close to the shore and can be a very real danger.Lorna recommends those who are thinking of giving it a try to bring a wetsuit, neoprene socks, a hat, gloves, dry robe, hot drinks and possibly a hot water bottle for afterwards.Swimmers should always aim to gradually heat their body once out of the water by adding layers to prevent going into a hypothermic shock.Also, they are advised to bring a floating aid to be seen safely and wear bright clothes.Lorna, a NHS care worker, first got involved with wild swimming after a colleague informed her of a Bangor-based group called Dash and Splash.Since then, more and more groups have took to the waters in local places such as Newcastle, Ballyhornan and Whiterock. Lornarsquos native Killyleagh have recently formed the cold water group Dippy Flipper swimmers.These groups are highly recommended to beginners as they have invaluable knowledge of the waters they are swimming in..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/14Apr2021-family.jpg","title":"McAlister family raises £3k for Marie Curie nurses  ","story":"A DRUMANESS family have helped raise over pound, for Marie Curie nurses in memory of local woman Peggy McAlister.The money was raised through a series of Easter activities including a virtual raffle and a socially distanced visit to homes in the village from the Easter bunny.Peggy, who was a well known figure in Drumaness, sadly passed away in August .

In October, firefighters fought to bring a malicious blaze under control.They were back at the plant last Saturday just before pm following reports of a fire in an industrial skip which spread to a nearby metal container.Fire crews from Downpatrick and Ballynahinch brought the blaze under control within an hour of the alarm being raised.The fire at the waste oil plant came at the end of three nights of sporadic trouble in the area, with fires started in the middle of the Killough Road which straddles the Model Farm and Flying Horse estates and missiles fired at cars.It is also understood that police on patrol in the area came across a pile of breeze blocks which were removed, fearing they would have been used as missiles to target passing cars.Cllr John Trainor mdash who was a passenger in a car targeted by petrol bombers late on Saturday night mdash has called for an end to the violence, which, he said, is being perpetrated by teenagers hellbent on causing misery for others.He believes that a partnership approach involving the local community, statutory agencies and the police is vital in getting on top of an issue which has resulted in a number of residents living in fear and others afraid to venture out at night.Just before .pm last Saturday, Cllr Trainor was approaching the Model Farm junction when a petrol bomb was hurled at the vehicle by a crowd of up to eight teenagers which included girls and boys. While the missile missed the car, it smashed on the main road and exploded.ldquoA fire had been lit on the main road and there is just no sense to this kind of activity, he declared.ldquoWhatan elderly driver had been confronted by a petrol bomb thrown at them and lost control of their vehicle  I have no doubt that last weekrsquos trouble was cleary pre-meditated.ldquoYou just donrsquot turn up at a housing area and discover petrol bombs. While what happened was clearly planned, it is not reflective of the hard working local people in the area.Cllr Trainor said there was ldquono sense to this kind of activity and questioned how the teenagers were able to get their hands on petrol bombs.He said there had been trouble at the Killough Road some years ago and that a targeted approach involving local groups and statutory agencies had made an impact.ldquoI think we need to go back to this model and there must be community buy-in. It is clear we are talking about a long term commitment as this continued trouble needs to stop. People have had enough and want to be able to live their lives free from the threat of trouble and violence, continued Cllr Trainor.ldquoWe need a strategy and action plan in tandem with an effective policing policy to deal with this issue and a pledge from partner agencies that they will make a long-term commitment. A partnership approach is vital moving forward and must include the local community.Admitting that he was not shocked nor surprised by the petrol bomb attack, Cllr Trainor said what happened could potentially have had ldquocatastrophic consequences with the behaviour witnessed over the past number of days at the Killough Road area nothing knew, insisting that it is in no way reflective of of the people who live locally.ldquoWe have a situation where people are not happy and a number are living in fear. Numerous scenarios could potentially have played out last weekend and I am thankful that they didnrsquot. The the fire in the road, the arson attack at the waste oil plant and the petrol bomb incident will be roundly condemned and rightly so. But they must not be allowed to continue, that is why a strategy to deal with the issue involving all stakeholders is vital.Cllr Trainor added: ldquoWe simply cannot have a situation where violence is prevalent in a part of Downpatrick where people are trying to get on with their lives. They do not need this. Throwing petrol bombs is not entertainment, it is criminality. Anti-social behaviour is often a symptom of other issues in peoplersquos lives which have to be tackled.Agreeing that the recent trouble is not reflective of the wider community, Cllr Oonagh Hanlon revealed that she witnessed some of the incidents including the malicious fires.She said it appeared that the blaze at the Macwaste plant was started deliberately and was ldquoextremely concerning given that the business was targeted last October.ldquoConsidering the highly flammable material stored at the Brannish Road site, it is a miracle that no one was seriously injured, she declared.ldquoCredit to our local firefighters who ensured that the fire did not spread. It is extremely frustrating that emergency services are being distracted from what could be more serious incidents and emergencies. We also had reports of petrol bombs being thrown at cars passing through the area last week.Cllr Hanlon added: ldquoIt is hugely disappointing and frustrating that this type of behaviour continues in this area. Do the perpetrators of these crimes realise the impact of their actions ldquoI would appeal to anyone with information about what happened and those involved to provide it to the authorities and ask the community to continue to report suspicious behaviour as people are fed up with the actions of a small minority.

The Prince will be missed most by his family, but he has left an indelible mark and the success of his Duke of Edinburgh award scheme is unparalleled.Terry said the torch for environmental issue which was taken up Sir David Attenborough so many years ago was one once carried by Prince Philip whose care for the such an important issue has been passed to his eldest son Prince Charles.He added: ldquoPrince Philip has left his mark on this world and there are many people from Northern Ireland who have met him over the years.ldquoThey recall a man with an infectious sense of duty and one who could also be humorous at times, using this aspect of his character to put others at ease.

He was there to say his last goodbye to the ship, that was his whole objective. He came down to see the ship and stayed for lunch. I met him in the working alley of the ship as he was escorted around the ship by an ex captain.ldquoHe was visiting ious departments and when he came to the Technical Department, we had our crew and officers lined up.

The other was the Duke of Gloucester but he was the only one of that station that I got speaking to.Mr Hanvey said that added to sharing the special day with his family, two special events to mark Remembrance Day added to the poignancy.ldquoA Lancaster bomber came over and ped poppies on the ship and once the ceremony was over a Harrier jump jet hovered along the side of the side facing inwards and did a bow to say goodbye.

Only thus can some of the worst consequences of air-attack be avoided.”House wrecked – Children under table The News Letter reported that hundreds of windows were broken in one district of the city“A small parlour house occupied by Mr S Kirkwood was wrecked by bomb, the entire front being blown out, leaving part the roof and the first floor hanging in the air. “By a sheer miracle none of the residents was seriously injured. Two young children of Mr W McIlwaine, who lived next door, were sheltering beneath a table when the bomb fell. The younger, a girl of about two and a half years, was carried by a rescuer to the first aid post for treatment. “It was found, however, that the child was little the worse for the experience. “She suffered from shock and was covered with soot and lime.” The News Letter’s report continued: “A short time later Mr Mcllwaine brought to the post the other child, who also had miraculous escape. Here again first aid was applied. Mr McIlwaine, it was noticed, was suffering from an injury to his leg, but he declined to be treated until he had ed to his wrecked home to see whether his we was safe. “It was learned later that she had escaped without injury.”The raid on Belfast on Easter Tuesday, April , , was by far the worst of the four German attacks. Some  Luftwaffe bombers attacked,  people were killed and , were injured.Indiscriminate bombing – Casualties may be heavy “Northern Ireland experienced the full fury of German frightfulness last night,” declared the News Letter. The following communique was issued the following morning by the Ministry of Public Security, Northern Ireland, and headquarters, RAF, Northern Ireland: ‘‘A heavy force of enemy bombers carried out an attack lasting several hours over area comprising practically the whole of Northern Ireland. “The intensity of the attack ied. In some areas it was vicious and indiscriminate. “Damage has been sustained by some industrial premises, but many of the bombs fell on residential property. From preliminary reports it is feared that casualties may be heavy.”Ulster ‘Takes It’ Thursday, April , The News Letter’s editorial comment from two days after the raid, as the magnitude of the damage and deaths still yet unknown, adopted a defiant tone to the Nazi raiders.“The scale of the air attacks to which Northern Ireland was subjected on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning remains a subject for guesswork. Very many machines – the Germans themselves say ‘hundreds’ – seem to have been employed, and, as was, perhaps, inevitable, Belfast was the principal objective “It was savage raid – vicious and vindictive, and carried out with great persistency, with the obvious intention of doing the maximum of damage. “Residential and shopping areas in certain parts of the city suffered severely, and the casualty list, it is feared, may prove to be a long one. “A trying ordeal has demonstrated, however, two facts of importance. The first is that Belfast can be proud of its emergency services. “Put to a supreme test at the very outset, fire-fighters and ARP men worked manfully and well, casting aside all personal considerations and sticking heroically to tasks that were always dangerous and often demanded courage to the point of recklessness. “A community which for a long time regarded them almost with indference now realises how foolish and ungenerous it was. “The other point is that the people of Northern Ireland, and not least those of its capital city, ‘can take it’. “The viciousness of the onslaught, the repeated bombing of districts entirely lacking in military objectives, evidenced a determination to break down the morale of the community. It has failed to do so.” The editorial concluded: “Northern Ireland is in this war to the finish, and will play its part even more resolutely because of this dire experience.”  \"       \"  Most PopularFarce as loyalist protest group claims credit for no one showing up to its protestPeaky Blinders Aunt Polly actress Helen McCrory dies aged Neil Lennon video - Inidual who shared clip of former Celtic manager labelled mad creepArlene Foster felt ‘humiliated’ over celebrity doctor’s ‘affair’ tweet - ‘I think the attack was meant to destabilise me at a very critical time’Chief Constable responds to critics over NI Women’s football tweetMost PopularLoyalists have been left feeling betrayed and unrepresentedBlatantly sectarian - Row erupts as DUP prevent scheduled North South Ministerial Council from going aheadLeading Orangeman: We’re still preparing for a full TwelfthNew loyalist group calls for immediate protests and threatens to campaign against DUP and UUPOrange Order challenges PSNI over ‘harassing’ bands about their current mood and plans for the summer                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\" ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-kafWEX sc-feJyhm dbjzDR\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommendedPublic NoticesFollow us          "},{"url":null,"title":"past stoicism meant belfast blitz never got attention it deserved ","story":"Unionists have been shown how they would be treated when Irish nationalists have power   New loyalist group calls for immediate protests and threatens to campaign against DUP and UUPNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensHomes and GardensCoronaviruse-PaperFarmingRecommendedPuzzlesPublic NoticesNewsOpinionPast stoicism meant Belfast Blitz never got attention it deservedNews Letter editorial of Friday April  :By EditorialFriday, th April , : am  \"       \"  News Letter editorialTo get a sense of how society has improved the way it cares for people who have suffered in conflict of violence, compare the Blitz to the Troubles.The German raids on Belfast over four nights, the worst of which was on April  and  , exactly  years ago, left more than , people deadmilitary casualties are included.Most of the dead were civilians, often meeting barely imaginable ends in firestorms.Belfast suffered the worst casualties in a single night outside London yet to this day there is no major memorial to the Blitz dead. The council has, however, approved plans for one.Anyone who was severely injured or left penniless because the main earner in a home had been killed did not in  get the sort of benefits or compensation that many victims of the Troubles got .It was a much tougher, poorer society in which people often just had to come to terms with their appalling fate.No-one would want toto such days.A problem with the stoical approach of the past is that the Blitz has never really had the attention that it deserves. It was a massive trauma inflicted on Belfast that cut across the religious ide. Our supplement today lists the dead, and makes for haunting reading — names such as William Curran aged one, Andrew Ferguson aged three, Bridget Power aged seven.What happened in  is, like the sinking of the Titanic, a tragic chapter in the long history of Belfast.We remember the dead, and can at the same time give thanks for human progress in terms of reduction of violence.The Canadian academic Steven Pinker has explained in his works how there have been long-term declines in the use of war globally over the centuries.But the fact that so many people are alive, aged in their late s or older, who remember the Belfast Blitz and the war shows that disastrous conflict happened in recent history.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMonday, April , marks the official ftieth birthday of Chapter Arts Centre in Cardf.The multi-artform venue was the first of its kind in Wales.CEO of Chapter, Andy Eagle said: ldquoChapter was originally set up by a community of artists and that remains its foundation and principal purpose. Itrsquos an eclectic and fascinating place that has, over the last fty years, evolved to be welcoming and inclusive to many dferent types of peopleChapter Arts Centre came to le thanks to the driving force of writer Mik Flood and artists Christine Kinsey and Bryan Jones.CEO Chapter Andy Eagle. Photo Kirsten McTernanDiscussions about the opening of an arts centre in Cardf started in  and were part of a vision for a space where artists could produce and present work, free from commercial pressures. Experimental work was seen as key to its identity, and the needs of artists were at its heart.The venue was formerly Canton High School, and the initial period of set up was a demanding time. The founders, and a gang of enthusiastic and dedicated volunteers, lovingly cleared, restored and adapted the building to make it fit for purpose as Walesrsquo first arts centre.The first official Board meeting was held on  April  and in July that year Chapter opened its doors with a temporary cinema, gallery and bar, and with former classrooms used as studios, workshops and offices. Chapter Fundraising gig, Pavilions in the Park. Photo courtesy of Christine KinseyToabout the history of Chapter and itrsquos early years between  and , visit: www.issuu chapter docs earlyyears_copy.Five decades on, Chapter has grown into one of the largest arts complexes in Europe, with two cinemas, two theatres, a gallery, a large number of artistsrsquo studios and creative industry offices, meeting places for the community and a cafeacute bar.Chapter in the early daysIt produces and presents the best in national and international contemporary visual art, experimental and thought-provoking performance, and challenging independent, mainstream and international films, all alongside an inclusive learning and engagement programme.     Every year, the venue welcomes , visitors to more than  film screenings,  live performances,  visual art exhibitions and  community classes, artisan fairs and events.Mr Eagle added: ldquoChapter is many dferent things to many dferent people. For some, it will be the international gallery exhibitions and the programme of independent films.\"For others, it will be the cafeacute bar and restaurant to meet friends before a Cardf City home game, or it will be for dance and theatre classes or a cup of tea before working in the community garden.\"But at its heart itrsquos a centre for contemporary art, supporting artists and creatives from Wales and beyond to produce and present work.Chapter works with practitioners at every stage in their careers, supporting and stimulating opportunities for exciting new talent as well as promoting the work of established artists.It is a springboard for the creative community of Wales with a focus on bringing the world to Wales and Wales to the world.Chapter is home to over  of Walesrsquo most dynamic creative companies and artists, including BAFTA Cymru, Printhaus, ie ie Productions, Everyman Theatre, Beryl Productions, Cardf Music School and Taking Flight Theatre. Chapter has remained open to this creative community during the pandemic.MORE NEWS:They also offer a range of spaces in support of local artists and companies for the research and development of artistic projects, including Hijinx Theatre.Like most art and entertainment venues, the last year has been one of the most dficult times for the organisation as they were forced to close their doors. MrEagle commented: ldquoClosure has had a massive impact on us. We are an arts organisation that generates almost all of its income through ticket sales, classes, hires, cafeacute bar and other activity.\"The small remaining amount comes fromArts Council of Wales and is used to support our arts and education programme. Our capacity to earn incomeliterally stopped overnight and that was profoundly scary.Support has been generated from extremely generous public donations and from a range of funders including Arts Council Wales, Welsh Government, BFI, Art Fund, Ffilm Cymru and Admiral.Since its closure, Chapter has offered an exciting Chapter from Home programme, consisting of over  virtual film screenings, online theatre productions and art exhibitions, monthly online comedy gigs presented by Welsh comedian Robin Morgan, virtual lectures with Arts Society Cardf, as well as outdoor theatre performances with Cardf-based companies including Theatr Iolo and Kitsch  Sync.Currently showing at Chapteris internationally focussed art exhibition Artes Mundi.

In the Gallery are immersive works by South African artist Dineo Seshee Bopape - objects, drawing and sound are presented in spaces with walls covered in washes of soil from Welsh sacred sites.Talking about the programme since Chapter closed, Director of Programme Hannah Firth said: ldquoWhen our doors closed in March last year we wanted to ensure that we could still talk to our audiences and the creative community that is our beating heart.\"Despite the uncertainty faced by many artists, they showed an astonishing resilience and desire to quickly adapt to other ways of working and engaging.\"Wersquove been lucky enough to be able to work with some of them to create a dynamic programme of events and activity online and outdoors, and have developed a number of key commissions to support artists including on our lightbox, in our cafeacute bar, in our gallery, around the Canton community, and online.Chapter is currently getting ready to re-open. Depending on Covid guidelines, they hope to welcome customers back outdoors sometime after Easter, and they have been working hard to improve their outdoor catering offer to keep visitors warm and cosy day and night.Although Chapter canrsquot bring everyone together for a big Birthday party as planned, they will celebrate their five decades through to next April with a series of special events, activities and online content - they particularly have some exciting plans for outdoor events this summer.Mr Eagle said: ldquoNeedless to say  is not the year we were anticipating for our th!ldquoWhile the move to digital is great in many ways, ultimately, people want to be able to enjoy themselves and meet and do things in person.

Irsquom opposed to this plan. Itrsquos a loss of open countryside yet again, and the big issue of course that wersquore concerned about in Llantwit Major is the impact on local infrastructure.ldquoWe have two surgeries in Llantwit Major: one is nearly falling down. Our leisure centre is over  years old it has never really been improved upon in that time. Our traffic is chock-a-block the roads are gridlocked at peak periods.ldquoWhorsquos going to live in these homes  Wersquore building more and more homes all the time, but there are so many homes already available.

About  per cent of the planned homes will be affordable.     Both sites would be accessed off of the Northern Access Road, also known as Fford Bro Tathan. This new road was built in  and , running from the B north of Boverton to the St Athan enterprise zone and Aston Martin factory.Planning officers responded to Cllr Johnrsquos concerns by pointing to the newly built road, as an example of new traffic infrastructure in the area and saying new residents of the proposed homes could help local shops by bringing them extra trade.A plan showing the layout of site A Picture: WYG Free to use for all LDRS partnersAn image showing the layout of the siteAnother concern was noise pollution: the eastern site is close to a firing range used by the Ministry of Defence. Councillors on the planning committee feared future residents could suffer from hearing loud gunfire. Planning officers said they could make noise complaints.David Harris, who lives in the local area, told the planning committee: ldquoThis site is located right opposite and within  metres of a live MOD firing range. This range can be used seven days a week, up to pm. Itrsquos regularly used.ldquoNo matter how much mitigation is used in the building fabric, you canrsquot reduce the exceptional noise of live gun fire when you have your windows open or when yoursquore in your garden. This fact alone makes this site totally inappropriate for residential development.Because the housing development is split into two sites, councillors voted on two separate planning applications, one for each site.The second application, for the eastern site, only narrowly passed a vote. Six councillors voted in favour of granting planning permission, and six voted against, with four abstaining. Planning officers warned refusing permission could risk a costly legal challenge.As the vote was tied, the chair of the planning committee, Cllr Jonathan Bird, used his casting vote to grant permission, effectively voting twice. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They are really daunted and concerned by the move away from this method of payment.“Some elderly folk I have assisted feel overwhelmed with the terms and conditions which they must sign up to operate a current account with a card facility and some don’t have all the identity documents required. Whilst this is routine for many who are well used to signing up for ious services, elderly people can be more reticent of paper work and what it all means.”Mr Irwin explained: “I feel there could be steps that banking organisations could take to enable this process in these specic circumstances to be slightly less burdensome on the elderly. This could be around offering greater assistance one-to-one and through simplying the process, for instancethe person has limited identication documents. There is a lot of detail contained in the benefits letters that people received and I feel it would be easy for banks to quickly very a person’s identy and reason for opening an account on this specic basis with further verication provided by the Department for Communities.“The Payment Exception Service will also operate from this summer which will help through the issuing of redeemable vouchers to those pensioners who have been unable to open a bank account. However, this will be a short term measure and thus there remains a time pressure for the creation of a bank account. I will again be raising these matters with the Minister for Communities to encourage greater co-operation with banks to ensure no one is disenfranchised or greatly inconvenienced.”Horror as bags of dead lambs found during evening stroll Read full story here--Editor’s Message:Thank you for reading this article.

Named after a Hockey legend it is famed for its coffee and freshly bakedgoods – including an extensive range of home-made doughnuts.Taking councillors through a report which recommended the application was approved, a council planning officer told members the application was before them as it had receiveda high number of objections and petitions.Prominent amongst the objectors, is Peter Pan’s Neverland children’s play centre. The play centre will be a neighbour of the new drive-through and a petition collated by it contained , signatures objecting to the proposed application.Members were told the application site is currently used as a car park and there will be “no loss of retail use should the application be approved”.Members were also advised the proposed access points to the site have been heavily revised to limit the impact of potential traffic congestion in the area.Speaking about vehicular access, Alderman Gareth Wilson said the plans showed  vehicles in the queueand noted that at ious points in Portadown a build up of traffic is possible and asked what impact this proposal would have on traffic in the area.The planning officer told the meeting, as long as the proposal can accommodate vehicles it meets the policy and noted how the access is via Sandy Row, not Meadow Lane.“The access to the site has been looked at in detail and that is why access is not onto the main arterial route – the scheme was designed with that in mind,” said the planning officer.Councillor Sam Nicholson said he knows the area very well having used the area for his banking and noted how busy it can be. He then asked the engineer to provide some detail as to how they approached this design.In response, an engineer from Clyde Shanks said it had been recognised as an issue early in the design phase and had required a series of revisions before DfI Roads were satisfied.“We had five or six consultations with DfI Roads before we reached a satisfactory outcome,” said the engineer. “In that process the drive-throughincreased and was moved to the back of the site.“At present, drive-throughsare very popular and this one will be able to take about  vehicles. To address concerns about the traffic lights, the site will be accessible without going through them as customers will be able to access it via Sandy Row.”Councillor Paul Duffy noted the drive-through lanes appear to front onto the main road, like the McDonald’ssite in the vicinity and askedthere will be anything to deter pedestrians from taking a shortcut through the drive-through.He was advised a knee high rail fence will be erected to act as a barrier preventing this.Alderman Sydney Anderson also expressed some concern about the traffic flow and stated “I just hope there has been enough vision put into this to allow the traffic to build up on the premises as it can ill afford to back up on the road.“It is a busy junction most of the time and extra vehicles are to exit out onto the Sandy Row side, is everyone quite happy these plans and the road network can sustain this impact.”The planning officer answered Alderman Anderson’s question, telling the chamber it has taken a “considerable amount of time and focus”.“At present it is an existing  car, car park,” said the planning officer.“This means  cars could potentially come and go as they please at any time of day or night and we have no control over that.”An engineer from Clyde Shanks also noted the site expects to accommodate vehiclesan hour at peak times.“That is an extra vehicle every two minutes between the two roads,” said the engineer. “And that is assuming this is new traffic coming to the area but Tim Hortons are keen to come to this location becauseof the number vehicles and people in the area already.”Councillor Peter Lavery said he was “leaning towards approval” and noted the applicant has put a “number of measures” in place to address concerns about traffic build up.“They have done everything they can to mitigateour concerns and we should be noting and welcoming that,” he said.Alderman Wilson said he held the same opinion as Cllr Lavery while Councillor Duffy said he would be minded to approve as well but felt the traffic lights in the area may need some adjustment to accommodatethe extra traffic turning into this facility.Alderman Sydney Anderson said he was “encouraged by the amount of effortto look at potential traffic problems” and proposed the application was approved.This proposal was seconded by Cllr Nicholson who praisedthe application for being “very creative on what could have been a restrictive site” and the committee voiced its approval for this proposal.The development has beeen welcomed by local MLA Jonathan Buckley, who described it as ‘another great asset for our town’.  \"       \"  Most PopularLaura Gracey, a woman of substance, has diedTim Hortons set for Portadown arrested after ‘serious assault’\" data-s-el\"\" data-s-ea\"most popular\"
