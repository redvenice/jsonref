We should never forget these companies’ empires are built upon the hard work of their employees.‘Rest assured, we will be exploring every available legal avenue to protect our members’ jobs.’Sainsbury’s confirmed the two supermarket chains are in advanced talks about a merge (Picture: PA)Joanne McGuinness, Usdaw national officer, said: ‘Our priorities will be to protect our members and ensure any deal between the retailers does not impact on their jobs or incomes.Asda is owned by the world’s largest supermarket retailer Walmart and it is not yet clear how the deal would be structured.‘Sainsbury’s confirms that it and Walmart Inc are in advanced discussions regarding a combination of the Sainsbury’s and Asda businesses. A further announcement will be made at 7am on Monday 30 April.’"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/cannabis1-e1524755276509.jpg?w=748\u0026amp;h=545\u0026amp;crop=1\" alt=\"UK \u0027could legalise cannabis in five years\u0027, experts believe\" class=\"img-align-none wp-image-7500906 size-full\" data-rewritten=\"true","title":"uk legalise cannabis five years experts believe","story":"Max Zavet speaking at a cannabis investment conference in London on April 26 (Picture: Jen Mills)The UK could legalise cannabis recreationally within five years, experts in the industry believe.It seems like a very quick turnaround to reform drug laws, but investors are already scoping out Britain as a potential new market.Dozens of company reps met at a hotel in Mayfair for a conference on Thursday, in anticipation of the UK following Canada, Australia and dozens of US states in loosening their regulations.‘We are very, very eager to get into the UK market,’ Max Zavet, founder of Canadian cannabis company Emblem, said.He believes we’ve reached a tipping point globally, and it’s only a matter of time before the government catches up.‘It will definitely be medical first,’ he told .‘Once that starts happening, people aren’t as afraid about pot anymore and the stigma reduces. You may see a recreational regime here in the next five years as well.’Max Zavet: ‘We see the UK as a huge opportunity to expand in’ (Picture: Jen Mills)He spent several days in London to make contacts in the hope of expanding his business once the laws have changed.‘It could start with export, but eventually the UK will probably want a domestic-grown product,’ he said.Emblem, which produces and sells dried flower as well as cannabis oils, is one of 14 companies who presented at the Cannabis Invest conference at the May Fair Hotel.The exclusive London hotel is not necessarily where you’d expect to find businessmen and high net worth investors discussing the THC content of ‘premium flower’.Cannabis Invest: Not your typical stoners (Picture: Jen Mills)Those attending were almost exclusively in suits and cufflinks, with only one sequinned jacket in sight.Some present admitted they had never even tried cannabis, but were there because they saw it as an exciting investment.It shows how far the drug has come in being seen as acceptable, with canapés and glass bottles of San Pellegrino offered to guests – rather than a large order of Pizza Hut.Emblem operates legally in CanadaMany of those presenting were Canadian, which makes sense as the country will make recreational use fully legal by September this year. Brits in attendance were more likely to be listening than leading the sessions.Max believes UK industry as a whole will lose out because businesses will be playing catch-up once it is made legal (although one of the largest cannabis companies in the world, GW Pharmaceuticals, is based in Britain).‘The UK is on the forefront of most industries, but I think the culture is maybe a little too conservative, and is afraid of a new substance to harm children and harm society,’ he said.‘That’s even though people are consuming it regularly anyway.’The conference at the May Fair Hotel (Picture: Jen Mills)It’s obviously simpler for cannabis-based companies to operate if the drug is legal, because investors won’t be afraid it’s an illegal operation so it will be easier to raise capital.This has put US companies at a disadvantage, even in states where it is legal, because banks are federally regulated and at a governmental level cannabis is still outlawed.The Home Office insists it has no plans to relax the laws in Britain, describing cannabis as a ‘harmful drug’.It has been linked to schizophrenia and depression, with the Royal College of Psychiatrists warning of the ‘risk of serious consequences for people, such as the development of an enduring psychotic illness, particularly in those who are genetically vulnerable.’However, despite this many are optimistic the laws will soon change.Travis Wong, who used to be an investment banker in London, also attended the conference and hopes to move into the UK market.‘In the future we would love to look into Europe and London,’ he told .‘In a lot of markets there’s a two-step process. They always start with allowing medical access, having a regulated market for patients who want THC and CBD to help with pain management.‘As soon as people start realising the world isn’t blowing up and it’s not a gateway drug and there’s not people high on cannabis all the time, the second phase is to go recreational.’‘From what I recall, the UK has a relatively high level of recreational usage.‘Public opinion will shift very quickly.‘Everyone can see it being a global shift in public opinion.’Cannabis in its raw form is not recognised in the UK as having any medicinal benefit.It is subject to strict controls, which means it cannot be prescribed or supplied to the public, and can only be used for research under a Home Office licence.Despite this, the UK is one of the largest producers and exporters of legal cannabis to other countries. GW Pharmaceuticals has a licence to grow it for medical use to create its brands Sativex and Epidiolex, used to treat MS and epilepsy.Many places around the world have legalised medical cannabis (Picture: Getty Images)A Home Office spokesman told  the government has no plans to legalise cannabis, medicinally or otherwise.They said: ‘Cannabis is a controlled Class B drug, as there is clear scientific and medical evidence that it is a harmful drug, which can damage people’s mental and physical health, as well as harming iniduals and communities. The government is ‘absolutely committed’ to reducing drug use, they added.Uruguay was the first country to fully legalise cannabis in 2013. In Canada, cannabis is expected to become legal for recreational use nationwide in August or September this year.Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Vermont, Washington and Washington DC have legalised cannabis for recreational use, and dozens of states allow it for medical use.Many other countries allow it for medical use, including Israel, Italy, Denmark and Finland.Thousands of people gathered in London’s Hyde park on April 20, AKA 420 Day (Picture: Rex)Germany, Italy and Australia have recently relaxed their laws and are seen as exciting markets within the industry.‘I think the UK is probably going to take its regulation guidance from Canada, like Australia has,’ Max said.‘Yes the the UK is late, but there could be a robust and viable domestic industry. It could be a springboard to the rest of Europe.’MORE: This bloke’s been photographing his marijuana plants for over 30 yearsMORE: More than 5,000 weed smokers flock to Hyde Park for 420"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/27/10/4B9AC19900000578-5664157-image-a-26_1524821497118.jpg","title":"Never seen pictures Meghan Markle larking set Suits","story":"    Extraordinary photographs have emerged of Meghan Markle, showing her messing around behind the scenes of US TV hit Suits          Taken by her co-star Patrick J Adams and published on his Instagram, they show the princess-in-waiting as you’ve never seen her before: slumped in a chair, wearing curlers and filing her nails           In other pictures, we see her learning her lines and lying on the ground with her legs in the air while on a break from filming      Get Meghan\u0026#39s on-screen bridal style in an Anne Barge dressClick to explore the brand!As soon as Prince Harry announced his engagement to Meghan Markle our attention here at Fashion Finder naturally turned to what Meghan will wear on the big day!

Meghan, who quit the show last November when she announced her engagement to Prince Harry, was a star of the series for seven years          The photographs - which include Meghan photobombing her co-star - were posted on Adams’s Instagram page in 2012, during the first season of Suits, before Meghan, 36, began dating Prince Harry          The pictures are a far cry from Meghan\u0027s polished appearances with Prince Harry, such as the Anzac Day Service of Commemoration and Thanksgiving at Westminster Abbey this week‘I\u0027ve been shooting photos pretty much for as long as I can remember,’ said Adams, who is expected to be a guest at the Royal wedding, ‘but never really with the impulse to share them.‘I guess in the last few years, with Instagram becoming more popular, I\u0027ve started sharing more of my stuff.’Many of the photographs show Meghan backstage, having her hair or make-up done – the one of her in curlers is captioned ‘pre-game’. One shows her hugging ‘wizard’ hair stylist Stephanie, another shows her with make-up artist Lydia Sellers, who said recently: ‘Every time I\u0027d do her makeup, she\u0027d say: ‘Can we just make sure my freckles are peeking through? I don\u0027t want a ton of foundation’.’Meghan and Adams, who played lawyer Mike Ross in the show, have become close friends since they landed their roles in Suits, socialising together after work and taking a break from filming at Georgian Bay, Ontario.They are captured on a speedboat with Meghan’s then husband, TV producer Trevor Engelson, whom she orced in 2013, and Adam’s actress wife Troian Bellisario, whom he married in 2016.          In November, after wrapping up filming for the final time,Meghan announced her engagement to Prince Harry and both she and Adams announced they would be leaving the show. Pictured: Meghan with her soon to be brother-in-law Prince William at the Anzac parade          Meghan and Adams, who played lawyer Mike Ross in the show, became close friends while appearing in Suits, socialising together after work and going on holiday togetherLast August, on Meghan’s birthday, Adams posted a photograph of himself and Markle in a clinch with the capture ‘Rachel and Ross’ but it caused such a furore that he removed it.Afterwards he told Esquire magazine: ‘I had this onslaught of people retweeting the thing, people thinking it was a recent picture, and I just thought: ‘What the hell is going on?’‘It was such an innocent moment of sentimentality that was twisted into something totally different.\u0027It made me feel like: ‘Why put myself through this?’ We’re like brother and sister, it’s not like it was lurid or anything, but it just became a story that people wanted to talk about.’Then, in November, after wrapping up filming for the final time, Meghan announced her engagement to Prince Harry and Adams quipped: ‘She said she was just going out to get some milk ...’Afterwards he paid tribute to her saying: ‘Playing Meghan\u0027s television partner for the better part of a decade uniquely qualifies me to say this: ‘Your Royal Highness, you are a lucky man and I know your long life together will be joyful, productive and hilarious. Meghan, so happy for you, friend.’          Last August, on Meghan’s birthday, Adams posted a photograph of himself and Markle in a clinch with the capture ‘Rachel and Ross’ but it caused such a furore that he removed it. Above: the pair\u0027s final scenes in Suits, aired this week          Reflecting on the success of the show, Adams said: \u0027In some ways, Meghan and I were the closest because we were the youngest people in the cast and both came in with the least experience. We grew up together over the course of the show\u0027          Paying tribute to his co-star of seven years after her engagement was announced, Adams said Prince Harry was a lucky man and wished the couple all the bestThen, this week, their final scenes were aired. ‘With Meghan, a lot went unsaid,’ Adams said. ‘Meghan has this whole crazy part of her life that’s just beginning now.‘In some ways, Meghan and I were the closest because we were the youngest people in the cast and both came in with the least experience. We grew up together over the course of the show.‘There was this natural sense that we both knew that the time had come for both of us. \u0027It went unspoken and we just enjoyed the hell out of the last few episodes that we got to shoot. \u0027We both knew that we wouldn’t be coming back. It made every one of our scenes that much more special.‘We had a great time. We could laugh through it. \u0027Even the things that might have frustrated us about the show, they became things that we could have a good laugh about and compare notes on just how crazy this thing had become.’          Adams made a quip online when her engagement to Prince Harry was announced.

He tweeted this around 9.30am PST  West was spotted walking out of his Calabasas studio with a smoothie in one hand and his cell phone in the otherChance, whose father is a Democratic operative in Chicago who worked for future president Barack Obama, also shared a lengthy statement explaining he only wanted to support West, whom he called such a mentor that he felt like family.\u0027Anyone who knows me knows how passionate I am about my city and my loved ones,\u0027 began Chance. \u0027Kanye West in just a mentor or big brother to me. He\u0027s my family. No matter how much I may disagree with him, it\u0027s hard to watch people talk about someone I love-- even if they were justified in doing so. I didn\u0027t speak up because I agreed with what Kanye had to say or cause I fuck with Trump, I did it because I wanted to help my friend and cause I felt like I was being used to attack him.\u0027\u0027I\u0027d never support anyone who has made a career out of hatred, racism and discrimination,\u0027 Chance tweeted in reference to Trump.Chance said his comments were ill-timed but that Chicago has had \u0027generations of Democratic officials with no investment or regard for black schools, neighborhood(s) or black lives.\u0027          Several fans have tweeted that West may be experiencing a mental breakdown, but Chance cleared the air on that assumption as well          That tweet was followed by another that read: \u0027Next President gon be independent\u0027          Kanye West fans and supporters have been left ided after he traded adoring tweets with President Donald Trump, but Chance the Rapper has come to his defense          West and Chance the Rapper at the Magnificent Coloring Day Festival at Comiskey Park in Chicago in 2016\u0027We have to talk honestly about what is happening and has been happening in this country and we have to challenge those who are responsible, as well as those who are giving them a pass,\u0027 said Chance, whose charity last year pledged $2.2 million for arts programs in Chicago public schools.West met Trump in 2016 after the rapper cut short a tour following a breakdown. But West has said little about why he admires the real estate tycoon, who came to political prominence promoting unfounded conspiracy theories about Obama\u0027s place of birth.West tweeted on Friday: \u0027I haven\u0027t done enough research on conservatives to call myself or be called one.

But Kardashian later took to her own Twitter to defend her husband, tweeting around 12.30pm PST that her husband was \u0027years ahead of his time\u0027          Less than an hour later at 10.30 PST, West tweeted that his wife Kim Kardashian had called him about the Trump tweet          Kardashian (pictured with West in a recent family photo) was a vocal supporter of Clinton during the 2016 presidential election campaign Later on Wednesday evening, West turned his attention to former president Barack Obama, tweeting: \u0027Obama was in office for eight years and nothing in Chicago changed.\u0027 However, he declared his respect for Hillary Clinton, writing \u0027I love Hillary too\u0027.Kanye then retweeted a post in which President Trump was expressing his excitement about meeting Apple CEO Tim Cook with the caption: \u0027Can\u0027t wait to meet\u0027.Next he posted a photo of Trump and Cook speaking together and said \u0027caption this photo\u0027.  Seconds later he wrote: \u00272 of my favorite people\u0027 before retweeting Trump\u0027s \u0027MAGA\u0027 tweet again. After that he posted messages which had apparently been sent by popular New York radio host Ebro Darden that seemed to discuss the rapper\u0027s support for Trump.          Trump later retweeted the message on his page and wrote: \u0027Thank you Kanye, very cool!\u0027           The president then tweeted the photo of the hat with \u0027MAGA!\u0027          West even tweeted a picture of himself in a Make America Great Again hat (pictured here with music mogul Lyor Cohen in center and an unidentified man)          Around 12.30pm PST West posted a picture of his MAGA hat to show that it had been signed by Trump himself          Chance\u0027s tweet also caught the attention of the president\u0027s son, Donald Trump Jr, who retweeted it           At 1pm PST he tweeted a screen grab of Trump\u0027s retweet - posted half an hour earlier - which he had seen from mediatkd, a Kanye West Twitter fan page\u0027And in a few years when someone else says the same exact thing but they aren\u0027t labeled the way he is and you will all praise them!

And they were wealthy enough to employ six servants, socialise with the great and good of Leeds, and involve themselves in the politics of the day.

Together, the tentacles of their influence reached across the city.But the family was also struck by tragedy.Arthur’s wife Harriot, who was a cousin of Beatrix Potter’s mother Helen, died in childbirth in 1888, at the age of 35, before her famous cousin published her first children’s book The Tale of Peter Rabbit, leaving her husband a widower with three children Arthur, two, Elinor, one, and baby Elizabeth.

Within 11 months he was dead. A year later his father Arthur succumbed to grief.It was Hugo Lupton, son of Arthur’s younger brother Hugh and cousin of Kate’s great-grandmother Olive, who was responsible for linking the Luptons to Arthur Ransome.An old Wellingtonian and Trinity College alumnus, who won a Military Cross for his service in France, he married the author’s sister Joyce in 1920 and had four children Francis, in 1921, Arthur, in 1924, Cecily, in 1927, and Geoffrey, in 1930, ensuring the name Arthur went down through the generations.

Her paternal grandfather and uncle were both known as Charlie, although they were both christened Stephen Charles.The elder Charlie Goldsmith – Kate’s great-grandfather – was born at home in Acton, Middlesex, in 1886, and brought up in Southall. When he left home he lived in Uxbridge, where he worked as a mechanic and met his future wife Edith.A tiny woman, under 5 ft tall and weighing 7 stone, she was disfigured by a huge scar on her torso, which she had got during a narrow escape from death when she was a toddler.‘Grandad used to light his cigar in his big oil stove in the hall of the big house where they lived,’ his daughter Alice Tomlinson, the only one of his children still alive at 106 told me.‘He would roll a piece of paper up and put it in the stove and light his cigar. of course, when he went out, my mum copied. She had a go doing the same thing and nearly burned herself to death.’Charlie and Edith got married at Uxbridge Register office in 1909. She was four months pregnant with their eldest child, whom they named after his father.When Charlie Jnr was five years old, his father signed up, serving in France with the Royal Fusiliers, initially in the trenches and afterwards in the cookhouse. He was one of Kitchener’s ‘shilling men’.Luckily, he survived the war but returned home with emphysema. The father-of-six died in 1938, when his oldest son Charlie was 28 years old, and his youngest son, Kate’s grandfather Ronald was just six years old. His widow Edith was forced to move into a condemned flat and go to work at the local factory.Less than a century later, their great-granddaughter is living in Kensington Palace.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/27/20/4B77441D00000578-0-image-m-21_1524856582755.jpg","title":"Is royal baby look like","story":"    How a forensic artist predicted Prince Louis of Cambridge will look in years to comeThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have finally revealed the name of their newborn son, and this is how he could look in years to come.A forensic artist, who is based in Washington D.C, studied recent photographs of Prince William, Kate and their two eldest children.Joe Mullins then put together an image of what he predicts Prince Louis will look like in the future.According to Mr Mullins\u0027 predictions the youngster will have blue eyes, dark blonde hair and full cheeks.He has previously released images of what he predicted Prince George and Princess Charlotte would look like as they grew up.At the time Mr Mullins\u0027 pictures suggested that the children would both have dark hair and blue eyes.  Royalists and bookmakers alike have waited patiently since Monday to find out the name of the new arrival and fifth in line to the throne.     Joe Mullins has previously released images of what he predicted Prince George and Princess Charlotte would look like as they grew upThe name serves as a poignant tribute to Prince Charles\u0027 beloved great-uncle, mentor and \u0027honorary grandfather\u0027, Lord Mountbatten, who was killed in 1979 when the IRA placed a bomb in his fishing boat.   More than 100,000 bets were placed across the UK betting industry on the baby name, with both Albert and Arthur leading the way as the bookmakers\u0027 favourite.Legoland to give free entry to anyone called Louis after...Share this articleBut William and Kate have plumped for a moniker used for centuries across the Channel by the French, who have had 18 kings called Louis.    Following the baby\u0027s arrival, Prince Harry shifts down the line of succession to sixth place. The Duke of York, who was born second in line, has moved to seventh and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie to eighth and ninth.             According to Mr Mullins\u0027 predictions the youngster will have blue eyes, dark blonde hair and full cheeksAndrew falling out of the top six means he will no longer have to ask the Queen for permission to marry - unlike Charles, William, George, Charlotte and Harry.The first six people in the line of succession must have the Queen\u0027s consent before they can marry on May 19, as set out by the Succession to the Crown Act 2013.The act\u0027s introduction also saw sex removed as a determining factor in the line of succession.It has also been claimed that the royal baby has been born a commoner.Royal historian Marlene Koenig told Town and Country: \u0027It sounds complicated, but in the UK, the only people who are not commoners are the Sovereign and peers of the realm, Duke, Marquess, Earl, Viscount, and Baron.\u0027  It was always thought that William and Kate would go on to have three children.Kate is one of three and had a happy home life with her sister, Pippa Matthews, and brother, James Middleton, and is close to both of her siblings.But William may need to adjust to caring for a newborn once again.Kate joked in the months leading up to her due date that her husband was \u0027in denial\u0027 about having a third.By having more than two children, William and Kate are following in the footsteps of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, who went on to have four children - although there was a gap of 10 years between their second child, Anne, and third, Andrew. Is this what royal baby could look like?

And we can show younger generations that owning a home is a reality, not a distant prospect in 21st-century Britain.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/28/22/4BA8BE0800000578-0-image-m-12_1524950496984.jpg","title":"James Dean SAVED paramedics brace broken neck says TV documentary","story":"    Rising star: James Dean was just 24 when he was killed in a high-speed car crash Hollywood icon James Dean might have survived if paramedics had used a neck brace following the high-speed crash that ultimately claimed the 24-year-old\u0027s life.Forensic pathologist Dr Michael Hunter came to the shock conclusion after reviewing official documents relating to the death of the Rebel Without A Cause actor.The Porsche 550 Spyder driven by Dean slammed into a Ford coupe near Cholame, California, while he was on his way to a sports rally on September 30, 1955. Dean - who only starred in three films and was the first actor to receive a posthumous Oscar nomination for Best Actor - was pronounced dead on arrival at Paso Robles Hospital, while his passenger, German car engineer Rolf Wutherich, survived with a double fractured jaw and serious hip and leg injuries.  Dr Hunter, one of America\u0027s leading forensic experts, believes Dean was unconscious, but still breathing following the accident.Family and friends of crypto-currency billionaire Matthew...Emotional Bindi Irwin tears up as her late father Steve \u0027The...\u0027My heart\u0027s going to explode\u0027: Darts legend Eric Bristow...Share this articleHis chances of surviving were however greatly decreased by the actions of those trying to save him in the aftermath.Dean\u0027s broken neck was not placed in a brace and he may have been further injured when the ambulance he was travelling in collided with another vehicle as it raced to the hospital.Dr Hunter\u0027s claims are made in a new documentary, Autopsy: The Last Hours Of James Dean, which airs tonight on the Reelz network, in the US. The programme will broadcast in the UK later this year.An official inquest into his death concluded that Dean had been speeding and died from a broken neck. He also sustained a broken upper and low jaw, broken arms and internal injuries.

His father left farming to become a dental technician, and  the family subsequently moved to Santa Monica, California.When Dean was just nine-years-old, his mother died of cancer. Unable to look after his son alone, his father sent him to live with his aunt and uncle on a farm in Fairmount, Indiana, where he was raised in a Quaker background.

He dropped out in January 1951 to pursue an acting career full-time and moved to New York City.Three years later, he caught the attention of director Elia Kazan, while portraying a gay houseboy in the play, The Immoralist.   With John Steinbeck’s approval, Kazan cast Dean in a screen adaptation of Steinbeck’s novel, East of Eden, launching him into stardom. A lover of speed, he reportedly used part of his advance for East of Eden to buy a red convertible and a motorcycle. He later purchased a white Porsche Super Speedster, which he used to compete in road races.The contract for his next film, Giant, banned him from racing, but upon finishing the film, he traded in the Speedster for the more powerful Porsche 550 Spyder, which he nicknamed \u0027Little Bastard\u0027.           Giant, which starred Dean alongside Elizabeth Taylor, was the young actor\u0027s second filmOn the very same day as his fatal crash, a police officer fined Dean for going 65 mph in a 55 mph zone. Just two hours later, the rising star was dead. Rebel Without A Cause was released a month after Dean\u0027s death.  Dean was the first ever actor to receive a posthumous Academy Award nomination for Best Actor, for his role in East Of Eden in 1955.The following year he received a second posthumous Academy Award nomination for Giant.He is buried in Fairmount, Indiana, near to his uncle\u0027s farm where he grew up.

One of them, Jonas Bendiksen, a Norwegian photographer, has won international awards for his pictures of people just about as far away from home as can be – from isolated communities in newly independent states of the former Soviet Union to a book of photographs of urban slums around the world.Turning his camera toward the intimate, Bendiksen used the opportunity to track the arrival of his new baby daughter, Billie, through his wife Anna’s pregnancy to the birth. In publishing the pictures in Magnum’s book Bendiksen, who has a photojournalist’s distrust of the familiar, is apologetic about them. “These are some of the most important pictures I’ll ever take,” he notes. “But not because they are necessarily very interesting for others to see.” You have the sense he needn’t have worried.The picture on this page was the last of the home photographs Bendiksen took, showing Billie adrift on a table top amid the familiar plastic detritus of a children’s party. The deep infant sleep carries with it not only an ever-present trace of parental anxiety – what if Billie should roll? – but also an edge of lovely private comedy: what kind of world, of half-drunk dregs and abandoned shades and empty chairs has this child fallen into? In this week when baby photographs have been front-page news, it also goes to prove what newspaper picture editors have long known – that no other subject moves so effortlessly from the particular to the universal.Home, a collaboration between Fujifilm and Magnum Photos, runs from 18-27 May 2018 at the Vinyl Factory, London W1.

I check my watch: it’s five to two. “It’s not going to work today,” he sighs. “But this isn’t really work, this is just blah blah blah, it’s easy. The hard thing is writing things in the studio and thinking of stuff that’s interesting.”An afternoon nap might sound indulgent, but it is hard to fault 49-year-old Shrigley’s work ethic. An excellent new book is imminent: Fully Coherent Plan for a New and Better Society features 254 new illustrations, all drawn in his distinctive thick black pen on stark white paper, the naivety of the image offset by the scabrous, surreal or darkly comic text. He’s also the guest director of the 2018 Brighton festival (he moved to Brighton three years ago with his wife, Kim, and miniature schnauzer Inka, after 27 years in Glasgow). Shrigley has been involved in selecting performers for the festival – which features everything from art to comedy to music to a lot that is indescribable – and will be making several appearances himself.To that end, below us, in a large room that still has the stained-glass windows and pulpit from its days as a church, the finishing touches are being applied to Shrigley’s installation Life Model II. The work, which revisits a piece he made when he was nominated for the Turner prize in 2013, is an imposing 9ft nude woman with a severe fringe and long eyelashes that blink every so often. Surrounding the model are easels, paper and drawing materials, and visitors are invited to make a “life” drawing. These will then be tacked to the gallery walls and, in Shrigley’s mind, become artwork just as interesting as his original sculpture, if not more so.The show hasn’t yet opened when we meet, so on the walls are some examples from the last time Life Model II was shown, in Vienna, which will act as a “giddy-up” to the people of Brighton. “So they are drawings by Austrians,” says Shrigley, as though this fact might explain a lot.Life Model II is a just part of Shrigley’s contribution to the festival. What’s really disrupting his sleep right now is a new work called Problem in Brighton, which is billed as “an alt-rock pantomime” starring Pauline Knowles and Gavin Mitchell. In some ways it’s a companion piece to Shrigley’s 2011 “opera”, Pass the Spoon, but the truth is that even the artist is unsure what it will look and sound like.“I’ve always wanted to direct a performance on stage,” says Shrigley. “I did the opera thing a few years ago, but I didn’t direct that, I just wrote the words. But the word ‘pantomime’ suggests, ‘oh well, it’s a pantomime, it’s like a rubbish, funny play for children’. Then you say it’s ‘alt-rock’… I didn’t say ‘avant-garde’, because that’s pretentious. Basically I’ve set the bar really low, so I can do whatever I like and make a cacophonous noise.”Doing something totally different clearly appeals to Shrigley. Alongside his best-known work – the books and merch his 2012 solo show, Brain Activity, at London’s Hayward gallery his huge bronze thumb, titled Really Good, which until last month sat on the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square – he is also drawn to more esoteric commissions. In 2015, he designed a new mascot for the Scottish football club Partick Thistle he’s called Kingsley and looks like a furious sun. He’s made music videos for Blur and Bonnie Prince Billy, and hosted pop-up tattoo stations, at which he draws directly on to people’s bodies and, if they like the result, they can have it inked permanently.Now, for the Observer, Shrigley is submitting himself to interrogation by our readers. At 6ft 5in, he’s not hard to spot – does he generally have pleasant interactions with the public? “They give me the fear, if I’m honest,” says Shrigley. “In Glasgow it used to be, ‘You’re that guy, aren’t ye?’ And I’d be like, ‘Aye, I am.’ Then he’d say, ‘I thought you were, right, I think you’re that guy. All the best to ye.’”Shrigley laughs, “The thing is, who was he talking about? Was he talking about me? We’ll never know.”Hans-Ulrich Obrist, artistic director of the Serpentine Galleries Don’t listen to people like me. Or Hans-Ulrich. There’s that famous statement: every generation invents rock’n’roll, or whatever it is, for itself. And every generation invents its art anew. So, don’t find excuses not to do it. I’m sure a lot of young people have more excuses than I did when I was in my early 20s: I was lucky, there were no fees to pay then. But yeah, if you want to do it, get on with it.Yinka Shonibare, artistTommy Cooper was funny. The thing about Tommy Cooper is that he walked on to the stage and people laughed. That’s magic, isn’t it? If you can just look at people and they start laughing. I’m not really a nostalgic person, but when I watch things from the 1970s, when I was a little kid, The Two Ronnies and Dad’s Army are still funny. I couldn’t really say that about a lot of other things that have happened in the interim.I like standup, but I don’t go to it often. When it’s good, you always think: “Why don’t I do this more often?” Just laughing for a whole hour, it’s so therapeutic. But then you see something that isn’t that funny and you’re like, “Shall we go to the bar?” and you realise why you don’t do it so often. It’s very subjective as well. My wife and I went to see Stewart Lee and then we went to see an American guy whose name I can’t remember. She really liked the American guy and didn’t like Stewart Lee. And I was like: “How can you not like Stewart Lee?” And she said, “I think it’s a man thing. He’s just so bloody clever.” And that’s a criticism. That’s part of the reason I like him: because he is so bloody clever. Anyway, subjective, innit?Jess Kidd, authorRight, a bank holiday weekend – because it’s bound to be raining, isn’t it? So you’re indoors with this bloody ghost. I’m actually reading Jess Kidd’s book at the moment, which is all about ghosts. Anyway, who would it be? It would have to be Duchamp, because he could perhaps teach me to play chess – he was one of the best chess players in France. People have taught me to play chess before but it’s never stuck, so I’d like to go over it with him. And I could sit there in the park playing and tell people: “Well, Marcel Duchamp taught me to play…” Actually no: “The ghost of Marcel Duchamp taught me to play chess.” That would be cool.It would probably take longer than a weekend. Obviously there’d be a lot of questions I’d want to ask him: Duchamp is a kind of god, or a touchstone. And if Duchamp wasn’t available then Andy Warhol, but Duchamp would be my first choice.Sir Nicholas Serota, chair of Arts Council EnglandWell, I live in Brighton, so that’s really handy. And part of the reason they need a guest director as a marketing figurehead is because it is so disparate in terms of the things that are on. It’s very difficult to pull them all together into one unified blurb, other than: it’s here and there’s lots of really good things on. My programming was basically sending a list by email to somebody and, fortunately for me, a lot of the things came to be. So Deerhoof and Ezra Furman and Bridget Christie among others: Deerhoof are one of my favourite bands, Ezra Furman I’ve never seen before and Bridget Christie, I missed her show as well. So it was a way of filling in the gaps and not having to go to London and get the vomit express back at the end of the evening.Emma Jane Unsworth, authorWho! Who! Who! I let the dog out at 6am, and I don’t know why she wakes up at 6am but it’s always me that has to take her out. And it’s only when we’re in Brighton. We spend part of our time in Devon and she gets up at 8am when we’re in Devon. I think it’s the seagulls that wake her up here. Anyway, I’ve taken to wearing shorts in bed, so I don’t have to take my pyjamas off, I just go out in shorts and a coat and wander like a zombie around the block. She does what she has to do and then we go back to bed for another two hours.Evie Wyld, novelistI don’t like frogs and toads very much. They look, particularly toads, like dirt when you see them from a distance. I saw one on the doorstep the other day and I thought it was dog shit. I wish them well, toads, I wish them long, healthy lives, but if you said, “Would you like me to put a toad on your bare chest right now?” I’d say: “Absolutely not.”Ezra Furman, musicianI think they’re both. For some people they can be quite annoying, if you look at them too much. I’m aware of that. As an artist, you have to do what you’ve gotta do. There is some cathartic thing about making art: if you don’t get it out, it’ll fester inside and damage you somehow. I do feel a bit like that. So it’s healthy for me to make art whether it’s healthy for other people to look at it, I don’t know.Amanda Palmer, singerI guess so, but sometimes I misunderstand lyrics. There’s a famous old blues song called He’s a Mighty Good Leader Beck did a version of it on one of his early albums. I really liked it, but I always thought the lyric was, “Is the monarch a leader?” and it was only fairly recently that the Beck album was reissued on vinyl and I realised, Oooh… yeah: is the monarch a leader? And a picture of the royal family: are they a leader? Or is it just a token office?I’ve made a couple of pop promos in my life. I’d do it for Beck but not for anybody else. Now Mark E Smith is dead, Beck is probably the only one I’d do it for. But not this year, I’m too busy.Matt Haig, novelist (who lives in Brighton)I love it. It was hard to leave Glasgow and Brighton was probably the one other place I’ve always felt really at home. It’s my kind of people in Brighton, it’s by the sea, and the weather’s better than Glasgow.But it depends where you live as well. I’ve never actually met Matt but we have a friend in common, so doubtless I will soon. I think he lives in Hove, while I’m in Kemptown. The bad thing about Kemptown is that it’s full of dogshit and lunatics. And I suspect Hove isn’t. I’m not talking about homeless people, I’m just talking about genuinely mad people, barking at the moon, who live in houses and who are mad. To wit, the day after we moved in, I’d parked the car on the pavement and I was unloading it. Some guy was walking down the street and he was wearing a pair of shorts, flip-flops, a cowboy hat and a pair of sunglasses, and he had “Get High” written in lipstick on his chest. This was about 8.30am and he was smoking a joint and he said: “You can’t park like that, mate. I’m just telling ya.”Now, I like that, but I’d like to be like the people who come from a different part of town just to visit, to look at Mr Get High.Ed Vaizey, Conservative MP for WantageOh yeah, I know your mum. My mum lives with maybe two and they are both ceramic pieces, because she threw away all the rest. She and my dad between them discarded all of my work, probably shortly after I left home for art school. I’d say they’ve come to appreciate it a bit more over time. There was a watershed moment where there was some documentary about me on TV and overnight they went from knowing nothing to everything about what I did for a living. That’s not to say my parents haven’t been supportive, because they have they just didn’t really have any interest in art.Also, to be fair to them, I’m slightly less bothered about them throwing the artwork away than I was about them throwing away all my football programmes. I had the programme to the 1979 European Cup final, Nottingham Forest’s moment of glory. Don’t know where that is. Gone.Peter Jenkinson, co-founder of Culture+ConflictWell, it can’t always tell you which artworks are mine and which works just look like mine, for example. On Google image search there are works that are erroneously attributed to me, and then people invite you to participate in something that they’re curating and they say: “We love your work! Could we reproduce this image on the brochure?” And it’s not one of your images. Then you have to say: “You don’t like my work as much as you think you do.” So Google image search – problem.Dan Guthrie, Stroud, GloucsThe difficult thing about answering any question about what is or isn’t art is that even before you’ve finished making the statement as to what art is or what art isn’t, you think of an exception, a contradiction to what you’ve just said. You realise you’re wrong even before you’ve finished saying it.But, just for the sake of argument: stuff that’s in hotel rooms. Authorless, inkjet prints on canvas, you have to say that isn’t really art. It just looks like art but it isn’t art.Ally Ferguson, GlasgowIt’s very difficult to say. When I was looking for somewhere to study, I found Glasgow really exciting and different and mysterious. It was everything the suburbs of Leicester, where I grew up, weren’t. It probably took about 12 years for that to wear off and then suddenly I realised I was sort of a Glaswegian. This was my home. I can’t really remember my childhood in the East Midlands that well, but Glasgow is still very vivid. I lived there from when I was 19 to when I was 47 – teenage to middle age – and it was only three years ago that I left – it’s the biggest part of my life.Emma Richardson, BedfordGlad you enjoyed it. I guess when you make something that you invite somebody to draw, it’s going to look like what you’ve made. But their drawings can also be a critique of the work, perhaps, and it’s an acknowledgement that everybody sees an artwork differently – on a metaphorical level as well as a literal level. What I like about it is that it’s a nice inclusive work. I tend to hate all the big sculptures I’ve made after a while. But I like this one because I don’t look at it any more, I look at the people’s drawings, so it’s like going to a different exhibition every time. I just ignore the big person.Matt Wilson, MadridLeighton BuzzardYeah, the most difficult thing is to know whether it’s any good. That tends to change depending on what mood you’re in. Knowing whether it’s finished? Well, with a drawing, it has to be because all of the paper is covered. Then it’s definitely finished.William Tallan, AyrshireNo. We are not getting relegated, first of all. At the time of writing, we’ve got to play Ross County and we’ve got to play Hamilton. Win both of those games, we could feasibly be out of the shit we’re in. So first of all let’s think positive. Second of all, no. I’m not going to update Kingsley. Kingsley will be as he is and he will be there next season if we have to achieve promotion again.Selma Montford , honorary secretary of the Brighton Society 1973-2016I don’t think it’s clever, for the record. And it’s my handwriting, right, so what you’re objecting to is my handwriting. It’s like you’re basically objecting to me and there’s nothing I can do about that. I accept that. That’s why I don’t correspond by social media. It’s transmit only, I’m afraid, with social media. Because otherwise you’re just opening yourself – it’s a conduit to everyone in the world, some of whom are going to be really nasty to you.Sion Williams, Ruthin, north WalesYes, I do have a Moleskine notebook, as you might imagine, as every other note-taker does. I was in Glasgow one day, before we left, in the Botanic Gardens near where we lived, and I was making a little drawing, sitting on a bench. I overheard two guys walking past and they went: “Police.” How far from the truth can you be?Stefano Turato, EdinburghSelf-delusion probably. I’ve come to realise that self-delusion is quite important if you want to be an artist: “Oh, that doesn’t tally with my view of myself” – just ignore it. That’s the way my brain works. If you want to do something, you’ve got to ignore things that are unhelpful and that’s what I do.Mike Abbott, Limoges, FranceIt is my finger, yes. I think it’s my left hand because I’ve got a wonky nail on my left hand where my school friends trod on my finger when I was 10. Does it reference Lord Kitchener? In a sense the image functions in the same way as that famous recruitment poster but it isn’t a direct reference to that image.I don’t really make photographs any more – I stopped after the changeover to digital. Though that might be a digital picture actually, but I mostly stopped making photographic art in the early 2000s. I just stopped being interested in physical paper photographs. You start taking pictures on your phone and now there’s Instagram and that somehow seems to be enough: to make digital images and stick them on there.Luke, CopenhagenYeah, it’s a bad idea it’s been done. We’ve all got to be unique. Get “Finger” tattooed on your toe, that’s my advice.

The new grocer would ring up nearly £1 in every £3 spent on groceries on the UK high street.Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said the proposed merger could create “even more concentrated local monopolies” and challenged Andrew Tyrie, the incoming boss of the Competition and Markets Authority regulator, to reverse a history of “spineless” inquiries by conducting a robust investigation.“This is an early test for Andrew Tyrie and an important one,” Cable said. “The CMA really needs to show some teeth after previously being soft in its remedies in the audit, banking and energy sectors.”Last year the CMA waved through Tesco’s £3.7bn takeover of cash-and-carry group Booker despite rivals warning it could drive them out of businessAndrew Simms, co-director of the New Weather Institute thinktank and the author of Tescopoly, said: “This is profoundly not in the public interest. It’s going to have negative consequences for consumers and all the along the grocery supply chain.”Sainsbury’s will publish a statement fleshing out the terms of the agreement on Monday morning at 7am. The shares-based deal is expected to create a combined company worth £15bn including debt, led by current Sainsbury’s boss Mike Coupe. It is envisaged that his opposite number at Asda, Roger Burnley, will report to Coupe.The proposed new retail giant will have 2,800 stores and annual sales of more than £50bn. The plan is to retain both retail brands because they have different heartlands and attract different sorts of shoppers.One senior industry source told the  that Walmart had been trying to sell the struggling Asda chain for some time. The deal brokered with Sainsbury was, he said, evidence the US retail giant was “flying the white flag” after failing to conquer the UK market during the near two decades it has owned the Leeds-based grocer.Talks between the two businesses have been going on for more than a year, with the deal based on pooling their buying power to offer lower prices at the checkout – rather than closing stores or cutting jobs. The Qatar Investment Authority, the sovereign wealth fund that is currently Sainsbury’s biggest shareholder, is said to be supportive of the deal.It is thought the CMA has already been in advanced discussions with Sainsbury’s and Asda about plans for a merger, as the regulator’s guidance states that “businesses are strongly encouraged to approach the CMA to discuss their merger ... on a confidential basis” ahead of formally notifying the regulator."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7ed0ba082d4818674a64c7380fa356d028a5d9a/0_21_968_581/master/968.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8647bbb3783c307cad9daeaca1b61fea","title":"saudi aramco appoints first woman to board","story":"World’s most profitable company recruits US oil executive Lynn Laverty Elsenhans in milestone move for Saudi ArabiaSaudi Aramco, the world’s most profitable company, has appointed a woman to its board, in a milestone move for Saudi Arabia, where only one-fifth of women work and there are very few female executives.The oil company, which made profits of $33.8bn (£25bn) in the first half of 2017 – $5bn more than second-placed Apple – said on Sunday it had recruited the American oil executive Lynn Laverty Elsenhans to its 11-member board.The appointment of Elsenhans, a former chief executive and chair of US oil refiner Sunoco, comes as the Saudi Arabian government prepares to float Saudi Aramco later this year or early in 2019. The initial public offering, which could take place in London, New York or Hong Kong, will be the world’s largest. Last year, the Saudi stock exchange appointed Sarah al-Suhaimi as its first female chair. She was the first woman to chair a major government financial institution in the kingdom. Elsenhans was named by Forbes magazine as one of the world’s most powerful women in 2008. Prior to her role at Sunoco, Elsenhans was a senior executive at Royal Dutch Shell, where she worked for more than 28 years. She also sits on the board of GlaxoSmithKline.Also joining Aramco’s board are the Saudi Arabian minister of finance, Mohammed al-Jadaan the economy minister, Mohammed al-Tuwaijri Peter Cella, the former president and chief executive of Chevron Phillips Chemicals and Andrew Liveris, the chief executive of the Dow Chemical Company.The five new members of Aramco’s board will join six returning members, including the Saudi energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, who is also Aramco’s chairman, and Amin Nasser, Aramco’s chief executive.

I have never lived in social housing. Even during my childhood, my parents turned to our wider family to support us during tough times. Social housing, meanwhile, was for people who had hit rock bottom and had nowhere to turn for help.Growing up, I was fortunate enough to seize the opportunities provided by social mobility. I was lucky that, as a young lawyer in Yorkshire, I was able to buy my first home – for around twice my salary. Yes, interest rates were high 25 years ago and I still had to work hard, but it didn’t occur to me that I wouldn’t be able to buy my own home.Now I meet young solicitors who, even with a promising career, know the prospect of owning their own home seems impossible. I used to assume that the market would always provide for people who worked hard, that any kinks in the housing market would iron themselves out in the end. Of course, a safety net would always be necessary for some, yet for the majority hard work would pay off and social housing would be as irrelevant as it had been to me. Housing would be a private matter, not a government concern.Now, this basic social contract is broken. Socially mobile young people find that working hard isn’t enough unless they have help from the bank of mum and dad. And that safety net for people at the bottom? It’s looking ever more stretched as more and more people need help.It’s clear that the housing market is fundamentally broken. Tweaks by successive governments have not rectified this and even the current Conservative government has published a white paper on the “broken housing market”. That’s because the effects are being felt widely, from the growing numbers of people being made homeless, to young people stuck in expensive and insecure private rents, despairing of ever finding a way out.Politicians cannot look young people in the eyes and honestly tell them that everything will be OK if they just work hard. Our broken housing market has become a major barrier to social mobility.This is an intolerable situation and demands politicians of all hues respond. Shelter’s commission will consider the role in which social housing, and government more generally, should provide an alternative.I start this process with a genuinely open mind. I admit that I have been innately sceptical of large-scale social housing. I’ve always seen it as a safety net, but a worsening housing crisis forces us to ask whether that safety net needs to be stretched far wider. Or, with the market no longer providing a housing ladder, does a wider group of people need to use social housing as a stepping stone?Shelter has embarked on a large consultation and fact-finding exercise, which will give me and my fellow commissioners the evidence we need to answer these questions. It’s a privilege to have the opportunity to debate this alongside 15 smart people from a range of backgrounds and political affiliations. We have met once and it’s impossible to guess what we will conclude, but what’s clear and exciting is a shared determination to set out a vision for social housing that everyone can support.• Sayeeda Warsi is a lawyer and a member of the House of Lords"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bd82a38dab76df735aa7854864378a3f69c302b/68_0_3433_2061/master/3433.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7dcb8fbf4b70bbfc18d99e1322b6e8e","title":"guardian redesign tabloid readers response paul chadwick","story":"In the three months since the  redesigned and reshaped to tabloid size, readers have sent about 2,400 pieces of feedback. Broadly, the response has been positive. Most readers accepted the change as partly a necessary cost-saving measure in the face of difficult market conditions for newspapers. Expressions of loyalty towards the  were a tonic. “Don’t worry, dedicated supporters will keep your GREAT PAPER going,” wrote a devotee.At the beginning, 15 January, reflex responses – pro and con – had comparable intensity. But they soon gave way to a flow of thoughtful and detailed emails and letters. Some who welcomed the smaller size also focused on how the redesign had perhaps moved, or for space reasons dropped, aspects of the paper which they enjoyed. Specific puzzles or weather details or listings were missed, but the overall response to the layout and pacing of the paper was approving. Some early resisters warmed to the changes, others said they had adapted.I put the main themes of readers’ responses to the designers and to the editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner. She is open to considering changes, within constraints of space and cost.Wrote one reader: “The main body of your excellent newspaper in my hands has developed migratory tendencies.” Readers commented on how they disassemble the paper and share parts of it for simultaneous reading among members of their household, or take only one section with them on the bus or train.The habits of many are matched by the stapled G2 and the well-received Journal section that can be removed whole from the centre of the main paper. Some lament that sport is no longer separate. A frequent request was for the main paper to be stapled, but the production process and the deadlines of the operation do not permit it.I am told the initial boost that novelty and promotion gave to newsstand sales has eased back now, but subscriptions since the change have grown strongly.A highly visible innovation was the introduction of patches of yellow. Adverse response was significant, and usage is being cut back. Viner says the technique will be used judiciously and “the randomness will stop”.Although various readers perceived the body type as smaller, the ink less intense and the paper itself perhaps different, I am assured that the font size of the body type is fractionally larger and the ink and paper are the same.The change of masthead drew attention, partly because some readers thought it didn’t draw enough attention to itself on newsstands among its competitors.

So the directors of a new documentary about her short and scandalous life faced a difficult task.Was Mansfield, one of the first actresses to be marketed as a “blonde bombshell”, also a violin-playing intellectual with superb comic timing who spoke five languages? Or was the star who came to be known as the “working man’s Marilyn Monroe” actually a devil worshipper who was decapitated in a car crash as the result of a curse?For the makers of Mansfield 6667, these questions were only part of the story. Instead, the American film-makers P David Ebersole and Todd Hughes have created an unorthodox account of the world of Hollywood gossip and illusion. Top-billed contributors to the documentary, out in cinemas last month, include Tippi Hedren, Alfred Hitchcock’s muse, Kenneth Anger, the author of the bible of tacky ephemera Hollywood Babylon, and the film director John Waters, a master of offbeat kitsch.The release of Mansfield 6667 in Britain marks the 50th anniversary of the star’s death at 34. Focused on the last two years of her life, the film was made after Ebersole and Hughes failed to find producers for their fictionalised screenplay The Devil Made Her Do It, about Mansfield’s reputed dalliance with the San Francisco-based satanic guru Anthony LaVey.Unconventional elements of their finished documentary include interpretive dance sequences and a series of animated recreations of some key Mansfield myths. There are also clips of the star in the hit films The Girl Can’t Help It and Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? as proof of her sure sense of comic timing.Born Vera Jayne Palmer in Pennsylvania in 1933, she was initially hired by Warner Brothers in 1955 and then by 20th Century Fox, where she was seen as a potential successor to the troublesome Monroe.In her short life she also made a string of centrefold appearances as “playmate of the month” in Playboy magazine and had three husbands and five children. Her youngest child from her second marriage to the 1955 Mr Universe winner, Mickey Hargitay, is the actress Mariska Hargitay, a regular on the television show Law \u0026amp Order: Special Victims Unit.One fact about Mansfield never in doubt was her trademark proclivity for revealing her ample bosom. Those not familiar with her acting may know her name simply because of a notorious photograph of her taken in 1957 at a party Paramount Studios gave for the rising Italian star Sophia Loren. Although Loren was officially belle of that ball, it was her bemused reaction to Mansfield’s low-cut gown that became Hollywood folklore.Mansfield’s film career hit the buffers in the mid-1960s and she was forced to resort to working in nightclubs. She continued to make promotional special appearances, however, and travelled out to cheer the troops in Vietnam. It was at this stage, while also dating a married lawyer, Sam Brody, that she began to see LaVey, the self-styled head of the Church of Satan who had painted his home black and wore a dark cape. When a jealous Brody challenged LaVey over Mansfield’s affections, the legend says a fatal curse was brought down upon his head.During 1966 and 1967, Mansfield and Brody survived seven car crashes before an eighth eventually killed them both. The actress had been travelling from Biloxi, Mississippi, to New Orleans to appear on television when her car hit a trailer head-on. The accident gave birth to a persistent rumour that Mansfield’s head, or at least her blond wig, had been flung from the car. If it was not LaVey’s curse that killed her, it may have been the fault of a truck that had sprayed a thick fog of insect repellent across the road."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1985b09c24f3fcd76e8d805f4a1220fcfacdc1a0/0_72_3608_2165/master/3608.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a1fb8c19b2db5284449f8cab83901f6","title":"times up tribeca film festival","story":"Celebrities including Lupita Nyong’o and Julianne Moore discussed the work of the group that was formed to counter sexual harassmentActivists, media-makers and celebrities including Lupita Nyong’o and Julianne Moore convened at the Tribeca film festival on Saturday, to discuss the work of Time’s Up, the group formed to counter systemic sexual harassment in the entertainment business and US workplaces.“I am still trying to catch my breath that this moment is here and that is what we’re talking about,” said the actor Mariska Hargitay. In a series of panels, moderators pushed their guests to suggest things anyone watching could immediately do. Amani Al-Khatahtbeh, founder of MuslimGirl, encouraged people to share articles on social media that tell the story of marginalized people. Nina Shaw, founding partner at the law firm Del Shaw Moonves Tanaka Finkelstein and Lezcano, said women should push men to call out sexist behavior in other men. Jetmire Gjini, a hotel room attendant in New York, advocated for workplace unions. “When women are part of a strong union like men,” Gjini said, “they have the power to stand up and protect themselves without fear of retaliation”.Time’s Up announced its own new initiative, +13x, which encourages women to help other women at their workplace. Desiree Gruber, chief executive of the multi-media company Full Picture and executive producer of Project Runway, explained that “+1” stood for bringing another woman to any work meeting or event and “3x” stood for at least three other meaningful connections that woman could be helped to make. “Even if you are at the beginning of your career, there is something you could demystify for someone else in this office,” she said. Time’s Up also celebrated its own success with a panel on its Legal Defense Fund, which provides resources to people fighting sexual harassment in the workplace. The fund is managed with the help of the National Women’s Law Center (NWLC) and has raised more than $21m.Another trend the NWLC has spotted, she said, was that the men and women who approach it are often seeking legal help because they are being retaliated against with lawsuits or threatened legal action for reporting, or even just mentioning, sexual harassment. “The retaliation people face is real,” Graves said.As attorney Robbie Kaplan, of Kaplan \u0026amp Company, explained, the fund was meant to create an army of lawyers that would fight to show such behavior would no longer be ignored. Kaplan, who argued before the US supreme court in favor of legalizing same-sex marriage, said the fund was filling a gap.For decades, she said, people who were able to find attorneys to fight sexual harassment cases tended to be either high income or were “embarrassment cases”, making accusations against high-profile and powerful people. “Almost everyone else in the middle were having a very, very hard time finding representation,” Kaplan said. Time’s Up, she said, has heard from women in nearly every industry including food, construction and the military. Kaplan said the action she was seeing was reminiscent of the activism that helped make same-sex marriage legal.“It’s just like gay rights,” Kaplan said. “How did we get them? One person said, ‘I am gay,’ and then another, and another and another. It’s exactly the same here.”The only man on stage was a former NFL player, Wade Davis, who is gay. He works with corporations, sports teams and universities to improve the understanding of sexuality. To do this, he said, he has to educate men about feminist theory. “The root of homophobia is sexism,” he said.Asked what women in the audience could do to help promote feminism, Davis said it was men who needed to step up. “Women don’t have to do anything,” he said. “They’ve done everything. Anything smart I said today I learned from a woman.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e33f1671c2c1ac0061cc4fbd71c911e930ae273/0_117_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b403ed4bcb047fe6cca03425e1df2e6","title":"chris coleman sackedd manager sunderland","story":"Sunderland lost a manager but gained new owners on Sunday when Ellis Short sacked Chris Coleman before announcing he had cleared the struggling club’s debts and sold it to an international consortium headed by the chairman of non-league Eastleigh.While Coleman paid the price for failing to prevent Sunderland from falling into League One, the outgoing Short wrote off tens of millions of pounds in liabilities, thereby facilitating the takeover spearheaded by Stewart Donald.Once this transfer in ownership has received Football League ratification, Donald will sever his ties with Eastleigh of the National League before he and his group of “football investors” begin the task of rebuilding a club which has suffered successive relegations, entering the third tier for only the second time in its history.Coleman had hoped to have been part of Sunderland’s rebirth and even offered to take a pay cut next season. Instead, the 47-year-old who led Wales to the Euro 2016 semi-finals was informed that the incoming owner wants a new coach.The consensus is that Coleman, who had never spoken to Short since swapping Wales for Wearside last November, and was apparently unaware of the impending takeover, has been treated shoddily. Yet if his honesty and enthusiasm impressed, it seems Donald and friends were unconvinced by Coleman’s collection of only five wins as Sunderland were condemned to finishing bottom of the Championship.His dismissal leaves the club seeking a 12th permanent appointment in 10 years. Early contenders include Mick McCarthy, most recently of Ipswich and a former Sunderland manager, and the former Reading coach Jaap Stam.Although the debts are understood to have been reduced considerably since the publication of the last set of accounts – which showed that Sunderland owed £69m to Short and £68m to Security Bank Capital – Short’s decision to wipe out those arrears still represents a significant, and generous, gesture which should go at least some way to repairing his severely tarnished reputation in the north-east.It is thought that eliminating the debt could cost him in excess of £100m, thereby lifting his total spending on Sunderland to around £250m. The club’s latest accounts are scheduled to be released this week. The Florida-domiciled American billionaire financier has made some calamitous decisions and wasted millions of pounds on signing sub-standard players during a decade in control. “It’s no secret that I’ve been trying to sell Sunderland,” Short said on Sunday. “But I’ve waited until the right group came along that have the experience, finances and plan to take this great club back where it deserves to be.”An initially hands-on owner who used to happily interact with fans, he became increasingly disillusioned as a series of poor managerial and boardroom appointments and unwise off field ventures – most notably the ill-fated Invest in Africa project – conspired to set the team on an inexorably downward spiral.“Overall, my chairmanship has not gone the way I would have wished the many high points of a decade in the Premier League have been overshadowed by the low points of the last two terrible seasons,” Short said. “I was therefore determined to ensure that I leave Sunderland in the best possible hands and in the best possible state to turn the corner. To achieve this, higher offers from less qualified buyers were rejected, and I’ve paid off all debts owed by the club to leave it financially strong and debt free for the first time since years before I owned it.“I will be a Sunderland fan for life and hope to return as a fan to watch them climb back to where they belong.”Apart from his role with Eastleigh – which he put up for sale on Sunday – Donald has also been involved, albeit in a much lower-profile capacity, with Oxford United’s recent revival. It is unclear what price his consortium are paying for Sunderland or how a deal kept secret until its shock announcement on Sunday lunchtime is structured.“All of us involved in this bid believe that Sunderland represents an extraordinary opportunity,” said Donald, who invested around £10m in Eastleigh and is expected to join fellow consortium members in the Stadium of Light’s directors box for the final Championship game against Wolves on Sunday. “All of us have been involved in building or rebuilding football clubs to reach their potential. We believe we have the necessary skill-set to overcome the many challenges facing us at this great club. For a club with one of the best fan bases, stadium and academies in the UK to find itself in League One is unacceptable.”A 43-year-old millionaire businessmen, he grew up in Oxfordshire and owns Bridle Insurance, a broker specialising in the civil engineering and construction industries.“We have a carefully thought-through plan to restructure Sunderland, make it sustainable and, with the help of the fans, restore its sense of pride and reconnect it with the local community,” the Oxford United-supporting Donald said. “We’re rolling our sleeves up to do what needs to be done to ready this club to start competing again.”It is likely that Martin Bain, Sunderland’s chief executive, will also leave, possibly along with a handful of other senior executives. Kit Symons, Coleman’s assistant, has already departed and other members of the backroom staff could follow.Charlotte Coleman, the departing manager’s wife tweeted that she and her husband were “gutted to be leaving Sunderland”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed007c825126a2ad0f6b39b5c69d50bf0d0d5993/0_119_3917_2350/master/3917.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8446c178b49031bc6ba91f66a69d3da","title":"manchester united arsenal premier league match report","story":"The problem with football, as Arsène Wenger is rapidly finding out, is that there is never any guarantee of a happy ending. The lingering memory of this game will be the applause that followed Arsenal’s manager down the touchline before the match. Yet Manchester United’s hospitality, on a day when Sir Alex Ferguson made a special presentation to his former bête noire, was never likely to stretch to events on the pitch.Wenger was clapped in but, by the end, he did not look like a man who cared a great deal about whether he might be afforded the same courtesy on the walk back to the tunnel. His team had conceded a 91st-minute winner and the bottom line for Arsenal, however rich the tributes might be for the departing manager, is that they have now lost six successive top-ision away fixtures for the first time since 1966. Arsenal are the only team in England’s four professional isions who have lost every league match on the road since the turn of the year, and Marouane Fellaini’s late goal means Wenger will not remember his final visit to this stadium with any affection.Fellaini’s stoppage-time header was cruelly timed because until that moment it had looked like being a satisfying result for Arsenal courtesy of Henrikh Mkhitaryan’s equaliser earlier in the second half. Paul Pogba had given United a first-half lead but José Mourinho’s team had struggled at times against a vastly changed Arsenal line-up, selected with the second leg of the Europa League semi-final against Atlético Madrid uppermost in Wenger’s thoughts.In total, Wenger made eight changes from the team that drew the first leg last Thursday. It was the youngest Arsenal team, with an average age of 24 years and 67 days, since the infamous 8-2 defeat here in August 2011 and, to put it into perspective, there were three teenagers on the bench – Eddie Nketiah, Jordi Osei-Tutu and Joe Willock - with a shirt number in the 60s. Arsenal’s entire match-day squad included only one player, Mkhitaryan, with a number from one to 11.Wenger’s record against Mourinho – two victories out of 19 attempts – is fairly lamentable even with his strongest group of players available. Here, though, he was trying to do it with the kind of inexperienced team he would usually put out in the earlier rounds of the Carabao Cup. In the process, he gave Konstantinos Mavropanos, a 20-year-old Greek defender signed from PAS Giannina in January, his first start. Arsenal’s midfield quartet included Reiss Nelson and Ainsley Maitland-Niles and, with so many changes, it must have been troubling for Mourinho that his team could not exert more control.Alexis Sánchez, for instance, found it heavy going at times against his former club. He was, however, prominently involved in Pogba’s goal after Romelu Lukaku’s cross had picked him out at the far post. Sánchez’s stooping header was goal-bound until Héctor Bellerin jutted out his leg to ert the ball against the post. The rebound fell kindly for Pogba and he turned the ball into an exposed net.The goal had originated with Nelson, Arsenal’s youngest player, losing the ball to Jesse Lingard close to the halfway line. To be generous, it was a lesson for the 18-year-old that, at this level, those kind of mistakes tend to be punished by the elite teams. Yet Nelson, to give him his due, showed flashes of potential and the build-up to Arsenal’s equaliser was a reminder that even players of considerable experience can be guilty of costly lapses.For this one it was a combination of errors, with Antonio Valencia playing a short pass inside from the right touchline and Nemanja Matic and Ander Herrera leaving the ball to one another. As soon as Granit Xhaka took possession, United were vulnerable. Mkhitaryan had sprinted upfield to be in support and his shot went through Victor Lindelöf’s legs to find its way into David de Gea’s net.By that stage United had lost Lukaku to an injury and it was not until the final exchanges that they managed to pin back their opponents. Fellaini hit the post with one header and when the substitute Marcus Rashford bundled in the rebound the goal was ruled out by a late flag. Unfortunately for Wenger, the next time Fellaini won a header in the penalty area it was the winner."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b6a05308baf6ec50cd179192b654f254d0b99de/1024_158_2388_1432/master/2388.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d2ab6cef1ddc607b2fb555062c7a69d","title":"pep guardiola manchester city can be best team in history","story":"Pep Guardiola has urged his Manchester City side to establish themselves as “the best team in history” after the champions moved to within two points of Chelsea’s record tally for a season in the top flight.City’s 4-1 thrashing of West Ham took them to 93 points with three games still to play, and to within one goal of the 103 Carlo Ancelotti’s Chelsea rattled up in 2010.Guardiola has invited his players to target the records as extra motivation over the campaign’s last few weeks and hopes to eclipse the points haul achieved by José Mourinho’s side in 2005 in next Sunday’s game against Huddersfield.“It is incredible. The numbers are a consequence of what we have done. We will try and surpass the number of goals and points but the guys have to play well and fight a lot.“We have something special in terms of confidence and we needed some targets to set in front of us. But these players like to play football. They are professionals.“They want to play and the guys on the bench want to play. They enjoy training and playing, like amateurs. They want to play for something, too. So, once we won the Premier League, the target became the numbers. It’s good to see something to fight for, to achieve something.”Guardiola reiterated his desire to add “maybe one, maybe two, no more than that” to his squad over the summer before a title defence and reminded his players they can still improve as iniduals and a collective. “Football is not a finished business: be more clinical,” he added.“The last five or 10 minutes of the first half here were not good. At 4-1 we weren’t hungry enough to score another one. There were inidual mistakes, our full-backs not controlling the players inside, so there are many aspects we can improve. If it was perfect, I would not be here next season. I would be done. The level of consistency was high this season, yes, but we are still a young team. Our strikers have an average age of 22.“For 20 guys in our squad, this will be the first time they’ve won the Premier League. That’s why it’s good. Recent history shows Premier League teams have not been able to defend their title. That is our challenge.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27efedc59738debbec2b3156d847714d5173f071/0_167_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d65e9dbfcab7680f05b6852bc1c6e5f3","title":"deportivo la coruna v barcelona la liga live","story":"Or whatever Invincibles is in Spanish.No Iniesta, no party.Is Iniesta off to Manchester City? Guardiola was very Trumpian in his response. I’m not going to promote the fake news.

If he does take the award, it will be the fifth of his career.I cannot see the two sets of fans doing much of this tonight, but the away team only generally being about 47 people in Spain.Barcelona are really going for it tonight with Suarez, Messi and Dembele up top, not to mention Coutinho in midfield. Not something Depor will be looking forward to. I like Albentosa and Schar but I can’t seem them enjoying the evening in northern Spain.And, of course, you want a bit more Sid Lowe from this week.A title victory and relegation in one game would be enjoyable for all involved, apart from Depor. Can you remember any similar occasions?There are 12 points up for grabs for Depor, who are 11 points adrift of safety, so Raul Albentosa has to trot out a few lines about how survival is possible, even though it really is not.Barcelona are a big team that want to come and win the league, and we want to get out of this sticky situation whichever way possible.We still have options and we have to make the most of them until the end.Messi paid tribute in the way all modern footballers do, by Instagramming about his team-mate.

Last week they taught Sevilla a lesson or five about how to play football and Deportivo are far from being comparable in quality to the Andalucians.A lot of the focus this week has been on Andres Iniesta and the beginning of his long goodbye from the Nou Camp as he heads further afield to finish his career in less glamorous but, more than likely, more lucrative surroundings. His standards have not slipped, although he rarely completes 90 mins but he wants to go out on a high and not with attributes fading in the twilight of his La Liga career.Sadly for Deportivo, this could be confirmation of what has been coming for a long while this season: relegation. It’s really been one to forget for them. Clarence Seedorf has done what he can to keep them in the league - and they are unbeaten in four - but really a miracle was required to keep them up and they have fallen well short."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5619c43589a207c5a97b57f8a93b54883566044c/0_137_2844_1706/master/2844.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e0b3f9ea58803be28ab5286e10f456d","title":"fiorentina v napoli serie a live","story":"Napoli’s title challenge hangs by a threat after a 3-0 defeat at Fiorentina, who took control after Kalidou Koulibaly’s early red cardWell, that’s not the result title race enthusiasts were after. But well played to Fiorentina, who took that by the scruff of the neck after Koulibaly’s – deserved, even if it took VAR to give it – red card and won in some style. Napoli just seemed shot after going behind and were never in the game at all, but the elementary errors had been there from the start. A week, they say, is a long time in football – I doubt there’ll be the reception party at the airport this week, unless any particularly bold Juventus fans are in Naples. This confirms Juve are four points clear, plus a much better goal difference, with three to play. It’s not over yet – the leaders have to go to Roma, remember – but the odds are massively stacked against Napoli now. Thanks for your company, and goodnight!And that’s it! Jubilation in Florence, and in the world of Juventus!He’s got the third! It’s another seemingly simple ball down the middle, and there’s no offside given as Simeone runs through again to slot home. Reina buries his face in his shirt. Fiorentina are jubilant what a night for them! For Napoli it’s an utter, utter choker.90+1 min: Napoli wanted to be off this pitch as soon as the second goal went in, I’ve no doubt. Perhaps they’ve called it in a bit early here but, then again, perhaps they’re just exhausted. Did last weekend’s giddy celebrations work against them in some way, I wonder?88 min: Chiesa breaks, and eventually can’t make much of it, but Napoli’s players were just walking back there.85 min: Benassi goes for the spectacular from Simeone’s ball to the far post, but can’t keep it down. Fiorentina are winning the goal-attempts battle by 27-4!84 min: Here is one more Fiorentina change – Cristoforo on for Badelj, another fine performer today.82 min: Napoli look knackered. Everything is slow, ill-thought-out, slightly off kilter. This will feel devastating after last week.79 min: Another card, the eighth yellow of the game I think and sixth for Napoli, as Rui chops down Eysseric.78 min: Eysseric is booked for a foul inside the Napoli box.77 min: Another hat-trick chance for Simeone, who has a free header 12 yards out but seems to mistime the jump and it appears to loop over off his shoulder.76 min: Yes, for the first time we’re seeing Napoli string a couple of sustained moves together – but it ends abruptly when Insigne miscontrols a ball out of play, boots it high in the stands in frustration, and is promptly booked.75 min: Here’s another Fiorentina change, just as Napoli threaten a modest spell of sustained pressure. Eysseric comes on for the impressive Saponara.74 min: Callejon delivers a free-kick and Simeone concedes the corner. A rare chance for a Napoli lifeline here. They don’t take it.72 min: Simeone, the son of Diego on the off chance you didn’t know, can’t be far from the Argentina squad on this form.70 min: Gaspar works a cross from the right and Simeone, who is on a hat-trick now, flashes a volley just wide of the near post.69 min: For their part Fiorentina’s fans, who are watching their team breathe fire into their Europa League charge, are making a lot of noise now.66 min: Insigne controls on his thigh and hooks a volley well wide. This must really be hurting him.65 min: I suspect sales of the Koulibaly pizza may be about to drop. Napoli will rue his red card here it’s shaped the game and they just haven’t ever really been in it.Has this handed the title to Juventus? The corner is nodded on, deflects sharply off Hysaj, half-saved by the leg of Reina and then Simeone pounces to snaffle the rebound up from a yard!62 min: Callejon tries to nod a deep Rui cross down to a team-mate but it’s defended well ... and then Chiesa and Simeoni have a two-on-one break but Albiol slides well to cut out the former’s cross and send it behind. It came off a hand, but at point blank range. The game may well be opening up. Now a first Fiorentina change, Gaspar on for Laurini.60 min: Another opportunity for Chiesa, who bursts through the inside-left channel but has defenders around him and eventually draws a comfortable-ish save from Reina. Milik is then booked for a foul, his first involvement since coming on.58 min: Here, indeed, is a Napoli change and it’s Milik on for Mertens. Perhaps the Pole will offer something more physical. And there’s a second Polish introduction – Zielinski for Hamsik.57 min: Sharp stop from Reina, who sticks out a paw to turn Chiesa’s shot around his near post. That would surely have ended the contest.55 min: Saponara shoots off target. Will Sarri have to find a gamble from the bench here? Napoli might need to speculate.53 min: But they really need to start putting a little spell together. Fiorentina are still dominating the ball and, really, look comfortable.50 min: First real chance of the game for Napoli! And certainly their first shot. They come alive as Callejon diagonals one from the right and Mertens, running in, connects sweetly with a left-footed volley – only to see Sportiello save down to his left.49 min: Laurini’s inviting cross goes above Chiesa but reaches Saponara beyond the far post. He steadies himself, before curling high and wide.48 min: Mertens, who we really hadn’t seen up til now, sweeps a first-time pass through to Callejon but his colleague is offside.This game is running very late now, largely on account of all that first-half controversy.Ok, we’re about to get back underway. This is a *vital* half in the Serie A season. Ten-man Napoli need something ...Well, well. Koulibaly, last weekend’s hero, is this weekend’s villain after that early – VAR-awarded – red card and his side have struggled accordingly, going a goal down and perhaps fortunate not to have conceded more. They haven’t really managed to put anything together and, unless Sarri can work wonders at the break, Juventus will regain an iron grip on the title race.45+3 min: I wouldn’t advocate this at all but the best chance for Napoli here is perhaps to ratchet up the niggliness and see if they can’t get the numbers levelled up before too long.45+2 min: Reina appears to have received a blow to the rubs, perhaps when saving that Chiesa effort as the striker fell over him. He takes some treatment but should be alright."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06e2fc351f7ab281c31ef7eeed8328e85afa3cfc/0_118_3400_2040/master/3400.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47e32a29ff624d0cfeb2cc116b33c180","title":"manchester united v arsenal premier league live","story":"Arsene Wenger’s final trip to Old Trafford as Arsenal manager ended in defeat after Marouane Fellaini’s injury-time header gave United the pointsThat’s about it for today’s blog. Thanks for your company and emails, bye!Here’s Arsene Wenger “It was a very positive performance and overall it reflects our season away from home. We looked a little tired in the last 20 minutes. It’s good to see the young players having the courage to play in this atmosphere. It was a very nice reception – it was classy. I have come here for a long, long time and next year somebody else will sit on the bench and they will get a very hostile reception!”Here’s Daniel Taylor’s report from Old TraffordHere’s Jose Mourinho “A draw wouldn’t have been unfair. They played well the two young centre-backs did very, very well. We had a few more chances but that’s normal. We changed our approach in the second half, we had more width and we used Marouane to give us more presence in the box. I knew they were going to drop deep, and without Lukaku I felt we needed a presence in the air. I knew we would create problems that way.”We’ll have Danny Taylor’s match report shortly, and I’m expecting reaction from Arsene Wenger and Jose Mourinho in our Whatsapp group.Ainsley Maitland-Niles is the Man of the Match “We’re disappointed and unhappy to concede so late. You live and learn from these experiences and it was great to be out there. The manager trusts the young players and we tried to show what we could do. I’m happy playing midfield and I guess I delivered. The manager is like a father figure to me and it’s brilliant having someone like that.” United need four points from the last three games to be certain of finishing second. Those games are Brighton (A), West Ham (A) and Watford (H)That was a brilliant substitution from Jose Mourinho, even though he won’t get much credit for it. Arsenal struggled to handle Fellaini and he was by far the biggest three in the last 10 minutes.Paul Pogba speaks! “I feel very good. We played well, we had lots of chances. The perfect season would have been the league – we didn’t manage that, but we want to finish second and win the FA Cup.”Marouane Fellaini speaks! “The manager told me to get into the box. I know my quality, I know that if the ball comes in the box I can be dangerous. It was a good ball, I tried to flick it, and it’s a goal.” Russell Richardson points out that Fellaini’s goal confirms United’s place in the top four, and thus ensures they will be eliminated in the last 16 of the Champions League next season.“I thought it about time you had a comment from an old fart,” says Terry Woods, selflessly offering his services. “My memory takes me back to 1966-67, my Gooner debut season. Utd were the visitors at a packed Highbury evening game, there was I at the grand age of 11 stood at the front of the old West stand witnessing a 1-1 draw, United wearing an all white strip, in those days our shirts were an exact match: red shirt, white collar and cuffs. The North bank to my left was in good voice, the Clock end to my right was open to the night sky. There started my love affair with THE Arsenal.”That win should ensure United finish the season in second place. They could end with 86 points, a title-winning total in some cultures.Peep peep! Arsene Wenger’s last trip to Old Trafford ends in another painful defeat. It doesn’t come close to the misery of 2001, 2004 or 2011, but it will still smart because Arsenal’s young side played well and deserved a draw. Fellaini was under pressure and facing away from goal when Young’s cross reached him. He tried to guide it towards goal with the back of his appreciable noggin, and it took a deflection off the challenging Xhaka before drifting away from Ospina.One last bit of Old Trafford heartbreak for Arsene Wenger. Young’s inswinging cross is backheaded into the net by Fellaini, and United have stolen two extra points.89 min Rashford has a goal disallowed for offside. Fellaini headed Martial’s cross against the post, from where it rebounded off Rashford and into the net. He was clearly offside when Fellaini headed the ball and there are no complaints. 88 min “Very few players take shots from distance these days,” says Arthur Tee. “Teams are too concerned with possession and protecting the ball. United in particular create very few chances, relatively, but they are almost always gilt-edged.”87 min Willock tries to slip a pass through for Welbeck, and Smalling does well to poke the ball back to De Gea.87 min The match is petering out. Martial tries to run Bellerin, who defends solidly.85 min Pogba, surrounded by Arsenal defenders in the area, backheels the ball into his own standing leg and away from danger.84 min Why doesn’t Paul Pogba shoot from long range any more? 83 min The lively Young lifts a deep cross beyond the far post, where Valencia arrives late and volleys the ball into orbit.82 min Young’s terrific cross almost finds the head of Fellaini, who appeals for a penalty after a bit of a wrestle with Mavropanos. I don’t think it was a foul.81 min United are dominating the match without looking like they are going to score. It feels like an end-of-season friendly.80 min “My favourite ArsenalUnited memory was back in 2001,” says Xavier Pillai. “It was my first game ever at Highbury and I was 7. Two Fabien Barthez mistakes and the song ‘Give it to Barthez’ rang around the ground. After the match, we went to the side entrance on Avenell road and we continued to sing. We caught the United players coming out to their coach and there with his head nestled in Paul Scholes’ shoulder and with a few tears dripping from his eyes was Fabian Barthez. They rushed him on to the coach and there began my love affair with the Arsenal. A close second was being in the Emirates for that Henry header.”79 min United win three corners in quick succession, and waste all of them.78 min Talking of strangling, this picture gets more wonderful by the year.77 min “Brian McClair strangling Winterburn has to be a favourite,” says Adam Hirst. “It got a bigger cheer at OT than most goals. Not the penalty or the Battle of OT matches, but obviously related.”76 min Arsenal make their final change: the goalscorer Henrikh Mkhitaryan is replaced by Joe Willock.76 min Ospina bumps into Fellaini and staggers around for a few seconds before falling over. He looks in a fair bit of pain, and Petr Cech is warming up just in case.73 min It hasn’t really happened for Rashford since he came on. He looks rusty, which is probably because he is rusty.72 min In-form goalgetter Chris Smalling misses a good chance, fresh-airing an attempted sidefoot from Martial’s low cross.71 min Martial lifts a dangerous cross towards Fellaini, who is poised to apply noggin to ball when Mavropanos heads behind for a corner. Fine defending. He’s had a quietly impressive debut.69 min Fellaini is robbed by Welbeck, who thrashes a shot towards goal from 25 yards. It’s well struck but too close to De Gea, who saves comfortably.68 min United were so good against Spurs last weekend but this has been a pedestrian performance. It’s hard to fathom why they are quite so inconsistent.66 min Martial enlivens the crowd by slaloming past three defenders, only to overhit a pass to Fellaini.64 min Substitutions galore. For Arsenal, Danny Welbeck and Nacho Monreal replace Reiss Nelson and Sead Kolasinac. For United, Anthony Martial and Marouane Fellaini replace Ander Herrera and Jesse Lingard."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8029897b46bda0e1c8e7d500eca606634e2a39d0/0_0_4775_2865/master/4775.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2cc7fb7871eccd9fa28e313bd7ac158d","title":"barbara hulanicki biba the worst age milestone was 40","story":"The Biba founder and designer, 81, talks about ageing, cheese and young friendsI went to live in Miami for six months and ended up there for 28 years.

Why? ‘It just feels like the right thing to do’‘If you analyse what I’m saying,” says Jamie Oliver, “there’s nothing clever and there’s nothing really that controversial it’s fucking really basic common sense.”We meet on the morning that a letter he coordinated has been released, addressed to the prime minister and signed by Jeremy Corbyn, Nicola Sturgeon and other party leaders. It calls on the government to ban junk food advertising before 9pm and unhealthy buy-one-get-one-free offers, among other things. Oliver is proud of it. He looks relaxed, sitting on one of the sofas in his industrial, vintage-styled head office – although he knows the attacks will come. Later, he will be accused on Twitter of being the “fun police” a column in the Sun will call it a nanny-state initiative that penalises poor people.He talks in long, rambling sentences, bristling with energy. His transformation from cheeky-chappy Essex boy chef to single-issue crusader, facts and figures to hand, about to appear in front of a select committee, is complete. You would think he would have enough going on – he closed several of his restaurants recently and restructured his business – but Oliver remains laser-focused on the issue of childhood obesity.So far, Oliver seems to be coming at obesity principally as a diet problem, rather than a social one, although it may be too much to ask even someone as energetic and ambitious as him to fix society. Obesity disproportionately affects children in deprived areas. If there is one criticism of Oliver that seems to stand up, it is that he does not entirely understand what it is like to live in relentless, grinding poverty: to be unable to afford fresh vegetables (healthy food is three times more expensive, per calorie, than unhealthy food – Oliver has suggested that the government should subsidise healthy food) to be too tired to cook from scratch every night to take the financial risk on a lentil recipe that your kids may refuse to eat.At one point, when we are talking about whether people – working parents, people who have to work several jobs – can be persuaded to turn their backs on the ease of convenience food, he acknowledges that “humans crave convenience, that’s what we’re programmed to do. But convenience food doesn’t have to be shit. The freezer is the future.” But what if you live in a small flat, with a tiny fridge and just an ice box? “Of course, but you can buy it on the defrost – that will be two or three days in the fridge still. You don’t have to have it all racked up in the freezer. But costs are down, welfare is up, waste down. Convenience food doesn’t have to be shite.” But it probably will not be cheap.Maybe it does not help when he keeps talking about “them” and “us”, as if people on low incomes or benefits are a separate species. But he is not having it. “Yeah, because I don’t have to worry about feeding my kids today and they do. It’s not hard to get someone to say: ‘Jamie Oliver is a wanker.’ I think the concept of having an opinion and caring in Britain is a really funny one, you know: ‘How dare you.’” It is true that he is in an impossible position – as a chef reportedly worth £150m, he is regularly accused of hypocrisy (years on, those lucrative supermarket adverts are used as a stick with which to beat him) and for lecturing the rest of us, but the alternative would be to do nothing. “When I stand up there and start talking, you may or may not like what I say,” he says. “But if you’ve ever seen the people representing the advertising industry or the food industry, I know you would trust me with your kids more than them.”Why does he do it? There must be times when an easier life – with his wife, Jools, their five children and their lovely £9m home in Hampstead, north London, and his TV cookery shows – seem more appealing. “The important stuff I’ve done I’ve rarely enjoyed,” he says. “I get a beating quite regularly.” So, why carry on? “It just feels like the right thing to do,” he says slowly, enunciating every word.Oliver became political early on. It was only three years after his explosive 1999 debut as the Naked Chef that he was training unemployed young people to staff his restaurant Fifteen – filmed, of course, for a TV series (few can match Oliver’s media skills). His campaign to improve school dinners culminated in the series Jamie’s School Dinners in 2005, while his 2008 series Ministry of Food followed his initiative to teach cookery skills in Rotherham (that project closed last year after Rotherham council stopped funding it, but there are others around the country).In 2015, Oliver turned his attention to sugar with his documentary Jamie’s Sugar Rush. The month it aired, he says darkly, “stuff changed. Like burglaries, computer systems, break-ins at the office, home.” Before I can ask if he thinks Big Sugar was trying to intimidate him, he continues: “I don’t know, but there’s a string of events since the month that started.” Still, the sugar tax was introduced, under David Cameron’s government (Oliver has been scathing of Theresa May’s childhood obesity strategy).People have often tried to work out what drives Oliver, but I suspect it is as simple as the satisfaction of seeing results (just like the process of starting with raw ingredients and producing a Sunday roast). “As time has gone on and we’ve got some stuff done, you realise that getting stuff done isn’t that common,” he says. Someone called him a socialist recently and he had to look up the definition. He does not think he is one he prefers the idea of running a commercial business with a social ethos.That is not to say everyone agrees he is succeeding. A report in the Times last month portrayed his chief executive Paul Hunt, who is married to Oliver’s sister, as a bully, quoting a former employee who said “morale is at rock bottom”. “It’s complete bollocks,” Oliver says. “You can walk round the business. Like I said to the editor when they ran the story, come in and talk to everyone. If you’re talking about some bad leavers, of course you’re going to find some people who have something to whine about.”It has been a tough year for Oliver – tougher still for some of his staff. He describes the closure of one of his two Barbecoa steak restaurants and 12 of the 37 UK branches of his chain Jamie’s Italian as “awful. Worst time in my life.” It is the job losses, he says. “We’ve still got 2,000 people, but we’ve had to close 12 restaurants, which is about 800 people.”It can be easy to forget that, amid all the campaigning and the chain-restaurant managing, Oliver is still a wildly popular and successful chef. His most recent book, 5 Ingredients, was one of his biggest-selling and he has another out in the summer. He still writes two recipes every day (about a third are healthy, the rest less so this is often pointed out as though it is evidence of Oliver’s hypocrisy).Anyway, he has to go – Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, that other anti-obesity campaigner and chef, is on the phone. Oliver says his business is committed to the target of halving childhood obesity by 2030. “That is what you’re going to hear me say for the next 12 years,” he says. You have to admire his single-mindedness. “Don’t get me wrong,” he adds, “I’m fucking looking forward to retiring.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d04be42c527dc3d12062a35c90cfd525ef893bb/0_95_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39f7f6cb993438b043fb4aefb93a87d5","title":"why do i wish my perfect partner didnt dote on me so much mariella frostrup","story":"Only stay in the relationship if you’re enjoying it – and don’t overthink it, Mariella Frostrup tells a woman wondering whether her kind and loving boyfriend is a bad choiceThe dilemma I’m a 25-year-old woman in her first serious relationship. We have been together for 15 months and he is exactly what you would want in a partner – loving, kind, accepting and ultimately makes himself totally available to me in all senses of the word. This is also exactly the opposite of any kind of man I have dated previously and I worry that those experiences have somehow scarred me. I find myself wishing he was more unavailable, less overtly loving and did not dote on me so much.I feel I am attracted more to men I know to be bad news, particularly if they’re off limits, and I wish there was more passion in our relationship. None of this is helped by my having health problems recently. We have discussed moving in together and a big trip, but I find myself torn between this path and a very different partner and life.I can’t tell if I am pursuing the idea of perfection, or if these are genuine issues that will leave me feeling dissatisfied and unhappy later down the line.Mariella replies I’m so glad you wrote. It takes most of us so much longer to realise we’re making bad choices – three decades in the case of yours truly – so well done for spotting your romantic peccadillos so soon! Not that such self-awareness automatically gifts you with a crystal ball for future pairing. Taking that for granted would be tantamount to believing that we live in a fair and equal world and we all know that’s not the case. Any relationship is a gamble and while that can get us into all sorts of trouble along the way it’s also part of the fun.The pursuit of perfection may be a compelling pastime that occasionally achieves tangible results, but in most cases it proves an everlasting and insatiable quest. You may well be in a relationship that’s ill-suited to your emotional requirements or you may just be overthinking things. As this is your first serious coupling it’s unlikely to be your last, which may sound harsh but that certainly takes the heat off and offers you a lot more exploratory freedom than you might feel at, say, 40.You describe your previous preference for men who behave badly, but your choice of a “serious” boyfriend is the opposite of that description. Why so? Did self-preservation come into play or does the guy you’ve ended up with have more appealing qualities than you are giving him credit for? Nobody wants to while away their lives with a dullard, so I’m always cautious about those who are committed to “protecting”, “taking care of”, or worse still “worshipping” their lover.A desperation to nurture you is as unwelcome an aspiration as serial adultery. All the best relationships I’ve witnessed have been those where partners don’t lose a sense of their own priorities. Therefore, when you say he “ultimately makes himself available to me in all senses of the word,” I get nervous. The answer seems to be to sample the experience for as long as you enjoy it and stop worrying about whether he’s the perfect proposition for the long haul. I can see you are tying yourself in knots trying to make the right choice, but what if there’s no such thing?My advice would be to stop chewing over the long-term considerations and just accept this relationship in the here and now. Taking an extended trip seems an excellent way of establishing whether there is a possibility for anything longer term. If he doesn’t drive you crazy when you’re in constant close proximity, you’ll know that you stand a chance of cohabiting successfully. Nothing is laid in stone, life is an endless array of changes and choices and I suspect by conscientiously trying to do the best thing you’re limiting your experiences. Predicting the future is a fool’s game and yet it ties up so much of our emotional energy.When you get to my age and start attending more funerals than weddings it’s a topic you can’t help but dwell on. What was time well spent? What was squandered? All too often it’s the energy expended on fretting and speculating about what might happen rather than living each day as the welcome surprise it is that seems worth regretting. It also seems time we all embraced a more realistic and contemporary approach to our pairings. Once upon a time the choice of who to settle down with was a serious business, particularly for women. When you’d made your choice, or had it made for you more often than not, there you were, stuck, until death did you part. Nowadays we can hook up and pair off, change our minds, stream through a whole regiment or decide our best friend was the person we wanted all along. Freedom brings with it an escalation of personal choice and that doesn’t make decision-making easier.Being attracted to bad boys and hitching your wagon to one for life are very different things but you mustn’t live in fear of making mistakes. Worrying about the future is seriously detrimental to enjoying the present and I’m increasingly convinced that’s all we can be sure of. So enjoy the relationship for what it offers, or move on to more adrenaline-fuelled adventures – both routes have something to offer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0d04a3b979cddf26ea42ca225794e1ea4af0ad1/0_0_2992_1795/master/2992.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c07ef003b7576201ee8e0ae739d7259","title":"akala review shepherds bush empire london black people hip hop poet","story":"Shepherd’s Bush Empire, LondonAs he unpicks the marginalisation of black people, the rapper and cultural commentator seems to draw ever more strength from his own messagesRapper, musician and cultural commentator Akala is becoming one of the UK’s foremost critical thinkers, having recently spoken on everything from Grenfell and Corbyn to the entire  of human history in his televised epic poem The Ruins of Empires. This all-encompassing scrutiny is clear from the get-go of his sold-out show, with an introductory video in which he criticises western television for its propagation of negative images of black people over the course of history. Backed by his DJ and a live drummer, Akala carries the air of a civil rights orator. His energetic presentation and lyrically dense raps float with poise, are ingested by his cult following and reflected back in the form of constant mobbing.Particular fervour is whipped up as he moves through call-to-arms thriller Sun Tzu, with the help of featured guest Asheber, and the crowd’s growing appreciation for his tongue-twisting prowess crafts a raucous atmosphere. Each of the night’s peaks, from singalong anthems Roll Wid Us and XXL to curtain call Find No Enemy, are constantly topped, and these leaps do not falter as the show continues. It’s as if he finds infinite strength in rejecting gang violence, examining historical injustice towards black people, and exploring the doctrines of black leaders such as Malcolm X and Marcus Garvey. His calm demeanour is a tonic to the lyrical onslaughts, and comforting, given the tough nature of his subject matter.Akala’s mission to educate becomes increasingly obvious, and comic-book style visuals and impromptu on-stage soliloquies inject vividness into his songs about finding one’s path after being led astray. There is a genuine feeling that he is trying to make sense of the world’s injustices as he speaks, which numbs the crowd into a thought-provoking silence. He saves the night’s most powerful sequence for Visions, a detailed account of black history, from pre-civilisation to the present day, that bounces off the exceptional pounding drums that soundtrack the entire evening. He draws a line in the sand between himself and his braggadocio rap contemporaries, with anecdotes relating to discovering his own limitations, and urges the crowd to do the same. His fervent hand-waving is proof that his belief in his own work continues to burn like an Olympic flame."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ae038e8c2c4b36908a25371c5654c626e38ed80/0_1953_5547_3327/master/5547.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56060177d1dbd221307c3fcc7443ad43","title":"bob dylan whiskey heavens door","story":"For a man whose Bootleg Series now runs to 13 albums, distilling his own Tennessee liquor seems like a logical next stepBob Dylan will next month launch a range of whiskeys, hoping to capitalize on growing demand for all things celebrity-tagged.The 76-year-old singer and Nobel laureate has joined with liquor entrepreneur Marc Bushala to turn a deconsecrated church in Tennessee into a distillery. Their Heaven’s Door Spirits – a Tennessee straight bourbon, a double barrel whiskey and a straight rye – will first be available in Tennessee, Florida, California, Illinois, New York and Texas. A wider rollout will follow.Dylan’s new project was announced on Saturday. “You don’t always find inspiration,” he mused in a press release. “Sometimes it finds you. We wanted to create a collection of American whiskeys that would each tell a story.” Bushala, 52, told his story to the . The project began, he said, when he noticed Dylan, whose Bootleg Series now runs to 13 albums, had filed a trademark application for “bootleg whiskey”. Bushala contacted the enigmatic singer and made his pitch.Knowing that Dylan is a whiskey aficiando, Bushala decided to approach the project from a whiskey-centric point of view. “That appealed to Bob,” he said. “This is not a vanity project for him. It’s a passion project.”When it came to a name, the two men “wanted a standalone name for whiskey that could also be a nod and a wink to Dylan”.Dylan’s songs are not short of whiskey references, among them Copper Kettle (The Pale Moonlight) (“Daddy he made whiskey, my grandaddy he did too  We ain’t paid no whiskey tax since 1792”) Blind Willie McTell (“He’s dressed up like a squire  Bootlegged whiskey in his hand”) Gotta Serve Somebody )“Might like to drink whiskey  Might like to drink milk”) and Moonshiner (“I’ve spent all my money  On whiskey and beer”).The two men got down to 10 favourites, then agreed to go with a reference to Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door, a hit from the 1973 album Pat Garrett \u0026amp Billy the Kid which in fact does not refer to whiskey. “Everyone felt strongly that Heaven’s Door was just a perfect name,” Bushala said, “especially given the imagery we’re using on the bottles” – wrought ironwork from Dylan’s own metalwork foundry in Los Angeles.Someone as “eclectic and erse as Bob”, Bushala said, should put out “an evolving collection or portfolio” of whiskeys. To achieve that, he said, he raised $35m from investors.Dylan’s idea for his own whiskey came from a more down-to-earth source: his earliest incarnation as a Woody Guthrie-esque, riding-the-rails wandering minstrel.In a statement to the New York Times, the singer said: “I’ve been traveling for decades and I’ve been able to try some of the best spirits that the world of whiskey has to offer. This is great whiskey.”Bushala said: “There have been spirits and whiskey in his music for as long as he’s been making it, going on 60 years, and in the kind of rural Americana that plays into it. So for sure in his mind, there were elements he was after. But it wasn’t directly articulated.“He was after a mood or a feeling. He wasn’t after saying, ‘This should taste more smokey or have more corn or rye, or adjust the proof.’” Presented with one distillation, Bushala said, Dylan said simply the drink should feel “more like a wood structure”. “We were nodding like we understood,” Bushala said. “But we didn’t really.”Nor, perhaps to the horror of Dylan purists, is this the singer’s first foray into the world of commerce. The singer is a periodic pitchman, endorsing Chobani, Chrysler and even Victoria’s Secret.“He didn’t sell out,” Bushala said. “This is his brand, and it’s his idea. We just helped him do what he wanted to do. Bob does not want to be face man of the brand and he does not want the packaging to scream ‘Dylan’.”Dylan’s signature is therefore on the reverse side of the label, Bushala said, making it visible only when the bottle is empty. “He was willing to do that but he’s not going to appearances or bottle signings. He didn’t even pick up his Nobel prize so he’s not going to go out touting this. And that’s great because it’s authentic for Dylan and authentic for the brand.” With some irony, perhaps, the rules that will govern the success or otherwise of Dylan’s project will, like his whiskey and his music, hark back to America’s past. Liquor distribution in the US is still based on a post-prohibition model, each market tightly controlled by licensed state distributors. Those markets have to be broken into much as folk musicians or promoters once toured local radio stations, seeking precious airplay.“There are parallels,” Bushala said. “You’re going from account to accounts and hand-selling. You’re going round, knocking on the doors.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78fd60c8e2424c4c5ce5fa1bbdb727f82cff2785/176_111_935_561/master/935.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11ce2733249da7789f2bf8a269c76a79","title":"eugene onegin review theatre royal glasgow tchaikovsky","story":"Theatre Royal, GlasgowNatalya Romaniw is a glorious Tatyana in Scottish Opera’s new show, wonderfully conducted by Stuart Stratford and incorporating extra parts of Pushkin’s novelEugene Onegin is the exception to the rule that great operas have lives of their own, independent of their literary sources. It is a masterpiece, but impossible to detach from Alexander Pushkin’s verse novel on which it is based. Tchaikovsky knew that, carefully categorising it as “lyric scenes”, intended for an audience in 19th-century Russia that probably could have recited large chunks of Pushkin’s work from memory. He could be sure that the crucial strands of the story of Onegin and Tatyana he omitted from his libretto would have been well known to his first audiences.It’s one of the achievements of Oliver Mears’s fine new production for Scottish Opera that, as well as remaining almost entirely faithful to the opera’s text, it explores some of those extra strands, especially the pervading importance of memory, a fierce sense of loss, and opportunities for happiness squandered. Mears and designer Annemarie Woods shift the story to the early 1900s, the last years of Tsarist Russia, but conjure that period through the memory of the old Tatyana (played by actor Rosy Sanders). She’s dowdy and grey-haired. The grandeur and affluence of her marriage to Gremin have been destroyed by the 1917 revolution, and as she returns to her dilapidated family home she painfully relives the events of her youth there.Within that frame, the action is truthful, although rather than keep Tatyana’s letter, as in the Pushkin, this Onegin (Samuel Dale Johnson) returns it to her, so that the very last image of the production is of the older Tatyana tearing it into tiny pieces. It’s by no means a lavish production – the basic box set is a constant, and the chorus and most of the dancers (with the exception of solo ballerina, Eve Mutso, dancing Ashley Page’s choreography) remain behind gauze in the two ball scenes. There is, however, a horse, on which Onegin makes his first appearance, and which on the first night deposited a steaming pile of dung centre stage.Johnson is a credible Onegin, handsome and haughty in the first act a broken man by the time he confronts Natalya Romaniw’s Tatyana in the final scene, even though his singing grew in expressive assurance as the opera went on. Romaniw’s performance is gloriously sung from the start, although she is perhaps more convincing as a princess than as a naive young girl. Peter Auty is a touching Lensky, whose ardent honesty is an obvious mismatch with Sioned Gwen Davies’s wild Olga, seen in flagrante with a farm worker in the first act.Graeme Broadbent makes a rather gravelly Gremin: the slow tempo for his aria didn’t help. Otherwise, the score is conducted with total conviction by Stuart Stratford. The Russian repertory is one of his specialisms, and it shows in the wonderfully rich textures he draws from the Scottish Opera orchestra, and by his habitually faultless dramatic pacing. A couple of passages will tighten as the production beds in: the climax of the Larins’ party, when the fatal duel is fixed, could have been fiercer, and the final scene could push more emotional buttons – but Scottish Opera should already be immensely proud of this show."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16603970b80c30b2f4e96436f601df35b101f08c/2387_172_6068_3641/master/6068.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a8dd5196f3548653a2ebb24424de662","title":"gary barlow review blackpool opera house take that","story":"Blackpool Opera HouseThere’s an almost music-hall atmosphere as this gig from the singer’s smaller-stage tour delivers a crowd-pleasing portfolio of Take That hits among solo numbers Where Take That’s stadium and arena tours have become visual extravaganzas, featuring mechanical elephants and giant robots, the band’s singer-songwriter’s theatre tour takes him back, if not for good, to intimate gigs heavy on traditional stagecraft and audience interaction. “Gary! Gary!” the mostly female audience (some wearing Barlow masks) chant before he bounds on, all peroxide quiff, big grins and black and red suit, which renders him a cross between a totalitarian dictator and Star Trek’s Captain Kirk. “Turn the lights up and let’s ’ave a look at this audience,” he yells. “Oh yes! Saturday in Blackpool!” Although Barlow’s reissued 1997 debut, Open Road, recently went Top 10, solo songs don’t feature prominently in the setlist. In the show opener Since I Last Saw You, however, he reconciles himself to being popular but uncool (“I’ve made my peace with what may happen  Accepted I won’t be in fashion”). This means he can cheerily interrupt songs with Alan Partidge-isms (“Whoo! Nice!” “Did you enjoy that? Yes!”) and trigger a massive singsong with a ticker-tape explosion as early as the second number. It’s a bit of a stretch to call Barlow a renaissance man, but the singerretired X Factor judge and occasional Heartbeat actor has built up a more varied portfolio than most performers who served their apprenticeship in northern working men’s clubs. Here, he delves into songs from his musicals, Finding Neverland and Calendar Girls, unveils a curious sideline as tour statistician (“and this song was released on the 11th October 1993”), tactfully avoids his brief but controversial 2014 period as a poster boy for tax avoidance and settles into a comfier role as all-round end-of-the-pier light entertainer. When someone in the crowd holds up a sign reading: “Mummy and me came from Malta. Can I have a hug?” he strides into the stalls to give them one. Someone else with a placard reading: “I’ll never forget sitting on your organ,” is theatrically scolded: “That’s disgusting!” He serenades an audience member called Martina with A Million Love Songs while she sits at the end of his piano and films it on her phone. There’s a dollop of pantomime as he removes his jacket: people start cheering “Stop it!” and bombard him with mock boos when he puts more clothing on. Otherwise, he knows that people want plenty of Take That nostalgia and doesn’t let them down. New song Relive Those Years tells the band’s story from early days to 2005 reformation with jazz, confessionals and witty self-deprecation. “My appetite for singing slowly dies,” he sings of his post-split wilderness period, rubbing his now trimmer stomach for the punchline, “replaced by an appetite for pies”. Meanwhile, TT smashes are gleefully reinvented – as big-band brass (Everything Changes), cod jazz funk (Sure), seaside disco stomper (Dan Hartman cover Relight My Fire) – or accompanied by comically bad dancing (Pray). Although he turns in a shift as sincere balladeer, this show is less about gravitas than 90 minutes of old-fashioned, almost music-hall showbiz. Still, it’s hard not to be swept along as a crowd choir turn Back for Good, Patience, Never Forget and the rest into Last-Night-of-the-Proms-type epics. Barlow reminds the audience that party towns and theatres like this are where he started and, in a sense, he has never left. “Goodnight,” he promises. “I’ll see you on the ghost train.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1aa452a57fc4e01a47fa3ea691e312dc9eb1f427/0_0_3482_2248/master/3482.jpg?w=660\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=6165c00d2c8b0f770a74cb83614e23fc 1320w","title":"amber rudd letter to pm reveals ambitious but deliverable removals target","story":"Exclusive: denials she was aware of deportation targets at odds with January 2017 letter now published in fullThe private letter from Amber Rudd to Downing Street in which she sets an “ambitious but deliverable” target for an increase in the enforced deportation of immigrants has been published by the  in full for the first time.Rudd has claimed she did not set, see or approve any targets for removals. The former immigration minister Brandon Lewis suggested on Sunday this proposed increase was an ambition rather than a target.But Home Office sources have told the  that it is “shame-faced nonsense” to claim the department had not been set specific targets in this area, or that these have not been regularly discussed at the highest levels.The latest furore was sparked on Friday when the  published details from a separate confidential memo that was sent to Rudd in June last year.Prepared by Hugh Ind, the director general of Immigration Enforcement in the Home Office, it picked up on the new policy outlined by Rudd in her letter to Theresa May.While Rudd has denied seeing the six-page briefing note, the  can now reveal that it was also sent to at least eight of the Home Office’s most senior officials, including:• Marc Owen, senior director of national and international operations in Immigration Enforcement.• Mark Thomson, the director general of the Passport Office.• Tony Eastaugh, UK director of operations at Immigration Enforcement.• Gareth Hills, director of performance and risk at the Home Office.• Stephen Kershaw, a senior director in Immigration Enforcement.• Andrew Wren, director of performance, assurance and governance at the Home Office.The home secretary has issued five apologies in the last week – four of them over her department\u0027s handling of the Windrush crisis and immigration targets.Rudd delivered an unprecedented apology to parliament and acknowledged that her department had “lost sight of iniduals” and become “too concerned with policy”.Rudd apologised for failing to grasp the scale of the problem. She told the home affairs select committee: “I bitterly, deeply regret that I didn’t see it as more than inidual cases gone wrong that needed addressing. I didn’t see it as a systemic issue until very recently.”On Thursday morning, Rudd was forced to admit officials did have targets for removals, having previously denied their existence.“The immigration arm of the Home Office has been using local targets for internal performance management. These were not published targets against which performance was assessed, but if they were used inappropriately then I am clear that this will have to change.On Thursday afternoon, Rudd was forced to issue a hasty clarification after appearing to leave the door open to the UK staying in a customs union with the EU.“I should have been clearer – of course when we leave the EU we will be leaving the customs union.In a series of late-night tweets, Rudd apologised for not being aware of documents, leaked to the , which set out immigration removal targets.\u0026nbsp‘I wasn’t aware of specific removal targets. I accept I should have been and I’m sorry that I wasn’t. I didn’t see the leaked document, although it was copied to my office as many documents are.The disclosure will heap further pressure on Rudd, who has said she will address MPs on Monday to answer the “legitimate questions” that have been raised over the past week.On Friday night, nine hours after the  first told the Home Office about the leaked memo, Rudd tweeted: “I wasn’t aware of removal targets. I accept I should have been and I am sorry that I wasn’t.”The response appears at odds with the letter she sent to the prime minister in January last year.But it also suggests that none of the other senior officials and special advisers copied into the subsequent briefing note ever discussed with her the targets which the Immigration Enforcement agency was attempting to reach on her instruction.Home Office sources have told the  that Immigration Enforcement has been working all year to reach the target of 12,800 enforced returns in 2017-18.They have been bracing themselves to acknowledge to ministers that the agency has failed to do so. To meet the goal, it needed to deport 250 people a week, but it has only been able to remove about 225 a week.“At the Home Office we work in a target culture,” said a source. “The civil service is completely target based. That’s all we do. It is shame-faced nonsense for Amber Rudd to say otherwise.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/178984a25ada8e2cd4243639899dbd13a8bc5f70/248_280_1186_711/master/1186.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=613763ed07d1e67a7de2f83f7a433257","title":"davis under pressure to disown criticism of civil service chief on brexit","story":"Minister seeks to defuse row after backlash to claims he wanted Oliver Robbins sidelinedBrexit secretary David Davis has sought to defuse tensions with No 10 by playing down reports that he might resign unless Theresa May sidelines Whitehall’s top civil servant working on Britain’s exit from the EU.After unexpected interventions from the cabinet secretary Jeremy Heywood and May’s close aide Gavin Barwell defending Oliver Robbins, an aide to Davis said on Sunday evening that no such threats had been made. The aide added that Davis considered Robbins to be “a fantastic civil servant”.Davis’s intervention comes in a crucial week for May who faces a tense Brexit inner cabinet meeting on Wednesday when she is expected to discuss a plan, backed by Robbins, to create a customs partnership with the EU. Another option on the table is the so-called “max fac” – or maximum facilitation – solution, using technology to minimise the need for border checks.According to the Sunday Times, Davis told the prime minister to ignore Robbins in favour of her ministers.Robbins, tipped as a future cabinet secretary, was moved from Davis’s Brexit department into No 10 last year as May sought to take greater control over the process.A former minister claimed that Tory backbenchers could be willing to oust May if she does not stop listening to her adviser on the customs partnership plan.EU members (plus Turkey, Andorra, Monaco and San Marino) trade without customs duties, taxes or tariffs between themselves, and charge the same tariffs on imports from outside the EU. Customs union members cannot negotiate their own trade deals outside the EU, which is why leaving it – while hopefully negotiating a bespoke arrangement – has been one of the government’s Brexit goals.\u0026nbspSee our full Brexit phrasebook.“The prime minister would be extraordinarily unwise to take Robbins’s advice on this,” they told the newspaper. “There will be a very swift and very violent reaction. It will put the prime minister in personal peril.” Attacks on Robbins provoked an angry response from civil servants on Sunday morning. Dave Penman, the head of the FDA union, said: “Is there a more despicable form of political cowardice than to allow anonymous briefings in your name to effectively call for a civil servant to be sacked?“Civil servants advise, ministers decide. Politicians of all stripes know this. If David Davis leaves these comments from a ‘close ally’ out there unchallenged, it ultimately suggests that he supports them but isn’t brave enough to say so publicly.”Heywood also took the unusual step of tweeting about criticisms of Robbins. After May’s close aide Gavin Barwell retweeted a statement from the chief whip, Julian Smith, saying “Attacking ind civil servants is deeply unfair”, Heywood wrote:Under Robbins’ plan, the UK would collect import tariffs on behalf of Brussels, while being free to set its own duties for goods bound for the UK. Pro-Brexit Conservatives have described the plan as unworkable and say it will allow Brussels to dictate UK trade policy.An aide to Davis said the Sunday Times story was wrong, and added the Brexit secretary had praised Robbins in an interview with the newspaper on Monday but his words had not been published. According to the aide, Davis said in the interview: “Olly is a fantastic civil servant.... He’s the sherpa, he’s the PM’s sherpa and what do sherpas do? They get you to base camp so you can make the assault on the summit. It’s fine.”Senior Tory backbencher Bernard Jenkin said on Sunday that a customs partnership plan would mean the UK acting as a “tax collector” for the EU and would fail the prime minister’s key tests for a deal with Brussels. “It doesn’t pass any of the key tests that the prime minister has outlined in her statements,” he told BBC1’s Sunday Politics programme. “It doesn’t give us full regulatory autonomy so we wouldn’t be able to do free trade deals with other countries,” he added. The Brexiter business group Leave Means Leave has called for Robbins to be sacked and “replaced by someone from outside the civil service who will take a tough line with Brussels”.Richard Tice and John Longworth of the Brexit-backing business group wrote: “At each stage, Robbins has presided over a bungled negotiating position on behalf of the UK, giving leverage to the EU and acquiescing to their every whim in a way no business person would do.”In a further development, Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, has told the UK the time has come for it to “resolve the contradictions” in its Irish border policy.Writing in Ireland’s Sunday Independent newspaper ahead of a visit to the country on Monday, he said there will need to be “substantial progress” on the border issue by the next major meeting of EU leaders, who are due to assess progress on the border issue at a summit in June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fc75899cbe64170d23a20947d81aecc3f955ccd/17_42_2521_1512/master/2521.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e330361f2033d6a28e48db8a0ce5249f","title":"lewis hamilton wins azerbaijan grand prix red bulls collide","story":"From formulaic through to a denouement that simply could not have been scripted, the streets of Baku were once again the stage for a compelling, dramatic performance. Where cool heads were called for at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix there was not a little abandon and in its wake fortune too played its part to deliver an unlikely result in a season already notable for refusing to stick to a predictable plot.Lewis Hamilton took the win but it is unlikely to be a favoured memory. He inherited first place with two laps to go from his Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas, who had looked nailed on for the victory until a puncture caused by debris ended his charge, leaving the Finn disconsolate.Behind Hamilton his championship rival, Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel, for some time in control of the race, saw his hopes disappear after a late safety car when he sacrificed calm consideration for an overambitious lunge that reduced him to fourth place.This most unlikely turnaround at the front was reflected in an equally unexpected reversal of the championship standings. Trailing Vettel by nine points before Baku, Hamilton leaves four points to the good, the first time he has topped the table this season.Hamilton, who had not been on the pace all weekend and never looked like threatening for the lead, was honest about his good fortune. “It was mixed emotions,” he said. “Grateful for the opportunity to win but on the other side I did not drive the way I feel like I normally drive, so that hurts a little bit in my heart.”A likely win at the first round in Melbourne was denied Hamilton after a late safety car and he may feel that some justice has been served. But perhaps there will be more satisfaction that his chance of a win here last year was ultimately denied after Vettel barged him. “I was coming out of the last corner in disbelief,” he said. “It was very emotional. In previous years here I have been in the lead and then something went against me. I said maybe third time lucky and it was that scenario today.”Bottas’s ill-fortune and Hamilton’s good favour was the final part of a thrilling last act. Behind them the Red Bulls had been offering a fine narrative of their own, with Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen going wheel to wheel throughout. It was nail-biting stuff but the team had let them race, a decision they came to regret when the Australian went for a pass into the braking zone of turn one. Verstappen had already moved once and then shifted back to the inside where Ricciardo had committed. A terminal collision ensued. The stewards concluded that both were responsible, Verstappen for changing lines twice and Ricciardo for making his move too late. Both were given reprimands.Disappointment was writ large on the faces of the drivers, but that was as nothing to the condemnation from the team principal, Christian Horner. “We are not apportioning blame, they are both to blame,” he said. “They have been reminded that they are part of a team, they are highly paid iniduals and have to act with the team’s interests at heart, not just their own. That message was delivered very clearly.”The safety car the incident caused proved crucial. It allowed Mercedes to pit Bottas, who had stayed out long on his tyres and inherited the lead, to emerge still in front of Vettel.A further lack of focus saw Romain Grosjean put his Haas into the wall on lap 43 while weaving, and that kept the safety car out longer than expected. Five laps later at the restart Bottas had control, but Vettel did not. He charged up the inside into one, far too hot, locked up, went wide and lost places to Hamilton and Kimi Räikkönen, who was second, and then to Force India’s Sergio Pérez who took third, his team’s first podium of the year.It was not the percentage manoeuvre of a championship contender but the German insisted he had no regrets. “I am happy I tried the move. I am not happy it didn’t work. You have to try.” That’s a view he may come to consider again if the season goes to the wire.A lap later Bottas had to face his own slings and arrows, grinding to a halt amid disintegrating rubber. “It was just unfortunate. Unlucky. Ten pints of beer and maybe I will be fine,” said the visibly disappointed Finn. “I will get through it, you always have to get through, it is part of racing but at the moment it is painful.”Hamilton felt for Bottas but knows that he and his team have real work ahead. Their issue with bringing the tyres up to temperature looked no closer to being solved in Baku and he acknowledged that they had to address it.For the moment, however, he leaves with a lead, favoured by fortune but also more than aware that he kept his head and seized the reward. It was cause for the four-time world champion to remember the lesson he had learned in karting. “I never give up,” he said. “It has been a while since I have been reminded of that lesson my dad taught me years ago. I kept pushing and things turned out the way they did and that was a realisation of how true that mindset is.”Carlos Sainz in the Renault finished in fifth, while Charles Leclerc completed an exemplary afternoon and the rookie’s best drive thus far in F1 to take sixth for Sauber. The two McLarens of Fernando Alonso and Stoffel Vandoorne were seventh and ninth, with Lance Stroll eighth in the Williams and the Toro Rosso of Brendon Hartley 10th."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3ebd3dd85a355c10540fd95586b02dd6122b56e/92_142_3982_2389/master/3982.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c15d07187fb33f04fd94b859b620160","title":"azerbaijan grand prix f1 formula one live","story":"Lewis Hamilton won the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, thanks to a crash between the Red Bulls that inconvenienced Sebastian Vettel, and a puncture before the line that ruined Valtteri Bottas Otherwise that’s us - enjoy what’s left of the weekend! And here’s your report on an absolute jazzer of a race. Red Bull’s philosophy is not to stop team-mates fighting and the drivers seem ok with it, so I imagine that’ll be the end of things. Until next time. Verstappen said originally it was hard racing, but what happened afterwards was “not good”. He says they have to make sure it doesn’t happen again - he and Ricciardo are fine, and when you race “you go for every inch”. More from Hamilton: “It was an emotional race. Valtteri did an exceptional job and deserved the win. It feels odd to be up here but I have got to take it. It was an untidy race for me.”Bottas is unhappy, and hiding behind dark glasses. How do you handle the disappointment, he’s asked. “Ten pints of beer.”Nikki Lauda reckons they should’ve cleaned up the track properly, and Bottas should now be celebrating. Gosh, what a race that was. Can they come here every week? The trophies are presented. Hamilton shakes up his booze as does Perez, while Raikkonen has a swig of his. We hear the UK and German anthems. It’s very moving. Odds and sods: Charles Leclerc of Monaco and Sauber has scored his first ever points. Well in, my man. Hamilton hasn’t done much celebrating, which is fair enough. His team-mate had a mare, so it’s not being rubbed in, but points are points Raikkonen hugs his wife and is happy. He struggled a bit to keep his tyres warm enough, but here he is. Hamilton says it feels “a little bit harsh” to have won, but he kept pushing and he’ll take it. Lewis Hamilton is well pleased with himself. Yes, I know, but more even than usual. So, our results:“Well done Lewis. Lady luck was on our side today, but my heart goes out to Valtteri.”This does not tell us the whole story. Lap 5151: Hamilton is going to score points for the 29th consecutive race. Not bad. Lap 5151: No he doesn’t I was misinformed. Perez is good for another podium, which will make him the most decorated Mexican driver ever. Lap 5051: Perez has a five-second penalty, so will end up behind Stroll. Lap 4951: Hamilton hasn’t won a race since Austin last term, but here he is, and he’ll be double-chuffed to learn that Perez has gone by Vettel! He is now fourth! Lap 4951: Dearie me! Hamilton is going to win having barely been in the race! Poor old Valtteri! Lap 4951: Bottas runs over debris and has a puncture! Ouch! Lap 4851: What a mess this has been for Ferrari. Going in when the safety car came out instead of staying in front, then opting to attack instead of defend. Lap 4851: Hamilton is gaining on Bottas, Vettel fights back, his wheels locks, and Hamilton and Raikkonen pass him! Trying to win has cost him two places! Lap 4751: The safety car is on the way out..Lap 4751: It looks like we’re getting our dash to the line. Bottas could do with another quick prang behind him. Lap 4651: We might just get a restart. In the meantime:Lap 4551: Grossjean’s car is about to be wynched off the track. Grossjean himself stalks into the garage and theatrically chucks his gloves, but not at himself. Lap 4451: There’s all sorts of mess on the track. I’m not sure what kind of race we’ve got left here. Lap 4451: Apparently Christian Horner was “shaking with rage”. I’d love to know what that feels like. Lap 4351: Roman Grossjean, who was going well in fifth, has crashed behind the safety car while weaving to keep the tyres warm! That keep it out for longer, which might be enough for Bottas! Lap 4351: Is the plural of Red Bull Reds Bull?Lap 4351: Christian Horner is refusing to comment until he’s spoken to the drivers. I’m not certain he’s entirely happy with them. Lap 4251: That Red Bull crash doesn’t get less comical. The pair of cars, in the pits together, you’ve got to laugh. Lap 4151: Mercedes have played this really well. By keeping Bottas out there as long as possible they allowed for the possibility of a safety car, and they got one. Will Vettel go for the win, or keep second on the basis that Bottas isn’t going to challenge for the driver’s championship?Lap 4151: So what we’ve got now is Bottas in front - Ferrari put fresh tyres on - Vettel, then Hamilton. The charge when the safety car goes, and to the line, is going to be something. Lap 4051: Ricciardo wanted to go by on the left, Verstappen said no, Ricciardo was dummying him and went the other way, then shunted him in the jacksie. Their boss will probably want a quiet one. Lap 4051: Here comes the safety car, and Bottas pits. Lap 4051: The longer Bottas stays out ... excuse me while I interrupt myself! Ricciardo smashes into the front of Verstappen! Both are done! there is going to be trouble! Lap 3851: Bottas stays out for one more lap. He’ll come out ahead of Hamilton, but will he be able to challenge Vettel. Lap 3851: Ricciardo goes on and comes out with ultras, getting out in front of Raikkonen. He can now spend the rest of hi afternoon ruckusing with Versatappen.Lap 3751 If Bottas goes on ultrasofts, Hamilton will presumably have to let him by to try and challenge Vettel, then be allowed back in front if - when - no impression is made. Lap 3651: Bottas is still out there. Lap 3551: Ricciardo sets about Verstappen! He goes by after chilling in the slipstream and locking up, but times it well enough to maintain the advantage. Lap 3451: Bottas probably has enough to get in and out ahead of Hamilton, who trails him by roundabout 19 seconds. Vettel is 11.755 off the front. Lap 3351: Bottas is lapping faster than Hamilton at the moment, while behind the, Red Bull are staying out to get clear of Raikkonen. Lap 3252: The question for Bottas, or for Mercedes, is whether to stay out longer and try and get to the end on a supersoft. Do they want their drivers racing each other? Lap 3151: In to the pits goes Vettel, copying Hamilton’s soft tyes. He comes out behind Bottas, who still needs to pit. Lap 3051: We’ve hardly seen Vettel still, so absolute is and has been his domination. Bottas has just set the fastest lap, and is miles ahead of Hamilton. Lap 2851: Hamilton reckons his tyres aren’t great, but is told they should get him to the end. In the meantime, Ricciardo, hot on Verstappen’s tail, sets the fastest lap. He’s still fifth, mind. Lap 2751: Ricciardo attacks Verstappen, looks to be past, but Verstappen closes the door! Their manager probably isn’t loving this, watching them lose time fighting with one another, but whatchagonnado.Lap 2651: We see Holkenberg walking up the stairs, day did. Vettel leads by ten seconds, and Hamilton is a further nine back."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c78a6752ddc87334885bab643e6014ce26bb6cd2/0_99_4295_2577/master/4295.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f199043976766c68e91089e4d28d634","title":"cavaliers pacers live game 7 nba playoffs","story":"Indiana finally starts cooking here.

But talk matters, as is demonstrated in Sarah Daniels’ 1983 play Masterpieces, which was derided by many male critics on its premiere, and now gets a timely revival.In an early scene, set at a dinner party, the men delight in telling sexist jokes about rape in front of the women. But Daniels’ ground-breaking play makes the link between misogynistic jokes and misogynistic actions. Set in pre-internet times when porn came between pages, it also suggests that porn that depicts sexual violence against women leads to real violence against women and harassment.This consciousness-raising story may lack the complexities of 21st-century gender politics, but doesn’t lack impact. Rowena (Olivia Darnley giving the production’s only memorable performance) is a social worker who thinks herself happily married and little of the fact that when her job keeps her out late at night she feels afraid of being alone on the streets.When a client is abused and she starts to investigate the pornography that her husband and his friends think is normal, she becomes angry and takes action. “How they must hate us,” she says on seeing one image.Daniels’s play, rightly kept in period by director Melissa Dunne, sometimes shows its age. But it also reminds us, in the era of #MeToo, that perhaps progress in the way men talk, think about and treat women has been less dramatic than we might think. The men in Masterpieces wear their misogyny like a badge of pride: today, it is more likely to be covert.The play is a fascinating example of radical non-linear storytelling, and it’s only a pity that it doesn’t get a sharper, stronger production than Dunne manages here. A small cast playing multiple roles makes demands that are clumsily handled and a lack of pace, fluidity and clarity do Daniels’ provoking drama no favours.

Talk to Books lets you ask whole questions, and pulls up a list of responses from 100,000 books in the Google Books database. In theory, this is incredible. We know the internet is a trash can of terrible people and misinformation – a kitten clutching a cat-print edition of Mein Kampf and aggressively selling you maxi dresses. But books! Books are portals to the greatest minds of recorded time. Why ask Jeeves when you can ask PG Wodehouse? Or Montaigne or Tolstoy or Woolf? They’re sure to know more than Reddit. And at times, the tool does seem strangely wise.But there’s also something disorienting in the experiment, in which answers are given to slightly different questions than the one I ask. Sometimes they’re dry and literal. “What is death?” generates passages from medical textbooks, but nothing more spiritual. “Do you know the way to San Jose?” pulls up a Los Angeles hiking guide, which advises me to take the 118 Freeway West, then park in a dirt lot to the right. But it doesn’t ask where I’m coming from. I’m not sure I know where it’s coming from either – frequently, it sounds quite mad. “How deep is your love?” yields Charles Darwin’s thoughts on the evolutionary reduction of crest in Silk fowl. (Probably good the Bee Gees cut that verse.)It is refreshing, though, to step away from personalising algorithms and data tracking, which have given us a curiously claustrophobic internet, closer to a hall of mirrors. We’ve built a servile model of technology, and invariably imagine its flipside – the single-minded, aggressive robot uprising. Talk to Books presents an alternative vision of AI: the rambling pub bore. Semi-coherent, undeniably literate, accidentally profound. It suggests the future of the internet may be far stranger than predicted.

A no-holds-barred Olympics, in which six-year-olds compete against sports professionals, who are encouraged to take all the steroids and stem cells they can handle, to level the field. Imagine the potential of cross-country tag, or a violent-reprisals version of Simon says, or test-match length ring a ring o’ roses, played to the point of collapse.

McDonald was joined by the Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, who said there should be an inquiry into why En+ was allowed to float in a deal that earned banks, lawyers, auditors and PR firms £25m in fees.Cable said it was “very odd that we will follow Trump into military action, but won’t join in imposing tough sanctions on oligarchs”. On the En+ listing, he said: “There should be a review of this flotation. When Russian oligarchs are using the London markets to raise money we must take a strict line on scrutiny.”Six banks shared an estimated half of the £25m with the largest share taken by the lead bookrunner, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Citigroup, Credit Suisse, JP Morgan and Russian banks Sberbank and VTB Capital would have shared the rest. The remainder was to be shared by lawyers including Linklaters and White \u0026amp Case with smaller auditors KPMG and financial PR specialists Finsbury.En+ is a holding company for Deripaska’s metal and energy interests. He built his business empire during Russia’s so-called aluminium wars following the post-Soviet privatisations of the 1990s. It floated in London last November, raising $1bn which was used to pay back borrowings owed to VTB, a bank prevented by sanctions from raising capital in the EU and the US.The City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), approved the flotation, but a fortnight ago Deripaska was one of 38 Russian business leaders the US Treasury targeted because of “malign activity” on the part of Vladimir Putin’s government.En+’s share price tumbled as a result, and the stock is now priced at $6, less than half the $14 flotation price. A string of independent directors have resigned although the company’s chairman, the former Conservative minister Lord Barker of Battle, remains the firm’s figurehead. Finsbury no longer advises En+, saying its mandate only extended to the listing.The US Treasury cited Russia’s support for Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, malicious cyber activities, the occupation of Crimea and support for violence in eastern Ukraine as its reasoning for putting the sanctions in place. They were already in preparation when the UK accused Putin’s government of being behind the poisoning of the Skripals in Salisbury.An FCA spokesperson said the regulator had responded to the Trump administration’s action by delisting a class of En+ shares aimed at US citizens, but that it had no plans to take any further action because the British government had not asked it to.Deripaska is one of Russia’s best connected international businessmen. Paul Manafort, the former head of Donald Trump’s election campaign who is fighting fraud and tax charges brought by special counsel Robert Mueller, worked for Deripaska for many years.Criticising the British failure to follow the US example, McDonnell said: “The City of London cannot risk to be seen as a light touch when it comes to imposing effective sanctions on Russia and clamping down on foreign oligarchs linked to the regime. In this case, it looks like once again we have been playing catch-up with regulators in other countries.”EN+ did not respond to a request for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da8a2b6483c373a8c35387af7848693464225378/0_84_3916_2350/master/3916.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80f9a107c7498a889d8d718fd1df54b0","title":"north korea denuclearization john bolton mike pompeo","story":"North Korea will have to show concrete and tangible evidence it has made a strategic decision to give up nuclear weapons before any move is made to ease pressure on the regime, Donald Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, said on Sunday.With a summit between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un potentially as close as three weeks away, Bolton warned that no progress would be made without verifiable evidence of Pyongyang’s commitment to complete and “irreversible” denuclearization. “What we want to see from them is evidence that it’s real and not just rhetoric,” he told CBS’ Face the Nation.The famously hawkish Bolton took a notably less hardline approach than was reflected in his many disparaging remarks towards North Korea before he was brought into the White House earlier this month. In one typical comment on Fox News he made what he called a joke: “How do you know the North Korean regime is lying – answer, their lips are moving.”Now Bolton is striking a more nuanced position. In an interview with Fox News Sunday, he stressed that the US had made no commitment to remove its military presence from the Korean peninsula and said: “There’s nobody in the Trump administration who’s starry-eyed about what’s happening here.”He went on to say that if North Korea were willing to allow full and complete disclosure of its nuclear weapons programme coupled with international verification, “things could move quickly”.Hopes of a breakthrough in dismantling North Korea’s nuclear weapons at a Trump-Kim summit have risen in the wake of fast-moving events. Details emerging from the office of South Korean president Moon Jae-in following his historic face-to-face encounter with Kim suggest the North Korean leader offered to allow foreign inspectors and journalists to witness nuclear decommissioning ahead of the Trump summit.The Trump administration is remaining noncommittal about such dramatic posturing from Kim, as the US tries to walk a hazardous path that both pursues a breakthrough and remains aware of broken promises made in the past. In his first interview as secretary of state, former CIA director Mike Pompeo characterized the current flurry of diplomatic activity as a “real opportunity for something that would be transformative for the world if we could achieve it”.Pompeo spoke to ABC’s This Week from Saudi Arabia, giving generally stilted answers and bringing the interview to an abrupt close after facing questions on US strategy. He declined to reveal intelligence on North Korean nuclear capabilities and said repeatedly: “This administration has its eyes wide open.”He added: “We know the history, we know the risks. We’re going to negotiate in a different way than before, we’re going to require steps that demonstrate denuclearization is going to be achieved. We’re not going to take promises or words, we are going to look for actions and deeds.”Earlier this year, Pompeo had a secret meeting with Kim in Pyongyang, lasting more than an hour. He told ABC it had been a “good conversation. We talked about serious matters, on the hardest issues that face our two countries.”Bolton went into further details about subjects that Trump will want to raise should the summit with Kim go ahead at a time and location still to be determined. North Korean ballistic missile programs, biological and chemical weapons programs, and the “abduction of innocent Japanese and South Korean citizens over the years” would all be on the list, Bolton said.Despite the reticence on the part of both Pompeo and Bolton to go into details about the precise US gameplan, top administration figures were outspoken on one point: all praise for current extraordinary events should be bestowed on Trump.The most passionate proponent of that idea is Trump himself. At a rally in Michigan on Saturday night he told the crowd: “I had one of the fake news groups this morning saying: ‘What do you think President Trump had to do with it?’ I’ll tell you what. Like, how about everything?”In response, there were chants of “Nobel! Nobel!”, in reference to the Nobel peace prize.Bolton made the same point on Sunday to CBS, albeit in more measured terms: “I think it’s clear we’re here where we are today because of the pressure that the Trump administration has put on North Korea. Economic pressure, political, military pressure. I think this is widely recognized.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16e00e75dc5dcab0b3117dae8cff980942cb5fe0/0_125_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b7ea4849a94285542a873c553d6b92a","title":"ramadan eid fun fashion halal lipstick retailers economy","story":"Muslims observing Ramadan are increasingly being targeted by supermarkets and brands in the UK, which has led to a rise in spending on food and gifts during the month, according to new research.The Ramadan economy in the UK is worth at least £200m, with supermarket chains such as Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons increasingly gearing products, displays and special offers on popular food items to Ramadan in areas with significant Muslim populations. This year, for example, Morrisons is selling a Ramadan countdown calendar, similar to an Advent calendar, aimed at children.The month-long Muslim religious observance starts in mid-May and its ending is marked with the Eid al-Fitr holiday. MAC cosmetics, the Body Shop and Goa chocolates are some of the brands specifically packaging goods as Eid gifts.Despite the trend, more than three-quarters of British Muslims want retailers to pay even more attention to Ramadan, according to the Great British Ramadan, a study by an Islamic marketing consultancy Ogilvy Noor.“Muslims feel that Ramadan and Eid are ignored, the report says. “They see the nation proudly gravitate towards cultural and religious holidays such as Chinese New Year and Diwali. They are saying it’s also time to embrace Ramadan and Eid.”In an indication of growing awareness of the lucrative opportunities of the Muslim market, Westfield London, Europe’s largest shopping centre, is hosting its first Eid festival in June. It will include live catwalk shows, pop-up food stalls, special offers and performances.“The Muslim pound is seen as a valuable and largely untapped opportunity in the UK economy,” says festival promotional material.The global Islamic economy is forecast to be worth more than £3 trillion by 2021, according to the State of the Global Islamic Economy report, and is growing at nearly double the rate of the general worldwide economy. The sector includes halal food, Islamic finance, halal travel, modest fashion, halal media and recreation, and halal pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.Shelina Janmohamed, vice-president of Ogilvy Noor and author of a 2016 book, Generation M: Young Muslims Changing the World, says: “The Ramadan season is one of complete life transformation, which brings with it an economic surge.“We conservatively estimate this to be upwards of £200m each year, covering everything from financial planning to food, eating out, clothes, toys and gifting. Following only Christmas and Easter in scale and size, this is surely Britain’s biggest untapped business opportunity.”Many of the UK’s four million Muslims begin to prepare for Ramadan two weeks before its start date, which is determined by the lunar calendar. The month is characterised by sunrise-to-sunset fasting. Although in some countries the working day is adjusted to accommodate the season, for many British Muslims the fasting requirement is complicated by the need to continue working or studying.For the second year running, Ramadan falls within the six-week summer exam season, which means hundreds of thousands of school and university students have to take exams when their concentration may be impaired by lack of sleep, food and water.The absence of official recognition in the UK of the three-day Eid holiday immediately following the end of Ramadan means traditional visits to family and friends end up being spread over two weekends.“In the UK, you don’t have three days of shutdown over Eid like you do in the Middle East,” says Janmohamed. “Only about half of people take time off work, so Eid visits and celebrations are spread out.”She said brands and retailers should wake up to the opportunities of the Ramadan season. “If brands can play a useful role in Muslims’ experience of Ramadan, if they can help with planning or freeing up time for spiritual or social activities, that is very welcome.”Almost two-thirds of Muslims plan financially for Ramadan and Eid, the study found. More than half are concerned about their concentration during the month-long daylight fast and two-thirds worry about dehydration. Young men in particular are concerned about maintaining fitness and some gyms in areas with big Muslim populations adjust opening times to allow exercise between iftar, the sunset meal that breaks the fast, and suhoor, the pre-dawn meal.The majority of British Muslims eat a range of food over the two meals, with chicken and chips a favourite for 18-to-24-year-olds. Despite the long hours of fasting, four in 10 married women say putting on weight during Ramadan is a worry. Gift-giving, buying new clothes, eating out and family gatherings are key features of the Eid holiday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7367799adc822bdfd24c4f8625cef7eff67e830/0_80_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35d69f76f4e11be8bdd1e38e50a78438","title":"my financial future can i have my brunch and eat it too","story":"The options appear to be: never socialise and stay in to save for a house, or live a normal, modern urban life and spiral into debt. But is there a third way?Sitting firmly in the middle of the millennial generation (those born 1981-2000) and I’m told I could easily afford to buy my first home in London if I just give up: coffee, my gym membership, an annual weekend away, takeaway food, and a mobile upgrade, or one night out a week, for five years – or avocados.Sure, London living is afforded by renting the equivalent of a dodgy hostel dorm, nights out revolving around two-for-one deals, and “side-hustles”, which is a glorified term for my three jobs. So, should I accept that I can’t have my brunch and eat it too? Living paycheck to paycheck isn’t the dream and maybe neither is owning a home, but there must be a way I could at least consider the option.I’m certainly not alone, but maybe we’re placing too much value on “Yolo” – apparently a typical habit of young people today – so I’ve asked Paul Bridgwater, head of commercial and proposition at financial services provider OneFamily, and millennial lifestyle and personal finance expert Lisa Rowan from The Penny Hoarder what they think – and luckily neither suggested a five-year period where I give up all that I hold dear.Is it really that hard to save in a big city or am I being led astray?Rowan suggests that, unfortunately, it’s not all in my head. “Affordable, low-amenity units are being replaced with luxury buildings that are simply out of reach for many people, especially young people in the early stages of their careers,” she says. “This competitive housing environment means more workers in their 20s and 30s are enduring long commutes from the suburbs or are living with several roommates in order to make the most of their budgets.” But, Bridgwater says, while it can feel unattainable without the help from “the bank of mum and dad” we do have the benefit of living in a connected, digital age that can help us achieve our financial goals.I really value my social life – do I have to give up a chunk of it for five years?No, says Rowan, but there are some hacks to help make sure you don’t spend most of your monthly wages during the excitement of payday. In short, be at least a bit prepared. “Knowing the type of activity upfront can help you determine whether an event is a social and financial priority for you – then, it’s easier to make compromises. You may skip on the 12-person birthday dinner at a fancy restaurant, but you can still meet the group for drinks or dessert afterward. You can still go on a bar crawl with your friends, but perhaps eat a hearty meal before you leave the house,” she says.Bridgwater agrees, and says it’s safe to assume that most of your friends are in the same boat, so be straight up with them. “Money is a bit of a taboo subject for any age group, especially in the UK. On a practical level, earnings, savings and debts are not really discussed and perhaps they should be,” he says. “Like anything else in life, by talking and sharing issues, interesting solutions will come to light.”OK, so maybe I should be budgeting. What are some handy guidelines?Bridgwater says that budgeting isn’t the same for everyone, but taking away the temptation to spend is often the easiest way to save. “Create different accounts for your big expenses (housing, bills and savings) and then set up a standing order into these accounts one to two days after your wages go in from your main account. You’ll then know the money you have left in your main account is money you can spend,” he says.So, can I think about saving for a big purchase and still keep seeing my friends?Yes, says Rowan: “You can have your instant and delayed gratification at the same time.” A product like OneFamily’s stocks and shares Lifetime Isa is a good start when considering your options. With a Lifetime Isa, for every £4 put in, the government adds £1 – so save up to £4,000 a year and get £1,000 as a bonus (available after 12 months). Lifetime Isas are available either based on cash investments, which can be preferable for first-time house purchases in the short-term or stocks and shares investments, which might be preferable if you are aiming to buy your first home in five or more years, as they offer potentially better returns over the longer term, but be aware that capital is at risk.For information on the OneFamily stocks and shares Lifetime Isa, visit OneFamily.

The condition of a school for children with autism and profound intellectual disabilities in Co Cork has been compared to that of an orphanage in an underdeveloped country.They say the school, which has 43 pupils aged between four and 18, has not received any major refurbishment since it opened 20 years ago and students are going without physiotherapyoccupational therapy rooms or a sensory garden.Concerned parents and the school’s management have set up a Go Fund Me page in an attempt to raise funds after growing frustrated at the lack of action on addressing the issues by the Department of Education.“The parents say they feel forgotten. These are children who should be our number one priority,” he said.Sinead Desmond, chair of St Gabriel’s Parent’s Association, says the principal and teachers do everything in their power to assist the students, who are all non verbal, but that the primitive surroundings they find themselves in make this difficult.Ms Desmond said that when the building was originally purchased in the 1990s it was never intended for use as a special needs school. She said it was not suitably upgraded and the conditions resemble those seen in documentaries about old-fashioned orphanages in underdeveloped countries.“This is happening in Cork. My son Max’s wheelchair doesn’t fit in to the toilets in the school. So there are no toilet facilities for children in wheelchairs. It is fine when Max is seven and he is small and they can lift him on to a changing bed,” she said. “But they have men there who are 17 and 18 years old and are 6ft tall with complex medical needs. They are trying to maintain their dignity and they can’t. “Ms Desmond said many of the children have compromised immune systems which leave them vulnerable to infection in bad conditions.She said the school’s principal gave parents her blessing to speak out about the issues because they are running out of time after years of unsuccessfully applying for funding.“Our children only get one shot at childhood. Their childhood already has so many limitations and struggles that their school building really shouldn’t be one of them,” she said. “In Max’s classroom you used to have to open the door and stand back and a gush of dirty water from the roof would fall down. They had buckets collecting water in the classroom. The children in the senior side have nothing.”She added: “Regardless of how bad the building is (the students) love going to school every day. They love the staff. The principal is like a mom to those children but this building is substandard.”St Gabriel’s Special School, which is under the patronage of the Brothers of Charity Southern Services, is hoping to raise €200,000 through its online appeal.A Department of Education spokesman said the Government was committed to ensuring every child with special educational needs had the opportunity to fulfil their potential. He said the department was aware of the accommodation needs at St Gabriel’s and is committed to working with the school to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Hardeep Singh running unaccredited Isles International University with Dublin addressIrish women can be trusted to make the right decisions about their treatment, says medicDublin to Belfast Enterprise Service which runs on route suspended until further noticeCouple who had to go to UK for termination say No campaign posters cause anguishSolicitor for Alison McCormack calls for review of pathologist\u0026rsquos cases at St James\u0026rsquosContentious two-storey religious and cultural centre meets stiff opposition from locals\u0026lsquoIdea is to encourage people to bring their dogs out and encourage good pet ownership\u0026rsquoMary Lou McDonald critical of way Vicky Phelan \u0026lsquopursued and forced into court\u0026rsquoClimate change scientists base findings on what happened to Scotland\u0026rsquos last glaciersOnline funding appeal seeks to improve conditions at St Gabriel\u0026rsquos in BishopstownDavid Gavin failed to return to surface while swimming in British Columbia last JuneOfficer being treated in hospital for injuries to hand, head and body after Ballyogan assaultControversy after figures show 206 women may have had a delayed cancer diagnosisCouple told to wait for heartbeat to stop in pregnancy that would not go to full termPhelan\u0026rsquos court case brought to light failings of the CervicalCheck screening programmeInitiative follows rise in number of collisions and death of boy (12) in Dublin incident"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3478271.1525024171!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eighth amendment causing uncertainty for doctors gynaecologist","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Fine Gael  pressing for a Yes vote in the upcoming referendum on the Eighth Amendment. Photograph: Nick BradshawThe Eighth Amendment should be repealed as it is causing uncertainty and difficulty for doctors and delaying the treatment of seriously ill women, a gynaecologist has said. Speaking at the launch of Fine Gael’s Yes campaign in Cork, Prof Richard Greene said the amendment and the termination of pregnancy were difficult issues with both sides of the debate offering opposing views as to how it affects practitioners and patients. “How does it affect me as a clinician, dealing daily with women and I’ve been working in obstetrics and gynaecology for nearly 30 years? I would say the simplest message I would give about the Eighth Amendment is that it muddies the water –we just don’t have clarity about how we should practise,” said Prof Greene, who works at University College Cork and Cork University Maternity Hospital.He offered examples of how the amendment, which guarantees an equal right to life to the mother and child, has an impact on his work at the hospital. He cited the case of a woman he called Sheila, who presented at 13-14 weeks pregnant with her cervix already open in a pregnancy that she really wanted.“Sheila’s water bag around the baby had gone, the chance that this baby would survive is about one or two in 1,000. The chances of that baby’s lungs developing are limited and the risk of infection is very significant and we have to achieve another 10 weeks of pregnancy to get her to a viable gestation,” he said. “But I have to actually wait until her life is at risk to do what I know is an appropriate treatment. Yes, the 2013 Protection Of Life in Pregnancy Act will allow me to act once her life is in danger but effectively the Eighth Amendment is dictating a tardiness for both Sheila and myself.”Prof Greene also instanced the case of a woman he called Nancy who presented with an ectopic pregnancy, in which the foetus was outside the uterus and unviable. She was also showing signs of bleeding which put her life at risk, he said.“We discuss it with Nancy and her partner. The decision is made to treat her surgically and remove the pregnancy. There is a heartbeat but they accept that it is the appropriate treatment and it meets all the legal requirements,” he said.“However, I leave her and I am called to come back and counsel her again because she overhears a conversation where one staff member says to the other, ‘Is this legal, the baby’s heart is still beating?’ So the correct choice of care is being questioned because of the Eighth Amendment.”Prof Greene also gave the example of a couple he named Martina and Joe who suffered “a profound loss of pregnancy at 38 weeks when their baby was stillborn” and three subsequent miscarriages before Martina became pregnant again only to discover the baby had anencephaly.“This baby is not going to survive, it may be born alive but it will not survive. They were devastated given their story but they were absolutely horrified at the idea we had to wait for the pregnancy to proceed and go to the end of the pregnancy, knowing there was nothing to get out of it,” he said.“And the question they were asking was why cannot we do something now so that we can at least try again and hopefully have a child and I saw the horrendous pain they went through. In the end, the Eighth Amendment was adding to their grief and mental trauma.“They eventually went to the UK for a termination but they are still pained by all of this. They never had a baby to take home, they had no burial place, they had no service with their family. Martina’s physical life was not in danger but they are psychologically traumatised because of it.”Prof Greene accepted some believe the floodgates would open if the Eighth Amendment was repealed but the evidence from Eastern Europe and some US states where free contraception and early healthcare were provided suggested the number of terminations can be reduced multifold.“I trust the women I looked after in pregnancy and I can honestly tell you they make good decisions after much consideration before they undertake a termination. The Eighth Amendment is affecting women and doctors in providing good healthcare and that’s why I’m supporting a Yes vote.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3478188.1525018581!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mosque scheme in kilkenny heading way of planning board","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA copy of the Koran in a mosque. Trustees of the Kilkenny Islamic Centre have applied for planning permission for a religious and cultural centre. Photograph: Getty ImagesA controversial proposal to build a mosque and cultural centre on a site near the edge of Kilkenny city is likely to end up before An Bórd Pleanála, regardless of what decision the local council makes.Trustees of the Kilkenny Islamic Centre have applied to Kilkenny County Council for planning permission for a two-storey religious and cultural centre at the Hebron Industrial Estate but the plan has met with significant opposition locally, with one objector collecting 1,035 signatures against the idea.The deadline for submissions on the application has passed and 40 have been lodged with the council, most of them opposing the project. This follows a public meeting marked by angry scenes and concerns raised about the plan.The Green Party’s former mayor of Kilkenny Cllr Malcolm Noonan said at the weekend the “hate speech” voiced in recent weeks in relation to the proposal came from “a small number of people, most of whom have no connection to Kilkenny, nor are affected by the proposed mosque”.He said he would be supportive of the application “if it meets the planning requirements”.Cllr Noonan attended an open inter-cultural day hosted by the Kilkenny Islamic Centre last Friday and described it as “uplifting”.Among the attendees was Church of Ireland Bishop of Ossory Michael Burrows. Cllr Noonan said they have agreed to hold “further faith initiatives” in the area to promote understanding.“For those who sought to ide our community over this, it’s had the opposite effect by bringing us closer together.”Among the many submissions made on the plan is one by the O’Loughlin Gaels GAA Club.Club chairman Brian Murphy, himself a former inter-county hurler with Cork, said the submission was purely on traffic grounds. The site for the proposed mosque and cultural centre is close to the O’Loughlin Gaels complex.“We haven’t lodged an objection,” he told said. “We made a submission about the traffic . . . Our facilities are used by an awful lot of people, there’s a lot of traffic. There’s congestion at our main entrance a lot of the time.”One of the most vociferous objectors, former election candidate Eugene McGuinness, a brother of Fianna Fáil TD John McGuinness, said he collected 1,035 signatures from people living in the area near the site.“This is a very emotive issue, with religion and all involved,” he said, adding that “99 percent of people in the area don’t want that development”. Traffic can be stuck for an hour in the area on days of big games in nearby Nowlan Park, said Mr McGuinness. “Now they want to compound that . . . by adding 200 cars.”He denied his objection had any racist or sectarian motive. “There’s no issue in relation to religion.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillWomen who choose to have an abortion when they are informed their baby will not survive outside the womb are abandoned by the State, the master of the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, has said.Speaking at the launch of Labour’s campaign to repeal the Eighth Amendment, Dr Rhona O’Mahony said the State’s current abortion regime was hypocritical towards women who travelled abroad for a termination when they learned of a fatal foetal abnormality.She said that women who chose to continue with their pregnancies in such circumstances were supported by the State and offered bereavement counselling among other things.However, Dr Mahony said that a woman who decided she could not continue with the pregnancy was forced to make her own appointment without the assistance of a doctor, pay for their treatment and travel to a different country with “shame and stigma” to access care the State refused to provide.“Not only that, they travel knowing that this option would be a criminal offence in their own country,” she said. Ms O’Mahony said retaining the Eighth Amendment would send a message to families in this situation that they should not be allowed to access healthcare in their own country. Being treated in a different country carries its own risks including inappropriate referral and clinical details being missed, she added. The campaign launch was addressed by a young couple from Marino in Dublin, who travelled to the UK last year after being informed their baby had a condition called anencephaly and would not survive outside the womb. Amy Callahan said she and her partner, Conor Upton, both wanted the pregnancy and were distraught on learning of the news. Their devastation was compounded by the fact they could not access the healthcare they wanted at home, she said. The couple said they brought their baby, Nico, back to Dublin after the procedure but had to take his remains on the plane as part of their luggage. Mr Upton said they took the decision to come forward after opening their curtains last month to see a No campaign poster with a foetus and the words “A licence to kill” written on it. He said the experience was still raw for them and the posters brought the anguish back.“This is not about us. We are talking about compassion in a crisis. The crisis here is that women are not taken care of here,” Ms Callahan said. The launch was also addressed by the Together For Yes co-ordinators Orla O’Connor and Ailbhe Smyth and party leader Brendan Howlin. Mr Howlin urged Labour members to canvass every household and ensure the Eighth Amendment was removed from the Constitution. The matter was not settled, he said, and the party must continue to make its case in constituencies across the State.Mr Howlin said that women who required terminatons were now faced with lawyers and gardaí rather than the medical assistance they needed. -the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3478218.1525020562!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"italy s political impasse deepened by party enmity","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA mural in Rome depicting Five-Star Movement leader Luigi Di Maio kissing League leader Matteo Salvini in the context of their striking a deal. Photograph: Tiziana FabiAFPGetty ImagesDeep-rooted antipathy built up over years must be overcome if the anti-establishment Five-Star Movement and the centre-left Democratic Party (PD) are to strike a deal to form a government and end Italy’s post-election stalemate.The third-largest economy in the euro zone has been in political limbo since a vote on March 4th produced a hung parliament. A centre-right alliance led by the anti-immigrant League won the most seats and Five Star emerged as the biggest single party. The PD came a distant third.After an initial attempt to form a coalition between the centre-right and Five Star ended in failure, Italy president Sergio Mattarella last week asked Five Star and the PD to try.If it were only about policies, the sides should be able to find some common ground, especially since Five Star’s 31-year-old leader Luigi Di Maio has recently shifted his party towards more moderate positions, close to those of the PD, in terms of fiscal policy and Europe.Both parties want to renegotiate Europe’s fiscal rules to allow Italy to cut taxes and increase investment, but say they would hold the budget deficit below the EU’s ceiling of 3 per cent of gross domestic product.Italy’s Five Star has abandoned a previous pledge to hold a referendum on the country’s euro membership and its flagship policy, a universal income support for the poor, is essentially a more generous version of a policy already adopted this year by the PD.Three policy priorities advanced this month by PD leader Maurizio Martina, centred on increasing welfare provision and fighting poverty, were broadly similar to initiatives advocated by Five Star.However, the PD is split between factions that want to go into opposition, led by former leader and prime minister Matteo Renzi, and others that want to negotiate with its most bitter adversary during the last five years of PD government.Mr Renzi’s successor, acting leader Martina, is in the second group. And he has called a meeting of the PD executive body on Thursday to decide whether to begin talks.The Five-Star Movement’s leader Di Maio wants the two sides to come to terms on a limited number of policy goals, but Renzi loyalists do not even want to discuss policies.“It’s a waste of time, it can only end in failure,” said PD president Matteo Orfini. “We are incompatible with Five Star in terms of political culture, programmes, history and what has happened in these past years.”Mr Renzi’s supporters say that as a junior partner to Five Star the PD would get no credit for any government successes and would share the blame if things go wrong. Advocates of a deal say the greatest danger for the PD would be a quick return to the polls, where it risks losing even more support.The differences between the parties are about identity and personalities more than policies and they run very deep.The Five-Star Movement was founded in 2009 by comedian Beppe Grillo as a protest against what he saw as Italy’s corrupt establishment comprising business tycoon Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia party on the right and the PD on the left.The Five Star Movement has always maintained there is little difference between the two. It blames the PD for never passing a conflict of interest law to curb Berlusconi’s media empire. Moreover, it says that with the PD pro-business, politically-correct agenda it is an expression of vested interests and the status quo.“The PD simply represents banks and multinationals,” said Grillo in 2016.A poll published on Saturday by the SWG agency showed twice as many 5-Star voters identify themselves as centre-left than centre-right, yet the majority still preferred the idea of Five Star governing with the far-right League than with the PD.The findings suggest that being pro- or anti-establishment is a more significant ide for Five-Star voters than the traditional left-right ideological labels.Grillo (69) has taken a back seat in recent years, but his furious rants against the PD when he spearheaded the movement have left deep scars. And Five-Star politicians have on occasion been as verbally abusive as he was.“Disgusting mafiosi”, yelled Paola Taverna, now deputy speaker of the Senate, at her PD counterparts in the upper house of parliament in 2015. Mr Renzi reserved most of his political attacks for Five Star rather than Forza Italia or the League. In return, he was dubbed a “half-wit” by Grillo and his followers.“We can’t pretend there weren’t five years of government on one side and five years of insults on another,” said Simona Bonafe, a PD European parliamentarian who is close to Mr Renzi.The insults have flown in the other direction too, with PD parliamentarians calling their Five-Star counterparts “fascists”.The PD presented a new electoral law a few months before the vote which it later admitted was aimed at preventing a Five-Star victory.There is no doubt that the main obstacle to a deal between the two parties is Mr Renzi.He resigned as PD leader after the election when it won just 18 per cent of the vote, its worst ever result and some 14 points behind Five Star. But he had hand-picked most of its parliamentary candidates and retains a major influence on its decisions.Some Five-Star politicians fear that even if the PD agrees at Thursday’s meeting to open policy talks, Mr Renzi and his followers will sink the negotiations later on or quickly bring down the government once it gets off the ground. – Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3468658.1524242996!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"le big mac emmanuel macron s rise and rise","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWinning ways: Emmanuel Macron at his victory rally in Paris after being elected president, in May 2017. Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph launches next phase words chosen brand campaign","story":"The  has launched the second phase of the Words Chosen Well brand campaign which aims to showcase its award-winning quality journalism and raise brand awareness.The campaign started with a new television advert debuted during the commercial break of Channel 4’s Gogglebox on Friday 20th April. Created by adam\u0026ampeveDDB  in collaboration with The ’s in-house marketing and creative teams, it builds on the success of last year’s campaign with a bigger and bolder creative that utilises important cultural references and leans on some of the most emotive and impactful events of our times, highlighting iconic moments when words have been considered and chosen well.The ’s new campaign seeks to demonstrate the influence and importance of the spoken and written word, and the role that quality journalism plays in providing news, insight and analysis.

In practice, this means the infection is resistant to all commonly used antibiotics.The figures have emerged as Lord O\u0027Neill, the former Goldman Sachs banker who led a government-commissioned review into superbugs, accuses senior ministers of a lack of leadership on the issue. Lord O’Neill, former commercial secretary to the Treasury, said the Prime Minister, Theresa May, had allowed the issue to fade and that actions promised had not been taken.Lord O\u0026#39Neill has urged senior ministers to do more to tackle the threat of superbugs“It is disappointing to see that the UK government’s global and national efforts to fight AMR seem to have faded, he saidWriting exclusively for the  Lord O’Neill said that the UK was once seen as a leader in the field but that May had allowed the issue to slide.“The government should put this part of \u0027global Britain\u0027 back at the top of its priorities,” he writes. “There has been a lot of talk, but no action.Lord O’Neill’s review warned that if left unchecked antibiotic resistance would kill 10 million people and the world economy could lose up to $100 trillion by 2050.Antibiotic resistance | The true cost in Britain and around the worldOfficial figures suggest antimicrobial resistance claims the lives of 5,000 people a year in the UK, though experts have argued the real figure is at least double that. Getting global figures on the problem is difficult but reliable estimates suggest 700,000 are already dying each year – one person a minute.Lord O’Neill also attacked the major pharmaceutical companies for doing little to counter the problem, despite signing up to the Davos Declaration in 2015, where they pledged to combat the threat.He wrote: “Since then, no major pharmaceutical company has taken any fresh action.”Lord O’Neill said that since investigating the issue the number of reports of antibiotic resistance was rising faster and “in more places than we ever dreamt of.”.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}There has been a lot of talk, but no action.Lord O\u0026#x27NeillIn addition to the ‘super gonorrhoea’ case the PHE figures, obtained under a Freedom of Information request, show 29 people suffered from pan-drug-resistant-infections from Pseudomonas bacteria.Pseudomonas is a bug often found in soil or water (hospital sinks are tested for it) that usually affects people with a weaker immune system such as cancer patients, newborn babies, people with diabetes or patients with severe burns.Up to 11 per cent of Pseudomonas bacteria are now resistant to ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic commonly used in combination with others.A further six patients suffered pan-drug-resistant Klebsiella infections. New antibiotics to treat multi-drug-resistant Klebsiella infections were introduced last year in light of rising resistance, said Professor Peter Hawkey, a public health and bacteriology expert at the University of Birmingham. But they don’t work against every strain, he said.Antibiotic resistance | Global consumption fuels spread of superbugsProf Hawkey added that the cases show antimicrobial resistance is not a hypothetical or future threat but a real one currently affecting patients in British hospitals.These are organisms which are resistant to most antibiotics and then you’re in a tricky place, he said. The threat is very real. These figures are a wake up call,” he said.The pan-resistant infections recorded by PHE were from gram negative bacteria: rod-shaped bugs with thinner cell walls than their gram positive counterparts.Gram negative bacteria, some of which live in the human gut, are fast becoming resistant to antibiotics and are known as an emerging global threat. The government aims to halve the number of healthcare-associated gram-negative bloodstream infections by 2021.Prof Hawkey said pan-drug-resistant-infections are much more common in other areas of the world with lax surveillance and poor infection control, and these will spread to Britain.He said: With huge movement in populations people are coming back to the UK with these bugs in their guts. If you get it and you’re given the wrong antibiotic, you will die.Dr Susan Hopkins, deputy director for AMR and healthcare acquired infections at Public Health England, said: “While there is only a small number of bacteria identified that were resistant to a number of treatments in recent years, they serve as an example of the threat antibiotic resistance poses to public health.Madlen Davies is a reporter with the Bureau of Investigative JournalismProtect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Mike Pompeo takes hard line with Iran as European allies stand up for nuclear dealComment: After decades of strife, the French are finally falling out of love with strikesMillions of trees mapped by drone in Network Rail felling programmeLondon Marathon impostor revealed as homeless builder nicknamed \u0026#39Jogging Tramp\u0026#39Tiger mosquitoes capable of carrying Zika spread across half of France Power cut warning for Britain as south east and London brace for torrential rain, floods and galesFrench tycoon Vincent Bolloré blames Africa corruption charges on prejudiceOn this day in 1429: Joan of Arc wins her first military victory as she outwits the English besiegers of OrléansNicola Sturgeon accused of scaremongering over Brexit powers dealMike Tindall finally gets his nose straightened out after breaking it at least eight times during careerHalf of TSB online banking customers still locked out of accountsWhat will Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u0026#39s titles be after their wedding?Royal wedding guest list: Who did Meghan Markle and Prince Harry invite?Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding 2018: date, details and latest newsWhat\u0026#39s in a name?

There will be no more recruitment for especially domestic helpers. No more, Mr Duterte told reporters in the southern city of Davao.There was no immediate response from Kuwait, where around 262,000 Filipinos are employed - nearly 60 percent of them as domestic workers, according to the Philippines\u0027 foreign department.Last week the Philippines apologised over the rescue videos but Kuwaiti officials announced they were expelling Manila\u0027s ambassador and recalling their own envoy from the Southeast Asian nation.In quotes | Rodrigo Duterte, President of the PhilippinesKuwait also detained four Filipinos hired by the Philippine embassy and issued arrest warrants against three diplomatic personnel, Manila said.Mr Duterte on Sunday described the treatment of workers in Kuwait as a calamity. He said he would bring home Filipina maids who suffered abuse as he appealed to workers who wanted to stay in the oil-rich state.I would like to address to their patriotism: come home. No matter how poor we are, we will survive. The economy is doing good and we are short of our workers, he said.About 10 million Filipinos work abroad, seeking high-paying jobs they are unable to find at home, and their remittances are a major pillar of the Philippine economy.The Philippine government has for decades hailed overseas workers as modern heroes but advocacy groups have highlighted the social cost of migration, tearing families apart and making Filipinos vulnerable to abuse.Mr Duterte lashed out at Kuwait in February, alleging Arab employers routinely rape Filipina workers, force them to work 21 hours a day and feed them scraps.However after the latest row, Mr Duterte used a conciliatory tone as he addressed the diplomatic ruckus on Saturday.Apparently it seems as if they have anger against Filipinos ... I do not want to send (workers) because apparently you do not like Filipinos, he said in a speech before Filipinos in Singapore.Just do not hurt them.

He is flanked by fellow ex-internationals Neil Back (left) and Will Greenwood (right)He said he might have to get the procedure done, and added: I guess it\u0027s something similar to a pug.The problem is that if I get it done, will people say I\u0027ve had it just because I\u0027m doing TV stuff now? Because it\u0027s definitely not.Tindall first broke his nose aged five when he collided in a dodgem car and headbutted the steering wheel.Earlier this year, The Queen has welcomed news that she is to become a great-grandmother again, as Zara and Mike Tindall confirmed they were expecting a baby.Mr and Mrs Tindall, who are already parents to three-year-old Mia, have announced they are expecting another child a year after enduring a miscarriage.The Queen, a spokesman said, said she was “very pleased” to hear the news, of that will be her seventh great-grandchild.She already has two great-grandsons, Prince George and Prince Louis, and four great-granddaughter: Princess Charlotte, Savannah and Isla Phillips and Mia Tindall.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are expecting their third child in April, with the Tindall’s baby believed to be due in the summer.Confirmation of Mrs Tindall’s pregnancy was celebrated yesterday, just over a year after a spokesman announced the miscarriage of a child due in 2017.Their newest addition is likely to be born in the same Cotswolds NHS hospital as their first daughter Mia.Unlike the newest Royal baby, the new arrival will not be given a title with the parents keen for their children to have a normal upbringing.The children will be born into a family of true sporting pedigree with an Olympian as a mother and an international captain as a father. Zara Phillips won gold in the World Championships in the inidual eventing at the 2006 tournament in Aachen and gained a silver medal in the team eventing at London 2012. Her husband played 75 timed for England and notched up more than 350 games for Bath and Gloucester in a decorated career. Mike Pompeo takes hard line with Iran as European allies stand up for nuclear dealComment: After decades of strife, the French are finally falling out of love with strikesMillions of trees mapped by drone in Network Rail felling programmeLondon Marathon impostor revealed as homeless builder nicknamed \u0026#39Jogging Tramp\u0026#39Tiger mosquitoes capable of carrying Zika spread across half of France Power cut warning for Britain as south east and London brace for torrential rain, floods and galesFrench tycoon Vincent Bolloré blames Africa corruption charges on prejudiceOn this day in 1429: Joan of Arc wins her first military victory as she outwits the English besiegers of OrléansNicola Sturgeon accused of scaremongering over Brexit powers dealHalf of TSB online banking customers still locked out of accountsWhat will Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u0026#39s titles be after their wedding?Royal wedding guest list: Who did Meghan Markle and Prince Harry invite?Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding 2018: date, details and latest newsWhat\u0026#39s in a name?

Possibly complicating matters was the fact that Denzel Washington was sitting next to him at the table.“When someone says you’re like your idol,” Jordan said, “It’s like: ‘Really? You see that in me?’ I’d only done that one movie. But then I started using it as motivation,” he said. “I wanted to pop up on Denzel’s radar. He’s the OG. If I could get recognition from him, I know I’m going down the right path, you know?”Denzel: We’re only getting further apart in this technological ageFinally, Washington broke in with a booming laugh: “And here we are, Mike! Looks like it’s working out already,” he said.In truth, it would be hard for an actor to choose a better role model than Washington. In a career ning more than 40 years and 50 films – and kicked off by the hit TV drama St Elsewhere – Washington, 63, has been nominated for nine Academy Awards. He won twice: for best actor as a terrifying rogue cop in Training Day and for best supporting actor as a Union soldier in an African-American army unit in Glory. And he was nominated for best actor Oscars in both of the past two years.Jordan (left, with Kevin Durand) in the 2013’s ‘Fruitvale Station’ (Weinstein Company)In the past decade, Washington has ruled the stage, too. He won a Tony Award for best actor in the revival of August Wilson’s Fences in 2010, later directing and starring in an Oscar-nominated film version. He led the acclaimed revival of A Raisin in the Sun in 2014. And today (26 April), he will open again on Broadway in a revival of Eugene O’Neill’s play The Iceman Cometh, a searing and (at four hours long) monumental drama about the lies we tell ourselves to get through life.Like Washington, Jordan, 31, got his big break on television: on HBO’s The Wire, when he was just 15. After his heartbreaking performance in Fruitvale Station, about the last day in the life of a transit-police shooting victim, he starred in the popular Rocky reboot Creed. And this year, he played the villain, Erik Killmonger, in the Marvel juggernaut Black Panther, winning perhaps the best reviews of anyone in the extremely well-reviewed cast.Next month, he stars in Fahrenheit 451 on HBO, a dystopian film based on the novel by Ray Bradbury. Jordan plays a “fireman,” part of a state-sanctioned brigade that hunts down readers and burns books. His company, Outlier Society Productions, is one of the film’s producers and also among the first to adopt inclusion riders, requiring ersity among cast and crew, as called for by Frances McDormand from the stage of this year’s Academy Awards.Over a cocktail hour at the Lambs Club in Manhattan (a Diet Coke for Washington, a sauvignon blanc for Jordan), the actors traded notes about creating characters and the socially minded work that really matters to them. These are excerpts from the conversation.Galanes: If Mike reminds people of a young Denzel, who did young Denzel remind people of?Washington: I never saw it that way. I never even thought about movie stars. My goal was to be on Broadway, to earn $650 a week. My hero was James Earl Jones. And I came to acting green. I was taking pre-law courses, then journalism courses. Then I took an acting class and got bit by the bug. So I came down to Lincoln Centre and saw plays and stage actors.Galanes: But all those things you did – law, journalism, acting – they’re all about getting to the bottom of a story, right?Washington: I like that part: building a character. You start with the material that gives you clues. If you’re playing a boxer, you want to throw out punches. If you’re playing a conductor, you want to get on a train.Galanes: And the script?Washington: Sure, but you don’t know who the character is just by reading the script. I don’t read a script and go, “Now, I get it!” That’s just the beginning. The first thread you pull.Jordan: The script tells you what’s going up on screen. But the biggest part, the fun part, is figuring out what happened to that character before page one of the script. What kind of food does he like? Did he get into fights going to school? That back story determines the choices you make within the confines of the script. And going through that process with the director is a big part of the collaboration. Now I’ve got notebooks and notebooks of back stories. Some directors may want you to add something or change your version. That’s when you try to find common ground.Washington won an Oscar for his role as rogue cop Alonzo in 2001’s ‘Training Day’ (Warner Bros)Galanes: Is that why you’ve both worked with directors repeatedly? Mike with Ryan Coogler Denzel with Spike Lee and Antoine Fuqua. Your common ground?Washington (laughing): Maybe they’re the ones who called. What you’re saying is part of it, but I don’t think it’s just one way.Jordan: Those are the roles I was lucky enough to get. Ryan and I have worked together three times, and I have a really close relationship with him. But I said no to lots of other things with other people in between. They weren’t right. Personally, I think you’re defined by what you say no to.Washington: I say yes to everything!Galanes: Why do I doubt that? Managing a career as big as yours must take a lot of work.Washington: Not now. Maybe early on. Now, I just do what I want to do. And you don’t want to walk down the same road twice. I’m sure after doing Iceman Cometh, I won’t be looking to do another play.Washington: Yeah, not for a while.Galanes: You’re too young to remember this, Mike. But early in his career, Denzel was so beloved for playing good guys – in Glory and Cry Freedom – that we all freaked out when he started playing villains: in Training Day, American Gangster. And he was even better at bad guys! Was that about walking down different roads?Playing Killmonger (right) in ‘Black Panther’ brought rave reviews for Jordan (MarvelDisney)Jordan: So much trickles down from the director. That’s why I try to choose the ones who make the best environments to work in, so we can maybe make something as good as Training Day. You don’t want to go into a project with somebody who won’t be helpful to your process – or vice versa.Galanes: I read this funny thing about you, Mike: you started choosing projects where you wouldn’t die in the end?Jordan: It started with my mom, who’s super emotional. When I shot my death scene in The Wire, she was on set. And the PAs kept coming to me and saying: ‘You may want to check on your mom.’ I go see her, and she’s sitting there bawling. I’m just a kid. I’m going, ‘Come on, Ma. You’re embarrassing me.’ And after Fruitvale Station, I was like, ‘Man, this is really affecting her.’ But there was another thing, too. Look at Denzel’s career. I want people to see me win. I want audiences to see me ending up on top – not dying. I want to be the leading man.Washington: Man, I got underwear older than that.Jordan: That was the real thought process: How do I become a leading man? I know phenomenal actors who can’t open movies overseas. How do you become the guy who can carry a film?Washington: So, you study the game?Galanes Is that why you went down the superhero route?Galanes You probably made up for it with Black Panther. Why no superheroes for you, Denzel?Galanes: Superheroes have changed. When Denzel might have played one, they were dull. The villains were interesting: Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger. Like you in Black Panther, Mike.Washington: When I was a teenager, Shaft and Super Fly, those were our superheroes. I remember watching Super Fly with my boy Carl, and when we got back to the projects, he carved the character’s name – Priest – on the elevator door. And Richard Roundtree in those long leather coats in Shaft.Galanes: Both of your new projects are dark. Iceman Cometh is brutal. And in Fahrenheit 451, competing ideas are so scary that people decide to burn all the books and kill the readers. Why choose them now?27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 Galanes: It’s powerful to watch a black man in your role.Jordan: But it wasn’t all there on the page. I needed to make sure that he was willing to collaborate, to change some things to help me, as a black man, feel more comfortable in that role. And my company’s co-producing it alongside HBO was important to me too. This is my first time working with the director and the network, giving my opinion and hoping that it’s taken seriously.Washington (laughing): Getting your big boy voice.Galanes Like coming back to the stage, Denzel?Washington: Yeah. Then we boiled it down to Iceman and King Lear. And he said: ‘Let’s do Lear five years from now.’ I said: “OK, we’ll do that next – God willing.”Washington: Eugene O’Neill. That simple. The chance to interpret his brilliant material. You know, my first role on stage, when I was a student at Fordham, was in The Emperor Jones. I’ve always loved O’Neill. And here I am, 40 years later, coming back to him in Iceman.Galanes: Your character, Hickey, seems like the life of the party at first, but what a tortured soul he turns out to be. What drew you to him?Washington: His desire to see people happy. Even when he knows he can’t make that happen, that desire is still there in him.Galanes: It’s a mountain of a play – four hours long. Is it hard to maintain that intensity every night?‘Fahrenheit 451’ sees Jordan plays a ‘fireman’, part of a state-sanctioned brigade that hunts down readers and burns books (HBO)Washington: Listen, this is what I love: acting on stage. And I don’t have to do anything else. Just be in this play. So, don’t feel sorry for me compared to most workers in America.Galanes: Is theatre on your radar, Mike?Jordan: Down the line. But right now, I want to take care of my family financially and grow my production company. That’s the big thing I want to do: set my family up.Jordan: As a kid, you don’t see your circumstances. I didn’t. It’s not until you look back and think, ‘Man, we were poor!’ My parents really hid that from me. They kept me safe.Washington: It wasn’t that tough. I was having a good time. A lot of my boys went to prison.Jordan: That’s why I want to take care of my family now. Then let me go and work on my craft, do something to fulfil me on the inside. That’s what I think theatre is going to be for me – when I’m older. What do you love about it, Denzel?Washington: The energy from the audience is immediate. And you get to develop a full life. See, in film, you might shoot the end first, then the middle. But on stage, it’s the full score of the character’s life. And you always get another night.Washington: In film, you don’t get another night to shoot a scene. You can try to fix it in other scenes. But film is a director’s medium. Theatre is for actors. We’re directed, but once the curtain goes up, it belongs to us. And every night’s as different as the audience. Some nights, they cheer the whole way through others, they don’t cheer at all.Galanes: Let me shift gears. We’re living through a time right now where men in power who’ve done ugly things –Washington: No. We’re not ‘living through a time right now’. It’s always been this way, from the beginning of time. Pick one: from Caesar to Caligula. Now, it’s just on the news cycle every 15 seconds.Jordan: And opinion is now fact – because anyone with a Twitter handle can say it.Washington: It doesn’t even have to be true it just has to be first.Galanes: Hang on, I’m asking something different: Based on your years as a powerful figure, why do you think some guys turn to ugly behaviour, and others don’t?Washington: Nobody’s perfect, man. Don’t put me on a pedestal, if that’s what you’re trying to do. I’m just a human being. I made mistakes I’ll make some more. Hopefully, you learn from them. My mother always said, ‘Keep it simple.’ The older I get, the more I understand her: cut away the fat. When you’re younger, you want to see, taste, touch.Washington (laughing): There you have it. But when you get to be my age, you learn you don’t have to. I have a beautiful wife, beautiful children, a great job. What more do I need?Jordan: And people like us, actors of colour, we don’t get a lot of second chances. It’s a different type of scrutiny. Knowing it’s not all fair and equal, you’ve got to make smart decisions in the moment.Washington: I remember going home one time and saying to my mother, ‘Hey, Ma, did you ever think that I...’ And she said: ‘Stop right there! Do you know all the people who’ve been praying for your raggedy butt?’ You don’t get there by yourself.Jordan: That’s crazy! I was just thinking: I’m going to church in the morning – because I know the people there have always prayed for me. Their blessings have protected me from terrible situations. That’s how I think about keeping it simple: remembering where it started – that village, that tribe that kept you safe.Galanes: And it was 38 years between Sidney Poitier’s Oscar for best actor and yours.Galanes: How about opportunities for people of colour?Washington: That’s why I’m here! That’s why I’m still in the race. And I’m passing the baton. What a lot of people don’t know is: when you pass the baton, you keep running behind the other runner, you don’t just stop. I’m like, ‘Make the turn, bring it home!’ I like helping people. I want to see them do well.Black Panther star reveals Denzel Washington paid for his acting classDenzel schools journalist with response to \u0027fake news\u0027 questionHow to stop Denzel Washington stealing your sceneJordan: That’s why I want to produce so much. I like creating opportunities for people.Galanes: You were right out of the gate on inclusion riders, Mike. The first to say, ‘My company guarantees that casts and crews will be erse.’Jordan: That’s super important to me. No matter what community we’re talking about. Everybody should be in a position where they can win.Washington: I’m just wired that way.Jordan: My path is my path. I can’t take nothing away from nobody, and nobody can take nothing away from me. I’m running my race. But we can still encourage each other.Washington: What’s the harm in that? You’ll never see a U-Haul behind a hearse.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship“We are going after the money,” Boris Johnson promised after being questioned on the absence of specific measures to impose sanctions and financial penalties on the UK assets of Russian oligarchs closely aligned to President Putin. But when pressed by MPs on why decisive action was not being taken, the foreign secretary replied: “This is not a country where we in the government can say ‘Oi! We think this so-and-so deserves to have his or her collar felt’. This is not how it works.” While Theresa May may yet impose sanctions against Putin-supporting billionaires in response to the attempted murder of the Russian spy Sergei Skripal, her government’s track record has been marred by procrastination and prevarication.   Privately, the prime minister regards the exploitation of London as a haven for dirty Russian money as a serious problem. She once listened in stunned silence as a senior MI6 officer briefed her on the activities of Russian organised crime and certain oligarchs in the UK. And in 2016 she authorised the National Security Council to review why and how wealthy Russians buy property in London. But she has been nervous about taking action. For the past three years she has dithered on implementing a legally-enforceable register that will force all foreign companies that own UK property to disclose the identity of their owners.Russia claims Skripals poisoned using toxin possessed by UK and USRussia has been spying on the Skripals for at least five years- UKRussia stock market crashes after US imposes sanctions on oligarchsFreezing property assets is the key to inflicting pain on the Russian state and its compliant plutocrats. Since 2004, £190m of UK property has been subject to criminal investigation as suspected proceeds of corruption. The London property market has been skewed by laundered money, as The Independent revealed exclusively in 2014. Prices are being artificially driven up by wealthy, influential, foreign men who want to hide their assets in the UK.Multi-million pound payments are accepted without their origin being questioned. Oligarchs hide ownership behind anonymous shell companies registered in secretive jurisdictions while a London address offers a veneer of legitimacy and prestige that helps launder reputations as well as cash. Transparency International estimates that Russians account for £729m of the £4.4bn acquired in UK property via what it regards as “suspicious wealth”.There is no suggestion that all London property bought by Russian oligarchs is derived from illegal or criminal sources. For some Russian plutocrats buying luxury property in London is a symbol that they have been accepted by the British establishment. This is illustrated by the eleven bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square that Oleg Deripaska, regarded as one of Putin’s favourite oligarchs, snapped up for £17m through an offshore company registered in the British Virgin Islands in 2003 and now worth £45m.Oleg Deripaska’s 11-bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square is seen as a symbol of acceptance by the British establishment (Alamy)Built in the 1820s, it was formerly the home of Sir Henry “Chips” Channon, society host, Conservative MP and notoriously indiscreet diarist. It was designed for entertaining royalty and diplomats with its grand staircase, Madame Récamier sofas and flamboyant decor. When Harold Nicolson arrived at the house for dinner, he exclaimed: “Oh my God, how rich and powerful Lord Channon has become.” The equally grand and historic mansion Beechwood House, set in 11 acres of land in Highgate, north London, was bought by the powerful oligarch Alisher Usmanov in 2008 for £48m from the Emir of Qatar. Usmanov is a major shareholder in Arsenal football club and has amassed a £14bn fortune from metals and commodities and has long been regarded as a pro-Putin figure. And his fellow football-loving oligarch Roman Abramovich owns houses on Kensington Palace Gardens and Chester Square, Belgravia, and apartments on Eaton Square and Manresa Road, Chelsea.  One Hyde Park, one of the wealthiest residencies in the world, was famously bought up by Russian oligarchs (Alamy)It is not just prestigious houses that attract Russian billionaires. The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return for their cash, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship.  Since 2008 iniduals have been able to obtain “golden visas” if they invest as little as £2m in a UK business. And for £5m, they gain the right to become a UK resident on a temporary basis and then, after five years, a British citizen. By 2014, almost 700 rich Russians had paid for entry using this method, with Roman Rotenberg, son of Putin’s former judo partner Boris Rotenberg, being the most prominent example. He owns a mews house on Cadogan Lane in Belgravia.The government is taking some action to stop London becoming what David Cameron described as a haven to hide “dodgy foreign cash”. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is investigating a list of wealthy iniduals, not just oligarchs, to assess if they have used the UK to launder their fortunes.An estimated 149 iniduals are restricted on their travel and ability to conduct business in the UK. And the Unexplained Wealth Orders is now law, whereby the NCA can demand that the oligarch explain the origin of his wealth. But the problem with this order, according to a Russian businessman, is that the inidual in question could too easily lie about his source of wealth and instead produce a document that shows his fortune was based on, for example, share idends. Roman Rotenberg gained entry to the UK using the ‘golden visas’ method (Getty)Boris Johnson protests that the government cannot act directly against the pro-Putin brigade because it cannot interfere in criminal investigations. But it could make specific changes to the law, notably an amendment to the Sanctions and Money Laundering Bill, which would give Magnitsky-type powers to freeze the UK assets of relevant iniduals, including intelligence agents or other officials who have abused human rights.  The government could also implement the register of inidual owners of foreign and offshore companies that own UK property. But that bill has been delayed until 2021 and campaigners smell a cover-up after the government announced that one reason for the delay is that the Business Department has commissioned research on the impact of the register on investment decisions. “This is a crucial moment for the UK’s future trading relationship with the rest of the world, and we must proceed with as good an understanding as possible of the potential impacts on legitimate inward investment,” said foreign office minister Lord Ahmad. Skripal attack aftermath – in picturesSkripal attack aftermath – in picturesInvestigators in protective clothing remove a van from an address in Winterslow near Salisbury in Wiltshire, as police and members of the armed forces continue to investigate the suspected nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei SkripaA police officer on duty near the protective tent which covers the bench where a man and woman were apparently poisoned with what was later identified as a nerve agent, in SalisburyMilitary in protective clothing prior to removing vehicles from a car park in SalisburyPersonnel in protective coveralls and breathing equipment cover an ambulance with a tarpaulin at the Salisbury District HospitalHome Secretary Amber Rudd visits the scene of the nerve agent attack in SalibsuryMembers of the emergency services in hazard suits fix the tent over the bench where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were foundOfficials in protective suits check their equipment before repositioning a forensics tent A poice officer stands guard outside a branch of the Italian chain restaurant ZizziDetective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who assisted the Russian ex-spy targeted with a nerve agent, was also hospitalisedSergei Skripal days before he was exposed to a mystery substance that has left him fighting for lifeSergei Skripal speaks to his lawyer from behind bars seen on a screen of a monitor outside a courtroom in Moscow.Yulia Skripal, who is thought to have been poisoned along with her father, Sergei SkripalProgress to legislation has thus been painfully slow. An insight into why political rhetoric has not resulted in legislative action can be gleaned by the recent flotation on the London stock exchange of the Russian energy company En+, then owned by Deripaska and chaired by former Conservative energy minister Lord Barker. For it revealed a fundamental dispute between MI6 and the financial regulators on how to make oligarchs who park their assets in London more accountable and transparent.MI6 and the prime minister’s national security advisor, Sir Mark Sedwill, were furious with the Stock Exchange and Financial Conduct Authority for failing to consult them and conduct the required due diligence of En+. Their main concern was about whether Rusal, a subsidiary of En+, had been manufacturing aluminium powder used by Russian arms firms for military purposes. Rusal adamantly denied it – yet its own website previously indicated that the defence industry was among the users of the type of aluminium powder it manufactured.Sir Mark Sedwill was furious when the required due diligence of En+ was not carried out ahead of its flotation on the London stock exchange (Getty)The En+ group could be a candidate for new sanctions as the Russian state-owned VTB Bank is a major shareholder with a 4.35 per cent holding, while Deripaska is known for being close to the Russian President. Leaked US diplomatic cables described Deripaska as “among the two to three oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis” and is “a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin’s trips abroad”.Indeed, when the US imposed sanctions on seven oligarchs and the 12 companies they own or control last week, shares tumbled. Deripaska was among those affected, as was Rotenberg.  Still, Britiain cannot follow suit. And the anger of National Security officials and MI6 En+\u0027s flotation last year stemmed precisely from their belief that it typified the complacent approach to Russian money in London, which the infamous oligarch Boris Berezovsky once told me was “70 per cent dirty”. The inability to impose sanctions is similarly emblematic.The London Stock Exchange has long been a vehicle for Russian companies and oligarchs to raise money in shares and bonds – an estimated $200bn (£140bn) since 2004. Last summer, Russia’s largest gold producer Polyus, controlled by Suleyman Kerimov, a Russian senator awarded the Order of Merit by Putin, raised $879m. There are now 57 predominantly-Russian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, more than anywhere else outside Moscow.   The wealthiest Russian oligarchs who call London homeA little-noticed loophole to avoid sanctions is that Russian sovereign debt is permitted to be sold in London. “We are allowing Russian sovereign debt to be sold in the UK and that debt is being used to reimburse Russians to bring back their money onshore in Moscow terms,” said the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “As that gold is moving towards Moscow, we are quite extraordinarily enabling those bond and debt auctions...This is one of those areas where sanctions on businesses are being compensated by the Russian state.”Just hours after Theresa May’s retaliation against the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, Gazprom issued a $750m eurobond in London and the following day the Russian government joined in by issuing a $4bn bond in the capital. Within hours, the Russian Embassy issued a revealing tweet: “Business as usual?”Could the nerve-agent attack in Salisbury be the unwitting catalyst for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London? (Getty)But the irony is that it is the attempted assassination of a Russian spy and double agent living in Salisbury and the murder of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov in Surrey that could be the unwitting catalysts for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London.Mark Hollingsworth is the author of “Londongrad – From Russia with Cash’’ or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Others were able to log in but, when they did, some or all of their account details had disappeared.Customers have also reported that they could access other people’s accounts, including account numbers, sort codes and transaction histories.TSB apology after customers complain of online banking ‘data breach’​TSB could not say how many people were still locked out of the service or when the problems would be fully resolved.The ongoing IT disaster began with botched upgrade work on Friday, but has developed into one of the worst technology failures to hit a UK retail bank and has left many of TSB’s 1.9 million customers furious.Some said they were falling behind with bill payments.Others said they were worried their money had simply disappeared.Many customers expressed frustration that the bank was not being clear about what had happened.That came after Paul Pester, CEO of TSB, tweeted on Wednesday morning: “Our mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running. Thank you for your patience and for bearing with us.”Our mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running. Thank you for your patience and for bearing with us.MPs demanded answers from TSB on Tuesday. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury Committee, said: “The reports of unauthorised transactions, access to other customers’ accounts and failures of in-branch services have all the hallmarks of an IT meltdown.“This is yet another addition to the litany of failures of banking IT systems. Potentially, millions of customers could be affected by uncertainty and disruption.“It simply isn’t good enough to expose customers to IT failures, including delays in paying bills and an inability to access their own money.”A spokesperson for the Financial Conduct Authority said on Tuesday that the watchdog was “aware of the issue and liaising with the firm”. A spokesperson for the Information Commissioner’s Office said: “We are aware of a potential data breach in relation to the TSB and are making enquiries.”Mr Pester said on Tuesday that he was “truly sorry” about the problems caused. “We’re still seeing issues with access to our digital services,” he added. “One of the steps we need to take to resolve this is to take our mobile app and online banking down for a few hours.“We did this at around 10.30 this morning and we hope to be back up later this afternoon.”The problems stemmed from a switch to a new online banking system. TSB had rented the technology behind its app and online banking from Lloyds Banking Group since the two companies split. Over the weekend, TSB moved customers to a new platform which experienced some teething problems.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Under the current rules, anyone in the world is able to register an SLP.The changes being put to consultation by the Department for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy will also mean anyone setting up a limited partnership will have to pass anti-money laundering checks.While many SLPs are owned by legitimate businesses, government research suggests others have been part of complex attempts to launder the proceeds of criminal activities.One scheme is reported to have used 100 different SLPs to move $80bn out of Russia, while other partnerships were found to have been exploited by international criminal networks based in Eastern Europe and used in arms deals.Announcing the changes, business minister Andrew Griffiths said: “The UK has taken a leading role in the fight against money laundering and is known internationally as a great place to work, invest and do business.“But as we are seeing especially with Scottish Limited Partnerships, is that they are being abused to carry out all manner of crimes abroad – from foreign money laundering to arms dealing.“This simply cannot continue to go unchecked and these reforms will improve their transparency and subject them to more stringent checks to ensure they can continue to be used as a legitimate way for investors and pension funds to invest in the UK.”The government has taken a number of steps to stem the flow of dirty money through the UK. Laws due to be introduced this summer will establish a public register of foreign-owned property, while law enforcement agencies have already been given greater powers to identity and recover dirty money.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesCeltic celebrate after winning they confirmed winning the Scottish Premiership by beating rivals Rangers 5-0 at Celtic Park.People release balloons outside Alder Hey Children\u0027s Hospital in Liverpool, following the death on Saturday morning of Alfie Evans, who was being treated at the hospital.

It has also helped draw attention to a number of other virtual currencies looming in its shadow, most notably ethereum.Ethereum was created in 2013 by a 19-year-old Russian programmer and launched in 2015. For the first two years its price remained below $10. Then, in 2017, it exploded. In the space of 12 months, one unit of the cyptocurrency – called an ether – surged in value to be worth around $1,400 at its peak in January 2018.While its price has since fallen back down to around $700, many still see it as the most promising of all cryptocurrency platforms, and therefore the one that holds the most potential for future price gains. Some even believe it could one day surpass bitcoin.“Ethereum has the possibility to overtake the market capitalisation, and thus value, of bitcoin,”  Hubert Olszewski, director of business development at Blockchain Board of Derivatives, tells The Independent. “This is because from the get-go it was a more versatile tool.” A smartphone displaying the current price chart for ethereum on April 25, 2018 in London, England. Cryptocurrency markets began to recover this month following a massive crash during the first quarter of 2018, seeing more than $550 billion wiped from the total market capitalisation. (Getty Images)When bitcoin became the world’s first decentralised digital currency upon its release in 2009, the world was reeling from the worst financial crisis in decades. So-called crypto-anarchists and others who were disillusioned by the recession hailed bitcoin for its ability to facilitate payments without the need for a bank. Essentially, they thought, it held the potential to revolutionise the global financial system.Since bitcoin’s inception, more than 1,500 other cryptocurrencies have appeared in its wake. Each one has attempted to offer something that bitcoin can’t, with the argument being that bitcoin’s core technology contains a number a fundamental flaws that are being exposed as its network grows. Here’s why bitcoin might be on the verge of another price explosionSome, like litecoin and bitcoin cash, have improved transaction times and lowered transaction costs. Ethereum’s aim, by contrast, is far more ambitious than simply improving upon bitcoin’s credentials as a payment system and store of value.“Bitcoin is a virtual currency, but also a store of value similar to gold. It’s limited to this function by its own design,” says Alessandra Sollberger, an early investor in bitcoin who has since ersified her cryptocurrency portfolio to include ethereum.“That’s different with ethereum. Beyond being a virtual currency, it’s been designed as a software platform that enables applications such as smart contracts – which are self-executing, secure contracts – to be built and to run without the need of a third party.”Bitcoin: Is the virtual currency the new gold standard?Bitcoin: Is the virtual currency the new gold standard?Bitcoin exists without a central bank able to manipulate its valueEthereum is therefore designed to not just decentralise traditional banks – as bitcoin sets out to do – but decentralise the entire internet. It does this by expanding upon bitcoin’s core technology called the blockchain, which is the online public ledger that permanently records the transactions made across the network.Using ethereum’s more versatile and advanced blockchain technology, anyone is able to create their own decentralised applications.“This opens up a vast potential of business use-case particularly as we move towards a much more connected and autonomous future,” says Erhan Korhaliller, founder of the blockchain specialist PR agency EAK Digital. “Ethereum has the potential to proliferate to all levels of business interaction.”By completely cutting out third parties, ethereum could one day transform the way we transfer everything, from online data to the property deeds of a house. In doing so, it has earned the nickname “World Computer”.“The ethereum platform has the potential to facilitate major innovation in applications, helping to usher a future in which self-driving cars, for example, can accept crypto in order to become self-sustainable,” says Gaurang Torvekar,co-founder and CEO of Indorse, a professional network powered by ethereum.“In the years ahead, there might even be a way in which we can use our smartphones for research that can cure cancer, and in turn get paid for it. With a growing number of companies across the globe working on groundbreaking applications using the ethereum blockchain, the future of innovation is bright, with endless possibilities on the horizon.”The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

People say put libraries in and health centres, but the Government does not have the money to fill the gaps that would be left by independent shops.                Two centuries of trading closes it\u0027s doors to be solely onlineALAMY 1,500 traditional \u0027bricks and mortar\u0027 stores closed across Britain in 2017The study on the state of the high street by the Local Data Company and Bira found that Yorkshire and the Humber, and Greater London, have suffered the greatest decline in independent shops in the past year.In Yorkshire and the Humber 460 stores closed, with 374 shutting in Greater London. However, the West Midlands managed to buck this trend, with 230 new stores opening.Telford has the lowest percentage of independent retailers, with Yate in Gloucestershire, Bracknell in Berks, Cowley in Oxfordshire and Salford in Greater Manchester the next worst.High street businesses visited by customers - like barbers, beauty salons and coffee shops - fared the best.As the Prezzo announces restaurant closures across the country. We take a look at the retail giants who have closed high street stores in recent years.                    Bloomberg via Getty Images1 of 14Prezzo, the restaurant chain, is shutting 92 branches across the UKNewsagents, women\u0027s clothes shops and estate agents struggled the most.Mr Hawkins continued: These figures come as no surprise. Uncertainty over Brexit, changing shopping habits, a harsh winter and real incomes falling all explain these figures.The consumer is king and if they want to buy online then that is their call, you can\u0027t do anything about it. But you can\u0027t leave the cost base with the old high street and expect it to survive with a new entrant, the internet.It\u0027s not fair to leave the high street to pick up the rates bill when they are only picking up 75 per cent of the trade that used to be there, due to what has gone online. We say to the Government, let the consumer be king but reduce the rates bill for those left in bricks and mortar on the high street.There should also be an equivalent version of business rates for warehousing, particularly if that warehousing is used for retail fulfilment.The last rates increase in April has been the last straw for a lot of struggling retailers, because of the massive increases. The Government says it has put rates relief measures in place to help those struggling, but it has not.It has exempted shops below \u0026pound12,000 rateable value when it used to be \u0026pound6,000, but there aren\u0027t many of our members with rateable value shops of \u0026pound12,000.Those are really tiny shops - the average independent is trading with a rateable value of about \u0026pound24,000. STOCKYorkshire and the Humber, and Greater London, have suffered the greatest decline in 2017He also highlighted the minimum wage and pensions auto-enrolment.While the Government prefers everyone to earn a certain amount, they have asked employers to pick up a bigger wage bill, he said. They have also made them pick up the cost of autoenrolment into pension schemes. The trade association, which represents 150,000 independent UK retailers, has submitted a proposal to the Government with simple measures to help its members. A cut in business rates is top of the list.Mr Hawkins said: If we had a \u0026pound12,000 allowance rather than a \u0026pound12,000 cliff edge, these shops on \u0026pound24,000 would see their rates halved. And if they were tighter on charitable relief and harder on internet warehouses there would be ways of making it revenue neutral.He said the three Ps - parking, property taxes and planning permission - were vitally important. He said: Parking is number one because it is perceived to be free out of town, even though it\u0027s often not.Newsagents, women\u0027s clothes shops and estate agents struggled the mostProperty taxes, being rates and rents, have also hit the high street.And finally planning permission, because it is too tempting for local planners to say \u0027yes, we\u0027ll allow a major development because it creates 10,000 jobs\u0027, without realising they are losing 11,000 jobs in the high street.A spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: This Government is determined to see our high streets thriving - now, and in the future.

and it went up to £7.38 from April 1, 2018.The wage increased from £5.60 to £5.90 for 18 to 20-year-olds, and from £4.05 to £4.20 for under 18s.However, apprentices were only entitled to £3.50 if they are under-19 - this increased to £3.70 from April 1, 2018.In April 2018, the minimum wage for 25-year-olds rose from £7.50 to £7.83 an hour.The national limits are legally binding.Anyone who thinks they are not getting the National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage should complain to their employer in the first instance.If this does not get anywhere, the next step is to take the complaint to HMRC who will investigate.Those who are self-employed, voluntary workers, company directors and family members who live in the home of the employer and do household chores do not qualify for either rate.There is no difference in pay for those that live in London compared to elsewhere.The only discrepancy is for people working in agriculture or horticulture.Workers already employed before October 1, 2013 are entitled to the pay set under their contract of employment.This is a voluntary scheme aiming to recognise the actual cost of living, to which 3,000 employers have signed up.Under it, the lowest rate of pay is calculated according to the cost of living in the UK based on the changing cost of a basket of groceries.The amount is set by the charity Living Wage Foundation, and accredited employers include local authorities, NHS trusts, banks, retailers, charities and construction companies.The foundations calculations put the real Living Wage at £8.75 an hour - and £10.20 in London.These rates also apply to over-18s in recognition that young people face the same living costs as everyone else.And while companies are not legally entitled to pay more than the National Living and Minimum Wages, those which have signed up to the real Living Wage scheme have pledged to pay all workers those rates.The rate is calculated every November, and accredited employers are committed to any increases.While theres no legal obligation for your employer to pay you more than the National Living Wage (£7.50 from April 1, 2017), if your company is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation you should be receiving more than that.The foundations head of partnerships Graham Griffiths said anyone concerned can use their online whistleblowing service, and any employer not adhering to the Real Living Wage faced losing its accreditation.Graham said one area where it was challenging to pay the living wage were retail and hospitality but pointed to Ikea, Aldi and Lidl, which have agreed to pay the same rate.The scheme was launched in 2001 by parents in East London, and the foundation was set up in 2011.In 2005 following a growing interest from employers, the Greater London Authority established the Living Wage Unit to calculate what the lowest pay should ideally be.In 2008 Trust for London selected the scheme as a special initiative and made a grant of more than £1million to campaign for it and set up an accreditation scheme for employers.In April 2016 it became the inspiration for the governments higher minimum wage rate, which it rebranded the National Living Wage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Because expectations are so low for the Tories, they are almost bound to surpass them.Mrs May’s own position is also stronger than it was in January thanks to her handling of the Salisbury attack.At the start of the local election campaign, the talk was of how the Tories were facing a wipe-out in London, how they would do well to end up holding on to even one council.But senior figures involved in the campaign now admit they should do much better than that.Conservative Campaign Headquarters’ biggest worry in London is simply being outgunned on the day.They fear Labour’s return to being a mass membership party under Jeremy Corbyn will enable them to get nearly all their voters out, while the Tories will struggle to get more than 40 per cent of their supporters to the polls.There is, though, still cautious optimism that the Tories will hold at least one of their two flagship London boroughs, Wandsworth and Westminster.Then they could claim the results were respectable for a government in mid-term.This is especially true as results outside London are expected to be quite good for the party.One former Cabinet minister loyal to Theresa May tells me: “Things outside London really aren’t bad.”The Tories are particularly hopeful of making gains in the West Midlands.It will be tempting for the Tories to declare the local elections are further proof the capital and the rest of country are diverging politically, and so their decline in London doesn’t matter much as it will be made up for elsewhere.But this would be a catastrophic mistake.Labour’s rise in London is quite remarkable.They have gone from 37 per cent of the vote in 2010 to 55 per cent in 2017.There are several reasons why the capital is turning red but one of the biggest is the decline in home ownership.Home ownership in London peaked in the 1990s and has been falling since.Homeowners became a minority in London in 2011, the first time that has been the case since Margaret Thatcher’s Right To Buy revolution in the early 1980s.On current trends, 60 per cent of Londoners will be renters in seven years’ time.It is no coincidence that this rise in renting has coincided with Labour’s surge in the capital.For one of the things that makes you most likely to vote Tory is owning your own home.Labour’s surprise success at the last election was largely down to a big increase in turnout among renters who swung heavily to Labour.Labour London offers a preview of what happens to the Tories when homeowners become a minority.If the Tories want to win elections they need to get more homes built — and fast.CABINET Brexiteers are getting increasingly frustrated.They feel that key decisions are not being taken in Cabinet, or even the Cabinet Committee tasked with managing the negotiation, but elsewhere.One senior Brexiteer complains to me that Olly Robbins, the Prime Minister’s chief Europe adviser, is, “Running around telling everyone we have to back down on pretty much everything”.This grumpiness has been exacerbated by this week’s meeting of the Brexit inner Cabinet not discussing the big issue of the moment, customs.One member of it tells me: “When people left, they all felt a greater level of frustration.”There is a sense No10 is not respecting the political process.This all ups the ante ahead of the Brexit inner Cabinet’s meeting next week.This will discuss Theresa May’s plan for a hybrid customs model which would see the UK leave the customs union but collect tariffs on the EU’s behalf.Brexiteer ministers regard this as complicated and as having no chance of being accepted by Brussels. They think persisting with it just wastes valuable time.One tells me Mrs May has been told this hybrid plan is unworkable on eight occasions but doesn’t show any signs of abandoning the idea.Part of the problem is that Mrs May remains deeply worried about whether she has the votes in the Commons to leave the customs union.No10 is extremely concerned about the customs union amendment to the trade bill, which is expected to come to a vote in June.Its hope is the hybrid model is close enough to a customs union to see off a rebellion on this issue but if the model is unworkable, as pretty much everyone thinks, it doesn’t solve anything.Mrs May would be better off making the argument that Brexit won’t mean Brexit if Britain doesn’t regain the ability to run its own trade policy and that she couldn’t continue as Prime Minister in these circumstances.CHRIS GRAYLING wants to make it a criminal offence to cheat on auto emissions tests.This law change, which will be part of Grayling’s road to zero plan to cut exhaust emissions and improve air quality, will enable the Government to prosecute car manufacturers who try to diddle the system.The law won’t apply retrospectively.But the Department for Transport hope it will help prevent a repeat of the Volkswagen scandal.OUR political class needs to remember we are NOT Americans.The question about Donald Trump isn’t whether we would have voted for him or if we think he is the right person to be President of the United States.But how we should deal with the country he leads – which is our most important security ally.No country expelled more Russian diplomats following the Salisbury attack than the United States.Mrs May should make clear that she is delighted, not embarrassed, to welcome Donald Trump to Britain on his “working visit”.Why, because a strong relationship with the United States is in this country’s national interest.French President Emmanuel Macron, on his state visit to Washington this week, didn’t hold back in either cosying up to the president, quite literally at times, or in making clear where he disagreed with him.This is a far more sensible approach than acting all embarrassed about observing the necessary diplomatic niceties.Without Trump, yesterday’s moment of history would not have happened. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It aims to force a binding Parliamentary vote on the draft deal while talks are still ongoing.Crucially, if the deal is rejected, MPs and peers would then have power to instruct ministers what action to take – even if it means stopping Brexit.Last night, angry Brexiteers accused peers of sneaky and dishonest tactics to frustrate our departure from the EU.Brexit Minister Lord Callanan said: “Labour’s flawed amendment seeks to tie our hands by inserting false deadlines and shifting the power to negotiate from government to Parliament.“It asks for meaningless votes on the deal before the deal is done.
