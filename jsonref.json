And while there is evidence of broad disparities in the quality of education these pupils are receiving, the majority are unlikely to return to school before September. For certain age groups though, the school gates opened again earlier this month, meaning that students at pivotal points in their learning could have face-to-face access to their teachers for the first time since March.Before reopening the doors of Bonneville primary school to reception, year 1 and year 6 pupils on 3 June, headteacher Andrea Parker spent weeks preparing pupils, staff and the school building itself for a safe and productive end to the summer term.From installing hand sanitisers and distance markers to iding children into “bubbles” with their own classrooms, equipment and playtimes, Parker took pains to keep staff, pupils and teachers safe.Before her doors were opened to the children, she communicated the changes to everyone involved, including in weekly newsletters and a video hosted by teachers showing pupils what to expect on their return.“To see everyone sticking to the timetable – to see parents coming in and lining up on the 2-metre lines as you planned them to do, bubbles of children moving at the right times, and everything running smoothly, makes me exceedingly proud,” says Parker.“It’s been a community effort, and has taken a lot of hard work from education professionals who’ve spent hours perfecting what we need to do in order to get children back to school – we’ve been living and breathing it.“But the result was that there was no reluctance on the children’s part when they came back – they’re thrilled to see their friends and be able to play with each other. The parents have been very grateful too, and our teachers are really happy to be back.”The safety measures put in place at Bonneville have run as planned, with the addition of Friday afternoon “induction days” for any staff who are returning to school for the first time the following week.“Any teachers who were anxious before coming back were reassured as soon as they saw how everything worked,” Parker says. “So we introduced the induction days to give them the opportunity to walk through and see the school in action for themselves before returning.”“We were apprehensive, obviously, but I was desperate for my daughter to go back to Bonneville because she was getting a bit down at home,” says Miriam Paridjanian, whose 10-year-old daughter Rosa was one of those returning. Paridjanian, who is a qualified teacher, found home schooling “very challenging”, and jumped at the chance for her daughter to be able to work alongside her friends again.“Rosa is normally very bright and bubbly, but she just wasn’t feeling happy,” says Paridjanian. “I had a really hard time motivating her – she was getting a bit despondent and unmotivated, and she didn’t want to do the work.“The school seemed to have prepared for reopening very well – there was lots of communication, and I knew if I had any queries they’d be answered – so whenthe offer came to send her back, I took it.“Psychologically, I think children need that routine of getting ready and leaving the house in the morning, and since we sent Rosa back after half term she’s perked up so much – she’s like a different child. It’s made a difference to the whole family.”Despite some initial misgivings, Rosa is equally happy to be back at Bonneville.“I was excited when Mum told me I’d be going back to school but nervous too, in case it didn’t work and we’d have to go back to being home schooled,” she says. “Some parts aren’t great – we have to eat lunch in our classrooms, then go out to play, whereas we’d usually just all eat together in the dinner hall, which is better.“But I’ve made some new friends, because we all play together in our bubble in the playground now, and lessons are easier to do in school because we’ve got help from our teachers. I also like seeing my friends – everything’s more fun with friends.”With primary schools such as Bonneville reopening, the next stage of the UK government’s plans to bring children gradually back into formal education began on 15 June. Years 10 and 12 are encouraged to receive some “contact time” in advance of the summer break, and exams taking place in 2021.Hinchingbrooke school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, is one of the secondary schools that has reopened its doors to years 10 and 12.“I’m extremely proud of our teachers and the whole army of support staff who’ve worked really hard to make the school safe,” says Andrew Goulding, chief executive of a four-school academy trust that incorporates Hinchingbrooke school.“Teaching is a lot more than just imparting knowledge and giving pupils the opportunity to develop their skills. It’s about supporting iniduals and their complex emotions.“Although Hinchingbrooke and many others have done a great job with online learning, there’s no real substitute for being face-to-face with a teacher, because a good teacher motivates students in ways online learning can’t. Fundamentally, teaching is about human interaction.”To prepare for its new arrivals, the school has split its year 12 pupils into two groups, who attend one day a week on Monday and Tuesday. Similarly, the larger year 10 has been ided into three groups, each attending on Wednesday, Thursday or Friday.Between the year groups, some children will attend school every day of the week, and the system allows the school to manage a large number of students across each week during what are key educational years.“It’s really clear from the feedback we’ve had from parents that they’re desperate for their children to get back to school,” says Hinchingbrooke’s school principal, Mark Patterson. “They need that safety net and routine.“Quite a lot of the students, particularly the younger ones, are struggling with self-discipline. But while it’s important for everyone to be back at school, you have to prioritise those students who are nearer to their national exams, because they’re the first ones who’ll be tested externally next year. Giving them some time in person before the summer, so we can direct their learning, is crucial.”Like Parker, Patterson has prioritised communication to reassure students and ease them back into lessons, via weekly virtual assemblies and video call sessions for each tutor group.“We’re one community, and have had to rise to the challenge of keeping that sense of identity through the crisis,” he says. “But when students come back, it’s a dramatically changed picture from the one they left before lockdown. Familiarising them with school again shouldn’t be underestimated.”Returning children have received a set of safety guidelines, and both students and parents have been asked to sign a contract agreeing to abide by them.Safety measures put in place at the time include red circles marked on the ground 2 metres apart to help with queueing, reorganised classrooms with distanced desks and chairs, and one-way systems to ensure students don’t have to pass each other in close proximity. There’s also signage around the school reminding everyone of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand-washing and keeping their distance.Year 12 Hinchingbrooke student Rheeya Makwana, 17, had to learn how to adapt when she returned to school on 15 June – and so far, she’s pleased to be back.“I can study quite well independently anyway, but it’s better to be back at school,” she says. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom – and although it was obviously quite different being 2 metres away from the teacher, they still tried to teach as normal.“Seeing my friends again was so great, too. During lockdown, I FaceTimed them every day, but it’s different seeing them at school.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

Does the board still think Beijing is committed to the principle of “one country, two systems”? That was the basis on which it offered support.HSBC’s response on Wednesday was a deafening “no comment”, a position that looks impossible to maintain for long. David Cumming of Aviva Investors was right last month when said that “if companies make political statements, they must accept the corporate responsibilities that follow”.Specifically, he told HSBC and Standard Chartered, which also did as Beijing clearly instructed, that they would be expected “to confirm that they will also speak out publicly if there are any future abuses of democratic freedoms connected to this law”.Apologists for HSBC’s craven stance argued the bank had little real choice. It makes most of its profits from Hong Kong and, if Beijing wants “a show of fealty”, as US secretary of state Mike Pompeo put it mockingly, it can’t refuse without commercial consequences. In any case, sermons from Washington sound hypocritical if the former US national security adviser John Bolton’s account of President Trump fawning over Xi Jinping is correct.That’s all true, of course, but the implementation of the new security law, in a more draconian form than feared, raises the stakes. HSBC chose to speak out in support of Beijing last month, and cannot now expect to return to its old habit of apolitical silence. Rival bankers whisper that they’ll be amazed if HSBC is still listed and regulated in London five years from now. If that analysis is wrong, HSBC’s chairman, Mark Tucker, is free to say why.The most hackneyed phrase in retailing is “sales are vanity, profits are sanity”. Sainsbury’s illustrates the point: the pandemic has delivered the biggest boom in sales in decades, yet the whirl of activity is expected to deliver no extra profit this year.Indeed, Sainsbury’s can only say that full-year underlying pre-tax profits are likely to be unchanged from last year’s £586m because the business rates freebie from government will cover most of the additional Covid-19 operating costs of £500m-ish.That all lies ahead for the new chief executive, Simon Roberts, who was in non-committal mode on his first outing. But possibilities are opening up.A “Digital Markets Unit” – the Competition and Markets Authority’s big idea for how to police the territory of Google and Facebook – sounds an excellent proposal. It is perfectly obvious that a virtual duopoly exists in the digital advertising market. And it’s equally clear that the scope for competition is limited by business models that lock out rivals.Some of the CMA’s suggested remedies would bring howls of outrage from the digital duo if they ever got close to being enacted. Giving Facebook users the right to opt out of personalised advertising would be a game-changer.

The defining features of the exercise are randomness and futility, which makes it an unfortunate metaphor for Boris Johnson to use for his government’s strategy when dealing with local Covid-19 outbreaks.The re-imposition of lockdown controls on Leicester is the first test of that approach and indications are not encouraging. The mayor, Sir Peter Soulsby, has complained about slow sharing of vital information from central government. It appears to have taken almost two weeks for evidence that the disease was surging in the city to translate into practical action.Even now it is unclear to what extent the high number of cases in Leicester indicates a discrete spike from exceptional local factors or a high general infection rate made visible by more intense testing. If the whole country is to move safely forwards there has to be some discernment of causes and patterns in occurrence of the virus. It seems there is not yet the infrastructure in place either to collect the necessary data or apply the information it yields with sufficient speed.Part of the problem is a distinction between cases recorded by NHS hospitals and tests conducted by private-sector providers for the centralised track-and-trace system. Local authorities say the latter data set, processed by commercial labs, is either not reaching them or not providing sufficient granularity to allow even an approximation of real-time monitoring.In parliament on Wednesday Mr Johnson denied that local government was being fed an incomplete picture, but his record does not invite trust. This is a government that abandoned testing at the start of the pandemic when it should have been accelerating, then double-counted tests to achieve the semblance of reaching an arbitrary target. It is also an administration that has ramped up expectation of a great liberation from lockdown so as to energise economic activity across England, without regard for regional variations in prevalence and ignoring more cautious counsel from many scientists. Mr Johnson’s stated ambition is for a swift return to “bustle” on the high street – an image almost as inappropriate as whack-a-mole given the requirements of physical distancing. When asked in parliament last week how local authorities should manage sudden throngs of people in popular locations, his reply was that they should “show some guts”. That attitude would not have helped Leicester.Demographic and socio-economic factors in one of the country’s most ethnically erse cities might well be an issue in the east Midlands, given the already proven vulnerability of BAME communities. Data analysis indicating potential Covid “hot spots” offers no definitive interpretation. Our view of the local contours of the pandemic is hazy because the national response has been haphazard. Millions of English shoppers and pub-goers are expected to swarm across that uncharted landscape on Saturday to fulfil Mr Johnson’s hopes of a consumer-stimulated economic recovery. Localised returns to lockdown are inevitable as the virus continues to circulate. National government might not be able to eliminate that threat but it can help local authorities to protect themselves promptly. Leicester’s misfortune is to have stress-tested the system and proved it inadequate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f9f4526a1ecc0302c4ac47fcf18c2b643b600d3/373_266_2934_1759/master/2934.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3cf57dfbedf9667f0de429c6f98229d4","title":"what a brief moment of being outnumbered taught me about race relations","story":"At a memorial for the great Cyrille Regis, I had a very instructive glimpse of what it is like to be in the minorityWhen I was a kid my hero was Cyrille Regis, one of the famous trio of brilliant black footballers who played for my team, West Brom. I lived in a place called Hagley, which is where people from Birmingham and the Black Country went to live if they had done well for themselves. Hagley was almost entirely white there was one black kid in my year at school.I absolutely revered Cyrille, along with his teammates Brendon Batson and Laurie Cunningham, and was overwhelmed with horror at the racist abuse they endured from opposing fans and, on occasion, even their own supporters.The first time I met Cyrille was many years after he had stopped playing and was back coaching at West Brom. I was filming something there that involved a bit of running around the pitch. Afterwards I walked into the shower in the dressing room and who should be in there but Cyrille. My legs went all wibbly-wobbly then and every subsequent time it was my privilege to spend time with him.Cyrille died two years ago, just short of his 60th birthday. All our hearts were broken. Shortly afterwards his family invited me to a memorial event in Harlesden. Although Cyrille had lived in Birmingham for most of his adult life, it was this part of north-west London where he had grown up, putting down deep roots. On this midwinter’s evening, several hundred people – friends, family, locals and football people – had gathered in a community hall. It was all a bit chaotic, with music playing and everyone talking and hugging. I was taken over to Cyrille’s brother-in-law Otis in a corner of this huge room. A slideshow of our hero’s life shone on a wall. After a while Otis asked me if I would say a few words. I hadn’t prepared anything, but this was an honour I could hardly turn down.Anyway, I had no choice, because suddenly the music stopped, the lights went on and I was introduced. I will never forget that moment, as I turned around to be faced with a big crowd that was overwhelmingly black. I was outnumbered. I doubt this counts as relevant “lived experience”, but I realised that, incredibly, in my 50 years I had never been outnumbered before. Having talked to many black footballers of Cyrille’s era and later, and written, broadcast, sympathised and opined on what they went through many times over the years, this picture pulled things into a sharp focus for the first time. Those players, their families and the communities they were from were all outnumbered, and still are.I managed to get some words out in the right order and I thanked God, as well as Otis, for the opportunity. The following morning, I called a black friend of mine, the television executive Pat Younge, to tell him about my evening being one of the very few people in the room with my colour skin. “That has been my life since I was 18,” he said. Since that night I haven’t been able to help seeing everything through the prism of the notion of outnumbering. It was a novelty for me it’s plainly a different matter if it’s like that all the time. The outnumbered’s lives will probably have added discomfort compared with those in the majority – and their experiences will be overshadowed by that. There are some white people who, finding themselves the exception not the rule in their changing communities, will doubtless feel the same way. Perhaps I would I don’t know. But it’s absurd that nationally there are many white people whose fear of being outnumbered is so great that they have entirely forgotten that they constitute more than four-fifths of the population and that this outnumbering is never going to happen.It might help if those of us doing the outnumbering all found ways of being properly outnumbered ourselves every now and then, just so we know, however briefly, what it feels like."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a2f58159f0ed8b2ee1adc90d8b809e772d729e4/0_258_4887_2932/master/4887.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c773d50f1ba4e0688f4cabe262d120b8","title":"english schools using coronavirus as excuse not to teach special needs pupils","story":"Risk assessments being used to keep children at home for ‘spurious reasons’, MPs hearSchools in England are using Covid-19 risk assessments as a “blanket excuse” to prevent pupils with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) from attending classes, MPs have been told.Campaigners told the cross-party education committee that schools were using “spurious reasons” to avoid having pupils with Send in education settings. Many children isolated at home have had little or no support and their families have been left feeling “utterly abandoned”, MPs heard.The committee, which is investigating the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on education in England, also heard that children with additional needs had seen their support “fall off a cliff” during the pandemic, and as a result the physical, emotional and mental health of many had deteriorated.Philippa Stobbs, the policy vice-chair of the Special Educational Consortium, said there were examples of good provision in some areas but elsewhere parents have had no contact with their school or local authority.“The impact of that is absolutely devastating,” said Stobbs. “The difficulty for a family left to home educate their child with a lack of any provision from a school or local authority is almost unimaginable, and the impact of that in terms of physical and mental wellbeing is going to be deep and, I fear, lasting.”Pupils with education, health and care plans (EHCPs) were among those offered school places during lockdown, alongside children of key workers and vulnerable students. While some families have chosen to keep children at home, the committee was told others have been unable to access places.Ali Fiddy, the chief executive of the Independent Provider of Special Education Advice, told MPs: “What we’re certainly seeing is the risk assessment process being used as a blanket excuse for not meeting the needs of children and young people and not having them in education settings – with either no reasons being given, or spurious reasons around, for example, ‘Well, your child isn’t capable of social distancing’, or ‘Your child won’t wash their hands without prompting’.”The committee was told that children and young people with Send had lost their additional support as a result of the government’s decision to relax the legal duty on local authorities – overstretched as a result of the Covid-19 crisis – to deliver provision outlined in EHCPs.The committee chairman, Conservative MP Robert Halfon, said the evidence provided by campaigners and lawyers painted an “incredibly depressing” picture of how the pandemic had affected children with Send and their families.Beyond the immediate crisis, witnesses warned of a rise in disability discrimination as schools fully reopen in September, with some children regarded as too high-risk and no focused catch-up provision for those with Send.They also raised concerns about a potential jump in exclusions among children with Send who will have been adversely affected by lockdown, particularly if the government enforces a “zero-tolerance” approach to behaviour once schools fully return.MPs were also told of the toll the crisis had taken on families left to care 247 for children with high needs during the lockdown. “A lot of families aren’t only home-schooling, they’re home nursing, administering therapies, some doing 247 care generally with very little support,” said Amanda Batten, the chair of the Disabled Children’s Partnership."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46eff7f400119c616a0d6861a7cab02dd390ccb7/668_161_2921_1753/master/2921.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f27c689c05d7176d683c06a862f315bb","title":"minister lambasts uk universities policy for letting down students","story":"Speech by Michelle Donelan signals a rebalancing of tertiary education away from HE sectorThe 20-year crusade to get more young people into higher education appears at an end, after the universities minister accused England’s universities of “taking advantage” of students with dumbed-down courses that left them saddled with debt.In a significant shift in policy, Michelle Donelan declared it was time to “think again” about the government’s use of higher education to boost social mobility.“Since 2004, there has been too much focus on getting students through the door, and not enough focus on how many drop out, or how many go on to graduate jobs. Too many have been misled by the expansion of popular-sounding courses with no real demand from the labour market,” Donelan said.“Quite frankly, our young people have been taken advantage of, particularly those without a family history of going to university. Instead some have been left with the debt of an investment that didn’t pay off in any sense.“And too many universities have felt pressured to dumb down – either when admitting students, or in the standards of their courses. We have seen this with grade inflation and it has to stop.”The minister’s comments came as the government was to offer new policies on skills and qualifications for school-leavers in England, rebalancing away from universities and emphasising social mobility through skilled, well-paid jobs secured through further education and apprenticeships.A white paper on further education is to be announced later this month, along with a green paper on higher education that will limit courses where a high percentage of students drop out or where few go on to graduate-level employment.Those close to the government said the rebalancing effort brings to an end policies promoted since the late 1990s, including Tony Blair’s famous pledge for half of all young people to go on to higher education.“For decades we’ve been recruiting too many young people on to courses that do nothing to improve their life chances or help with their career goals,” Donelan said.The new policy aims to have universities spend access funds on raising standards in schools rather than on “marketing”. Donelan pointedly praised Kings College London and Exeter universities for supporting specialist sixth-form colleges.Donelan’s comments appeared to repudiate her own government’s guidance to the Office for Students, the higher education regulator for England. Asked about the use of contextual admissions by universities to help under-represented groups gain entry, Donelan said: “To be frank, we don’t help disadvantaged students by levelling down, we help by levelling up.”Donelan’s speech came at the launch of a new national effort to help disadvantaged students affected by Covid-19 apply to university, backed by the National Education Opportunities Network (Neon).Graeme Atherton, Neon’s director, said: “The government’s own evidence still shows that going to university brings economic and social benefits for the vast majority of students – from all backgrounds, but sometimes these benefits are apparent only over the long term.“It is not true that widening access work has taken advantage of young people, rather it has transformed thousands of lives over the last 20 years.”Jo Grady, general secretary of the University and College Union, said the government’s obsession with graduate earnings was a worrying signal.“Instead of making the case for education, the minister appears to be trying to turn some students off university by saying it is expensive and substandard. Universities using contextual data to increase opportunity for students from the poorest backgrounds should be applauded,” Grady said.“For the minister to say students have been left indebted and let down is quite remarkable when the Conservatives are responsible for increasing tuition fee debt and letting the private sector squeeze more and more money out of higher education.”Chris Hale, director of policy at Universities UK, said official data showed that a university degree gave a significant boost to a career prospects, as graduates earned about £9,000 more a year than those without a degree."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7682a32703dc843b988dd961471afd767485506f/0_118_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67b5ea9f2c3696071896661f5d04d246","title":"air pollution likely to make coronavirus worse say uk experts","story":"Experts say further investigation of link is urgently required and may be relevant to managing pandemic Air pollution is likely to be increasing the number and severity of Covid-19 infections, according to the UK government’s expert advisers.In a report published on Wednesday, the experts said further investigation of the link between dirty air and the coronavirus pandemic was “urgently required” and may be relevant to how the pandemic is managed.The reports add to pressure on ministers to address the issue of air pollution and coronavirus, following calls from MPs for action and warnings from lawyers that the government has a legal obligation to urgently review its air quality strategy.There is growing evidence from around the world linking exposure to dirty air to increased coronavirus infections and deaths, with some suggesting it plays a significant role. But ruling out other possible factors is complex and time-consuming, meaning a definitive conclusion is yet to be reached.Exposure to air pollution is firmly linked to increases in respiratory and heart disease and these factors can increase the risk of severe Covid-19 symptoms, said Prof Alastair Lewis of the University of York, the chair of the UK government’s independent science advisory group on air pollution. “Given this, it would not be surprising if there was a link between exposure to air pollution – past or present – and the Covid-19 infection.”The section of the report on this issue was written by another government advisory group, the Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants, chaired by Prof Frank Kelly, of Imperial College London, and composed of 15 academic experts.“Although there is, as yet, no clear empirical evidence that exposure to air pollutants increases the likelihood or severity of Covid-19 infection, knowledge of the impacts of air pollution on health suggests that this is likely,” the group concluded.“Potential interactions between air pollution and Covid-19 may be relevant to the future management of the pandemic in the UK and elsewhere,” said the committee. Medical resources might be raised in polluted areas, for example.Long-term air pollution may worsen the impact of Covid-19 on patients, while short-term pollution may irritate the lungs and increase the risk of infection. Traces of the virus have also been found in samples of air pollution, raising questions about airborne spread outdoors. “Further investigation into all of the possible mechanisms is urgently required,” said the committee.In June, lawyers acting for Mums for Lungs and the Good Law Project told ministers that the potential risk to life posed by air pollution during the pandemic means ministers must act even if the evidence is not yet conclusive. Dirty air is already estimated to cause 40,000 early deaths a year in the UK.Ninety parliamentarians have also urged the government to back action on air pollution to help avoid a second wave of coronavirus, while an air pollution inquiry by a select committee of MPs is examining delays in the rollout of clean air zones in cities as a result of the pandemic.The failure to consider air pollution as a factor in the higher rates of coronavirus deaths among minority ethnic groups, who are disproportionately exposed, was recently called “astonishing” and “wholly irresponsible” by critics of a Public Health England review."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25004f4e240ddf6f062920f27c5b018584ce21a2/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=801cd452f0d65bd2f8ab77975b66692f","title":"water firms raw sewage england rivers","story":"Untreated effluent flowed into waterways for more than 1.5m hours, data showsWater companies in England discharged raw sewage into rivers on more than 200,000 occasions last year, according to data obtained by the .The analysis reveals untreated human waste was released into streams and rivers for more than 1.5m hours in 2019.The figures, obtained via environmental information requests, trace releases of sewage from storm drains in rivers across England by all nine water companies and provide a comprehensive picture of the scale of pollution from what critics say is the routine dumping of untreated sewage.Popular English rivers including the Thames, the Windrush, which runs through the Cotswolds and Oxfordshire, the River Chess, a chalk stream in Buckinghamshire, the Avon in Bristol, the Severn, and the River Wharfe in Ilkley are among the many affected.When the sewer system is operating normally, sewage leaves homes and businesses and is treated at a treatment works. Only when it has been treated is wastewater released to the environment, either out to sea through long outfalls or coastal discharges, or into rivers.The vast majority of England’s sewer network is a combined system, which dates back to Victorian engineering, and is designed to collect the contents of people’s toilets and surface rainwater then transfer them together to treatment plants.After extreme rainfall, the treatment works cannot cope with the volume of water and untreated sewage. Human excrement, condoms, sanitary towels and toilet paper are released untreated into rivers through combined sewer overflow pipes – just as it was in 19th-century London.These pipes are supposed to be a safety valve to release pressure in the system and used only when an exceptionally large amount of water enters the system.The data emerges as increasing numbers of people are using England’s rivers to swim, kayak and paddleboard.Countries are legally obliged to treat sewage before it is released into waterways. Discharges of untreated human waste are permitted only in “exceptional circumstances” for example after extreme rainfall, the European court of justice has ruled.But the scale of the sewage releases in 2019 reveals what one industry insider said was the frequent and routine nature of discharging untreated effluent from storm overflows.The source, who has worked in the industry for many years, said the discharges released “a horrible septic mix of nasties into the rivers”.He said the industry had for years ignored warnings about the growing scale of spills from combined sewer overflows (CSOs) – storm pipes that allow rainwater, untreated sewage and runoff to discharge into waterways.Recent scientific research has also raised concerns that Covid-19 can be carried into rivers via sewage discharges. data reveals 6,508 inland CSOs released untreated sewage into rivers 204,134 times in 2019. The spills discharged for 1.53m hours across the nine English water companies.Luke Pollard, the shadow environment secretary, said: “Sewage discharges should take place only in the most extreme of circumstances. Regulation needs to be tightened to stop water companies using discharges as a day-to-day measure.“Customers will rightly be shocked at the frequency of sewage discharges and the damage it does to some of our country’s most precious and valuable river habitats.”The Environment Agency issues permits to allow water companies to release untreated human waste, which includes excrement, condoms and toilet paper, from CSOs after extreme weather events, such as torrential rain, to stop water backing up and flooding homes.More than 60 discharges a year from a storm overflow should trigger an investigation by the agency but the data reveals some storm overflows have released discharges hundreds of times. The Environment Agency relies on water companies to self-monitor their CSOs.Ashley Smith of the campaign group Windrush against Sewage Pollution said the system was little more than a “licence to pollute”. Smith, who monitors sewage spills on the River Windrush in Oxfordshire, said discharges happened after just a rain shower.He said: “The industry has been given a way to prop up failed infrastructure and it has exploited this enthusiastically. The inability of the Environment Agency to prosecute or even drive improvement has led us to where we are today – in a complete shambles with pollution rife and unchecked.”Michelle Walker of the Rivers Trust described the data as “very alarming”. The environmental charity worked with the ’s data to create an interactive map where you can search for river discharges by area.She said: “When you look at the detail, you see that some of these locations are releasing untreated sewage hundreds of times a year, so they are not just operating during extreme rainstorms.”A recent study revealed the quantity of E coli coming out of CSOs was between 1,000 and 10,000 times higher than that coming from treated sewage from wastewater treatment plants.Walker said: “People think our rivers should be fit to swim in but they don’t realise it is legal to discharge untreated raw sewage into our rivers.”Water companies say the spills are so diluted by rainwater and wastewater that they do not affect the quality of the water.Wessex Water said: “As CSOs should only operate during periods of intense rainfall, any foul water released from them will be very dilute … Rarely is a pollution incident attributed to a CSO operating correctly.”Water companies were told by the government to install monitoring on the majority of their combined sewer overflows by March 2020. But by June, the  data reveals 3,400 out of about 10,000 inland outflows owned by the nine water companies still had no monitoring installed.Wessex Water has fitted monitoring devices to 495 of its 1,018 CSOs that can discharge into rivers and inland waters. Last year untreated sewage was released 13,876 times – more than twice as often as in 2018 – with a total duration over the year of 107,404 hours.South West Water has monitors on 410 of its 548 inland CSOs. In 2019, sewage was discharged from them 7,850 times over 36,149 hours.Yorkshire Water discharged untreated sewage from the 730 inland CSOs, which are monitored 22,906 times over 616,643 hours. Most of its 2,240 outflows into rivers are not fitted with monitors. data shows Southern Water released raw sewage into rivers last year 19,977 hours in 3,219 incidents.In March, the company separately pleaded guilty to 51 pollution charges over five years involving breaches of Environment Agency permits at treatment plants, which included 8,400 incidents of sewage escaping.Severn Trent has fitted monitoring devices to 1,239 of its 2,897 inland CSOs. The monitored storm overflows discharged untreated sewage for 272,518 hours in 2019.Dr Andrew Singer, a senior scientist at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, said the pollution impact of CSO discharge was a risk to ecological and human health.“English rivers, even the Thames and the Severn, are relatively small, so the contribution of CSOs to many of our rivers can be extremely significant,” he said. “Rivers are much more likely to be impacted now by CSOs because of the increase in population density and the fact that the sewage system has not expanded to meet it.”Singer called for more transparency from water companies.A spokesperson for Wessex Water said: “In an ideal world there would not be a combined sewerage system, but many sewers were laid at a time when only one drain served a property – carrying both rainwater and sewage … Since 2000 we have invested £181m to upgrade more than 582 CSOs, and there are plans to improve more over the next five years.”The Environment Agency could not say whether any of the 1.5m hours of spills had led to an investigation.A spokesperson said: “The sewage system is designed to overflow to relieve pressure on the system – discharges from CSOs are not a sign the system is faulty or being misused.“However, when companies do damage the environment, whether it is through polluting our waters or breaching permit conditions, we will take enforcement action against them including civil sanctions.”The spokesperson said there was more to do to improve water quality, despite substantial improvements over the past two decades. “We have already secured a more robust and consistent approach for water and sewerage companies to monitor CSO spills.”A spokesperson for the industry body Water UK, said: “The water industry is committed to the very highest environmental standards … Although there is currently no simple and effective alternative to overflows, there are some innovative solutions being used, such as sustainable drainage systems, which are natural features that help keep rainwater out of the sewer. In new housing developments, these can help to take some of the pressure off the sewer network.”• Visit an interactive map, created by the Rivers Trust with the ’s data, where you can search discharges in your area.• Statements from the water companies can be read in full here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7621830b87003585e894d48efdb78fdc0fe4c7d3/0_0_5129_3078/master/5129.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=0219a05ac1d5780c6d1391b5ba32969e","title":"how to cook crab linguine recipe felicity cloake","story":"Revive memories of Italian seaside cafes with this step-by-step guide to making classic crab linguineFew things scream summer holiday to me more than a big bowl of briny, seafood-studded pasta, even if it’s going to be eaten in front of the TV rather than some pretty Italian harbour. Happily, seafood is one of the things we do rather well in this country, and this dish is the perfect end for a fat, brown, British crab. Sunshine optional.\u0026nbsp2 brown crabs, or 200g brown crabmeat and 200g white crabmeat 400g linguine2 garlic cloves1 red chilli1 tbsp olive oil1 tsp fennel seeds, crushed1 lemon1 small bunch flat-leaf parsley, roughly choppedExtra-virgin olive oil, to finishStart with the crab. You may have bought it ready picked, but if not, you’ll need to get at the meat first. There are many online videos and tutorials showing this process in detail, but start by snapping off the claws close to the body, then remove the bottom of the shell by inserting the tip of a knife into the mouth (just below the eyes) and twisting gently.Prise off the back of the shell and locate and remove the hard spiny bits around the eyes and mouth, and the yellowish stomach sac attached to them, plus any bits of papery membrane and the dead man’s fingers, the greyish fronds around the edge of the shell. (Despite the name, they’re not poisonous, but they’re not very tasty, either.)Scoop the brown meat into one bowl and the white into another – a\u0026nbspsharp tap with a hammer, rolling pin or even a wooden spoon will help you to get into the stuff in the claws. Don’t miss the white meat in the leg sockets, either the handle of a teaspoon is a useful tool here. Keep any large pieces of claw meat separate.\u0026nbspBring a large pan of generously salted water to a boil and cook the pasta to your taste – this should take around eight to 10 minutes, unless you like it very al dente or very soft. Linguine is my preference here, but spaghetti, or any other long pasta, would also be fine (in fact, let’s be honest, almost any shape would be delicious).\u0026nbspWhile the pasta is cooking, peel and finely chop the garlic, and deseed and finely chop the chilli. Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium-low heat, then fry the garlic, chilli and fennel seeds for a couple of minutes until soft, but not coloured remember that garlic, in particular, burns easily.Take the frying pan off the heat, grate in the zest of half the lemon, then squeeze in the juice of the whole thing (do this through your other hand, to catch any errant pips alternatively, squeeze it into a cup and pour it into the pan through a sieve). Now stir in all the brown crab meat until well combined.\u0026nbspScoop a few tablespoons of the pasta cooking water out of the pan and set aside, then drain the pasta. Add the drained pasta to the frying pan, season and toss it around to coat the strands with the sauce add a little of the reserved cooking water, if you think it needs loosening.\u0026nbspRoughly chop the parsley, set a little aside to garnish and add the rest to the pan along with the 200g white crab meat (if you don’t have any large claw pieces, keep a little bit back, to finish). Toss again, ide between bowls and drizzle with a little extra-virgin olive oil. Finish with the remaining parsley and the claw (or reserved white) meat, and serve at once.If you’d like to add vegetables, the River Cafe puts shaved fresh fennel into its crab pasta, while River Cottage goes for fresh tomatoes (I reckon a handful of the cherry variety, added to the pan with the garlic and chilli, so they just burst in the heat, would be best). Tinned crab doesn’t seem to work well here, sadly – or at least not the brands I’ve tried.⁃  aims to publish recipes for sustainable fish.

You can pick one up for as little as three quid, and it does olives as well.If you haven’t got one of these and you’re faced with a recipe asking you to stone 500g of cherries, the most sensible course is to sit down, eat all the cherries and spit the stones out the window. This is, of course, the ultimate test of any cherry recipe: does it represent any sort of improvement on just eating cherries? If it’s close, a stoner may tip the balance.You can buy gadgets that stone six cherries at once, or machines that will stone a whole hopper full but, for a seasonal task like this, a little effort – a little ritual, even – is probably a good thing. It ought to take you a bit of time. There are other satisfactory methods, like this one using a bottle and a chopstick, but you may have to find the right bottleneck for your particular size of cherry. You can also manage the operation – messily – with a paperclip, should you find yourself cooking in an office setting.Nigel Slater’s recipes for cherry pie and cherry polenta cake are both good places to start – they’re straightforward and don’t ask too much of you. One of the difficulties of cherry season is that it arrives just at the point when the weather makes baking seem like a terrible idea. Chill your pastry dough that little bit longer, and find some shade to sit in while you wait.Cherry sorbet sounds an altogether cooler dessert, and Tamal Ray’s recipe requires only about 20 minutes over a hot stove. Better still, it has just three ingredients: cherries, sugar and white wine. Incidentally, if you’re going to end up with a puree, you don’t need to make a fuss about stoning the cherries. Just whack each one with the flat of a knife like you would a clove of garlic the stone will come away easily. Or, as Ray points out, you can cook the cherries whole and remove the stones once they’re soft.Clafoutis is a French dessert – whole cherries (stones left in, traditionally) baked in a batter until just set. Felicity Cloake’s perfect version contains almond essence and kirsch – a morello cherry liqueur which she describes as “ridiculously expensive”. Feel free to leave it out, along with the stones.Alternatively, you could invest in some kirsch for the season, since it is also called for in Liam Charles’s wholly nontraditional cherry bakewell custard tart. There is a lot going on in the name of this dish, but it is not unrelated to the clafoutis: cherries, almond essence and kirsch, baked in custard.This cherry galette also marries cherries and almonds – in this case via frangipane, the almond, flour, butter, sugar and egg paste that occupies a mysterious border realm somewhere between crust and filling. “Galette”, roughly translated, means “don’t worry – it’s supposed to look like that.” White spelt flour is recommended for the pastry, but it’s not a dealbreaker.Rachel Roddy’s cherry and ricotta tart has a latticed crust top with ricotta puffing out from underneath and a cherry filling below that. In Italy the cherries would be sour, but you can make this work with whatever sort you’ve got. The trick is to avoid overcooking the cherries – remove them with a slotted spoon before they turn mushy, reduce the remaining liquid to a syrup, and then put the cherries back in.Cherries and chocolate are another classic combination, most notably in black forest gateau, which is normally made with tinned black cherries, sometimes with the perverse addition of fresh cherries – stalks on – as a decoration. Dan Lepard uses fresh cherries to make the filling first. Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall preserves the basic pairing in his cherry chocolate tart, which calls for yet more kirsch. It also requires you to be forward thinking enough to leave the cherries to infuse overnight.For sheer laid-back ease, I love the idea of a “broken cake”: basically any stale cake ripped up and tossed with cherry syrup, fresh fruit, cream or ricotta and other things. It’s hardly even a recipe, and it makes Eton mess look positively ordered.Fresh cherries may just be for summer, but they’re not just for pudding. They can make an appearance in salads, alongside rocket or goat’s cheese or both, with cucumber, basil and quinoa, or roasted, with buttermilk dressing and lettuce.This pickled-cherries recipe (Nigel Slater again – going through his back catalogue, you get the impression he really likes cherries) can be served over mackerel or gammon. And duck with cherry sauce is most definitely a thing. A seasonal glut and a greedy nature will invariably leave you with some less than perfect, slightly post-ripe fruit and the distinct feeling that you never want to look at another cherry again. This will not last, but in the meantime you can make enough jam to see you through the dark, cheerless, cherryless months. This is an easy method, but the jam sugar is not optional: cherries are low in pectin, so they won’t set by themselves. In contrast, this cherry and chia seed jam, from reader Rheanna Lucy Akua Griffin, has no sugar in it: just a little agave nectar or honey.Finally, when you have exhausted all other avenues, make this cherry vodka – absolutely no stoning required. Slit 400g of cherries, heat them with water and sugar until dissolved, cool, add a bottle of vodka, seal the mixture up and leave it for at least four weeks. It’s the poor man’s kirsch."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e670a409b9aae220fd9c887bc5a9816d4d3e3f26/0_90_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96c14717776113130b9cd1c7232eb1b5","title":"arsenal norwich premier league match report","story":"On a balmy night at the Emirates Arsenal eased their way past a Norwich City team that offered all the resistance of a decorative bead curtain.Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored two and made one, and in between he looked like he wouldn’t mind playing these opponents every night of the week for the rest of this eerie summer off-season. Norwich were poor, defending throughout like a team unfamiliar with the basic concept but willing to give it a try. Daniel Farke’s team are running out of games, but also conviction.Arsenal, meanwhile, will take some heart both from the result and from some assured performances, not least from the excellent Dani Ceballos. Three wins in a week. Seven wins from the last 10. There may be flaws and holes and wobbly wheels on this evolving Arteta-built Arsenal team, but something is happening here.The switch to three at the back in the last few games has brought some success. It seems unlikely this was Mikel Arteta’s Plan A. But as the saying goes, when life gives you lemons, make a back three with David Luiz in it.Norwich made one change, Tom Trybull coming into a five-man midfield. Arsenal gave a start to Reiss Nelson, his first in the league this year. And the stadium was a breezy place at kick-off, a powder blue sky peering over the vast empty cantilevered stand. This is a stadium conceived and built in the name of full houses, hospitality spend and many other things that aren’t happening right now.Aubameyang had the first sight of goal after Granit Xhaka’s surge through a vacated midfield. Norwich spent those early moments arranged in a deep defensive block but Ben Godfrey produced the closest thing to a goal with 20 minutes gone, striding forward, finding no resistance, then king a shot from 30 yards on to the post.Steadily Ceballos began to take charge of midfield and to take charge of the ball generally, striding around like the only grown-up on the pitch, keeping possession in tight spaces and finding some telling angles near goal. Lukas Rupp was booked just after the half hour for hacking him down a little desperately.And two minutes later Arsenal were ahead, the goal a product of a horrible mistake from Tim Krul, who tried and failed to dribble around Aubameyang when he should have been hoofing the ball upfield. Aubameyang block-tackled Krul, then cut the loose ball back and into the net. It was his 50th Premier League goal in 79 games, the quickest Arsenal player to that mark. The post-Highbury period of drift has been dotted with starry underachievers. Aubameyang has not been one of them.Four minutes later it was 2-0. This was a fine team goal, sparked by a wonderful high punted David Luiz pass out to an unmarked Kieran Tierney on the left touchline. He took the ball down and found Aubameyang, who played a perfectly weighted pass for Granit Xhaka to shoot low and hard past Krul.There was time for Emiliano Martínez to produce a fine save from Kenny McLean’s free-kick. But the half had been defined by the craft of Ceballos and the incision of Aubameyang, whose game was a masterclass in attacking minimalism. His 18 first-half touches included three shots, the opening goal and an assist for the second.Adam Idah replaced the flaccid Teemu Pukki at half-time, an immediate upgrade, and Norwich were suddenly the aggressors as Arsenal exhaled. These things are of course relative. A 10-minute hounding from this Norwich City attack may be the footballing equivalent of being thrashed with a handful of dust-wipes, or roughed up by a platoon of squirrels. The best Norwich could muster was a penalty shout when the busy Todd Cantwell was bundled over. But stronger opponents will take advantage of this kind of doziness.Instead Arsenal roused themselves and scored a third, helped this time by a terrible pass across his own goal from Josip Drmic. The ball ran straight to Aubameyang, who took a touch and slid it past Krul. Cédric Soares added the fourth with a fine drive after a half-cleared corner. And Arsenal ended the evening in seventh place, a point above Tottenham Hotspur."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acf99b99f5694005ed195b2f776e96bd209d5aa2/45_0_2969_1782/master/2969.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f43fb90a84b2b9f717d4d73527a9e411","title":"bournemouth newcastle premier league match report","story":"By the end it was bordering on cruel. This was a futile Bournemouth performance, one that screamed relegation and they have now lost 16 of their past 21 games.Allan Saint-Maximin was influential as goals by Dwight Gayle, Sean Longstaff, Miguel Almirón and Valentino Lazaro chalked up Newcastle’s biggest win of the season. Victory should have been more emphatic, too, with Isaac Hayden missing a sitter after Lazaro smacked the crossbar.Eddie Howe, hands on hips, stood forlorn on the touchline as his team, battered and bruised by hungry Newcastle, were put out of their misery just after Dan Gosling bundled in a stoppage-time strike, which, tellingly, was Bournemouth’s only shot on target.Before the match the Bournemouth manager said it was too early to think about being mindful of goal difference in their fight for survival but when Lazaro capped off another slick attack to add Newcastle’s fourth, he must have feared it could take a beating.“We have to find answers quickly, we have a tough run of fixtures to come but I have no doubts we can turn this around,” said Howe, whose side visit Manchester United on Saturday before welcoming Tottenham and Leicester. Defeat leaves them ensconced in the battle to avoid the drop and time is running out with six games to play.As for Newcastle, in their orange strip, they were vibrant from start to finish. They toyed with the hosts, fizzing the ball around at speed, just like Bournemouth used to.The home side went into their shells from the moment Gayle opened the scoring when Newcastle preyed on Jefferson Lerma dallying on the edge of the area. Lerma’s heavy touch led to a collision with Longstaff and the superb Saint-Maximin seized possession before slipping in Gayle, who raced into a gaping defensive hole and finished clinically.From that moment on, as Howe acknowledged, Bournemouth never recovered. “When you’re in our position looking for a lift, it’s a hammer blow the other way,” he said.Bournemouth came undone in defeat at Wolves 10 days ago courtesy of Adama Traoré flicking on the afterburners and here it was Saint-Maximin’s quick feet that got the better of the full-back Adam Smith as Newcastle doubled their lead. It was not just Smith who was startled by Saint-Maximin’s trickery the winger also occupied Lerma and David Brooks before breezing beyond the trio and cutting the ball back from the byline for Longstaff to lash high into the roof of the net.Bournemouth badly lacked a creative spark. “We believed the team was in a good place,” Howe said. “It’s a bit of a head-scratcher for us at the moment.”It was the same story for Newcastle’s third approaching the hour mark, with Saint-Maximin again at the heart of things. He laid the ball centrally for Almirón, who kept a string of defenders at arm’s length before beautifully nestling the ball into the top corner with his right foot.Just before that, Saint-Maximin tore through the Bournemouth spine, picking up the ball on the edge of his penalty area before brushing off half-hearted challenges and travelling to the edge of the Bournemouth D without too much fuss. “That’s 80 yards,” yelled an incensed Aaron Ramsdale in the Bournemouth goal. If only the rest of his side showed the same urgency, with too many of them guilty of going through the motions.It was such a stroll that Steve Bruce had the luxury of being able to withdraw players with half an hour to play. Saint-Maximin, who was replaced by Lazaro, would surely have departed to a standing ovation had Newcastle supporters been there.“If we can get into the top 10 that would be a great achievement after a lot of people wrote me and the players off,” Bruce said. “But even at my age that just makes me roll my sleeves up and show them. It was a bit disrespectful at times. It makes you work harder and spurs you on. I’m delighted to manage this great club.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d92be3754095e4911cff4d11d15ff27fda19fd99/45_149_2628_1578/master/2628.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55dae3f985a27496378c74e50f46463a","title":"everton leicester premier league match report","story":"Champions League restrictions may be imposed on Leicester unless they find an antidote to 2020’s downturn. Brendan Rodgers can feel Manchester United and Wolves breathing down his neck after his side’s winless restart continued at Everton.Carlo Ancelotti’s team condemned the visitors to a costly defeat at Goodison Park that threatens their long residence among this season’s top four. Leicester have been in the Champions League places every week bar one since 24 August, but on current form they will not hold off United or Wolves for long. It is a decline that pre-dates lockdown and has deepened afterwards.A sluggish start offered Everton the cushion of a two-goal lead and, despite a stirring second half response, the loss means Rodgers’ team have taken a mere 13 points from 36 since the turn of the year. “We have to reset mentally to achieve what we wanted to achieve,” said the Leicester manager. “Our form has not been the best for a long period now, but it is still in our own hands to achieve what would be a dream for us. We have six games to go and we have to fight as much as we possibly can.”Rodgers had the notebook out and a face like thunder with only 16 minutes gone. A lack of tempo has been a recurring fault since the restart and incisive play by Everton combined to punish it once again. The hosts were sharper on the ball and more aggressive in their defensive work from the start. Richarlison made the breakthrough when Lucas Digne released Anthony Gordon with a deft header from Mason Holgate’s pass. The 19-year-old Gordon, making only his second Premier League start, cut the ball back perfectly from the byline for the Brazilian to beat Kasper Schmeichel with an emphatic close-range finish.Gordon had been handed his full debut against Liverpool and, while the intensity of a derby proved a difficult grounding, his touch and vision impressed greatly against Leicester. He released Dominic Calvert-Lewin for what would have been a second Premier League assist, only for Caglar Soyuncu to brush aside the striker legitimately inside the area.Everton had the cushion of a second goal by that stage and, no doubt to their surprise, it arrived via a VAR penalty award. Wilfred Ndidi challenged Michael Keane at Digne’s free-kick and connected with his hand, as the reaction of several Everton players attested. VAR required more than two minutes to decide whether the ball struck Keane’s head or hand before finding its way on to Ndidi. A tight call went against Leicester’s holding midfielder and Gylfi Sigurdsson rolled the resulting spot-kick – Everton’s first in 39 league games – confidently past Schmeichel. “It was so harsh,” said Rodgers. “It was certainly not clear and obvious.”Leicester’s recovery was slow in coming, and Everton defenders were quick to throw their bodies in front of danger when it eventually materialised. Keane blocked a Youri Tielemans volley from a corner, Jordan Pickford saved at Jonny Evans’ feet and Digne denied Marc Albrighton.In the second half Rodgers’ introduction of Kelechi Iheanacho and James Maddison injected much-needed urgency into their performance and altered the flow of the contest. Iheanacho reduced the arrears when Vardy flicked Tielemans’ cross into his path inside the area. The striker’s first touch was heavy but Holgate hooked an attempted clearance back into his face and the ball sailed beyond Pickford. Luck favoured Leicester on that occasion, but switched to Everton’s side when Pickford fumbled Albrighton’s low cross. The ball struck Keane and trickled goalwards but the central defender was just able to clear on the line.Ancelotti reverted to a five-man defence to stem the tide but it kept coming. Iheanacho fired over after Pickford failed to reach another cross by Albrighton, while Sigurdsson denied the substitute Ayoze Pérez with a vital challenge in stoppage time as Everton held out for a win that preserves their hopes of Europa League qualification. Leicester have grander designs, but are in danger of fading from view."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/498f5d30b84dc70a98653c7801fb383c4f56b2b2/0_34_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2791e0b95afa27be60320c592be63d20","title":"premier leagues promoted clubs debts","story":"The Premier League will charge newly promoted clubs £8m each next season and in 2021-22 to help soften the blow of broadcast revenues lost because of the Covid-19 crisis.The development has caused bewilderment among Championship clubs with hopes of going up. They question why they must pay a penalty that relates to a Premier League season in which they have played no part and some are viewing it as akin to paying an entrance fee for an exclusive members’ club.In their opinion, the top ision ought to be spreading its largesse down the leagues – as the government has demanded – and not, in effect, make a raid on upwardly mobile Football League clubs.The Premier League has been forced to agree to rebates of £330m to broadcasters because of the failure, through no fault of its own, to deliver its product as advertised. It will not pay the money now but in instalments over next season and the one after – years two and three of a three-year broadcast deal.Under the plan, which Championship clubs learned of last week, the three teams promoted would each pay £8m, with the three coming up in 2020-21 doing the same – adding up to £48m.Promotion is estimated to be worth £180m to a club and the likelihood would be that the £8m would be deducted from money paid out by the league. Clubs relegated can expect parachute payments of between £75m-90m over two or three years and they too would be expected to contribute towards the broadcasting rebate. It will most likely be taken from their parachute payments.The argument in favour of charging the promoted clubs, of making them bear a portion of the responsibility, relates to the knock-on effects of coronavirus how it will affect not only this season but the next one and even the one after.The next Premier League season will kick off later than planned and the league, in negotiations with broadcasters over the rebate, has essentially paid a price to control the flexibility of the start date. Therefore the promoted clubs are being told to contribute to that premium.A further counterpoint is that promoted clubs are entering a changed landscape, a competition operating with altered costs over the next two seasons. It is a reality and, as they will belong to that competition, it is felt that they should pay."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f95b5b3460aa036d94e01de18f1948c9026b22d/81_176_3697_2218/master/3697.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3d9a92c83b5994b951edd85d6249849","title":"west ham chelsea premier league match report","story":"The day that Hakim Ziyech and Timo Werner officially became Chelsea players ended with Frank Lampard seeing that his side will continue to fall short until they sort out their accident-prone defence. Reality bit hard when Andriy Yarmolenko cut inside to seal a crucial win for West Ham. Chelsea were a mess at the back throughout this chaotic London derby and while Lampard has sharpened his attack before next season, he would be wise to sign a top centre-back this summer.There is no doubt that Werner and Ziyech will make Chelsea more potent up front. Yet while both players will improve an attack that still flatters to deceive, it is debatable whether Lampard should continue his pursuit of Kai Havertz if signing the Bayer Leverkusen attacker means he will not have funds for defensive reinforcements.This was a calamitous display from Chelsea, who wasted an opportunity to move five points clear of Manchester United and replace Leicester in third, and another reminder that they lack the balance to rival Liverpool and Manchester City. With Kepa Arrizabalaga unwilling to ease the pressure by coming off his line to claim set-pieces, the defensive frailties were glaring. Antonio Rüdiger and Andreas Christensen were bullied by Michail Antonio and the final blow came when Marcos Alonso failed to track back to deal with a West Ham counterattack in the final minute, allowing Yarmolenko to win it.The way that Rüdiger was left exposed against Yarmolenko will strengthen Lampard’s determination to replace Alonso with the Leicester left-back, Ben Chilwell. Yet there were deficiencies across the back four and West Ham exploited them well, using Antonio’s physicality to good effect in the opening period before attacking clinically in the closing stages.It was a huge win for West Ham, who rose three points above 18th-placed Bournemouth after completing their first double over their neighbours since the 2002-03 season. Antonio was outstanding up front, scoring once and creating the winner. Jarrod Bowen caught the eye with two assists and the return of Angelo Ogbonna in central defence helped, giving West Ham more assurance at the back.*David Moyes was entitled to feel pleased with himself after seeing Yarmolenko come off the bench to score the decisive goal. It was a solid performance from West Ham, who will be confident about staying up after limiting Chelsea to few clear opportunities in open play.Chelsea did not create much despite dominating possession in the opening period. They weaved pretty patterns on the edge of the West Ham area and Christian Pulisic bent a shot just wide after a dummy from Tammy Abraham, but picking the lock was far from straightforward. Declan Rice was impressive for West Ham in midfield, using his positional sense to cut out through balls and his long legs to make important tackles, while there were reminders that Chelsea are always liable to gift their opponents a chance.West Ham’s equaliser on the stroke of half-time was a case in point, Rüdiger getting himself in a tangle and slicing the ball behind for a corner. The lack of composure under pressure was staggering and Chelsea paid the price when Bowen swung a corner to the far post, where Tomas Soucek rose above César Azpilicueta before heading in his first goal in English football.Soucek has given West Ham greater presence since arriving on loan in January and the Czech midfielder was unfortunate to have a goal ruled out from another Bowen corner when the game was goalless. Arrizabalaga, rooted to his line again, was relieved that a VAR review showed that Antonio was lying in an offside position.Chelsea opened the scoring shortly after that reprieve, Willian converting his second penalty in a week after Issa Diop’s foul on Pulisic. Yet vulnerabilities lingered. There was complacency at times, particularly when Arrizabalaga played his team into trouble with a risky pass. The goalkeeper was lucky that Antonio shot wide.Soucek’s equaliser gave West Ham hope and they went ahead in the 51st minute, Pablo Fornals flickering into life on the edge of the area and finding Bowen, who beat Alonso before fizzing in a low centre for Antonio to score from close range.The question before kick-off was whether West Ham would have enough bite without Sébastien Haller leading the line. Yet Chelsea never looked comfortable, even after Willian hauled them level with a wonderful free-kick that bounced in off the post.Lampard had made attacking changes, introducing Mason Mount for Mateo Kovacic, but Chelsea were too sloppy. Abraham and Ross Barkley both disappointed before being removed and Chelsea lost their shape in midfield as they chased a winner, allowing Antonio to jab a pass through to Yarmolenko. The winger cut on to his deadly left foot and an emphatic finish left Lampard with much to ponder.*"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9748d885706843f53b13bb63668e3c2b1af4d05f/873_115_2371_1423/master/2371.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=317a9007910f1599c89492d1bae64000","title":"west ham united v chelsea premier league live","story":"Andriy Yarmolenko’s late winner ensured some earlier VAR controversy didn’t really matter.Jacob Steinberg was our man at the London Stadium. His verdict has landed. Enjoy, enjoy ... and thanks for reading this MBM. Nighty night!Frank Lampard is categorically not happy. “It’s not the story of our season, because it’s been a good season, but there have been many of these moments. Three good results, an opportunity to go third. You can dominate possession but if there are moments when you switch off, if you make two or three errors, you’re going to encourage teams on. I’m aware of it. But the players have to show an extra mentality to see the game through. We can feel a game like this coming. It shows the work we have to do. We have to defend better. We’re upset because we want to win the game. There’s no point me being down, but I’m telling the truth and we should win here today.”David Moyes isn’t quite as chirpy, having a thing or two to say about the old video ref. “We were up against it at 2-2. But we stuck at it and got a result. The VAR stuff, I’m beginning to lose complete faith with it. I don’t want to whinge about decisions, I’m trying not to, but that’s what I am doing again. I’ve not seen it again, but everybody tells me the goal should have stood.” Sky then commend West Ham for not feeling sorry for themselves after the VAR decision. “Well I did! I was spewing. I was thinking: are we ever going to get a decision here? The things that have gone against West Ham recently have been really poor, and I can’t explain it. The players deserve a massive amount of credit for sticking to it.”Michail Antonio, Sky’s very happy man of the match, has been talking. “It’s massive. There’s been so many games when we’ve been so close, and today shows the grit and belief we’ve got. We’re going to keep fighting to the end. I really dislike VAR! Ha ha ha! So many things haven’t gone our way, it’s gone against us so many times, but today it didn’t stop us. We just kept going and got the victory. It gives us confidence and belief. Not the fact that we won, but that we went down, and had a goal taken away from us. Chelsea’s a quality team, and if we can do it against them, we can do it against anybody.” Then there’s a magnificent moment when the reasons for the VAR decision are explained to him - that he was in the line of the goalkeeper’s sight and his head was offside - and he pulls, with exquisite comic timing, a look of amused incredulity. A genuinely funny reaction.That was a magnificent game of football. West Ham thoroughly deserved their victory. They could easily have crumbled after the contentious decision by VAR to rule out an opening goal, the concession of a penalty coming along in short order. But they fought hard and - with no little skill, albeit some help from Chelsea’s unreliable defence - dragged themselves back into the game. Andriy Yarmolenko’s fine late winner could prove priceless. West Ham rise to 16th place (30pts), three points clear of the relegation zone, two clear of Watford in 17th. At the other end of the table, Chelsea remain in fourth (54pts), but they’re only two ahead of Manchester United and Wolves now. Arsenal and Tottenham won’t have chucked the towel in quite yet, either. The run-in is going to be fun.As for Chelsea, they pass up an opportunity to gain ground on third-placed Leicester City, giving the chasing Champions League pack hope. “This could be David Moyes’ best managerial result for Manchester United,” quips Peter Oh, because somebody had to get there first.It’s a huge three points for West Ham in their battle against relegation, and they celebrate accordingly!90 min +3: Kante drags a tame shot wide left from 25 yards. The jig looks up for Chelsea. They’ve played well enough, but West Ham have been better.90 min +2: Fornals is replaced by Balbuena. Textbook clock management.90 min +1: The first of them drifts by without incident.90 min: West Ham United are four added minutes away from a precious victory.This could be a huge goal at both ends of the table! Chelsea pile forward, but lose possession. West Ham spring on the counter. Antonio creams a pass down the right for Yarmolenko, who only has Rudiger in between him and the penalty box. Rudiger sells himself, allowing Yarmolenko to cut infield and batter a low shot past Kepa and into the bottom left! What a finish! What drama here!88 min: As things stand, West Ham will move above Watford into 16th place on goal difference. They’d be a point ahead of Bournemouth and Aston Villa. Chelsea will stay in fourth, behind Leicester on goal difference.87 min: Azpilicueta crosses deep from the right, forcing Yarmolenko to head behind for a corner. Alonso meets the set piece, but heads harmlessly wide. 86 min: Alonso crosses again. It’s just a bit too high for Azpilicueta at the far post, and Cresswell is able to shepherd the ball away from danger. West Ham are hanging on a bit here, so close yet so far away from a precious point.85 min: Alonso swings a low cross in from the left. Giroud attempts to sweep home from the edge of the six-yard box but gets it all wrong.84 min: Yarmolenko strides down the right with Chelsea light at the back and Antonio in space down the middle. But his cross is too close to Rudiger and the chance of setting his team-mate clear is spurned.82 min: Willian is booked for a cynical tug on Cresswell, who was in the business of breaking upfield.81 min: Wilshere forces the ball down the inside-right channel and into the Chelsea box. Antonio hares after it and goes over Kepa, the ball ballooning away from danger. Antonio wants a penalty, but he’s not getting one.80 min: Willian drives at the West Ham defence down the right. He slips Azpilicueta away. Azpilicueta crosses the ball misses Giroud’s head by an inch.79 min: Yarmolenko is immediately in the thick of it, combining well with Fredericks down the right. The latter loops a cross towards Cresswell, who is penalised for climbing all over someone in the hope of winning a header.77 min: West Ham can’t handle Pulisic, who looks dangerous every time he picks up a head of steam. He wins a corner with another run down the left. Fabianski half-clears it with a punch, then Pulisic attempts a spectacular bicycle kick from 20 yards. Nope! But full marks for ambition.75 min: No team has scored more than two goals in this fixture since 2013, when a certain Frank Lampard notched a couple in a 3-0 Chelsea win at Upton Park. Will someone put that not-particularly-significant run to bed tonight?73 min: That had been coming, drinks break notwithstanding. West Ham have been all over the show since Chelsea made that double sub. Pulisic dances in from the left and whistles a low shot inches wide of the left-hand post. Fabianski wasn’t getting to that.Willian whips the free kick towards the top right. The ball caroms off the post and in, leaving Fabianski, at full stretch, no chance! That’s a brilliant free kick, though the keeper’s starting position wasn’t great.71 min: That break came at a good time for West Ham, who were being put under serious pressure. But it’s not long before they’re backpedalling furiously again, as Pulisic dribbles with purpose, cutting in from the left. Rice, haring in from the other flank, unceremoniously hacks him down before he reaches the box. A booking for West Ham’s stand-in captain, and a free kick in a very dangerous position, just to the left of the D.68 min: Lanzini is quickly hooked by West Ham. Another referee might have showed him red for an out-of-control scissor lunge, but he probably got back down to earth in time. Wilshere comes on in his stead.66 min: Lanzini is booked for a carless lunge on Azpilicueta. From the resulting free kick, taken by Mount out on the right. Giroud tries to guide a header into the top left, but it’s easy pickings for Fabianski.65 min: West Ham are suddenly under siege, Giroud nearly getting his eyebrows on a Pulisic dink, Alonso nearly teeing up Loftus-Cheek with a looping cross. A couple of last-ditch clearances preserve West Ham’s lead.64 min: Willian reaches a ball he had no real right in reaching, sprinting manically down the right. He whips an outstanding first-time cross towards Loftus-Cheek, racing in at the near post. Meaningful contact is missed by a couple of millimetres. West Ham escape.63 min: A double change for Chelsea, as Barkley and Abraham are replaced by Loftus-Cheek and Giroud.62 min: Barkley slips a pass down the inside-left channel for Mount, who smoothly wriggles past a couple of challenges before ... passing to nobody in particular in the West Ham box. The hosts clear.60 min: Barkley tees up Christensen, in a pocket of space, centrally, 25 yards out. The defender doesn’t have the confidence to shoot, and the chance is gone. The attack soon peters out.58 min: Rice crunches into Pulisic, a lovely tackle that sets West Ham away on the counter. Fornals and Bowen combine at speed, then the ball’s sent to Lanzini, in a lot of space just to the left of the D. He shapes a shot towards the top right, but it’s always heading high and wide. A tame end to a fine move.56 min: Christensen tries to release Abraham down the right but the flag goes up for offside. West Ham hearts were in mouths for a second, because the striker would have beaten Fabianski to the ball on the edge of their box.55 min: Willian cranks up a gear and bustles down the right. He thinks he’s earned a corner but it’s only a throw, and soon Chelsea are heading back the other way. Nothing quite coming off for them since the break.53 min: That’s no more than West Ham deserve. They’ve been excellent so far this evening. On this evidence, you have to wonder why they’re in relegation bother. Anyway, now it’s Frank Lampard’s turn to shake his head performatively. He hooks Kovacic and sends on Mount.Rice curls in from the left. Antonio, his back to goal, thinks he’s been pulled down by Rudiger, but he’s not getting the penalty. No worries! Fornals picks up the loose ball and slides in Bowen on the right. Bowen fires low and hard into the centre, and Antonio, having picked himself up and dusted himself down, slams home from close range!50 min: Cresswell nearly sends Antonio clear down the left with a cute lay-off, but the super-quick striker clanks the ball out of play with his first touch. He tilts his head back in annoyance, knowing a chance to put some more pressure on the Chelsea defence is gone. Meanwhile here’s Preach On II, courtesy of the righteous Digvijay Yadav: “One thing that grates is the constant insinuation in some quarters that anyone who’s not in thrall to data, or decidedly cold towards VAR, is a Neanderthal. I mean VAR sucks, frankly, and should be chucked.”48 min: Lanzini is caught dozing on the ball and Chelsea are allowed to tear clear. Willian zips down the right and curls long and low for Abraham, who can’t quite connect at the far post under pressure from Diop. “How can Chelsea be so inept at dealing with set pieces? Even the most benign of free kicks makes my heart skip a beat. This can’t go on. I’m not trying to be all doom and gloom, but for the love of God.” Benjamin Park, there, raging beside Benjamin Park.46 min: Within ten seconds of the restart, Antonio is making a nuisance of himself just inside the Chelsea box. He forces a throw, after which a brief game of head tennis breaks out in the area. Chelsea eventually clear their lines.It’s the second half! West Ham get the ball rolling again. No half-time changes. “Villa fan here. I’d take that goal being given and the inevitable relegation to dispense with VAR.” Preach on, David Bertram.That’ll improve the mood in the West Ham changing room. David Moyes fair bounds down the tunnel. An equaliser was no more than West Ham deserved. Were it not for an overly fussy VAR decision, they’d be leading. It’s going to be a fun second half.Antonio wins a corner down the right. Bowen hits it long. Kepa runs into Kante in the slapstick style. Soucek rises highest at the far post and heads down. Rudiger tries to hack off the line, but misses altogether. The hosts are deservedly level!45 min +1: Antonio and Rice are given a good talking-to by the referee. Neither are happy with the VAR decision, and they’re making their point with great passion.45 min: It’s all Chelsea, and a reeling West Ham could do with hearing the half-time whistle. They need some time to regroup. Three extra minutes to go.44 min: That chain of events has really taken the wind out of the West Ham sail. The disallowed goal ... well, you can argue that one either way, though a three-and-a-half-minute check suggests there was no clear and obvious error. But the penalty award was as clear as day.Willian sends Fabianski to the right, then whips the spot kick to the left. Easy as that. On the touchline, David Moyes shakes his head in theatrical anger. 40 min: Insult To Injury dept. Pulisic comes in from the left, and drops a shoulder to go past Diop. The defender hangs out a leg, and that’s a no-brainer of a decision. The referee points to the spot.38 min: After a wait of three-and-a-half minutes, VAR squints and spots that the top of Antonio’s head was offside when Soucek forced home, and judges that he was interfering with play. It certainly wasn’t a clear-cut state of affairs - Kepa’s line of sight didn’t appear to be compromised - and David Moyes is fuming.36 min: VAR is checking this for an offside. It’d be against the prone Antonio, if it’s disallowed.Bowen’s corner is accidentally flicked on at the near post by Kovacic. The ball falls at the feet of Soucek, one of the players Azpilicueta was just rowing with, at the far post. He needs two attempts to force the ball past Antonio, who had tried an unsuccessful acrobatic overhead kick and was lying on the floor, and a grappling Azpilicueta. It’s untidy, but it’s in!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a9c44de1e637c82db9a950f0a0ae57ac9939e6f/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=413057466c4c410ac6e6cbfece64791b","title":"my day starts at 3am coronavirus fuels gruelling harare commutes in pictures","story":"Lockdown measures have meant getting to work is fraught with risk for those manning essential services in Zimbabwe’s capital. Three frontline staff reveal how they are coping with erratic buses, exhaustion and dangerIt’s a dark, nippy June morning before dawn and a queue is forming at Glen View 8 bus stop. A dozen or so people, mostly men, are there as 41-year-old Mairevei Mupombwi and her friend arrive at 4.43am carrying fleece blankets. The two women spread cloths on the ground to sit on and cover themselves with their blankets to keep warm. Mupombwi starts dozing.At 5.30am, the queue is now long and a man starts moving around with a permanent marker, writing numbers on people’s hands. Although it is still dark, Mupombwi is number 31 and by 5.44am, the last person in the queue is number 65. Muffled voices can be heard as people try to make conversation through their masks.Moments later, Mupombwi stands up, telling her friend she can feel ants getting into her clothes. She folds her cloth and puts it in her bag but keeps the blanket over her shoulders.As the first rays of the sun appear, there is no sign of the bus. Several buses pass but they’re all going in the direction opposite to central Harare, where she and the rest of the people in the queue want to go. As the sun warms up, she puts her blanket away. The conversation at the bus stop is now getting louder. You can clearly see men and women, young and old, wearing face coverings, others have them but have chosen not to wear them.At 7.10am, the first bus comes and parks a distance away. There is chaos, and the once orderly queue disintegrates as dozens of people run towards it. No one is allowed to board and no one knows exactly what is going on. The people start coming back to the queue saying that no one can get into town as all roads have been sealed off by the police and security forces. They start urging others to go back home.A few minutes later, another bus arrives, and Mupombwi and her friend manage to get on. There is a man at the door, squeezing sanitiser on to passengers’ hands as they board. Once on the bus, passengers observe social distancing.It is now 8.18am and the bus stops at Market Square. Mupombwi gets off and makes her way towards Avondale, where she works in a supermarket. She hails a private car at 8.43am and by 8.48am she arrives at work.Mupombwi says: “My typical day starts at 3.30am where I have to warm my water to bathe and by 4am I am leaving the house. I wait for my friend and we walk together to the bus stop and it takes us about 30 minutes. The bus sometimes comes at 6.45am, and if it is late, it comes after 7am. It’s the same coming home from work. We have to wait in long queues. I get very tired, and during my off-days, I just want to sleep.”Mupombwi’s story is not unique, and many frontline workers in key industries have been affected by the country’s lockdown. They are spending more time travelling to and from work, and being deprived of sleep and quality time with loved ones.Zimbabwe imposed a lockdown on 30 March to curb the spread of Covid-19. Under the current restrictions, only the government-owned and run transport operator Zimbabwe United Passengers Company (Zupco) is permitted to run. Private operators have been banned and directed to register under Zupco if they hope to continue operating.Many workers have been forced to start their day earlier than usual, walking in the dark, sometimes hitchhiking – a dangerous pursuit in Zimbabwe. While travelling, these workers are at risk of contracting the virus as commuter queues rarely observe social distancing.Sandra Chikore, 33, works at a tobacco auction floor and faces the same transport problems as Mupombwi. The tobacco industry is key to the country’s economy, and this is a busy time of year. She rises at 4.35am and by 5.45am she leaves the house, walking close to 2km to get to work on time.“I leave the house while it is still dark and walk along the main road, flagging private cars. My mother’s asked me if I am not afraid for my life. I am, but have no choice. When coming back from work, I have to wait for the bus and sometimes I get home around 8pm, and I am just tired and want to take a bath, eat and sleep. I do not have much time to spend with my son any more.”On the main road at 6.29am, an open truck stops and Chikore hops in with one other passenger, who sits in front. There are three other people in the back, all male. Along the way, the truck stops and two more men jump in. Eighteen minutes later, she arrives in town and walks to Market Square, where she boards a bus. Almost an hour later, at 7.25am, Chikore reaches her workplace.Archiford Zisengwe, 38, works at a petrol station, an essential service. He has been going to work since lockdown began. Zisengwe lives in Harare’s south-west suburb of Waterfalls and works in Groombridge, north of the capital.“There is no transport to take me directly to town so I leave the house at 4am every day and I go to Mbare. From there, I find transport into town and then from there, Groombridge. Some of the places we pass through are very dangerous.”The government recently relaxed social distancing rules and all buses now carry to capacity. However, the move has not alleviated the transport problem and for workers such as Mairevei, Chikore and Zisengwe, they continue to wake up early and spend much of their time waiting in queues.Besides sleep deprivation and losing time with loved ones, many key workers are at risk of infection on public transport due to difficulties with social distancing. They also face the threat of physical attack in a country where violence and crime are rife."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6743d105f5fcac5c7af7c8a3bd517dd32fa4752/0_0_2952_1772/master/2952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d4811ea062334054c76547678da45eb","title":"i found myself in charge of the kids did lockdown make me a better dad","story":"Spoiler alert: the answer is yes. But home schooling a five-year-old was a steep learning curveI don’t exactly remember the first time that I saw the words “home schooling” in the context of a thing society might actually expect me to do. But I have a feeling it was a mention from someone on Twitter, and that I smiled fondly at how earnestly they were taking the rapidly deteriorating “situation”, as the coronavirus pandemic shut Britain down for more than three months.This is not to say that I’m a lazy parent. I love spending time with my two-year-old and my five-year-old. But it’s probably true to say that my main role was to drive them to stuff and go with them to the park. I took a very dim idea of such newfangled ideas as “screens”. So the thought of being left solely in charge for an extended spell was nerve-wracking, but fanciful. Honestly, the five-year-old’s imminent first six-week school holiday was a worry. But it’s not like anybody would expect me to be solely in charge of him for all that time (or more).As it turns out, for much of the past few months, trying to relate to those worries felt akin to connecting to the worldview of early Neolithic civilisations. A lot happened. First I had to work from home with my wife. Then the schools and nurseries shut. Then everything else shut. Then I got furloughed, while my wife didn’t. It rapidly became apparent that our briefly untenable domestic arrangement had suddenly become very tenable: I would be in charge of the kids, all the time.Parenting felt both overwhelming and simple. On one level it was obvious what I would have to do. I would take them to the park as much as possible, while trying to educate the older one and stop the younger one from destroying stuff. And I would absolutely get over my fear of screens – data would be my friend.Fortunately, I had three major early breakthroughs. One, my wife pointed out that every week the school bunged a load of classwork on its website that I could print out to form a rudimentary “lesson plan”. Two, I successfully unearthed, recharged and remembered the password for the iPad we bought aeons ago and immediately ignored entirely. And three, I made the discovery that our TV – which we’ve owned for three years – has a YouTube Kids app installed.Things started to fall into place. A loose but functional day of teaching was cobbled together from the plans provided by the school, interspersed with a selection of webcasts (Joe Wicks, Maddie and Greg’s Let’s Go Live) and some learning sites disguised as fun games (Teach Your Monster to Read, Carol Vorderman’s The Maths Factor). There was also the heavily rationed daily bribe of a Jurassic World game downloaded to the iPad, which the five-year-old was nuts for and the two-year-old was hypnotised by. It was definitely a tiny bit ramshackle, not least because the five-year-old is a small boy and the two-year-old is a shambling monster of pure id, and their priorities don’t always overlap.More importantly, it was actually fun. Although I covered all the bases, I tried to make the learning lean on what the eldest enjoyed more, ie maths – thanks to the Vorderman website, his powers of adding and subtracting have come on way beyond what’s expected of a child in reception. If his attention was waning on phonics or handwriting, I could always look up some sort of dinosaur-themed variant on my phone.Above all, as we emerge from lockdown (fingers crossed) I feel like a much better parenttutor than I thought I was. I don’t think for a second I’m in the same league as the teachers at the eldest’s school, blessedly now reopened, but the fact is we survived. Some learning happened, and everybody basically had a good time. Lockdown could have been quite traumatic for the kids, but I think they actually had fun, and I suppose I did too.And it’s not like things have simply reverted. When we go out – especially to meet my child-free friends – I’m not worried about breaking out the iPad or passing over my phone to keep the big child happy after a while. Do his maths or watch a video or download a new game on the Playtime Island app? Yes, absolutely, high five to unlimited data.The new normal is still tough for kids, with playgrounds remaining shut in England, and confusing distancing rules to abide by. A quick shot of parentally supervised data can make them feel safe and familiar in still-strange circumstances. And while “How was school?” is a question that continues to get a very abstract response from the five-year-old at 3pm, when we get home we both look forward to playing his Jurassic World game. Sitting side-by-side, united by the screen, the details of his day trickle out. Because school must be a bit strange right now, with all the handwashing and attempts to social-distance small people who frequently forget. While we play his favourite game, we talk about what matters. We’re connected.Looking at child-free friends’ anxiety-laden tweets, I wonder if I really would have had a marvellous time twiddling my thumbs through an unoccupied furlough – perhaps me and the kids actually got each other through it. Would I do it again? Well it looks like I’ll be able to deploy the grandparents come the summer holidays, and that more stuff will be open than closed. But whatever the case: I’ve got it covered. I know I can look after my children, and that knowledge is a wonderful thing.From keeping the kids entertained while you’re out meeting the friends you haven’t seen in months to staying connected to social media on the go, getting the most from your mobile data has never been more important.Keep connecting with our unlimited data plans.

But we urge the public to be careful and use common sense. The NHS has coped admirably during this period, but staff are exhausted, and the system is very fragile,” said Dr Katherine Henderson, the college’s president.“After seeing all the goodwill, all of the clapping for the NHS, it would be heartbreaking to see A\u0026ampEs overwhelmed on the first post-lockdown evening by people who have gotten too drunk or been in a fight.“If you go to A\u0026ampE because you’re plastered, you end up stretching the health service further and potentially put others at risk. Not only do you risk accidentally infecting someone with coronavirus because you don’t know you have it, but you are taking up the time of doctors who could be treating patients whose lives are in danger,” said Henderson, an A\u0026ampE consultant in London.“It has never been more important that our emergency departments are for absolute emergencies, and it has never been more important that people drink responsibly. While social distancing measures may have been relaxed, the threat of coronavirus has not gone away it is still very real, it is still very dangerous,” she added.A\u0026ampE units have been much quieter than usual during the pandemic as many patients have either not sought help at all or gone to a GP, pharmacist or NHS walk-in centre instead. On Tuesday the Health Service Journal revealed that NHS England had sent a memo to hospitals in several parts of the country telling them to have enough staff on duty this weekend as part of efforts to “ensure that your demandactivity planning reflects a busy weekend, with peaks in activity into the evenings similar to that of New Year’s Eve”.Colenzo Jarrett-Thorpe, the trade union Unite’s national officer for health, said “gung-ho messaging from Boris Johnson” about the lifting of lockdown restrictions risked causing problems.“It is with deep concern that our members in the ambulance service and in A\u0026ampE departments are preparing themselves for the fallout from a badly-behaved minority when pubs reopen on Saturday.”In recent weeks ambulance crews have seen an increase in 999 calls related to accidents at illegal parties, more young people saying that they have Covid-19 and a rise in the use of nitrous oxide, which is better known as “laughing gas”.Pubs reopen in Northern Ireland this Friday, in Wales on 13 July and in Scotland at a future date that has not yet been confirmed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38eea919b7037d6508da057bf2e0b9890cf39c54/211_271_961_576/master/961.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfebc76dccc56e0119675b93b79e49fd","title":"manga saint hilare grimes overlooked mc","story":"He felt lost and outclassed in the chart-topping Roll Deep crew alongside Wiley. But now the Londoner is making grime’s most honest, soul-searching tracksManga Saint Hilare should be out touring his new album Make It Out Alive but, like the rest of us, he’s at home using his time to learn new things. “I’ve been learning how to make beats, improving my Photoshop skills and designing Instagram filters for promotion,” he says. “Things that can help my ting, really.”He even jokes about jumping on TikTok and starting a career there – funny because at 34, the London rapper is now a lot older than the platform’s fresh-faced dancers and meme-slingers. While drill and Afro-swing are the current dominant sounds of UK rap, Manga belongs to a previous generation: the grime MCs who built their credibility earning reloads in raves, the likes of Dizzee Rascal and Kano who paved the way for Stormzy.He joined Roll Deep in 2004, the grime crew who crossed into pop for two UK No 1 singles in 2010, but he always considered himself an outsider and kept a low profile compared with other members such as Wiley. “One time I released a solo single and made £3.58 on iTunes, and this was proper digital downloads,” he says, self-deprecatingly. But being outside of the spotlight can pay more than financial idends. Despite – indeed, perhaps because of – grime not being in fashion as it once was, Manga has made Make It Out Alive one of the most brilliant UK rap releases this year. He sketches out a hopeful future, but references the doubts and difficulties he’s had along the way – this graceful and contemplative outlook is the album’s highlight.He says his 2019 album with rapper Murkage Dave, We Need to Look After Us, was about slowing down and looking inward, and Make It Out Alive continues this self examination – themes of wellbeing and self-care thread them together. “It’s about remaining grounded in everything you do and not allowing this world to kill you. Everyone’s issues vary depending on circumstances, but it’s about always keeping in motion.” Hence the moped on the cover.While many other MCs are world-makers with their lyrics and themes, there’s a feeling that, when you listen to Manga spit, he’s in conversation with his listeners, inviting them into his world to share his experience. “It’s my clearest project in terms of the message I’m trying to convey, and I’m happy that people are collectively understanding,” he says. Even on the more explosive tracks such as Trample, the sharpness in his tone makes it feel like he’s speaking directly to you: “First things first, let me say from now we are not similar  I am not like dem,” he raps. And so it proves: whether fretting about the grim financial realities of an independent artist on Less Money More Problems or struggling with bouts of depression on Escape Plan, he touches on topics other MCs sometimes shy away from. His writing is purposeful, precise and often funny, and each word has its place as he challenges the idea of a single narrative within grime.As he says on Black Man Timing, “not giving a fuck is my skincare routine”, but this clarity of purpose came out of a long stretch in the wilderness. “I felt lost for a long time – there wasn’t any direction in my life,” he says. As one of the younger members of Roll Deep alongside some big personalities, he arguably joined ahead of his time – too early, in fact. “There are people like Wiley who just get it and have that energy. But I was lost in every area of life and I didn’t know what I was doing. I wasn’t earning anything really, I wasn’t making any impact, but at the same time I wasn’t doing enough. I wasn’t very good, and sometimes I wondered whether I should’ve got a job. It was a struggle back then. As I got older, I learned more about myself.”Each project since has encapsulated each stage in his life, gradually adding more detail to an overall portrait of a man. “I have the room to talk about my fears and insecurities about finding my place in the world,” he says. “There’s no extra songs recorded when I make a body of work – the first line you heard is the first thing I wrote, and it’s the same with the last. Everything in that project is me. That’s why I feel it’s sick when people tell me they like certain songs, it’s like there’s an understanding on a deeper level.”Manga’s name as a solo artist has only blown up in the last five years or so, following those years he spent figuring out what kind of MC he wanted to be. His golden age could unexpectedly come in his mid-30s. “I just wanted to tell my story and now people have gravitated towards me, from me being myself,” he says. “I’ve got nothing to pretend about any more. I’ve learned more about myself and the more I speak about the realities, the more people see me as Manga and not just a grime MC. I don’t have to play a character.” Grime’s wallflower will continue to blossom."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb10c0f998e7d48942fa1603ebcf0dc07ce008c1/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8aee839c9bf2ee7b47d77ef07359d5a2","title":"lockdown easing why the uk is better prepared for a second wave","story":"This Saturday, lockdown measures in England will ease further, with people able to get a pint in a pub, have a haircut and see another household indoors. ’s heath editor, Sarah Boseley, looks at whether another lifting of restrictions might result in a second wave, and if it does, why we are better prepared this time round From this Saturday, the government has said that in England, pubs, restaurants and hairdressers will be able to reopen, two households will be able to meet in any setting with physical distancing measures, and people can enjoy staycations with the reopening of accommodation sites.

Yes, by Philip Tetlock and Dan Gardner. The full title is Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction.What’s it about? It’s about how most experts are rubbish at making predictions, but some people are very good at it, and how you can learn to be more like the latter.So, how can I? Read the book and find out.Just tell me. No. You must read it.Who says? Dominic Cummings. And read it carefully as there will be questions.Questions? When? At an away day next month. Supplementary reading includes High Output Management by Andrew Grove, a business classic from the author of Only the Paranoid Survive.How did I miss this assignment? You must have skipped the weekly meeting Cummings held with government advisers.I did, but only because I’m not a government adviser. This is not the first time he has recommended the book. “Read Philip Tetlock’s Superforecasters, instead of political pundits who don’t know what they’re talking about,” he told reporters in February.In response to what? To questions about the appointment of Andrew Sabisky, a government adviser and self-proclaimed superforecaster who, it transpired, had previously espoused eugenicist views.How did such a controversial thinker get into Downing Street in the first place? He answered a call from Cummings for “misfits and weirdos” to apply for jobs at Number 10.Could someone with finely honed prognostic skills not have predicted all this? I knew you were going to say that.Returning to February, can you remind me how Cummings was superforecasting the Covid-19 response back then? According to a Sunday Times investigation, he revealed the government’s strategy at a private engagement, which those present paraphrased as “herd immunity, protect the economy and if that means some pensioners die, too bad”.That panned out well. Cummings denies this. At any rate, by March he was embracing a more proactive response to the coronavirus.As I recall, he went so far as to get Covid-19 symptoms. True. Then he superforecast that it would be a good idea to drive to Barnard Castle during lockdown in order to test his eyesight.And I predicted he would get the sack for that. Shows what I know.

I can only control what’s within my gift.That’s all from me today.But our coverage continues on the global coronavirus live blog.Bradford Council has said it is “working hard” to prevent another lockdown as figures revealed it has one of the highest rates of Covid-19 infection in England.As PA Media reports, latest data shows the West Yorkshire city has 69.4 cases per 100,000 population, the second highest in England behind Leicester with 140.2.We know that figures from Public Health England show Bradford with a high number of infections along with a number of other northern authorities, although we are some way behind Leicester. The number of people testing positive for the virus is still too high and we continue to work hard with all our partners to prevent infection spreading as no-one wants a second lockdown.As we take more and more steps towards returning to a more normal life, it’s easy to believe that Covid-19 is less of a threat to our health and the health of our family and friends.This is simply not the case. We urge all residents to continue to follow the guidelines around staying at home as much as possible, social distancing, washing hands frequently and ensuring that they self-isolate and get tested if they, or anyone in their household, develop any symptoms.Communities could face local coronavirus lockdowns lasting months unless the Government delivers an effective contact-tracing system, Sir Keir Starmer has warned. Speaking to the Local Government Association annual conference - taking place online - the Labour leader said there was a “massive problem” with the NHS Test and Trace programme. As PA Media reports, he said figures from the ONS suggested that three-quarters of the people infected by the virus were not being contacted by the system. He said:If we don’t get to grips with it we could be in local lockdown situations for months and months and months. It is going to be the story of the summer if we are not careful.Starmer also called for local councils to be given additional powers to ensure they were able to enforce local lockdown regulations.If you need to close down a particular area at the moment, I don’t think local authorities have got the necessary powers to do it.What we can’t have is a situation where statutory instruments or other bits of legislation have to be passed in a hurry in response to each outbreak. There is a huge amount of work to do there.Starmer also said that with councils facing an estimated £10bn “black hole” in their finances as a result of the pandemic, local services would be slashed without additional support from central government. He said:After a decade of cuts the coronavirus crisis and the Government’s inaction have created a perfect storm.Councils are faced with much higher costs for key services such as social care and much lower revenues through falls in areas such as business rates.It could mean further cuts to social care, fewer police officers. It could mean street lights going on later and going off earlier. It could mean libraries, gyms and community centres staying closed.The Medical Research Council (MRC) Biostatistics Unit at Cambridge University, which is one of several groups producing R number (reproduction number) estimates for the government, has published its latest “nowcast and forecast”. It says that R is probably below 1 in every region of England, that new infections are running at about 3,000 per day and that the number of deaths each day is likely to fall to between 35 and 70 by mid July.The latest edition of the ’s Politics Weekly podcast is out. Jonathan Freedland and Sonia Sodha break down a chock-a-block week for the government and opposition. Patrick Wintour explains the latest spat in the Commonwealth and local councillors David Williams and James Lewis discuss local council finance pressures post-Covid.Oldham, a former mill town in Greater Manchester, has been mooted as “the next Leicester” by various public health experts today.But Sean Fielding, Oldham’s council leader, insists the district is “nowhere near” Leicester in terms of the number of positive Covid-cases. He said the council finally had a complete picture of where positive cases have been reported in Oldham and “it shows we are some considerable distance behind Leicester (with others above us).”We can’t relax because it’s right that we are high, relatively speaking, but Leicester seems to be something of an outlier.The Greater Manchester combined authority released its infection figures today, showing what while there had been 135 cases in Leicester per 100,000 people over the last seven days, with numbers increasing, in Greater Manchester there were 13.3 and falling. Of the ten local authorities in Greater Manchester, Rochdale has the highest rate, with 28.8 cases per 100,000 people, compared with 27.8 in Oldham.The government has not yet got an answer as to whether it met its target of returning the vast majority of coronavirus tests within 24 hours, as Boris Johnson promised would happen by the end of June. (See 10.13am.) In fact, we learned on the regular No 10 lobby media conference call, we won’t know for another week.The first statistics on the number of tests completed within 24 hours will come out on Thursday as part of the weekly test and trace statistics, and will then be updated every week. However, this first batch will cover the period of 18-24 June. We will thus have to wait another seven days for the 30 June figure.Asked whether even he knew if the target had been met, Johnson’s spokesman said: “I don’t, no.”A sceptic might say that No 10 will at least have some idea, and if it looked like the 24-hour target had been reached, news would get out sooner. But time will tell.He says that is why mass testing is so important.He says “saturation testing” in hospitals should be an absolute requirement.Back in the science committee Kate Bingham, chair of the government’s vaccine taskforce, tells MPs that Oxford University’s coronavirus vaccine is ahead of any other in the world.At the Downing Street lobby briefing the prime minister’s spokesman defended the way coronavirus testing information had been shared with local authorities. He said:Since April detailed local data has been shared by Public Health England with local areas. And since June 11 an operational data dashboard was made available by NHS Digital which includes counts of local tests, total positives and test and trace data - it’s to give local authorities a clear picture of the stats in their local area, it was provided to support directors of public health and councils.Last week we started securely sharing postcode-level testing data with all local authorities including Leicester and that data is available to them at any time.The UK has enough stocks of the drug remdesivir, the Department of Health has confirmed, after the US bought nearly all the manufacturing stock for the next three months. As PA Media reports, the Department of Health said it had secured supplies of remdesivir in advance and had enough to treat every NHS patient who needs it. It comes after the US Department of Health and Human Services (HSS) said it had secured more than 500,000 treatment courses of remdesivir for American hospitals.But there have been no further deaths in Northern Ireland, according to today’s bulletin from its Department of Health.There has been one further coronavirus death in Scotland, the Scottish government has said.The UK’s official coronavirus death toll has gone up by 176 since yesterday, with a total of 43,906 people who have lost their lives in the pandemic in Britain.The Department of Health and Social Care has also released the latest testing figures in its daily tweet:Public Health Wales says a further six people have died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to 1,516."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62660bd411ba8ceff363e37df89d18681f9fc7f8/0_0_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d2d89c57043321522520be38e6d925a","title":"end of the world as we know it fans of apocalyptic films","story":"Researchers say apocalyptic movies prepare people for Covid-19 and make them more resilientFor those of you who whiled away hours on the sofa watching society crumble in the face of marauding zombies, deadly aliens and infectious diseases – it’s time to reap the rewards.Psychologists have found evidence that fans of apocalyptic movies – where global order is upturned – may be more resilient and better prepared to deal with the coronavirus pandemic than the rest of us.The bleak scenarios thrown up by films such as Contagion, from panic buying and isolation to fear of others and fake claims of miracle cures, appeared to help viewers take the outbreak in their stride and work out how best to handle the crisis.“If it’s a good movie, it pulls you in and you take the perspective of the characters, so you are unintentionally rehearsing the scenarios,” said Coltan Scrivner, a psychologist who specialises in morbid curiosity at the University of Chicago. “We think people are learning vicariously. It’s like, with the exception of the toilet paper shortage, they pretty much knew what to buy.”The researchers questioned 310 volunteers on their movie preferences and viewing histories before asking them how prepared they felt going into the pandemic and what levels of anxiety, depression, irritability and sleepless they had experienced.Horror movie fans appeared less distressed by the crisis than most, but those who favoured “prepper movies” – where society collapses – ranked as more resilient and better prepared, both mentally and practically.The finding held when the psychologists controlled for age, sex, how fond people were of movies in general, and personality traits such as neuroticism and conscientiousness.Scrivner suspects many factors are at play. Movies like Contagion, which rocketed in popularity as coronavirus spread, make aspects of the pandemic such as quarantine and supply shortages seem less strange, he believes.“You’ve seen it a hundred times in the movies, so it doesn’t catch you off-guard so much,” he said. The movies are an opportunity too, he added, for people to practice pulling themselves together when bad times come along.In one scene in Contagion, Beth Emhoff, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, is sitting in an airport bar when the camera follows her credit card as she hands it over to be swiped.In another, scientist Ian Sussman, played by Elliott Gould, is horrified as he watches a woman in a restaurant cough and take a sip from her glass. But they are not the only scenes that reflect real life in the coronavirus pandemic, Scrivner said.One character in the film touts a miracle cure called forsythia, which goes viral, so to speak, and causes chaos. “It’s similar to what’s happening with the antimalarial drug,” he said. “There are always going to be people who tout miracle cures in the face of something like that and one thing you take away is perhaps you should be sceptical.”Another prepper movie, It Comes at Night, centres on the paranoia of a cast holed up in a house in the woods after a highly infectious disease brings the world to its knees. “One thing someone might pull from this is that paranoia about a threat can sometimes cause more grief than the thing causing the paranoia,” Scrivner said.One reason people are drawn to apocalyptic movies, he believes, is that they give viewers a safe way to experience the chaos of social breakdown. “For the cost of a bad dream one night, you can learn what the world looks like when a pandemic hits,” he said, likening the benefit to playing tag. “It’s not like you’re thinking, this is what I’ll do when someone chases me, but you’re building the knowledge you can draw on later, even if it’s outside your conscious awareness.”Mathias Clasen, a psychologist at Aarhus University and a co-author on the study, which is under review at the Social Psychology and Personality Science journal, said movies can help people prepare for scary situations in the same way that our imagination allows us to rehearse for dates and confrontations.“Our ability to imaginatively inhabit virtual worlds – worlds of our own making, as well as those conveyed by movies and books – is a gift from natural selection a bit of biological machinery that evolved because it gave our ancestors an edge in the struggle for survival,” Clasen said.“If you’ve watched a lot of what we call prepper movies, you will have vicariously lived through massive social upheavals, states of martial law, people responding in both prosocial and dangerously selfish ways to a sudden catastrophic event,” he said. “Compared to somebody who has never simulated the end of the world, you’ll be in a better place because you have that vicarious experience.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce1c8e21d95fe9bef9eed866bbbcce4d3951071f/97_0_1480_889/master/1480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03ea3f318dcde7ebbbed903e6ca0319e","title":"ten years of the sun in one hour nasa releases mesmerising space film","story":"The space agency gathered 425 million high-resolution images of the sun, which have now been stitched together to form the videoNasa has released a mesmerising timelapse video of the sun that condenses an entire solar cycle into an hour of footage, using images of the star taken every hour continuously over a decade.Nasa’s Solar Dynamics Observatory has gathered 425 million high-resolution images of the sun, from its launch in February 2010 until June this year, which have now been stitched together to form the video.While the 20 million gigabytes of picture data captured over the decade have contributed to “countless new discoveries about the workings” of the sun, according to Nasa, the images have now been arranged into a 61-minute video showing events including transiting planets and eruptions.The film shows the major changes the sun undergoes during a solar cycle, an approximately 11-year period which sees the sun’s north and south poles flip, and the emergence of sunspots as a result of gas altering the star’s magnetic fields.Every second of the 61-minute video represents images taken over a single day, with the first frame showing the sun on 2 June 2010, and the last frame captured on 1 June 2020.With what Nasa describes as a “triad of instruments”, the SDO took a picture of the sun every 0.75 seconds on average, including the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly instrument that captured images “every 12 seconds at 10 different wavelengths of light”.However, not every image the SDO has taken has been used in the timelapse video. Only images taken at one wavelength, 17.1 nanometres, were used in the video, with the extreme ultraviolet wavelength of the images allowing for the sun’s golden yellow, outermost atmospheric layer – the corona – to be visible.Nasa commissioned German musician Lars Leonhard to compose Solar Observe to accompany the video.In a statement released with the video, Nasa explained why there were a few blank frames in the video and the infrequent changes of focus away from the sun.“While SDO has kept an unblinking eye pointed toward the sun, there have been a few moments it missed,” it said. “The dark frames in the video are caused by Earth or the moon eclipsing SDO as they pass between the spacecraft and the sun.”Nasa also explained that a “longer blackout” in the footage in 2016 was caused by a temporary AIA instrument issue that took a week to fix.“The images where the Sun is off-centre were observed when SDO was calibrating its instruments,” Nasa said.The SDO mission is expected to continue observing the sun until 2030."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f7161259a5950eabf076fb4dfba2a127b607b3d/0_334_7200_4320/master/7200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34aa470bdd0f24a436efd5b072b34484","title":"we never ran out of toilet roll the edinburgh eco store thats thriving in lockdown","story":"The husband and wife team running The Eco Larder have been stranded in different parts of Scotland in lockdown, but that’s not stopping them from keeping their zero-waste store openOn 5 June, The Eco Larder co-owner Matthew Foulds had his first day off work for 90 days. Making the most of his free time, he picked up a hire bike and went for a ride. An apt choice, given that when lockdown began, The Eco Larder started offering bicycle deliveries for the first time.This new option is one of the ways that Matthew and his co-owner and wife, Stephanie Foulds, have adapted their business during the coronavirus pandemic. “We started offering a delivery service as soon as the lockdown came into place because of how difficult it was for people to get hold of groceries,” says Stephanie. “And because we’re an environmental company, we decided to do this by cargo bike.”The Eco Larder is a zero-waste social enterprise food store in the Haymarket area of Edinburgh. It opened in November 2018 after a successful crowdfunding campaign helped the couple to raise £23,000. Their vision was inspired by their daughter, who was only six months old at the time. “She’s a really big driver for why we do what we do,” explains Stephanie. “We just wanted to bring her up in a world that takes better care of the planet than we have been seeing over our lifetime.”Juggling a newly established business and a small child is a challenge. Add a global pandemic into this mix? “It was total chaos”, laughs Stephanie, who is currently staying on the Isle of Bute with her mother and daughter. They travelled there before any of the lockdown restrictions came into force so that her mother, who shares their flat in Edinburgh, could recover from a period of ill health, which included a week in intensive care.Until she is able to return to Edinburgh, Stephanie is handling ordering for the store remotely while Matthew keeps the shop doors open with the help of assistant Charlotte Wood.Yet despite the physical ide, they have worked together to adapt their business model as circumstances changed. As soon as the store’s local Post Office shut, for example, they stopped orders of lifestyle products through the website. They also reduced the store’s opening hours to manage deliveries and the extra cleaning now required.The couple are both qualified yoga instructors and have a studio at the back of the store. While the physical classes have had to come to an end for now, Matthew is managing to find time on Sundays to offer a Zoom class for their regular yogis who are still keen for their weekly fix.The lockdown has resulted in more positive innovations too. As well as introducing cargo bike deliveries, The Eco Larder now offers click-and-collect. “It’s a contactless service,” says Stephanie. “We leave the goods outside the shop for people. That’s been really popular now that lockdown is easing.”Stephanie is keen to highlight Matthew’s hard work over the last few months (“I’m really proud of him for everything he’s doing and showing up every single day”), but it is thanks to both of them that their business has done so well. “We never ran out of toilet roll,” says Stephanie with pride.The couple have also been able to draw on support from various sources. Thanks to an existing relationship with a walking and cycling charity, they were able to borrow two cargo bikes and find two volunteers to do their deliveries. Being part of the Visa network has helped too. “Having the support of bigger companies is necessary for smaller businesses,” says Stephanie. “They have the resources to raise the profile of a small business like ours.”The couple have been keen to give back to others, too. Rather than charging for their deliveries, they asked for a £5 donation and put a food box together every week, based on how many deliveries they had, and delivered it to the foodbank at Tollcross community hub, which is close to the shop.Looking to the future, Stephanie and Matthew would like to open another store in Edinburgh as this would expand their zero-waste mission and allow them to reduce prices. “Being the type of shop we are, it’s all small suppliers,” states Stephanie. “It’s just an issue of supply and demand. The more demand that there is, then the lower we can provide prices.Until that is possible, the couple are focused on buying their own cargo bike and offering deliveries on all weekdays, not just three days a week – so Matthew had better get more practice miles in on his next day off too.Shop local.

But anyone hoping to pop in and browse the bookshelves, take their child to rhymetime or spend a couple of hours using the computers is going to be disappointed.“We have the capacity for 20 people at a time,” says Rachel Braithwaite, project development manager at the Archibald Corbett Library in south London, which will, unlike many other libraries, be opening its doors from 4 July and restarting at least some former activities. “There will be a space marshall and hand sanitiser at the door. Everyone feels differently. People who would be worried won’t come. But personally I’m looking forward to it.”Returned books will be put into crates and quarantined for 72 hours. As for browsing, there may be a system whereby any books that have been touched and not borrowed have to go into quarantine it’s still to be decided. But the system to check books out is in place: librarians will be behind perspex screens, through which library cards can be scanned.During lockdown online library services have been booming, but it’s also important, says Braithwaite, to offer more than online services. For the past three weeks, the library has provided a click and collect service – and only one book order has so far been put in. “A lot of our customers are people without access to computers. If we do things like click and collect, or online activities, that won’t reach them,” she explains. “We want people to come in and get books.”Community services will also be available, including helping people without digital access fill in online forms for benefits such as bus passes or universal credit. “We’ve already started those services, out at the back of the library, on the decking. We now plan to move that into a room, with distancing and personal protective equipment,” says Braithwaite. Classes in English for speakers of other languages will also restart, and there will be access to four of the library’s usual nine PCs.Over the past 10 years of austerity, libraries have become vital community hubs, agrees councillor James Lewis, deputy leader of Leeds city council. “We have put a lot more services into libraries – credit unions, job shops, even post offices,” he says. Of the 34 libraries in and around Leeds, six will initially reopen, but there will be no book browsing. Computers will be available, but will have to be booked for 45-minute sessions. Even this limited amount of reopening has taken “painstaking” work, he says.As they gradually reopen, all UK libraries will have to put strict measures in place to ensure the safety of staff and users, including physical distancing and measures such as booking computers in advance. Dates vary around the UK. Libraries in England are able to reopen from 4 July libraries in Scotland from 15 July and in Northern Ireland from 20 July. In Wales, the next review of lockdown measures will be on 13 July until then, some libraries already offer a click and collect service and many are planning how to reopen with limited services.In most areas, it’s the larger libraries, more easily able to provide physical distancing, that are reopening first. In Nottinghamshire, for instance, library spaces have been reorganised with no access to study space, toilets, refreshment areas and no activities.“A lot of us realise that the services we are used to will only come back gradually,” says Portsmouth councillor Gerald Vernon-Jackson, who chairs the culture, tourism and sport committee of the Local Government Association. Many library staff have kept in touch with their users, particularly older and more vulnerable residents, but not everyone will know the new rules. “For some people, that message won’t get to them until they go to the library and talk to staff,” he acknowledges. “There will be teething issues, but I expect people will be OK when things are explained to them.”Lewis agrees. “Trying to get back safely the places where people get together, like libraries, sports centres, museums and galleries, is really frustrating. There’s been nothing like this in anyone’s lifetime, so we didn’t expect government to figure it out to the last penny,” he says. “But we don’t see any extra money. We are already starting the process of service reviews to reduce spending, including potential compulsory redundancies.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d6a746fe290b01dab8075661b95edb2b8b3b5ae/1_0_2416_1451/master/2416.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d5b606a13059f2c65b0543fafb74349","title":"life in the amber zone a view of project restart","story":" photographer  Tom Jenkins has documented the Premier League since its restart in June. Here, he looks back on the experience of shooting matches in empty grounds amid strict Covid-19 precautionsClick on each image for more informationThat bloody bird has been putting me off all game. High up in the stand above me at Carrow Road, a seagull is roosting and making a right old racket. It seems to be distracting the Norwich defence too, as Nathan Redmond strolls through and scores to put Southampton 3-0 up. There’s a brief cheer and a polite round of applause from a couple of Saints staff members in the stand before Redmond performs a Black Power salute. It’s all very surreal. Black Lives Matter meets Behind Closed Doors football. Welcome to the world of Project Restart, the Covid-19 version of the Premier League.For the last two weeks I have been lucky enough to be one of the chosen few to be let in to see the resumption of top-class football in England. When normally I could be one of between 20 to 50 photographers attending these matches, now it’s just a maximum of 10. Current rules state there must be no more than 300 people inside the ground at any one time.My first game back was the one that launched the resumption, at Aston Villa as they faced Sheffield United. All attendees at matches are required to have a temperature check before accreditation is given. In a building in the main car park I’m stood on a designated spot and look at a screen, like a high-tech speak-your-weight machine. This equipment deems me safe and my pass is handed over. Rumour has it that Manchester City have splashed out on an even flashier thermometerand a scanner operated by a real nurse. At the other grounds I’ve subsequently been to, the temperature check is performed with a little white plastic gun to the forehead. At Spurs, before their game v West Ham, it’s boiling hot. To make matters worse the man with the gun is waiting at the top of a flight of stairs and I’m carrying a ton of gear up there. My fingers are crossed as the gun points at my red, sweaty temple.Every ground is ided into three zones: green, amber and red. Roughly speaking, green is the immediate vicinity outside the stadium, amber inside the ground, red on the pitch and the tunnel area. Only players and club officials, those who are regularly tested, get into the red zone. I am amber. Before every game I’m sent a health declaration form to sign along with safety protocols to read. These vary enormously from club to club but the most substantial and well organised is definitely Liverpool’s, courtesy of their safety officer, Mr Stan Tickle.As I go into the first match at Villa, I look up at a big screen. “Face coverings must be worn at all times” it declares. I’m led to my allotted spot by a couple of kind, middle-aged stewards who are wearing their claret and blue masks as chin warmers. “You can’t move from there” they tell me “and you must wear your mask at all times”. “No problem,” I say as Jamie Redknapp brushes past me looking very dapper in a navy suit but mask-free. A member of ground-staff comes to disinfect the corner flag near me. As I pick up my camera, he is told by a colleague “put your mask on properly, you’re having your picture taken”.The atmosphere inside all the grounds is very strange and eerie. These are stadia I know so well yet it all seems unfamiliar. It’s a real sensory scramble, not only visually but also aurally. I was at Goodison Park for the Everton v Liverpool match, sat in the front row of the Gwladys Street End. Normally a febrile atmosphere emanates from the home fans in that stand, scorn pouring down on anything red. Around me this time are acres of tarpaulin sheets adorned with faces of the Everton faithful. A couple of metres away sits John Powell, Liverpool’s official photographer. “Lovely isn’t it?” he jokes.With 10 minutes left, and the game tied 0-0, Tom Davies hits the inside of the post and Everton are denied a famous winner. It is such a dramatic moment but all I can hear, apart from a couple of expletives from players, are the mellow tunes of a jazz saxophonist playing Baker Street by Gerry Rafferty from outside the ground. After a few matches I start to get used to the noise of these games. You can hear everything the players, coaches and referees say – it’s quite illuminating. There is so much shouting from the players I begin to wonder how they have the energy to run around. It takes me back to park football, refreshing to hear that multi-millionaires can still say such well-known football phrases as “Man on”, “Push Up”, “Keeper’s ball” or “Pull your finger out” although the last one did include a swear word as well.It’s fascinating to see how clubs have adapted to the rules laid down by the Premier League and government health advisers. Goodison Park’s notoriously tight tunnel means the away team change in a portable building in the car park, while at Tottenham the home team have shifted their changing room to the other side of the ground where the huge, expansive NFL rooms are situated. It’s also meant a lot more work for ground-staff, as they have disinfecting duties with balls, corner flags and goalposts.At Norwich they have an old-fashioned bucket of Dettol to drop balls into, while at Spurs they have armed their staff with Ghostbusters-style backpacks to spray down the posts. Even with all these safety requirements, things can go slightly awry. I was at Watford, positioned near the sideline where the substitutes were warming up. In the stand behind the dugouts the subs had carefully distanced seats to sit in, but as they started to stretch their limbs they gathered in a tight bunch, completely blocking my view of the game. One Watford player put his leg onto the board right by my camera, looked at me in my mask a couple of feet away, realised he was far too close to an amber zone non-tester, and moved away sharpish. After talking to his fellow subs, they all scarpered giving me a lovely clear view again.At Anfield last week, just after Liverpool’s Trent Alexander-Arnold arched that beautiful free-kick into the top of the Crystal Palace net, I could clearly hear a commentator eagerly describing the goal, even though he was high up in the Centenary Stand, probably a hundred yards away. It made me think what that stadium would have been like if the crowd had been there and I felt sad for them, deprived of seeing a moment like that in the flesh.I hope that before too long they will back and that the abnormality of behind-closed-doors football will soon be consigned to history."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b82993cb5f506d717d1388c21b5bdd33baba0469/0_199_5330_3199/master/5330.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba1ff1ada04145e2b1e51d595173a3f5","title":"twickenham tickets for england games could be corporate only this autumn","story":"England supporters hoping to attend this year’s autumn internationals have been dealt a major blow after the Rugby Football Union changed its ticketing policy to reserve the first 28,000 for corporate contracts, the  understands.That means unless the government allows for crowds of nearly 30,000 or more this autumn, the RFU will not be able to sell match tickets to supporters since debenture and box holders, sponsors, as well as the union’s other partners, will be the priority.The RFU has been lobbying the government to permit crowds this autumn amid Covid-19 restrictions, with losses of £100m forecast if England’s matches take place behind closed doors.The union has calculated that if social distancing of two metres is required, around 10,000 fans could be admitted with concerns over transport links a factor. If so, all the tickets would go to contracted groups.The government has announced a reduction to “one metre plus” from Saturday but fans being allowed into any sporting events is still dependent on a relaxation of the current rules, or special dispensation under stage five of the DCMS’s protocols.With social distancing at one metre, crowds of between 35,000-40,000 would be possible, the RFU believes. Given the large number of tickets already contracted, however, the remaining seven- to 12,000 would be prioritised for the RFU’s affiliated clubs and key stakeholders. The RFU estimates that crowds of that size would be worth £3m a match.“Given the unprecedented situation and the extreme financial pressure the RFU is under, the RFU council agreed to temporarily suspend the ticket distribution policy to allow for a focus on fulfilling contracted ticket groups for the 20-21 season,” said an RFU spokesperson.“The decision was taken to preserve rugby revenues, which get invested back in the game. If it is safe for the autumn internationals to go ahead with crowds in attendance, we are hopeful that we will be able to offer tickets to a wide range of stakeholders and fans.”There is a growing expectation that those matches will not take place. Instead a one-off eight-team tournament featuring the Six Nations as well as Japan and Fiji would take place.The RFU’s ticket pricing strategy will not be confirmed until fixtures and permitted capacities have been signed off.The eight-team tournament would mean that England are likely to host three Tests this autumn, and not the four originally scheduled.The home unions have been working on a plan that would see them host three matches and travel for two this autumn. The dates of the autumn window have not yet been finalised. World Rugby was due to vote on the framework earlier this week but that has been delayed with both the RFU and the French federation unable to reach agreements with their respective leagues over player release.The most likely scenario is that England play their postponed Six Nations match against Italy in Rome on 31 October before the eight-team tournament. That would mean three pool matches for Eddie Jones’s side and a final or classification match on 5 December.There will be a mandatory rest week built into the expanded autumn window, while the RFU is also hoping to reschedule its annual fixture between an England XV and the Barbarians, for which some tickets have already been sold."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01f0e7e3e6ee39c352e895f14dcd2179cff07536/0_268_6570_3942/master/6570.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=9e9af90e89aca75e79d14d9a35a9a0c8","title":"tesla becomes worlds most valuable carmaker without making a profit","story":"Elon Musk’s company outstrips Toyota on stock market as demand for electric cars soarsTesla has overhauled Japanese rival Toyota to become the world’s most valuable automotive company.Despite never having made a profit, the billionaire Elon Musk’s electric car manufacturer has been tipped by some pundits to achieve a valuation of more than $1tn (£800bn) as demand for electric vehicles soars.Tesla’s performance is all the more remarkable given that it has never made a profit, but analysts have pointed to the company’s prospects as a market leader in battery-powered vehicle technology.Analysts at the stockbroker Jefferies said the coronavirus pandemic could accelerate the speed at which the world adopts cleaner fuels.“Tesla remains significantly ahead of peers in product range, capacity and technology.”Excitement has also been building around a so-called “million mile” battery lasting up to 16 years, which Tesla’s Chinese supplier Catl has been working on and which is predicted to lower the cost of electric vehicles.The rise in Tesla’s share price is doubly good news for Musk, who enjoys a controversial pay arrangement linked to the company’s stock market performance that could theoretically hand him a $55bn bonus.Under the scheme corporate governance experts have described as “staggering”, Musk must build Tesla into a $650bn company over the next 10 years, meaning the company’s share price will have to more than treble from Wednesday’s price of $209bn.Pirc, an influential adviser to shareholders, including the UK’s local authority pension funds, said this week that investors should vote against Tesla’s executive pay deal because it “unfairly enriches the chief executive”.Ahead of Wednesday’s symbolic moment, Tesla appeared to have eclipsed Toyota earlier this month, according to the way that Wall Street values listed businesses.Posts on Twitter in mid-June praised the company for reaching a stock market valuation of $184bn on the Nasdaq exchange, ahead of Toyota on $179bn, drawing approval from Musk via his own account on the social media platform.But the Tokyo stock exchange measures stock market valuation differently, counting shares that companies hold in themselves and which cannot be purchased by outside investors.Such shares, which are described as being held “in Treasury”, are the result of firms buying their own stock to boost returns to investors.The practice is sometimes criticised as an artificial means of propping up a company’s stock market performance.Including Treasury shares, Toyota remained the world’s most valuable carmaker at $205bn, until Tesla blew past that watermark on Wednesday. Tesla does not hold any shares in Treasury."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f73134cfbb2e1828285b2a986745c190d6c02aef/134_0_1799_1080/master/1799.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b00aec61a3a4ef70804d07b62a6d3902","title":"germanys new sculpture garden the perfect post lockdown attraction","story":" A contemporary art collection in the grounds of a castle north-west of Berlin is a bold addition for a quiet part of BrandenburgDr Loretta Würtenberger – tall and clad in a flowing black summer dress – greets me with a casual coronavirus-style elbow-bump on the grounds of her new home, Schlossgut Schwante: an 18th-century baroque castle she bought with her husband Daniel Tümpel last year. Both well-established in the art market, the couple have transformed the castle grounds into a sculpture park featuring works by German and international artists, such as Tony Cragg, Maria Loboda, Dan Graham, Hans Arp, and Carsten Nicolai.It’s a bold, perhaps even radical, new attraction for this sleepy part of the Brandenburg region, around 25km north-west of Berlin, and an ideal post-lockdown cultural destination. Alongside the sculpture park, the couple have created a restaurant with a rustic, intimate interior, a large patio with an outdoor kitchen and a quaint wagon selling artisanal ice-cream. A farm shop sells handmade crockery, art books, cookbooks and local produce perfect for on-site picnics. An events programme includes open-air film screenings, outdoor yoga classes, concerts and lectures.“If someone had told me 18 months ago that I would be doing all this, and having this conversation with you right now, I would have said they were crazy,” says Loretta as she leads me through the restaurant and into the park. “We bought it from a friend, with no real intention of creating a sculpture park. But we wanted to maintain the house as the centre of a dynamic entity rather than a scenic backdrop. Since there’s no big agriculture here any more, and we are not farmers, art was the answer.”The baroque main building, which now serves as a private home for the couple and their four children, is said to have been designed by fabulously named Georg Wenceslas von Knobelsdorff, one of Frederick the Great’s favoured architects. It was constructed in the early 1740s for the von Redern family, generations of whom lived here until the 1880s. The vicissitudes of 20th-century Germany saw it used as a hospital and a DDR kindergarten.The garden is the estate’s pièce de résistance, though. Originally designed in the English style popular at the time, it now combines landscaped and wilded sections dotted with fruit trees (cherries, plums, apples), as well as pendulous willows, proud (and fragrant) linden trees – and more than 20 international artworks placed up trees, in ponds, and semi-hidden within thickets.It’s a fun way to enjoy art, and some pieces are additionally interactive, such as Dan Graham’s 2018 Play Pen for Play Pals, which combines stainless steel, glass and a two-way mirror to allow the viewer to merge, ghost-like, with the surroundings, and Carsten Nicolai’s cast-iron sound installation Echo, which mimics a meditation temple, encouraging visitors to thump their chests and listen for the reverberation from different places.A stainless steel corkscrew-style sculpture in a field turns out to be a 2012 work by Tony Cragg, whose own sculpture park near Wuppertal is perhaps the only similar project to this one in Germany. A small field of aluminium flowers that shimmy and chime with the wind and rain is by Berlin-based Japanese artist Toshihiko Mitsuya, who comes each week to clip the grass and plant new flowers. A much-darker note is struck by Polish artist Monika Sosnowska’s Stairs 2019, a crumpled black staircase that lies in the grass like a malevolent bug.But overall the park is a welcoming and graceful place, embellished with strategically placed Sissinghurst benches (with graceful arched backs), hammocks strung between trees, and a circular hedged area with a small pond and several day beds.“It’s about creating a space where art has no barrier,” says Loretta. “It’s not a white cube. It’s something where nature and art merges and families can come and enjoy.” Since opening, the site has drawn hundreds of visitors, including many families, a positive surprise for the owners, especially during these difficult times. On the way out, I spy another artwork rising from the lake – a neon sign by Martin Creed that reads Everything Is Going To Be Alright. Under normal circumstances it might seem a little trite, but as the world continues to grapple with a pandemic, it feels strangely comforting.• The Sculpture and Nature exhibition runs until 31 October.

Around 2,000 people – the vast majority of them Czechs – sat at a specially constructed 515-metre dinner table, stretching the length of the bridge, for an event billed by organisers as a “farewell to coronavirus”.The event was marked by a lack of social distancing, a measure of the relaxed attitudes in Prague, which has recorded a rate of five cases per 100,000 residents over the past seven days.The gathering was made possible by the absence of the crowds of tourists that routinely flocked to the bridge before the pandemic prompted the Czech Republic to close its borders in March, days before most other European countries. It has since reopened its frontiers and normalised travel to and from most EU countries, as well as to and from Britain. The outbreaks in Karvina and Frýdek-Místek have led to the Czech Republic reporting its highest daily infection number – 305 – since April, but officials insisted the trend was localised and not indicative of a second wave.The Czech Republic has so far confirmed 11,954 Covid-19 cases, with 349 deaths."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d5ccccc1d87c0e13a6cfb1158a8d61a358bf261/0_48_2885_1731/master/2885.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=591bb57dc325cbd4b7c29a2e1c0a13a3","title":"data reveals coronavirus hotspots in bradford barnsley and rochdale","story":"Exclusive: figures reveal locations with highest levels of new infections after LeicesterBradford, Barnsley and Rochdale can be revealed as the places with the highest levels of new Covid-19 infections after Leicester, as fears grow of further local outbreaks and the UK heads towards Saturday’s lifting of more lockdown restrictions.The official data, which has not been previously published on Public Health England’s online dashboard, comes amid complaints from local health officials and medics that a lack of detailed testing about local outbreaks is causing delays in attempts to curtail them.It also raises fresh questions about the disproportionate impact of the virus on ethnic minorities, with seven out of 10 of the worst affected areas being in Yorkshire and Lancashire, including some of the most ethnically erse parts of the country.Leicester was locked down on Monday after the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the seven-day infection rate was 135 cases per 100,000 people, the highest in the country. Figures from Public Health England now show that rate was even higher in the east Midlands city – just over 140 – in the week ending the previous Sunday, 21 June.Bradford’s rate for that week was 69.4 per 100,000 people, Barnsley’s 54.7 and Rochdale’s 53.6, according to the official figures, which gather together both tests primarily in NHS settings and of healthcare workers and tests carried out in people’s homes and in the community.The two strands are known as pillar-one and pillar-two testing.However, only the pillar-one testing is used in PHE’s online coronavirus dashboard, meaning that the majority of cases in the worst-hit areas are being left off this data. This data did not show that as far back as the week beginning 1 June, PHE knew Leicester was among the two worst affected areas in England.The Leicester MP Liz Kendall said it took “far too long to get even very basic postcode data, which is what we need to identify where the problem is whether it is in schools, whether it is in certain factories and workplaces. You really do need that detail.”Local public health officials and medics have complained that the government has not supplied sufficiently detailed information on local infections, the lack of which they say hampers attempts to quash new outbreaks.Councils have been promised postcode-level data for weeks from Public Health England and the newly created Joint Biosecurity Centre. But some public health directors are concerned the centre has not been sharing data about potential clusters of infections with councils, which could enforce school or workplace closures that could suppress an outbreak at an early stage.“If the only data you’re getting is ‘in this population of 90,000 people there are 40 positives’ it’s like looking for a needle in a haystack. If Leicester had got the data sooner they could have had a fighting chance of managing it,” said one public health director, who asked not to be named.The British Medical Association also implored the government to ensure local leaders were given timely information about cases in their area to help contain the spread of the virus.Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the chairman of the BMA Council, said on Wednesday: “The prime minister has talked about a ‘whack-a-mole’ strategy to tackle local outbreaks, but this is no use if the people leading the response on the ground – be they public health teams or local leaders – are not given the most accurate up-to-date data possible. This is crucial to allow swift action and to protect lives and the health service, and something that is not happening right now. This is all the more important given that the ‘world-leading’ test and trace app is not in place, meaning local leaders and teams armed with up-to-date information will be vital in containing spread of outbreaks.”The Department of Health and Social Care has said it has been “working closely with our local partners, providing them with the resources and tools so that they can take swift action to deal with any new local spikes in infection”.In total, there are 47 English local authorities where there are more than 10 cases per 100,000. In a further sign that the disease has shifted away from the capital, not one of these 47 areas was in London."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f5ddb7046c70d042f7935cfa6298512abc3ed78/0_248_3363_2019/master/3363.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70443b1a76e538e990ae58e87bfcdde7","title":"hong kongs security laws usher in new era of chinese control","story":"Beijing’s new rules appear tailored to cover the actions of protesters and their supportersBeijing has imposed a raft of national security rules on Hong Kong, ushering in a new chapter of Chinese control over the semi-autonomous territory once known as a haven of political freedom and civil liberty.Chinese and Hong Kong officials have said the law would target only a “narrow set” of behaviours, but the full text of the legislation – released only after it was enacted late on Tuesday – shows it covers a broad range of activities under vaguely defined crimes related to security. The harshest penalties are life in prison.Legal experts say the most worrying aspect of the legislation is that it brings Chinese law and national security agencies to Hong Kong, eliminating the firewall separating it from mainland China under the “one country two systems” framework. Others say it aims to fundamentally change Hong Kong society with requirements for “national security education” in schools, the media, and the internet.Here are the most concerning parts of the new law:In criminalising secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces to endanger national security, the law is broad enough that it could target forms of what was previously protected speech – like holding up a sign. The rules also appear tailored to encompass the actions of demonstrators and their supporters in protests over the last year.For example, asking foreign organisations or authorities to adopt sanctions against the Hong Kong or Beijing government or generally provoking Hong Kong residents to “hate” the Beijing or Hong Kong government could count as collusion. Vandalising public transport, a tactic used by demonstrators last year, would count as terrorism.The law adopts broad definitions of national security used in mainland China, where such measures are often used against political dissidents. The vagueness of the definitions are all the more concerning because Chinese officials, the standing committee of the National People’s Congress, have ultimate say over interpreting the law.Most of the national security cases will be tried in Hong Kong courts, but the central government can exercise jurisdiction over “complex cases” that involve foreign interference and are difficult for the Hong Kong government to oversee, “serious circumstances” as well as cases where China faces “grave” threats.While the law does not explicitly allow for extradition, it says that China’s supreme people’s court can name “relevant courts” to handle certain trials. Zhang Xiaoming, executive director of the Hong Kong and Macao affairs office, said in a briefing on Wednesday that suspects in these cases would be tried in mainland China.Under the law, the National Security Office, an arm of the Chinese national security services, will be able to operate in Hong Kong,and its agents will be immune from local laws while performing their duties. All Hong Kong government departments are required to cooperate with the office.The office is also charged with taking “necessary measures” to strengthen management of foreign non-governmental organisations and media. In mainland China, national security organs often block both domestic and foreign media, while news outlets and human rights organisations have been able to operate freely and independently in Hong Kong.The law grants a new police department charged with national security cases greater authority to restrict residents from overseas travel, demand service providers to hand over personal information, require foreign political organisations or authorities to hand over information as well as other powers.National security police can also search homes and electronic devices without a warrant, with approval from Hong Kong’s chief executive, as well as conduct covert surveillance and intercept communications.The law allows for trials without jury in cases related to national security that require the protection of “national secrets” or “foreign factors” or the protection of jurors, as approved by Hong Kong’s secretary of justice. In these cases, a panel of three judges is to oversee the case.The press and the public may be barred from observing some cases that involve “state secrets” or risks to public order. Closed-door trials are often used in mainland China in cases involving political dissidents.Legal experts are also concerned about the independence of the courts overseeing national security cases. Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, who answers directly to Beijing, will designate judges who may be removed if they are seen to endanger national security in speech or behaviour.The law applies to permanent residents and non-residents in Hong Kong who violate the law on Hong Kong territory as well as to crimes committed by a Hong Kong permanent resident outside of the city.Extraordinarily, it also appears to apply to anyone deemed as violating the law regardless of their nationality and where the alleged crime took place. Article 38 of the law state: “This law shall apply to offences … committed against the Hong Kong special administrative region from outside the region by a person who is not a permanent resident of the region.”Donald Clarke, at the George Washington University Law School, wrote in an analysis: “I know of no reason not to think it means what it appears to say: it is asserting extraterritorial jurisdiction over every person on the planet.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f84d02c495eaabd1202eca830628028b9a7ad77/0_237_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f24f1d63b25ca18a90552af2e3d835d","title":"jordan bans smoking and vaping in indoor public spaces","story":"Decision follows recent revelation country has highest rates of tobacco use in the worldThe Jordanian government has banned smoking and vaping in all indoor public spaces a week after rates of tobacco use in the country were revealed to have become the highest in the world.“Today’s announcement is a huge change,” said Larissa Al-Uar, from the activist group Tobacco Free Jordan. “We’re happy, but we need to see strong implementation of the law. Without that, it will be a disaster.”She said previous efforts to curb the country’s record-high smoking rates had suffered from weak enforcement as well as what health advocates claimed was widespread interference in policymaking by multinational tobacco companies.A  investigation found that tobacco company lobbyists had been regularly invited to sit in on meetings to debate regulations on their products, in what campaigners claimed was inappropriate interference in policymaking.It also found that big tobacco had been publicly lauded for paying to refurbish schools, providing students with schoolbags and equipment and running careers-development sessions for young people – which anti-smoking activists characterised as an attempt to promote their image.Tobacco companies including British American Tobacco said their involvement in regulatory debates was appropriate and lawful and that their charitable donations were driven by a commitment to the community.Smoking will still be permitted in outdoor areas of hotels, cafes and restaurants under the new regulations. In media interviews over the past week, campaigners have urged the government to focus on implementing existing smoking bans in a country where tobacco use is linked to one in five deaths compared to one in 10 globally.Jordanian men who smoke daily consume an average of 23 cigarettes per day, the 2019 nationalWHO survey found.In its announcement on Wednesday, the Jordanian government cited studies showing that smokers and those who consumed secondhand smoke were more susceptible to harm if they caught coronavirus, a link that Al-Uar hoped would prompt a re-evaluation of smoking among legislators and the public. “We hope that connecting smoking and Covid-19 will have a positive effect,” she said.Though it borders several countries with significant coronavirus outbreaks, Jordan’s government has overseen one of the world’s most successful Covid-19 responses, declaring earlier this week that the kingdom had effectively ended community transmission of the virus and that public curfews and lockdowns would be scrapped."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48879e801ef61fb68ba8540fa54ba437cd18522a/0_374_4865_2919/master/4865.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=45f74133526cad205f5fd4feddefd00c","title":"oxford offers best hope for a covid 19 vaccine this year mps told","story":"University is leading rivals but first drugs may not work fully, says vaccine taskforce chairOxford University is leading the world in developing a vaccine against Covid-19 and offers the best chance of having something protective against the virus as we go into winter, MPs have been told.Kate Bingham, chair of the UK vaccine taskforce, said she expected to have a vaccine “early next year” from one or more of the candidates, although it was possible the first vaccines might only “help alleviate the symptoms” so that people have a less serious bout of disease, rather than fully protecting them.Asked whether the UK would have to face the winter without a vaccine, Bingham said the best chance lay with the vaccine being trialled by Prof Sarah Gilbert from Oxford University, which is ahead of the rest.“I hope we can improve on those timelines and come to your rescue,” Gilbert told the science and technology committee but would not be drawn on how much sooner the vaccine might be ready.Physical distancing had reduced the numbers of people getting infected in the UK, which was good news, she said, but made it harder to trial a vaccine so they were now also testing it in Brazil and South Africa, where the case numbers are high. Astra Zeneca, the company that has partnered with Oxford, is to start a trial with 30,000 people in the US.Bingham said Gilbert’s team was a long way ahead of the field. “The Oxford study will have likely vaccinated all their efficacy subjects before any of the other vaccines actually start their big efficacy trials. So that just gives you a scale of how far ahead they are versus the other companies,” she said.Sir John Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University, criticised the lack of pandemic planning in the UK and particularly the absence of manufacturing capacity for vaccines.“I don’t think we had particularly confident or extensive planning for any pandemic, to be honest,” he told the committee. “People occasionally talked about flu but very little was done. I think we weren’t really ready for a pandemic in the UK. And I think that’s something that we need to pay very close attention to.”The UK had shown its ability to be ahead of the rest of the world in scientific research and clinical trials for vaccines, he said.“So I think we have to go back and think about how our healthcare system and our public health system thinks much more strategically about how we get ready for pandemics, rather than try to react after they’ve arrived on the doorstep, because I think that’s where the problem was.”Bell said the UK was “pretty complacent” about its manufacturing capacity for vaccines before the pandemic.“Our vaccine manufacturing capability was allowed to drift and was pretty lamentable at the beginning of this,” he said. “You don’t want to rely on importing vaccine from the US because you’re not going to get it at this stage.”This pandemic was “not a one-off” that would not recur for centuries, he said.“Since 2000 we’ve had eight close calls, which should have made us wake up. We’ve had three flu epidemics or near-flu epidemics, two Sars episodes, one Mers episode, Zika and Ebola, and any one of those could have blown up to be exactly what we’ve got now, so this needs become part of our national health security infrastructure.”He said it would be important to immunise as many vulnerable and older people as possible against flu before the winter. At the moment Australia, which usually experiences first the strains of flu the UK can expect, is not having a bad season.“But then there are these reports coming out of China about a new flu strain, which is a swine flu strain, which always worry you, because many of these strains do emerge out of China,” Bell said.“Whatever happens is likely to happen through the autumn, getting into the winter, and we’ll have a whole new set of other respiratory viruses floating around and if we happen to have a bad flu season, it will cause lots of trouble and there will be a real challenge, you know doing diagnostics separating the flu from the Covid patients doing all that kind of stuff. So, so we need to be on the front foot.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1328b11432b923711a5ffbd33d91d303988bf7fd/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b1f9cb3e4e1fa7b8c490268f1c8d9c6","title":"pressure mounts on uk government to release list of air bridges","story":"Ministers yet to name countries people can travel to without having to quarantine on returnPressure is mounting on the government to release the list of countries British people can go on holiday to without having to quarantine for 14 days on their return.As lockdown restrictions are eased, confusion remains among holiday-goers over which countries would be included in so-called “air bridges” – some of which were supposed to be up and running by 6 July.There were mixed suggestions over when an announcement would be made, with No 10 indicating the details would be released later this week and briefings from other Whitehall departments suggesting it would be Wednesday or Thursday.MPs have said holidaymakers need urgent clarity to avoid them making bookings that could leave them out of pocket.Talks were ongoing on Wednesday night between the health secretary, Matt Hancock, and the devolved nations about the proposals to exempt some countries from quarantine.The shadow transport secretary, Jim McMahon, said ministers had promised to inform MPs this week on where people could book holidays.“Last week the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said he’d do an oral statement on air bridges to the House of Commons on Monday. Then on Monday he said it would later in the week. Now we know he’s not planning on doing a statement at all this week.“Holidaymakers and the travel industry need clarity. Due to government briefings and leaks, trips are being booked based on potentially erroneous reports of which countries would be included in air bridges. This could leave people out of pocket.”Labour backs the idea of air bridges but in the final measures they want to see pre-screening arrangements before departure, temperature scanning in airports, isolation zones, and an effective 48-hour-or-less test and trace scheme.France, Greece and Spain were the three countries the UK government said it would want to discuss the idea with, but shortly after the announcement Greece said it was extending its travel ban for Britons for a further two weeks until 15 July due to its infection rate, leading some to speculate that the concept might not get off the ground.The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said she would take time to consider the proposal and has criticised the level of consultation from the UK government.The Scottish justice secretary, Humza Yousaf, told the  that Scotland will be looking into the UK government’s quarantine proposals in the next few days.“I made clear that – as the first minister has already indicated – we will take time to consider the public health impact of the proposals, as well as the data and evidence underpinning them, before announcing any changes. I hope we will be able to do that within the coming days.”Shapps said on Monday that he would announce further details including a full list of the countries and territories “later this week”.The departments for transport and health, and the cabinet, home and foreign offices, are all said to be involved in drawing up the policy, although transport is understood to be taking the lead.A government source denied the devolved nations were holding up plans.A senior Tory told the  that the government needed to get on with the announcement as soon as possible.“We are marching into July and we still don’t have the countries listed as quarantine-exempt. The aviation industry is shedding jobs,” they said.“I hope we are not over-complicating matters an R-rate lower than the UK’s should be a simple enough benchmark to deliver a list of countries deemed safe destinations.”The government said last week that the UK’s Joint Biosecurity Centre has drawn up a categorisation of countries it is deemed safe for people to enter the UK from without needing to self-isolate based on strict public health criteria.Countries have been classified as green, amber and red depending on their risk assessment. Low-risk countries in the green and amber categories will be exempt from public health measures at the border."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b91762b88f4409a29816c9b88023d6fdd427a86f/0_0_4380_2628/master/4380.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=5772ec06e14953cb9f596a5bb80bde95","title":"shielding in england how do you feel about coming out of lockdown","story":"As lockdown restrictions ease we want to hear how you feel about itFrom this weekend, pubs and restaurants, cinemas, museums, galleries and hairdressers in England will be allowed to reopen their doors.On Monday, people in England with underlying health issues who have been shielding since March will be allowed to leave their homes.They will be able to meet up outside in groups of up to six people from different households, provided they keep 2 metres apart, and they will no longer have to remain 2 metres apart from the rest of their household at home.If you have been shielding since March we would like to hear how you feel about lockdown restrictions easing.You can get in touch by filling in the form below or via WhatsApp by clicking here or adding the contact +44(0)7867825056.

New public health guidance published today says schools should reopen with physical distancing of at least one metre between students in most cases. Photograph: Cesar MansoAFP New public health guidance published today says schools should reopen with physical distancing of at least one metre between students in most cases.The recommendations appear to throw into doubt Government plans to reopen schools to all pupils on a full-time basis without any physical distancing.Some teachers’ unions have warned that a full return to school is now unlikely and some form of “blended learning” may be required for students who cannot attend school full-time.The Department of Education last month warned that physical distance requirements of one metre could result in some year groups attending school just twoe and a half days a week. However, a department spokeswoman said this estimate was based on a distance of one metre between students’ desks rather than inidual students. As a result, many more students will be able to attend school full-time under the new guidelines. The extent to which school can reopen as normally as possible will be determined in conjunction with talks with education stakeholders over the coming weeks, she added.At primary level, the new guidance says a distance of one metre should be maintained between desks or inidual pupils. This will not be mandatory for classes from junior infants up to second class, on the basis that younger children are unlikely to maintain physical distancing indoors.A class may be ided into pods, or smaller groups, where there should be at least one metre distance between inidual pods within the class and between iniduals in the pod, “whenever possible”.At secondary level, physical distancing of at least one metre - and two metres, where possible - should be maintained between desks or between inidual students or staff. The interim guidance, produced by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, was published on Wednesday evening.“It is interim advice, as what is current now may not be current in two or three week’s time. I’m very conscious of that,” she said,“I think the advice is lending itself to the optimum reopening of schools, certainly. What begins now is the extensive engagement with stakeholders. Their wisdom and experience will have to feed into this their concerns will have to feed into that. It is our common agenda to safely reopen schools.”When asked if schools may not be able to fully reopen, she said it was difficult to be definitive.“You can never be definitive. I don’t want in any shape of form to give the impression that I am definitive... We are moving towards the reopening of schools, and the safe reopening of schools, with an accommodation for everyone in the entire school community.”Second level teachers unions, meanwhile, have warned that a full -scale re-opening of schools for all students may be unlikely this autumn.In a submission to the Oireachtas committee on Covid-19 which sits tomorrow, the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland (ASTI) suggested that some form of “blended” model of education provision may be needed for large classes.ASTI general secretary Kieran Christie will tell the committee: “Enormous difficulties will also have to be overcome in the management of practical classes in woodwork rooms, metalwork rooms, art rooms, PE, music and home economics, together with the cleaning requirements necessary between classes ... we think that a phased return to school may be necessary”.No matter how creative schools are in using their available rooms and facilities, Mr Christie said they will not be able to accommodate everyone on a full-time basis. “Even a one metre social distance task will be extremely difficult, but not insurmountable,” he said.The union said it would be unacceptable if different social distancing rules were to apply to facilitate the re-opening of schools than were in place in other workplaces or in wider society.It said it had a significant number of members with underlying conditions or were immuno compromised or were living with others in similar categories.It said these teachers were “extremely worried about returning to workplaces that placed them in greater danger of contracting or transmitting the virus than if they worked in another environment”.The Teachers’ Union of Ireland (TUI) will tell the committee its members have no magical immunity to Covid-19 and must be treated as are other workers. “They must have confidence that their safety is being protected and that they are not being lulled into or forced into a false and dangerous sense of security. Other workers are protected by social distancing, developed and comprehensive return to workplace plans carefully implemented, personal protective equipment where necessary. Teachers ask no more than to be treated with the same level of concern,” the union says.It said the piece of the jigsaw that had been missing and that was most needed was clear direction about social distancing. “We assume, but do not yet know, that the current requirement of two metres is likely to be modified. We hear various commentators speculate or insist that there will be no social distancing requirement at all in a school setting, or at least in a classroom setting. “However when we, as practitioners, whose workplace is the classroom, consider the practical logistics of a school, its less than generous dimensions, its congested corridors, its limited entry and exit points, its often inadequate toilet facilities, we are not convinced or satisfied that schools can reopen safely, given current circumstances, in the absence of some defined metric regarding social distancing.”The TUI said it was also concerned “that some of the public discourse is peddling a myth that the virus is not transmitted by children”. “While there is evidence that young children are less susceptible to the virus than other cohorts of the population, it is also the case that older students have been shown both to contract and to transmit the virus.”The Irish National Teachers Organisation (INTO) said there was frustration among schools across the country that this much-needed guidance was not published earlier. INTO general secretary John Boyle said the union has consistently stated that public health advice must be paramount in decisions around schools’ reopening. “We will examine the published documents in detail and will continue to work towards reopening in a manner, and with resourcing, which minimises risk,” he said.Among the interim reports other recommendation include * Face coverings for teachers are not, in general, considered necessary as they conceal facial expression and can make communication difficult. However, it is acknowledged that wearing a visor may be an appropriate alternative in situations where there may be behavioural issues or tending to intimate care needs* Pupils, staff members and visitors who are ill or who have symptoms should not attend school* Application of respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette* A public awareness campaign will be necessary to reinforce the message to parents, pupils and staff not to bring their children to school if the child has symptoms of a viral respiratory infection or if there is someone in the household suspected or known to have Covid-19* Removal and storage of furniture will be necessary in order to comply with the recommendations that space should be maximised, and class space should be reconfigured to maximise physical distancing.* Additional class resources will need to be purchased in order to comply with the recommended minimisation of sharing of tablets  toys  educational materials e.g. play dough should only be for inidual use.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4293827.1593631616!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pods bubbles staggered drop offs reopening schools in a brave new world","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPrimary school pupils and their teachers will be encouraged to form class bubbles or groupings which stay apart from other classes as much as possible. File photograph: Getty With less than eight weeks to go before the start of the new school year, health authorities have released interim guidelines for the safe reopening of schools. Once implemented, school life will look very different than before. Here are some of the key recommendations:Social distancingPrimary: A distance of one metre should be maintained between desks or between inidual pupils. Given that younger children are unlikely to maintain physical distancing indoors, this recommendation will not apply to the first four years of primary school (junior infants to second class).Secondary: Physical distancing of two metres where possible or at least one metre should be maintained between students or staff. Schools should consider moving to inidual desks and chairs for students.Class bubblesPrimary: Pupils and their teachers will be encouraged to form class bubbles or groupings which stay apart from other classes as much as possible. Within each class, there may be pods or smaller groups, which should stay at least one metre away from other pods.Secondary: As far as possible students should remain in the classroom and teachers would move between rooms. Double classes, where possible, would minimise movement during the day. In cases where students have to change classroom, hand washingsanitising is required by both teachers and students.Dropping offpicking up childrenWalkingcycling to school should be encouraged. To avoid congregation at school gates, schools should consider staggered drop-offpick-up times opening up additional entrances or access points and instructing pupils to head straight for the classroom.For those arriving by car, parents may be encouraged to park further away from the school and then walk with their children to avoid congestion.Face masksStudents: It is not practical for many students to wear a mask properly for the duration of a school day. Older students should not be requested to wear a facial covering, but those who may wish to may do so.Teachers: Face coverings for teachers are not, in general, considered necessary, as they conceal facial expression and can make communication difficult.However, wearing a visor may be an appropriate alternative in situations where there may be behavioural issues or tending to intimate care needs.GlovesUse of disposable gloves in schools by pupils or teachers is not appropriate.Temperature checksOn-site temperature taking is not recommended because fever is not a consistent symptom of Covid-19 in children and would result in delayed school entry.Hand hygienePupils and staff should wash or sanitise their hands on arrival at school before eating or drinking after using the toilet after petting animals and after playing outdoors.Sharing books or devicesArt students should be encouraged to have their own art supplies. Shared electronics such as tablets and keyboards should be cleaned between use. Musical instruments should not be shared between students, if possible.Textbooks that are shared should be covered in a wipeable plastic covering that can be wiped with cleaning agent between uses. Sharing of sports equipment should also be minimised.Rules for teaching staffTwo metres is recommended for physical distancing by staff on breaks or arriving for work. Breaks should be staggered. At post-primary level, the formation of school staff “pods”, or teams who work together and take breaks together, should be considered. Staff meetings may be held remotely, or in small groups or in large spaces to facilitate physical distancing.CanteensSchools should ensure that physical distancing is applied in canteen facilities, with classes or groupings served at different times on a staggered basis.Break timesThe risk of virus transmission due to contact with outside surfaces or play areas is low. However, schools should aim to keep groups together, to stagger breaktimes and to promote outdoor access.Choir practicemusicChoir practicesperformances and music practicesperformances involving wind instruments may pose a higher level of risk and special consideration should be given to how they are held, ensuring the room is well ventilated and distancing between performers is maintained.SportSchools should follow the existing advice of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre’s guidelines for return to sports activities, which advise socially distanced training.Cleaning regimesSchools should also consider ways of reducing the need for touching objects by installing no-touch waste containers, propping doors open, and using sensor-operated hand towels.Where possible the keeping open of doors and windows should be encouraged to increase natural ventilation and to reduce contact with door handles.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"From planting to organising the kids\u0026rsquo room, there are lots of ways to keep plastic out of landfillOne Change: We may be at the beginning of a new era with changes starting to happenFriends of the Irish Environment challenges Government\u0026rsquos National Mitigation Plan"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climate"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

virus-testing laboratories plan to start testing the genetic make-up of coronavirus in confirmed Covid-19 cases in a move that could help suppress emerging clusters of infection.The additional testing could help public health officials better tackle a potential second wave.Analysing the genetic sequence – a kind of barcode that identifies the make-up of the virus in each positive case – could help map how the virus is spreading and prevent further transmissions.Viruses evolve over time, and assessing the genetic sequence in a Covid-19 case could help trace how the person became infected and whether the virus is related to a cluster in a workplace or hospital or to travel if there are similarities to the sequence of the virus in another country.The State’s labs have until now been testing to diagnose whether or not a person is infected but, given the low number of cases, they intend to start looking in more detail at the genetic make-up of the virus found in inidual cases to find the source of the infection.“We have been intending to do this for a while but the laboratories were so busy from a diagnostic perspective, just getting through the numbers, that we weren’t in a position to do this additional analysis earlier,” said Dr Cillian De Gascun, director at UCD’s National Virus Reference Laboratory.“We were hoping to add the genetic data from the virus and pair that with the surveillance information or the contact-tracing information and try to put all of that together,” saidGenetic sequencingDr De Gascun, who is chairman of the expert advisory group to the State’s National Public Health Emergency Team, said the analysis would be a “significant piece of work” but that he was hoping it could be done “in real time” to add to the public health investigations into the virus.Genetic sequencing could identify whether infections were similar and help trace the virus to a geographical area, which would in turn manage the public health response to suppress the spread.“It is likely it won’t help in every situation but it may help in particular outbreaks,” he said.Dr Paul Cotter, a microbiologist at UCC, who is leading a separate State-funded research project assessing the genetic make-up of Covid-19 viruses circulating in Ireland, said that the virus undergoes small mutations as it moves that serve as a barcode for its origins to places or countries.“If there were to be a second wave, this would be even more powerful in tracking things down in real time rather than using people power and phoning people in contact tracing,” he said.Everything you need

storey the ira s planner and enforcer who stayed in the shadows","story":"Nearly 1,800 men and women, dressed in black trousers and slacks, white shirts and black ties, lined up along the black-flag draped Andersonstown and Falls roads in west Belfast on Tuesday for the funeral of Bobby Storey.Behind them stood thousands more as the hearse containing the Tricolour-covered coffin of Storey, a senior Sinn Féin and IRA figure for decades, passed by, applauding as it did. Even with the Covid-19 lockdown regulations in place, they were determined to pay tribute to a man they considered a hero.However, there are others who experienced the brutal side of the 64-year-old, who hold sharply different views about the man lauded in Anderstown and the Falls Road.Storey, who died on June 21st after an unsuccessful lung transplant in a National Health Service hospital in England, may be the “most famous Provo” that most people, with no connection to republicanism, have never heard about, or know little about him, if they had.However, “Big Bobby”, as his closest friend for decades, former Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams, generally called him, never wanted to be known by people at large, just by his own.Within the Sinn Féin and IRA family, he was viewed as a top commander – involved from his youth in the Troubles, with years behind bars, and a place at the top table right up to very recently when illness forced him from the scene.The two people he most admired, as he said himself, were Che Guevara and Gerry Adams. “He was grafted on to Adams,” was one well-put portrayal of their relationship.Studying his history, Storey, who was the IRA’s director of intelligence in the eyes of those who knew that world well, was “a planner, operator and an enforcer”.Illustrating that latter side to him, one former police officer, recalled a beating delivered by Storey to another republican who had dared to challenge the Adams-McGuinness leadership at one of key moments in the peace process.“The man was a repeat murderer, with a penchant for cutting people’s throats, but even he was scared of Bobby Storey,” the former officer recalled.Though he rarely took the microphone outside of speaking to usually-private, sometimes public Sinn Féin gatherings, Storey was able to come up with the memorable quote when he had to go to the front of the stage.One such moment came during a west Belfast press conference in August 2015 attended by Adams, the late Martin McGuinness, Mary Lou McDonald and some other leading republicans.Matters were then fraught. Kevin McGuigan had just been shot dead in Belfast in a revenge murder for the killing of senior IRA figure Gerard “Jock” Davison that May.Storey had been arrested for the McGuigan murder, but released without charge. The killing threatened the already shaky Northern Executive. Storey insisted that the IRA had had nothing to do with it.The then PSNI chief constable George Hamilton had said some IRA members carried out McGuigan’s murder, although they had acted without the authority of the leadership. Storey’s denials were treated with scepticism.“I think the chief constable and other perspectives out there see this in terms of the IRA being the caterpillar that is still there,” waxed Storey. “What I think is that it’s moved on, it’s become a butterfly, it’s flew away, it’s gone, it’s disappeared.”The butterfly metaphor, which prompted a smile from Adams, had the colloquial colour and rhythm of a remark from one who could talk softly because they carried a big stick.Storey was a “made man” in the IRA from his teens. In 1979, when in his early 20s, he was sent to London to try to free the late IRA leader Brian Keenan from Brixton prison using a helicopter.It failed and Storey and three others were arrested. He was acquitted but in 1981 was sentenced to 18 years in prison over a gun attack on British soldiers.That led to the Maze prison escape of 1983 and the beginning of Storey making his way into republican legend. Storey and North Belfast Assembly member Gerry Kelly were two of the masterminds in what was the biggest jailbreak in UK prison history, dubbed by republicans, The Great Escape, after the film. In all 38 IRA prisoners made it out of the prison gates in September 1983, half were recaptured but 19 got away.Storey, too, was caught and had another seven years added to his sentence. Prison officer James Ferris who was stabbed during the escape died, although a court later ruled that it was a heart attack that killed him.Storey in a 2008 interview with the republican paper An Phoblacht recalled the escape. “It was a great achievement for the IRA. It showed the degree to which comrades could work together, not just those who escaped but those who formed the back-up inside the jail, prisoners who weren’t going on the escape. Then there was the teamwork of people outside the jail: the drivers, the safe houses. Even getting captured didn’t dampen the event. We shafted Maggie Thatcher.”Storey probably is best known for the 2004 Northern Bank robbery. Adams and the IRA denied that the IRA did the job, and there are people who accept that denial, but not many.Carried out on December 20th, 2004 at the Northern Bank\u0027s headquarters at\u0026nbspDonegall Square\u0026nbspWest\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspBelfast, Northern Ireland, the robbers seized £26.5 m sterling, along with smaller amounts of other currents - the biggest bank robbery in British history.The families of two Northern Bank officials were held at gunpoint on the night before while they were forced the following morning to report for work, as normal. One of the officials was forced to bring out £1m in cash stuffed into a holdall in a test run for the main robbery later that night. The two officials were forced to grant access to the robbers later that night into the bank, which had huge sums of cash in the vault in readiness to fill ATMs. Following the raid, Northern Bank recalled\u0026nbsp£300m worth of banknotes worth £10 or more, and issued new ones with new logos and new serial numbersThe robbery had been months in the planning, coming shortly after a failed attempt to resurrect the powersharing Executive and Assembly which had collapsed in 2002.Intelligence and security services put Storey at the heart of its planning. “The robbery was carried out by the Belfast brigade, and Storey was a key player in the brigade, so he would have been up to his neck in it,” said a former senior Police Service of Northern Ireland officer.It should be remembered that the IRA was on ceasefire at the time and supposed to have eschewed such criminality. The same source recalled how over the years the IRA engaged in numerous bank, post office and other robberies. When Border fuel laundering and other activity was taken into account it all amounted to a multimillion pound criminal empire.It prompted the late and former IRA member Dolours Price to comment at the time about slipping republican “standards” and to wonder: “The war is over, we are told . . . so what is all this money needed for?”It is a question that has never been properly answered.Storey had been involved in major robberies before. Stung by multiple truck hijackings in the early 2000s Gallaher’s cigarette manufacturers in Ballymena began to ship supplies bound for Dublin first to Liverpool by ferry, and then onwards to Dublin.The change soon drew the attention of the IRA to Gallaher’s use of Belfast port. In a raid in June 2001 that never drew the attention of the Northern Bank robbery, the IRA targeted a £4 million consignment of cigarettes bound for Rotterdam in the Netherlands.The planning was impeccable, even in the words today of security sources. The Belfast brigade of the IRA provided the people, the IRA in south Armagh handled the logistics, while Storey was at the centre of the web.“One night about 30 men appeared in Belfast dock. They took over the entire dock. They knew exactly what they were doing, they knew exactly what containers they were looking for, they knew exactly where those containers would be,” said one source.“The only mistake they made was that they were a little bit late and a couple of those containers were loaded by the time they got to the quayside. So they put a gunman in the cab of the crane with the crane driver and made him unload them again.“A fleet of lorries then appeared provided by the south Armagh brigade. The containers were dropped onto the lorries which headed off for the Border. The IRA held up the dock for another four hours, and then disappeared.“By the time the alarm was raised I reckon some of those cigarettes were almost in Cork. Bobby Storey would have been at the heart of that as well.”If the Gallaher’s raid made few headlines, the Northern Bank raid dominated bulletins across the world. Anxious to keep the IRA on board British prime minister Tony Blair’s “peace train” played down charges that the IRA was responsible for the cigarette job.“But it was absolutely obvious who did it. No organisation in Northern Ireland had the capability to do that job but the IRA,” said one security source involved in the investigation.Then there was the St Patrick’s night break-in in 2002 at the PSNI special branch offices at the Castlereagh police complex in east Belfast, supposedly one of the most impenetrable security centres in Europe. Three smartly-dressed men, one reputedly with an Oxbridge accent, almost casually got through the various checks, flashing what appeared to be genuine security passes.It was a Sunday, a quiet night, and the men walked along the corridors of the building, just as IRA men did in the Belfast docks raid, knowing exactly where they were to go.Within minutes, the three men were in the office where information about police agents, their police handlers and other highly-confidential documentation were kept.They got out with that hoard just as easily as they got in, a lone constable in the office being punched in the face and then hooded, bound and gagged as the three carefully and methodically assembled their haul.Millions of pounds were spent rehousing compromised detectives and others whose security was threatened by the break-in.Highly embarrassed, then chief constable Ronnie Flanagan referred to the Castlereagh raid as “an inside job”, giving rise to speculation that this was some sort of faction fight between the different elements of British intelligence. But it then emerged that Flanagan appeared to be referring to someone in Castlereagh assisting the three well-dressed robbers.The IRA denied involvement while senior Sinn Féiners complained of dirty deeds by “British securocrats”, to use a favourite and much-used phrase of Adams.Whitehall mandarin Sir John Chilcot, who later investigated the causes of the Iraq war, conducted an inquiry and found no evidence that any section of the British security agencies was involved.Once more Storey was blamed. Remembering the raid, a former senior police officer has no doubts but that he was central. However, that same source believes that Storey was criticised internally by at least one Sinn Féin leader who, whatever about the haul of information found at the break-in, was unhappy with its timing because it put pressure on the Northern Executive and Assembly.The then Ulster Unionist Party first minister David Trimble was under severe strain at the time for sharing power with Sinn Féin. Allegations that the on-ceasefire IRA had broken Castlereagh did nothing for his temperament, or his position.Storey was seen as a man who had “sleepers” in many sensitive positions who could be used at opportune times. Storey, this inidual believes, had “an asset” with knowledge of Castlereagh and that he decided to “use that asset, rather than lose it”. Not every element of the republican movement was kept in the loop by a man who kept secrets well.Storey was said to run a meticulous, almost obsessive intelligence gathering operation. Every IRA brigade in Northern Ireland, possibly apart from south Armagh which tended to do its own thing, supplied information to him.He carefully collated and stored it, much of it in a large bag, a “bit like a Gladstone bag”, according to the source. It was described in court as a “rucksack”.“Republicans were reporting back intelligence all the time, picking up information on prison officers, on police officers, taking down car registrations, getting family details, where children went to school, getting gossip about people’s finances, who was having affairs – all of it being fed back to Bobby,” he explained.It was around then, said the same source, that the PSNI devised a plan to bring him down. And here the story gets convoluted but it all leads up to Stormontgate in October of 2002.StormontgateThat month a long line of PSNI special branch and regular officers trooped into the offices of Sinn Féin at Parliament Buildings and seized material. Amid allegations of an IRA spy ring operating at Stormont – hence Stormontgate – Trimble could no longer hold his people together and the whole powersharing structure came crashing down, not to be rebuilt for close to another five years – an occasion in which Storey also featured.Sinn Féin’s head of administration at Stormont, Denis Donaldson was arrested, as were two other men, Donaldson’s son-in-law Ciarán Kearney, and William Mackessy. Storey’s “big bag” – stored in Donaldson’s home – was seized during a PSNI raid.They faced a range of charges but gradually some of them were withdrawn. In December 2005, the prosecution case ended, lawyers reporting it was no longer in the “public interest” to proceed with the case – a term that not infrequently is shorthand for protecting undercover sources or agents.The following day, Friday, December 9th, Donaldson posed with Adams and McGuinness on the steps of Parliament Buildings, the three looking rather self-satisfied.That did not last long. The following week a forlorn Donaldson gave a statement to the press admitting that for about 20 years he had acted as a British agent. At Stormont Donaldson came across as a quiet and decent inidual who kept to the background. On that day he appeared pitiful. He went to live a life of isolation in a cottage near Glenties in Co Donegal where he was brutally murdered the following April. One of his arms was almost blown off by a shotgun blast. The Real IRA said it had killed him, but there are still questions over whether that was a genuine admission.The outing of Donaldson allowed Adams and other Sinn Féiners to claim the whole Stormontgate affair was yet another example of a British “securocrat” conspiracy and that there was no republican spying at Stormont.Again some people believe that version of events. The other story, as expressed by a number of security, official and other sources, was that the police were trying to get Storey in possession of that bag of secret documents. Revenge was required for Castlereagh.In fact, said the former PSNI officer, the operation to nab Storey and other senior republicans had run for a long period. It was costly and involved many officers. But they just could not get the bag and Storey together. The PSNI for a long time knew Donaldson had the bag but were hoping for a “pass the parcel” moment when it would be handed over to the IRA director of intelligence.The source explained: “The bag had been left temporarily with Denis Donaldson. It was destined for Bobby and we were trying to catch Bobby with it, with all those intelligence records and CDs, but we couldn’t in the end. Eventually it got to the stage where we ran out of resources and had to move on it and take Denis instead.”One of the explanations for Donaldson’s arrest, even though he was an agent, was that he had not told his handlers about all the secret documentation. Another reason for the police moving in was fear that the material would be transported for safer keeping across the Border.The result was that Storey escaped the net while millions of pounds were spent trying to safeguard the estimated 2,000 or so people, many of them prison, police and British army officers, some of them politicians, named in the documents.The former officer also recalled how police did not get a chance to contact one particular man, an alleged drug dealer, on the list. “He was killed by the IRA, using one of its cover names, before he could be warned.”LoyaltySpeaking after his death, Adams was strong in his tribute to Storey, saying that he was “one of the bravest people I have ever had the honour to know”.“Whether inside or outside of prison, or through the years of harassment and beatings, arrests and torture from the RUC and British army, Big Bobby demonstrated time and time again his enormous personal commitment and courage,” he added.In turn Storey had a fierce loyalty to Adams. In 2014, when Adams was arrested and questioned at Antrim police station for a number of days about the 1972 abduction, murder and secret burial of mother-of-10 Jean McConville, Storey rallied to his cause.“That they would dare touch our party leader, the leader of Irish republicanism,” Storey thundered at a public gathering in west Belfast. At the same meeting Storey repeated a famous line from Adams about the IRA: “We have a message for the British government, for the Irish government, for the cabal that is out there: we ain’t gone away, you know.”During research for this article, several political, security and republican sources have emphasised how critical Storey was to the peace process and strategy pursued by Adams and McGuinness. They provided the strategy, he provided the muscle to ensure they got their way.Following the August 1994 IRA ceasefire, senior Sinn Féiners went to IRA units across Northern Ireland, and in the Republic, to argue for the peace strategy. Encouraged to speak up, a couple of IRA volunteers attending a meeting close to the Markets in central Belfast did so, and expressed their opposition to the ceasefire.“During all of this Bobby sat at the back of the room,” said one well-placed source. “As the crowd were filtering out Bobby took those speakers aside and explained to them in words of one syllable what the consequences would be if they ever challenged the Adams-McGuinness leadership again. Bobby could be vicious, and they knew that.”One very senior security figure was certain that Storey was important in ensuring that those within the IRA and Sinn Féin who opposed Adams and McGuinness never got the upper hand.“We always believed that Bobby Storey was director of intelligence in the late 1990s and early noughties for the IRA,” he said. “He was very much a key player, extremely close to the leadership. His support for them was pretty vital in containing any iniduals within the organisation who were threatening to throw over the traces, because they were all terrified of him.”“I have no doubt that he played a positive role in making sure that any dissent within the organisation was suppressed,” he added.“He would have been fairly free with his fists when he had to. There were many, many people in the organisation who were frightened of him. If he came around and supported the party leadership then there would be very few people who would cross him.”At the funeral Adams quipped that he did not know anyone who knew Storey “who didn’t like him – except for MI5, MI6, the old RUC, the British army, and prison governors”. Still, he was not universally loved, even within republicanism.In addition to those he threatened, there were other Republicans who had little time for Storey. One in particular was former IRA leader Ivor Bell who last year in court was cleared of soliciting McConville’s murder.That case centred on testimony Bell gave on the Boston tapes – the ill-fated oral history of the Troubles – where it was alleged that one night in 1972, Bell, the late Pat McClure and Adams gathered to settle the terrible end of the life of Jean McConville.Adams, who also gave evidence to the court, insisted no such meeting took place and that he had no part in the murder of the 38-year-old widow.But in the tapes, where former IRA man Anthony McIntyre interviewed Bell, mention also is made of Storey. The court heard that when the IRA and Sinn Féin decided to assist in locating the bodies of McConville and others of the Disappeared Adams sent Storey to speak to Bell. This would have been around 1998-1999.Storey’s task, it appeared from the tapes, was to elicit from Bell what he knew about the Disappeared. But it was clear that Bell felt that Adams was being disingenuous, which led to an infuriated Bell describing Storey as a “clown” and an “idiot” – terms that very few people would have used about him.A clearly annoyed Bell said that he told Storey, “What are you asking me about it for, sure my knowledge of it would be second-hand, why don’t you ask Gerry?”“Oh Gerry knows nothing about it,” Storey told Bell with an exasperated Bell saying to McIntyre, “the annoying thing is he actually believed Gerry.”Storey was loved within most of the republican community but as with Bell there were those who despised him.In July 2018, dissident republicans threw explosive devices at the homes of Adams and Storey in West Belfast. No one was injured. A rally there was quickly organised, with Storey telling dissidents they needed to “go back to where they come from”. “They were on a road to nowhere,” was a message he repeated on a number of occasions.YouthFrom teenage years Storey’s whole life was given over to the IRA and Sinn Féin. He joined the IRA when he was 16. Aged 17, he was one of the youngest to be interned in 1973. He served more than 20 years in prison, quite a lot of them on remand on various charges such as IRA shootings and bombings. Several sources said he was implicated in a number of killings but that because he was so long inside that he is rarely linked to some of the even more notorious multiple-death IRA gun and bomb attacks.“Then there was the massacre on Bloody Sunday when 13 people were gunned down . . . The fact that British paratroopers could gun down innocent protesters had a massive impact on me and from that point on I was attempting to join the republican movement.”Through the 2000s and as the IRA, to a relative degree considering the criminality, retreated into the shadows Sinn Féin leaders such as Adams saw the merit of bringing Storey more into the political fold. They tested the waters first by seeing how he would perform. On one occasion The  and other newspapers were invited to an off-the-record briefing where Storey, a little self-effacingly and with some reluctance, offered his thoughts on whatever was the political issue of that day. “I am not used to this,” he said, but then chatted away. There were no other such invitations for sit-down meetings with Storey.Tall, strongly-built, and with a commanding presence, Storey could be affable man, and with a good sense of humour. Equally, it was clear that he was not one to be crossed.His civility did not stretch to all journalists. The Belfast writer and journalist Malachi O’Doherty, who has been a regular critic of Sinn Féin and the IRA, remembers how in the mid-1990s he was tackled by Storey after he had delivered a piece on BBC Radio Ulster’s Talkback programme in which he referred to Storey’s “enforcer” status.Storey was 6ft 5in. O’Doherty is 5ft 2in, or little more. O’Doherty had been attending a lecture in the Felons’ Club in west Belfast when Storey approached him. O’Doherty recalled: “He put me up against a wall and told me I was a slug and not welcome in west Belfast.”“After that incident another journalist went to speak to him and said, ‘Look what’s the score with Malachi?’ And he said, ‘Well, Malachi shouldn’t feel that he is free to just walk into west Belfast given that he has been so critical of us’.”This was not a teasing, semi-jocular act by Storey, says O’Doherty: “Oh, no, it was clear intimidation of a journalist.”Some people have characterised Storey as little more than an IRA hardman who carried out the orders given to him and who could barely think for himself. McIntyre, who spent time in prison with him and who was no friend of the Adams-McGuinness leadership, and who himself took some serious gyp from Storey, strongly contradicts that view.He recalled occasions in prison when inmates were shown films. “I hated sitting beside him because no matter how complicated the plot of the film he’d work it out immediately and ruin it for you,” he said.“He was very competent and very well got. He was absolutely hated by the cops, they absolutely despised him.“He was exceptionally bright. I never found Bobby thuggish or a bully in a personal sense although a whole lot of others did. Whenever he was talking he always carried the authority of the IRA.”“In terms of practical intelligence and practical ability you would meet nobody brighter. People used to say to me, ‘He is stupid’, and I would say back to them, ‘You are stupid for thinking he is stupid’. You don’t put operations like that together if you are stupid.”Journalist Ivan Little while writing about Storey paramilitary past in the Belfast  also had a memory about his “softer” side. “At a talent contest I hosted in west Belfast some years ago he and his mother watched with pride as Storey’s brother Brian who had Down’s syndrome stole the show as an Elvis impersonator,” he recalled.But there are few such anecdotes.Across the Border he was also very well known to senior Garda and Army intelligence officers. “He was certainly on our radar he figured a lot in our intelligence reports down the years, he was an interesting character,” said one former Garda source.And while Storey is seldom mentioned as being on the IRA Army Council a former Army intelligence source said the view in the South was that “he was on the army council, or very close to it”.“Membership of the army council was fluid we think he was on it for a while. Storey was very influential. He mostly stayed behind the scenes but we had him at the very top of the tree,” he said.That 2008 An Phoblacht interview was another example of Storey’s switch from paramilitarism to politics although one security source said that even in his Sinn Féin days “he was somewhere between the two”.He held a senior position for Sinn Féin at Stormont and also served as party chairman for a period. He was a prominent backroom figure at times of political crises and during elections. He could energise the footsoldiers when the vote had to be got out. Perhaps jaundiced by the necessity to deal with journalists it seemed, however, that elected politics was not for him.In his graveside oration Adams spoke about how Storey was devoted to his partner, Teresa, their children, and grandchildren, brothers Seamus and Brian, and sister Geraldine.One of the repeated arguments from senior British security figures and some unionist politicians over the years is that a chief reason for the IRA finally ending its “war” was because it was so riddled with and damaged by informers and agents, some of them operating at very elevated levels such as Donaldson and Freddie Scappaticci, also known as Stakeknife, and some purported high-rankers yet to be exposed.Differing viewsThere are different views of Storey. Most unionists and many others will see him as just another ruthless terrorist who was part of an IRA murder machine that killed up to 1,800 people and badly injured thousands more in an unjustifiable and unnecessary conflict.That view was reflected in a piece in the Belfast  on the day before the funeral by historian Ruth Dudley Edwards which was headlined: “Bobby Storey: a violent thug who played role in the collapse of Stormont on three occasions”.The counter view was offered in that same day’s Irish News where senior republican Jim Gibney wrote: “If it is possible for one inidual to embody the spirit, the dynamic, the duration and durability, the depth and complexity of the republican struggle over the last 45 years then it was Bobby Storey.”But in the often dispassionate warts and all world of the British and Irish intelligence and security services that battled with Storey and his like there remains an objective regard for his nerve and skill.That same former Stormont official had one lasting memory of Storey that acknowledged his place in the republican hierarchy and in the “long war” tussle between the competing forces. It was May 2007, two months after Adams and Ian Paisley after much coaxing from the British and Irish governments, struck their truly historic deal to restore the Northern Executive and Assembly. This was after close to five years of direct rule from Westminster and now finally powersharing was being reinstated.While below in the chamber the politicians went about the business of formally reactivating the Executive and Assembly, in the visitors’ gallery above the likes of taoiseach Bertie Ahern, Blair and other VIPs observed proceedings, enjoying some of the reflected light of a job well done.Just a few seats from them sat three of the most senior IRA figures of the Troubles, the late Brian Keenan, Brian Gillen and Bobby Storey.“This is how central he was to PIRA and also to the peace process – while it would have infuriated unionists, their presence was a vindication of the Adams strategy and the peace process,” said the former official.He said that Blair and some of the other dignitaries “probably wouldn’t have recognised Storey anyway, which again says something about him”.And in a neat encapsulation of Storey’s significant but in many way reticent place in republican history and in the peace process he added: “He was very low profile, as befits an intelligence person – he was an observer.“But I do remember the respect my intelligence colleagues had for his operations. Quite apart from the Maze breakout to have planned the Northern Bank robbery and the Castlereagh break-in was extraordinary: respectively one of the largest bank robberies in history and the single biggest breach of UK national security ever. Quite a CV and he certainly didn’t lack ambition.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4293577.1593640335!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"full line up of junior ministers unveiled as taoiseach accused by one td of snub","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Josepha Madigan is expected to be appointed as the Minister of State in the Department of Education.

I told him I was disappointed,” he said of his conversation with the Taoiseach.There was also controversy over the lack of a senior minister from the west and the new line up of ministers announced on Wednesday night attempts to address that criticism about regional imbalance.The Fine Gael junior ministers are Colm Brophy (Dublin South-West), Josepha Madigan (Dublin Rathdown), Peter Burke (Longford–Westmeath), Frank Feighan (Sligo–Leitrim), Martin Heydon (Kildare South), Damien English (Meath West) and Patrick O’Donovan (Limerick).Hildegard Naughton (Galway West) is Fine Gael’s super junior minister at the Cabinet table.The Greens’ junior ministers are Joe O’Brien (Dublin Fingal), Ossian Smyth (Dún Laoghaire) and Malcolm Noonan (Carlow-Kilkenny). Senator Pippa Hackett is the party’s super junior at the Cabinet table.Mr Moynihan, who was the Fianna Fail party’s chief whip, said Mr Martin had “insulted me and my community” by not appointing him a junior minister.He said he is “very, very disappointed with being let down”. He said Fianna Fáil held two out of three seats in his constituency.Mr Moynihan said he “worked extremely hard over nine years to rebuild (the) party, took a lot of stick in terms of picking candidates” but got “no thanks”.“He has insulted me and my community,” Mr Moynihan said.“Very, very disappointed with him.”Turned downEarlier Fianna Fáil TD Jim O’Callaghan turned down an offer of a junior ministerial post.Mr O’Callaghan told The  he was offered a junior position in the Department of Justice, with responsibility for law reform.“I was asked this afternoon by an Taoiseach, Micheál Martin TD, to accept an appointment as minister of state in the government. Having thought carefully about this offer I have decided not to accept,” he said.“The reason I am not accepting is because I believe my energy and abilities will be better used as a backbench Fianna Fáil TD rather than as a junior member of government.“At a time when many of our party’s senior members will be preoccupied with their ministerial duties, I want to devote more time to strengthening our great party by making it a more attractive option for young voters. I also believe Fianna Fáil needs strong voices outside government who can ensure that our party’s identity can be protected during the term of this coalition government.“I wish Micheál and his government every success in the years ahead.”The outgoing Fine Gael Minister for Education Joe McHugh is understood to have also turned down a junior ministerial post.‘Votegate’Mr Chambers has been appointed Minister of State at the Department of Finance with responsibility for financial institutions.Mr Collins has been appointed Minister of State at the Department of Education. When the “votegate” scandal erupted in the Dáil last year he lost his portfolio as the party’s spokesman on jobs, enterprise and innovation.The Government appointed 17 junior ministers on Wednesday. The two so-called super juniors who sit at Cabinet as well as the Government chief whip were named on Saturday along with all the senior ministers.The Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Green party leaders did not co-ordinate their appointments for the senior ministries resulting in the controversy over the absence of a minister in the West.The new Ministers of State at a glance:Dara Calleary, already appointed to the Department of the Taoiseach as Government Chief Whip, has been assigned additional responsibilities to also be a Minister of State at the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.

Photograph: Nick Bradshaw The junior ministerial appointments were the last chance Micheál Martin, Leo Varadkar and, to a lesser extent, Eamon Ryan, had to calm the anger among TDs who were passed over for Cabinet preferment. Martin largely succeeded in squaring off as many potential long-term difficulties for himself as possible in his Minister of State appointments, barring a handful of disappointed TDs. The regional imbalance at Cabinet was also rectified with a number of appointments from constituencies along the west coast by both Martin and Varadkar. For Martin, the Jim O’Callaghan question overshadowed the initial Cabinet appointments and, as it transpired, the junior ministerial picks too. Martin left the high-profile justice spokesman out of his seven choices for the Cabinet table but on Wednesday offered him a junior position in the Department of Justice, under Minister Helen McEntee, with responsibility for law reform. His offer was refused but it is possible Martin may have suspected this would happen, given rumours in recent days that O’Callaghan would decline a junior position.Political martrydomAlthough the offer has denied O’Callaghan political martyrdom, the Dublin Bay South’s refusal is still a harbinger of potential trouble for Martin. And the angry reaction of former Fianna Fáil chief whip Michael Moynihan showed that there will be some in the parliamentary party who will be inclined to cause trouble for their leader. Cork North West’s Moynihan, who was a Martin loyalist, lost out and said his leader “insulted me and my community” after nine years’ work to help rebuild Fianna Fáil. O’Callaghan said he wants to “devote more time to strengthening our great party by making it a more attractive option for young voters”. “I also believe Fianna Fáil needs strong voices outside government who can ensure that our party’s identity can be protected during the term of this Coalition Government.”Leadership bidO’Callaghan’s statement was widely interpreted as an indication that he intends to cultivate the Fianna Fáil grassroots ahead of a potential future leadership bid, and the level of his activity among rank and file members will be keenly watched in the months ahead.Yet other Fianna Fáil big beasts who could have been dangerous outside the tent, such as Limerick’s Niall Collins, were brought in by Martin. Another prominent TD who was not appointed to Cabinet, Meath East’s Thomas Byrne, was given the plum position of Minister for European Affairs. Despite the disappointments and resentments of recent days, Martin’s position at the helm of his party is secure, at least until he hands the Taoiseach’s office over to Varadkar in December 2022. But all of Martin’s moves in recent days give the impression that he does not expect to lead his party for much longer after that. Too many enemies are being made for there to be a clamour for him to lead Fianna Fáil into the next election. Varadkar’s job was easier, since the generational change he was seeking with Fine Gael prepared the ground for those who lost Cabinet posts – Charlie Flanagan, Michael Creed and Michael Ring – to be moved to the backbenches. SurpriseJosepha Madigan, who has also left Cabinet, was given a junior ministry and former minister for housing Eoghan Murphy let it be known that he did not want any ministry at all. There was surprise at the decisions of Joe McHugh to refuse a junior ministry, as well as that of John Paul Phelan to decline the position of deputy government whip. For Eamon Ryan of the Greens, the task was much easier since the overwhelming majority of his TDs are first timers. Ryan gave jobs to Ossian Smyth, Joe O’Brien and Malcolm Noonan. Dublin Central’s Neasa Hourigan, one of only two female Green TDs, is likely to have lost out because of her opposition to the programme for government."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4290693.1593296152!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"who is in the new cabinet members in profile","story":"Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has been elected Taoiseach by 93 votes to 63, with three abstentions, in a historic Dáil vote which has taken place in Dublin’s Convention Centre. Video: Oireachtas TV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGreen Party deputy leader Catherine Martin is now Minister   for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht.A new Taoiseach was elected on Saturday and a range of new Ministers were appointed. Here’s all you need to know about them:He became party leader in 2011 just weeks before the general election when Fianna Fáil lost 51 seats in the fall-out from the economic collapse. The five wilderness years were spent reorganising the party and its decimated cohort of TDs.In 2016, Fianna Fáil had a mini-revival, regaining 23 seats and in the 2019 local elections won the most seats of any party. The four years since were spent building up a still volatile parliamentary party but Fianna Fáil suffered further losses in the 2020 election and dropped six seats, partially blamed on the party’s confidence and supply agreement with Fine Gael.The 2020 election had become do or die for Martin, whose Cork South-Central constituency will now be home to three Cabinet members - himself as Taoiseach, his party colleague Michael McGrath and former tánaiste Simon Coveney.The first Cork Taoiseach for 41 years since Jack Lynch, he has been a TD since 1989, served on Fianna Fáil’s front bench since 1995 and held four senior government portfolios during the party’s time in office - foreign affairs, health, education and enterprise.Single-minded and driven with a huge work ethic, the pragmatic Martin can be sensitive to criticism. A good media performer he is however seen by some within the party as distant and colleagues are hoping that communications within the party will improve.Health conscious and very proud of introducing the smoking ban in Ireland, he has pushed the Public Health (Alcohol) Act despite the reluctance of rural TDs within the party.Leo Varadkar, Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and EmploymentAfter a terrible election result and what appeared initially to be a guaranteed trip across the Dáil to the opposition benches, Leo Varadkar’s fortunes have been transformed along with those of his party.His calm and assured leadership performance through the coronavirus pandemic combined with a lengthy stalemate over coalition formation talks have resulted in Fine Gael soaring from losers to clear victors in the opinion polls and with Varadkar moving from spent political force back to key player.Nobody has batted an eyelid at the fact that he will preside over the party’s abandonment of its Civil War stance after a century and move into a historic government coalition with Fianna Fáil and the Green Party.Even less remarked on has been his demotion to Tánaiste for over two years as Fine Gael participates in the previously vilified notion of rotating taoiseach. But he also leads his party into an unprecedented third term in office.A social agenda trailblazer, he is Ireland’s first openly gay minister, the State’s youngest taoiseach and is now Tánaiste. The son of an Irish mother and Indian father, his qualification as a doctor helped during the pandemic and assured him of good publicity when he decided to re-register as a medic and said he would do half a day a week on the helpline for people who suspected they had the Covid-19 virus.Never one to shy away from a photo opportunity, the 41-year-old was also the first taoiseach to assiduously use social media to push his message and his carefully cultivated image. And he got into the much discussed habit during lockdown of quoting a variety of books, films and other media in his speeches.He has also used his speeches to throw out provocative messages reflecting his economic views including his oft quoted controversial remark that Fine Gael should represent those who “get up early in the morning”.He previously served as minister for social protection, for transport and for health and now moves into the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. But it remains to be seen if he will innovate rather than merely manage as he was perceived to have done in his previous portfolios.Michael McGrath - Minister for Public Expenditure and ReformWhen political heavy hitter Michael McGrath (43) became Fianna Fáil’s finance spokesman, then minister for finance Michael Noonan pronounced that the accountant had a big future ahead of him in politics.That future has finally arrived for the Cork South-Central TD who has been finance spokesman since 2011, when Fine Gael was in coalition with Labour and again when Fine Gael relied on Independents and Fianna Fáil’s confidence and supply arrangement.First elected to the Dáil in 2007 he has retained his seat at each subsequent election. It has been a long road for the man who will finally take the helm at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.A constituency rival and colleague of his party leader he is seen as a potential successor, is well liked by his party colleagues and has a well-oiled constituency machine.Originally from Passage West but now living in Carrigaline with his wife Sarah O’Brien and seven children, he secured a first-class honours commerce degree in UCC and qualified as a chartered accountant with KPMG in Cork City.A central member of the party’s negotiating team in the government formation talks, he is a low-key, calm and effective spokesman.Stephen Donnelly - Minister for HealthThe appointment of Stephen Donnelly to Cabinet makes it two Ministers for Health in a row for his Wicklow constituency taking the baton from Simon Harris. It is a job often seen as a political crucifixion for the holder.Elected to the Dáil as an Independent on his first attempt in 2011, he went on to form the Social Democrats with Róisín Shortall and Catherine Murphy in 2015 and surged to a poll-topping performance in Wicklow in 2016.Shortly afterwards however, he left the party following disagreements with his co-leaders.In the Dáil he has since had a number of disagreements with the Social Democrats on the much lauded Sláintecare plan and all eyes will be keenly watching how he deals with the much debated health roadmap.After a short second  as an Independent he joined Fianna Fáil in 2017. While party leader Micheál Martin saw his recruitment as a major coup, his arrival left many noses out of joint in Fianna Fáil. Those tensions and the move, appeared to dent his 2020 election chances but he was elected on the 15th count.Darragh O’Brien, Minister for Housing, Local Government and HeritageAnother member of the Fianna Fáil negotiating team to get a seat at the big table Darragh O’Brien (45) becomes Minister for Housing in the new three-party Government.Party spokesman on housing, planning and local government in the last Dáil, he was first elected to the Dáil in 2007. He lost out in the 2011 decimation of the party in the economic recession. He became one of 51 party TDs to be defeated at the hands of angry voters. He successfully ran for the Seanad that year on the Labour panel and became Seanad leader, keeping a place in the Oireachtas.But his Dáil defeat had a salutary effect, resulting in him building up a strong constituency base with his brother as a local councillor. It may have contributed to local party tensions with Dublin Fingal colleague Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee.He went on to top the poll in Dublin Fingal in the 2016 general election.Before entering politics he worked in the financial services sector for 15 years as an area manager with Life Assurance Company.He was elected to Fingal County Council in 2004 before successfully contesting a Dáil seat in 2007.He is married with a young family.Barry Cowen, Minister for Agriculture and the MarineThe no-nonsense Fianna Fáil spokesman on public expenditure and reform Barry Cowen (52) has been appointed Minister for Agriculture. The man who sealed the fate of the water charges in the 2016 government formation negotiations, was again a key member of the negotiating team this time round.The 2016 talks led to the confidence and supply arrangement with Fine Gael but left Fianna Fáil out of government. The intense five-week\u0026nbspcampaign in 2020 led to government and the reward of a seat at the top table for the Clara, Co Offaly native.A brother of former taoiseach Brian Cowen he has been spokesman in a number of portfolios since his election to the Dáil in 2011. As well as spokesman on public expenditure and reform he also held the position of spokesman on environment and local government and on social protection.A married father of four, he was first elected to Offaly county council in 1999, where he served until his election to the Dáil to the seat vacated by his brother.A member of the Cowen family has represented Offaly in the Dáil continuously since 1977. His father Bernard Cowen was elected in 1969 but lost his seat in 1973. He regained it in 1977 and held it until his death in 1984.Norma Foley, Minister for EducationKerry TD Norma Foley, who nominated her party leader Micheál Martin to be Taoiseach has been appointed Minister for Education, five months after her election to the Dáil for the first time.Martin is said to prefer TDs to have done at least a term on the backbenches but the new TD who is a teacher by profession, has shown herself to be an impressive performer and has been effective at the Covid-19 committee in the questioning of witnesses. Calm, courteous and well prepared, she has a great grasp of detail and the bigger picture.The Tralee native took the fifth and final seat in the general election in Kerry, edging out her running mate and outgoing TD John Brassil.It is her second run at the Dáil, having been on the Fianna Fáil ticket in the 2007 election, when she was selected over Brassil.Since 2004, Foley has represented the people of Tralee Municipal District on Kerry County Council, topping the poll in last May’s local elections.She has also served on Tralee Town Council, and held the position of mayor of Tralee on three occasions, most recently in 20172018. In 20182019 she served as mayor of Kerry.She is the daughter of the late Denis Foley, who served as a TD for the constituency for 18 years, broken up by a three-year stint as a senator. He was named as the holder of an undisclosed offshore Ansbacher account.She is married to fellow teacher Denis Maguire.Simon Coveney, Minister for Foreign Affairs and DefenceHe may have lost his role as tánaiste but Simon Coveney (48) has retained the much coveted position of Minister for Foreign Affairs. Greatly admired by departmental staff as probably the hardest working minister in that portfolio, he has received much acclaim for his efforts in dealing with Brexit and is seen as the driving political force in Ireland securing its temporary seat on the United Nations Security Council.Loved by the party’s grassroots and accessible to TDs and Senators, he still retains ambitions to be party leader and is seen as likely to get there. A cautious and moderate politician, his tearaway teenage years when he was expelled from Clongowes school for drinking and partying, before being asked back – are at odds with his later serious image.From Cork’s so-called merchant class and a keen rugby and sailing fan, he has a degree in agriculture and land management and was catapulted into the world of politics following the death of his father Hugh, a TD and former minister, in 1998.He later successfully ran for the European Parliament in 2004 but returned to Ireland for the 2007 general election and he has successfully retained his seat since. He served as minister for agriculture for all five years of the Enda Kenny-led administration from 2011 later adding defence to his portfolio when Eamon Gilmore resigned as tánaiste.From 2016 he spent just a year as minister for housing, when his pledge to end all emergency hotel and B\u0026ampB\u0026nbspaccommodation backfired, before he moved to the hallowed halls of the Department of Foreign Affairs.Seen as open in his approach and meticulous in his work practices, he has risen solidly and steadily through the party’s ranks and his experience in Brexit talks paved the way for his central role in the government formation talks.Paschal Donohoe, Minister for FinanceAs soon as Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe confirmed he was putting his name forward as a unity candidate for the presidency of the Eurogroup, it was clear he was confident of returning to his office in Merrion Street.Ever cautious and highly political he would have been slow to put his reputation on the line without some assurance of keeping his own job while he applied for the top spot in the influential club of finance ministers from countries that use the euro.The deadline for that role came a day before the outcome of the vote on the programme for government.He is highly popular within the party although less so after his poison chalice position as director of elections for both the Dáil and Seanad elections.The electorate proved less than happy with the party’s budgetary and spending policies and Fine Gael lost 12 Dáil seats. It was also embarrassed by the failure to have any women elected to the Upper House.Nine years a TD for Dublin Central, the 45-year-old has held the finance portfolio since 2017. He previously served as a minister of state and then as minister for transport.A central member of the party’s leadership and key to the government formation talks he is viewed as culturally one of the more rounded Cabinet members with an interest in books, film and theatre.The former sales manager with a multinational firm will need all his skills as a party persuader and negotiator to navigate the traumatic economic conditions facing the State while keeping faith with his wary Fianna Fáil and suspicious Green Party colleagues.He will be happy to leave his one stated regret – not managing to control the costs of the new national children’s hospital – to Fianna Fáil’s Michael McGrath who takes up the re-ided Department of Public Expenditure and Reform portfolio.He is married with two children and lives in Phibsborough, Dublin.Heather Humphreys, Minister for Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the IslandsOne of the Ministers always seen as sure of keeping her seat at the cabinet table, Heather Humphreys fits the criteria for geography, gender and ability.A border-county TD, she was the first woman elected to the Cavan-Monaghan constituency in 2011, when she took over from fellow Presbyterian Fine Gael colleague Seymour Crawford.Now in her third Dáil term and one of three female TDs in the five-seat constituency, she is highly regarded within Fine Gael and viewed as capable and a safe pair of hands.A first-term backbench TD when she was appointed to cabinet in 2011 as minister for arts, heritage and the Gaeltacht she won plaudits for her stewardship of the successful 1916 Rising centenary commemorations.A loyal ally of former taoiseach Enda Kenny she was re-appointed to the portfolio by him in 2016 but was one of the first Ministers to declare her support for Leo Varadkar in the 2017 leadership contest.He promoted her to the Business, Enterprise and Innovation portfolio in 2017 following the resignation of tánaiste Frances Fitzgerald.A business background through her work with Ulster Bank and as manager of Cootehill Credit Union also helped secure her appointment. The coronavirus pandemic brought her biggest political challenge with the crisis facing thousands of businesses and leaving a 25 per cent unemployment rate. Grant and income support schemes, loans and other initiatives have helped cushion the initial blow.The Government will now have to deal with the fallout from a controversial High Court judgment striking out a sectoral employment order and ruling that she had acted outside her powers in making the order for the electrical industry.Her career in finance, experience as minister for business and farming background in Co Monaghan, where she is married with two adult daughters, make her a good candidate for the rural development portfolio.Elected for the first time in the 2011 general election, she lives in Aghabog, near Monaghan town, and her family is from the Cavan-Monaghan border area.Helen McEntee, Minister for JusticeA reserved but smart politician Helen McEntee (33) from Castletown, Co Meath, has been a TD since 2013 when she won the byelection following the death of her father Shane McEntee.Minister of State for European Affairs since 2017, the Meath East TD proved her mettle in the ever present and fraught Brexit crisis, leading the Government’s response on a number of related issues.She has been described as Leo Varadkar’s “secret weapon” and is considered level-headed and a very good negotiator. Former president of the European Council Donald Tusk called her “diligent” and an “exceptional diplomat”. She is one of 10 vice-presidents of the European People’s Party, Fine Gael’s centre-right representative grouping in the EU.Graduating from DCU in 2007 having studied law, politics and economics, she worked briefly in a Citibank subsidiary. She later completed a masters in journalism and communications and worked with her father in Leinster House, first in opposition and then when he was appointed minister of state.A supporter of Varadkar’s from the start she has been by his side throughout the Brexit crisis and has a keen understanding of its intricacies and complexities.Simon Harris, Minister for Higher Education, Innovation and ScienceDespite his increased stature during the coronavirus pandemic as minister for health Simon Harris (33) became a focus of increasing speculation in recent days that he would be demoted from Cabinet.In the fateful 2017 Fine Gael leadership campaign he took sides early on in favour of Simon Coveney as opposed to Varadkar but held onto the health portfolio Kenny appointed him to in 2016.Described as the “teenage” minister when first appointed to the hugely significant but poison chalice department, he has visibly aged in the past three months through the stresses of the Covid-19 crisis.He remained a popular choice in his Wicklow constituency in the election despite concerns about a shortage of hospital beds, the spiralling cost of the new national children’s hospital and the recruitment and retention difficulties around healthcare staff.Those issues disappeared during the pandemic with the unprecedented takeover of all private hospitals and the return home of emigrant doctors and nurses to assist with the crisis.These problems have re-emerged but are no longer an issue for Harris as he moves on from the department described as a war zone.A social media expert, he is one of the party’s top media performers, assured and persuasive in his delivery, accessible and generally guaranteed to avoid political gaffes.He first became engaged in politics while campaigning for his younger brother and other children with autism. He topped the poll in the local elections and secured the highest vote in the country through his social media campaign.While a councillor, he approached then Seanad leader Frances Fitzgerald, became her parliamentary assistant and moved into Leinster House politics from there.Viewed as having an uneasy relationship with his party leader he is far from the inner circle. He is married with one child and lives in Greystones, Co Wicklow.Eamon Ryan - Minister for Climate Action, Communications Networks and TransportIt has been a torrid few months for Green Party leader Eamon Ryan (56) as he enters Government with a deeply scarred and ided party.In all the controversy the spectacular success in winning 12 seats in the general election has been all but forgotten.Now appointed to his long sought role in climate action and transport he will have little time to relish the challenge as he bids to heal the schism within the party.It is a reflection of the party’s isions that when he was mired in controversy after repeating a racial slur in the Dáil that it took a minister from another party, Charlie Flanagan of Fine Gael to publicly defend the Dublin Bay South TD by saying he did not have a racist bone in his body.But through all the accusations, insults and recriminations he has been calm, conciliatory and with party deputy leader Catherine Martin has persuaded the party’s membership to decisively back an unprecedented government with Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.He now faces a leadership contest against his deputy leader but has remained sanguine about the prospect.An impassioned speaker prone to gaffes, including a call during the election campaign for the re-introduction of wolves, he nonetheless led a team to rebuild the party after its disastrous first foray into coalition government after which it lost all six Dáil seats.A councillor before his 2007 election to the Dáil he previously ran a bicycle shop and cycling holiday business.He is married to journalist Victoria White and they have four sons.Catherine Martin - Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the GaeltachtDublin Rathdown TD and deputy Green party leader Catherine Martin (47) emerged as a surprising contender for the top job in the party.Her stance on coalition has strained the previously close working relationship with Eamon Ryan but his move to appoint her as lead negotiator in the coalition talks was seen as an inspired move.Cautious by nature, she is said to seek advice widely and does not say things lightly. Some in her party are said to find it hard to gauge where she stands and those on the other side of the negotiating table have described her as an enigma.As an influential voice in the party she will have a significant role in attempting to heal the party’s schism.From her first days in the Dáil she forged good relations across all parties and founded the Irish Women’s Parliamentary Caucus in the Oireachtas, pressed for anti-bullying protocols in the Leinster House campus.From Carrickmacross, Co Monaghan she trained as a classical singer and after graduating from NUI Maynooth, she taught music and English at St Tiernan’s Community School in Ballinteer.Her initial foray into politics was when she was co-opted to her brother Vincent P Martin’s council seat in Monaghan in the 1990s. She returned to politics in Dublin, was elected as a councillor in 2014 and came from nowhere to win a Dáil seat in 2016.Her husband Francis Noel Duffy became a TD in 2020 and took an opposing view in rejecting the coalition deal. The couple has three children.Roderic O’Gorman - Minister for Children, Disability, Equality and IntegrationLong predicted to make the high table Roderic O’Gorman (38) is one of the Green party’s most experienced politicians. His victory in the 2020 general election marked his 10th foray in 15 years including four general elections, two byelections and four local elections. The party’s justice and equality spokesman he was on the negotiating team and insisted in the talks that the coalition must make a commitment to end direct provision.A former chairman of the party he served from 2011 to 2019.From Tyrellstown he lives with his partner Ray Healy in Blanchardstown. A lecturer at the Brexit Institute and School of Law and Government in DCU he is a graduate of Trinity College and the London School of Economics.Close to both party leader Ryan and deputy leader Martin he is courteous, considered and reflective in his deliberations and well regarded across the party. He is a fan of TV shows West Wing, Game of Thrones and Arrested Development.Hildegarde Naughton - Minister of State at the Department of Climate Action, she will be attending CabinetOne of the survivors of the electoral cull of Fine Gael TDs, Hildegarde Naughton (43) has consistently grown in experience and stature since she first arrived on the political stage in 2009.That was the year the former schoolteacher was first elected to Galway City Council, becoming mayor two years later. Mentored and promoted by then taoiseach Enda Kenny, the Galway West TD was appointed to the Seanad in 2013.In 2016 she seized the chance to get on the Fine Gael ticket in the general election after Barry Walsh stepped aside from politics on health grounds.Chair of the Oireachtas Committee for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment in the last Dáil she fought the green fight in an uphill and forthright battle to persuade many reluctant party colleagues to the cause and has been Fine Gael’s leading environmentalist.That role, that experience and her capability has brought her to the Cabinet table - along with the need to have some gender balance at cabinet and take account of geographical considerations.Outside politics she is a talented singer who has performed and won awards for her roles in musical theatre. While a senator she established a group called Bel Canto with two other sopranos, who sang at charity events. She has described her musical interest as “my golf”.Pippa Hackett, “Super Junior” Minister of StateGreen Party Senator Pippa Hackett’s appointment as a “Super Junior” Minister of State is the first appointment of a Senator to Cabinet since the early 1980s.She takes on the role of Minister of State for Agriculture with responsibility for land use and bioersity.Her appointment has taken some by surprise amid speculation that someone among the party’s TDs might be selected.A farmer from Offaly and the party’s agriculture spokeswoman, she was elected to the Seanad in a byelection in November when a vacancy arose following the election of then Senator Grace O’Sullivan to the European parliament.But the move is as much a surprise because it is virtually unprecedented.The last time a Senator took on a ministerial role was in 1981 when then taoiseach Garrett FitzGerald nominated Senator James Dooge as minister for foreign affairs, a portfolio he held for a year.A vocal supporter of the programme for government, Hackett was elected unopposed to the agricultural panel in the Seanad when the other parties opted not to contest the seat.Formerly an Offaly county councillor she lost out in the general election for the Laois-Offaly constituency when she was eliminated in the final round.Originally from Ballandine, Co Mayo she is married with four children and lives in Edenderry, Co Offaly.Dara Calleary - Chief whipNew Government chief whip Dara Calleary has Fianna Fáil in his DNA. The Mayo TD who has been in the Dáil since 2007 and is the son of late TD and former minister of state Sean Calleary who served in the Dáil from 1973 to 1992. His grandfather Phelim was TD for Mayo from 1952 to 1969.Affable and steady, popular with party colleagues he is deputy leader and viewed as a safe pair of hands.He has had a previous taste of government when he served as minister of state for labour affairs and public service transformation from 2009 to 2011 in the Fianna Fáil, Green Party coalition.A graduate of Trinity College with a degree in business and politics he has served as the party’s spokesman on justice, equality and defence, as well as spokesman on jobs, enterprise and innovation.Paul Gallagher SC, Attorney GeneralThis will be Paul Gallagher’s second time in the job, having previously served from 2007 to 2011. During his first term, he was called to offer legal advice on some of the biggest issues ever to face an Irish government, including the bank guarantee scheme, the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency and the International Monetary Fund Troika programme.He is regarded as one of Ireland’s top barristers, with a fearsome work ethic."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"At least nine charged under Chinese law that critics say strips Hong Kong of rights and freedomsLaw will punish crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusionHot and bothered commuters refuse to wear masks on public transportTesting blitz as recent jump in infections in Australia stokes fears of second waveHistoric move will allow authorities to crack down on subversive and secessionist activityRisks of viruses crossing species barrier into humans in densely populated regions highlightedWashington plans to target Chinese officials undermining Asian financial hub autonomyJustin Trudeau called on Beijing to cease the \u0026lsquoarbitrary detention\u0026rsquo of two CanadiansMany were struck as they were planting seeds across Bihar state in east of countryThe decades-long project sees a constellation of 35 satellites circling the Earth to rival the US-owned Global Positioning System (GPS)Regime rows back on threat to deploy troops near border amid rising tensionsOfficials prepare \u0026lsquoretaliatory punishment\u0026rsquo after anti-North balloons arrived from SouthBan on cruise ships extended beyond June 30th cases increase as more citizens return homeCovid-19 outbreak in staff at Tyson foods in Arkansas sparks Beijing U-turn on policyChina says draft law is aimed at separatist activity, subversion, terrorism and collusion abroadSamira Imin\u0026rsquos father was incarcerated for three years in XinjiangChina may have shut down its controversial re-education camps, but minorities are still persecutedDelhi says Chinese dammed a river and lay in wait for clash in which 20 Indians diedCases widely seen as Chinese \u0026lsquohostage diplomacy\u0026rsquo following arrest of Huawei\u0026rsquos chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou in VancouverInvestigators say they have found gun and are talking to two \u0026lsquopeople of interest\u0026rsquoStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4293803.1593630335!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"angela merkel s chance to shape her legacy and secure the eu s future","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGerman chancellor Angela Merkel addressing the Bundestag on Wednesday. Photograph: Krisztian BocsiBloombergGermany has this week assumed the presidency of the Council of the European Union, and the timing could hardly be more crucial.The role, which rotates between EU member states every six months, means chancellor Angela Merkel will be chairing meetings of the national leaders as they confront the coronavirus pandemic and its profound economic fallout.It’s a debate that could shape the future of the union, and Merkel will be steering it in what is expected to be the final year of her time as German chancellor, a position she has held since 2005. The next six months could be the making of her European legacy, and for Berlin, nothing less than the union itself is at stake.“The prime objective we see in our presidency, so the most important, is to keep this European Union together,” a senior German diplomat said.This sentiment is crucial to understanding a move by Germany that almost no one saw coming.SurpriseIn May, Merkel held a surprise press conference with French president Emmanuel Macron. The two leaders announced their joint support for a proposal to counter the economic damage of the pandemic. It involved a package of €500 million in grants to the countries hit hardest. And it would be funded by borrowing by the EU’s executive, the European Commission. Unlike the loans of the austerity years, these grants would not need to be paid back by the member states that receive them. To many economists, the kind of borrowing that would fund this – which would be jointly guaranteed by the whole bloc, unlike national debt – is a step towards fiscal integration that would help fix a structural flaw in the euro. It was a remarkable shift for a German leader to make, breaking with years of policy that made Berlin the bloc’s most powerful bastion of fiscal conservatism.Why did Merkel move? To defend the EU.“This €500 million in grants is something that you probably would not have expected the German side to do. But we did, because we are quite concerned that otherwise this corona crisis and its impact on our economy and our societies might lead to cracks in the European Union, that we would come out very differently out of this crisis,” the senior German diplomat explained. “That is why we decided to do something that we wouldn’t have done before.”A detailed plan incorporating this Franco-German proposal has been drawn up by the commission and put to member states, who must now come to an agreement on it, as well as the bloc’s seven-year budget.Countries have various objections, about size, tweaks, and which countries get the most generous slice. But the main opposition to the deal being done are the so-called Frugal Four of Austria, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands, who oppose joint debt and grants with no strings attached.Berlin used to be on their side. Now, as the country that will make the largest single national contribution both to the budget and to the recovery fund, and as their former ally, Germany could hardly be a more powerful advocate for persuading them to compromise.Berlin’s ambition is to achieve this by July 17th18th, when the\u0026nbsp27 national leaders are due to meet to discuss it.A lesson lies in this tale for Britain.There are many issues that Germany would rather dedicate its presidency to than Brexit. A common EU agreement on migration, a European Green Deal to transform the bloc to become carbon neutral by 2050, mass digitalisation, to name just a few.Last opportunityBut this month London has forced such topics on to the backburner by refusing to take its last opportunity to extend the transition period and buy more time to negotiate the post-Brexit relationship that will come into force on January 1st.Both sides say little progress has been made so far: negotiators have repeated their positions to each other, but no one has moved.As Merkel took questions in the German parliament on the first day of Germany’s EU presidency, she had a warning to give. “Progress in talks is, to put it cautiously, very limited,” she told the Bundestag. The EU “must be prepared... for the possibility that a deal doesn’t materialise”.The British government should read in Merkel’s big economic shift the depth of her commitment to the EU. She set aside narrower national policy priorities when she felt it was necessary to defend the bloc.ComplainedEU negotiators have repeatedly complained that London is seeking terms that would give Britain member state privileges without the obligations, and British companies an advantage over EU firms. These are things that are simply against the EU’s interest, and that it therefore cannot grant.Germany’s message is that it is time for London to move.“Is it possible to get a deal? I think so,” the diplomat said. “But this also needs the UK to take a more realistic approach, or let’s say less ideological and more pragmatic. Then we can get it done.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4292677.1593537762!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland left out as eu opens borders to 15 states including australia canada and japan","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA passenger iat El Part de Llobregat airport in Barcelona. Photograph: Ale Jandro GarciaEPAEuropean Union member states approved a list of 15 countries around the world that are deemed safe for travel, agreeing that member states should open their border to them for all travel from Wednesday.Unusually among EU member states, Ireland is not part of the agreement because it is not in the Schengen area of free travel and has a Common Travel Area with the United Kingdom. Ireland was invited to take part in the joint agreement, but could only do so if Britain also agreed due to the open border, and it opted not to do so, The  understands. Denmark is also opting out.The countries deemed safe are: Algeria, Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, Serbia, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia, and Uruguay. China is also to be included, as long as Beijing agrees that EU citizens will also be allowed to travel there in turn.To qualify countries needed to have coronavirus infections that were close to or below the EU average, and to open their borders to EU citizens in turn, but political considerations also came into play.\u0026nbspAgreement on the list of countries was repeatedly delayed as countries struggled to forge consensus, with isions between countries with large tourism industries which pushed for greater opening and those which were more cautious.The United States was not included due to pervasive level of coronavirus infections there.The list is expected to be reviewed every two weeks, and countries could be removed from the safe list if their epidemiological situation changes.To take part, Ireland would need to close off travel to all states but those on the “safe” list. The agreement notes that it “also includes Ireland and the United Kingdom if they decide to align”.While the Schengen countries opted to jointly close their borders to travel from outside the EU on March 17th, Ireland went its own way, maintaining open borders while requiring arrivals to quarantine for two weeks.Due to the quarantine, which also applies to arrivals in Ireland from EU member states, several countries in the EU including Germany, France, the Netherlands and Denmark advise their citizens against non-essential travel to Ireland.“Ireland meets the criteria for low infection rates in the new travel guide model, but we still advise against any unnecessary travel to Ireland because there is a 14 day home quarantine for people traveling to Ireland from abroad,” the advice to citizens on Denmark’s foreign affairs ministry reads.Asked whether it was a concern that some EU countries could have greater ease of travel with the 15 global countries than with Ireland, the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said the situation would be subject to review.“In accordance with government policy, which is based on official public health advice, the Department of Foreign Affairs continues to advise against all non-essential travel overseas. This includes Great Britain but does not apply to Northern Ireland,” a foreign affairs spokesman said.“This advice is subject to review and as per recent statements the Government is giving consideration to a possible roadmap for the resumption of international travel.”.Under the agreement, people travelling for essential reasons are allowed to travel regardless of which country they are arriving from. Essential workers include healthcare workers, seasonal agriculture workers, transport personnel, diplomats, people travelling for urgent family reasons, refugees, incoming international students, and highly skilled workers. Countries taking part in the agreement are free to impose additional precautions on these travellers, such as requiring them to quarantine.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"\u0026lsquoDefender of Israel\u0026rsquo Boris Johnson says move would be \u0026lsquoviolation of international law\u0026rsquoPlan to annex parts of West Bank condemned by UN commissioner as \u0026lsquodisastrous\u0026rsquoSome 9.3m Syrians are now food insecure, an increase of 1.4m in past six monthsSeparatist insurgents from Balochistan province claim responsibility for attackNo group claimed responsibility for the attack and Taliban has denied involvementThousands of children could die from preventable diseases because of dire state of healthcare, UN warnsArab world unites in opposition and warns of dire consequences if annexation proceedsOnly under-65s can take part and pilgrims will be quarantined before and after pilgrimageWorld community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideBritish-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Police and security force officers killed in roadside bomb and gun battleHealth authorities confirm more than 3,000 new cases on two consecutive daysOpponents warn that US-backed plan would lead to independent Palestinian stateWar and coronavirus-ravaged country to get $1.35bn from UN and Saudi ArabiaStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4293870.1593633999!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"leicester lockdown could be just the start if tracing system not improved labour","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t People wearing  face masks in the North Evington area of Leicester as a new lockdown due to coronavirus was imposed this week. Photograph: Neil HallEPALabour has called for urgent government action to ensure that local lockdowns are robust following complaints that officials in London failed to share full data about coronavirus infections with local authorities. Leicester this week became the first city in England to go back into lockdown after a spike in infections, with people advised against all non-essential travel in or out of the city.“The government made local lockdowns a key component of the exit strategy but yet again they were too slow to involve local authorities, just like they were too slow to enforce the lockdown nationally,” Labour’s shadow communities and local government secretary Steve Reed said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“The lack of a functioning test, track and trace system, coupled with their failure to give councils the power to take action quickly, could lead to local outbreaks becoming deadly national ones.\u0026nbspThe government must not waste any more time, we are facing the risk of a deadly second wave of infections and a second national lockdown – fatal for both lives and livelihoods across the country.”Leicester’s mayor Peter Soulsby criticised the government for delays in sharing detailed data about infections, but Boris Johnson said on Wednesday that all information about testing was now being shared with local councils. He denied the government had been caught off guard by events in Leicester.“The government first took notice and acted on what was going on in Leicester on June 8th, because we could see that there was an issue there. We sent mobile testing units – four more mobile testing units – shortly thereafter,” the prime minister told MPs. “We engaged actively with the authorities in Leicester, with public health in Leicester and with everybody responsible in Leicester in the way that we have done with other areas that have had similar issues. Unfortunately, in Leicester, it did not prove possible to get the results that we have seen elsewhere, so on Monday we took the decision ... to go into lockdown in Leicester.” ‘Massive problems’Labour leader Keir Starmer said there were “massive problems” with Britain’s testing and tracing system, with three out of four of those infected with coronavirus not being contacted by the system. He warned that Leicester could be the first of a succession of local lockdowns if the system was not improved.Speaking to the Local Government Association, Sir Keir said local councils needed extra powers to deal with local lockdowns and warned of a £10 billion (€11.09 billion) shortfall in their finances because of coronavirus.“If you need to close down a particular area at the moment, I don’t think local authorities have got the necessary powers to do it. What we can’t have is a situation where statutory instruments or other bits of legislation have to be passed in a hurry in response to each outbreak. There is a huge amount of work to do there,” he said.“Councils are faced with much higher costs for key services such as social care, and much lower revenues through falls in areas such as business rates. It could mean further cuts to social care, fewer police officers. It could mean street lights going on later and going off earlier. It could mean libraries, gyms and community centres staying closed.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates.

I’m not saying he’s losing his touch – at least not on record – but Boris Johnson’s in-house iconoclast, brought in to disrupt, destroy and rebuild the very heart of the sclerotic establishment, has decided the best way to do this is with a (whisper it) corporate awayday. Cringe. There we were thinking he was a pound-shop Elon Musk. Turns out he’s a bona fide David Brent.“All aboard! Everybody been to the loo? Remember you will never work in a place like this again. Fact. It’s brilliant. Fact. And you’ll never have another boss like me, someone who’s basically a chilled-out entertainer.”On the face of it, the notion of a charabanc of weirdos and misfits – sorry, I mean special advisers – heading for Barnard Castle like scouts gone rogue is quite compelling.Cummings will, of course, be sprawled proprietorially across the back seat. Why? Because angry game theorists with a side hustle in technological transformation are the new cool kids, daddio.Or maybe these hand-picked members of the New Cognitive Elite will all be travelling separately, like the Royal family, just in case some absolute madman testing his eyesight starts weaving his wife and child across the County Durham highway?Either way, on arrival there will presumably be plenty of opportunity not to mingle (that’s a key selling-point of the weird and misfitting) before they are turfed, shoeless, into the wilderness, with orders only to return once they have fully actualised their own inexistence, caught and skinned a rabbit with their teeth and finished Big Bad Dom’s extensive reading list.This includes Superforecasting by Philip Tetlock, a hefty 350-pager on how historical patterns can be used to accurately predict the future. Who knew that history repeats itself? Apart from every historian who ever lived and Karl Marx. Groucho, too.There’s also High Output Management, written by Andrew Grove, author of Only the Paranoid Survive, which sounds a lot more useful given that Dom will probably be taking potshots at them all as they run about his father’s forested estate like headless Spads, crying and trying to predict what terrible indignity will befall them next, and from which direction.Cummings’s modus operandi resides in wildly espousing originality for originality’s sake at the expense of logic for everyone’s sake. He also takes impish pleasure in confounding and confusing the grown-ups.This is odd because, in reality, he’s a balding 48-year-old father and could, if he lost the snarl, easily pass for one himself. It is also odd because any fule kno that reading the same books churns out the same narrow mindset.A smarter operator would set a random selection of unique works – say, a medieval vade mecum, a biography of Burke (Kathy, not Edmund), the collected works of AA Milne and that new lockdown cookbook from Nigella. Now that would result in a genuinely innovative brainstorm.But Cummings isn’t really interested in free thinkers any more than David Brent, who famously observed: “Remember that age and treachery will always triumph over youth and ability.”Boris’s right-hand apparatchik claims to be a visionary. But, in truth, any man who thinks the answer (to any question) lies in an awayday is not quite the radical nonconformist he fancies himself to be.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ministers must end muddle help us bring back children safely","story":"Anyone of a certain vintage will, like me, recall the old-fashioned schoolyard game of “follow the leader”.The game relied upon children (and occasionally teachers) lining up behind the chosen leader and then following and mimicking all their moves and actions, no matter how absurd, until being told to stop.Invariably, the best “leaders” showed certainty, clarity and a dash of charisma to ensure compliance.What is true of that playground game is true in Whitehall, too.During times of exceptional challenge for everyone, including our Government, an ability to make good decisions and follow instructions has been vitally important.Head teachers like myself, for example, have had to adapt and implement vast swathes of Government guidance relating to the opening of schools.First, for the children of key workers and disadvantaged families and, more recently, for a variety of year groups in primary and secondary settings.On the whole, schools, including our amazing special schools, have done a good job, especially as the guidance provided has often been flawed, opaque, counter-intuitive and sometimes all three.Personal protection equipment, for instance, is said to be vital on public transport but not in our schools, while social distancing is viewed as imperative for everyone unless you happen to walk through our school gates.Still, head teachers and our rather confused colleagues have kept things moving and provided reassurance and support to hard-pressed parents and their children.We have not got everything right, but confidence in our communities has been maintained and teachers and support staff are proud of their efforts.Now though, the stakes are much, much higher.Despite this significant work and intervention, ranging from online teaching to day to day pastoral care, all the evidence suggests children have fallen behind with their studies and many are not as safe as they must be.At a time, therefore, when provision by schools has never been more important, leadership from the centre, to enable head teachers to fulfil our obligations and duties effectively, has never mattered more.Sadly, high quality leadership from the Department for Education – or is it No 10? – has been in short supply.U-turns on wholesale primary school opening and provision of free school meals over the summer holidays have undermined confidence and credibility.Crucially too, inconsistent and muddled guidance from the DfE keeps filling our inboxes only to be revised a day or two later.Considerable time and energy has been expended in schools to no positive effect.On Tuesday, head teachers were being told not to worry about transmission and infection rates in schools, just as lockdown began in Leicester and schools there were ordered to shut due to a spike in local cases.So, as we all await directions from the Government about opening schools to all children in September, head teachers are simply asking for guidance that is consistent, science-based and workable.Then head teachers and our staff must be allowed to get on and get every child back into school as quickly and safely as possible.Just as many of us used to “follow the leader” who inspired the most confidence, head teachers need to be trusted to do the right thing, right now.We in turn also require some excellent, sure-footed leadership from our Government. Contradiction and confusion have ruled to date now our political masters must deliver with skill and certainty.Jules White is the head teacher at Tandridge House School and the founder of the national funding campaign Worth Less?More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"mps urge caution plans legalise e scooters get people public","story":"E-scooters should be limited to the same speed as milk floats and be fitted with bells to warn pedestrians, MPs have said ahead of legal trials starting next week.The devices, which are due to have a speed limit of 15.5mph when the public start using them legally in test areas, should be barred from travelling over 10mph, ministers were urged.Appearing before the Transport select committee on Wednesday, the chair of Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) said she was ‘shocked’ by how high the speed limit had been set and warned the charity viewed e-scooters as a \u0027real and genuine threat to blind people\u0027.MPs questioned why e-scooters would be allowed to be driven at 15.5mph, describing the figure as ‘arbitrary’.Lincoln MP, Karl McCartney, said today: “I am of an age where I can remember electric milk floats and they certainly didn’t travel at that speed - not even Ernie\u0027s, The Fastest Milkman in the West. So why are e-scooters going to be going at 15mph when probably less than 10mph would seem more safe?” His comments were backed by RNIB chair, Eleanor Southwood, who said the charity had wanted the speed limit to be as close to walking speed as possible.“We do consider e-scooters to be a real and genuine threat to the ability of blind people to move around independently and safely,” she said.Ms Southwood called for the devices to have ‘geofencing’ software installed that would block them from getting onto pavements.E-scooters are currently illegal to ride on public roads and pavements in the UK, however as many as 200,000 are estimated to have been bought so far.Experts have warned that their popularity is set to grow as people are being urged to avoid public transport due to the coronavirus pandemic.As a result, ministers announced earlier this year that they were bringing forward trials to see how e-scooters can be safely introduced on UK roads and streets.From next week, people will be able to ride e-scooters in public legally for the first time in designated test areas, starting in Teesside. Under the Government’s scheme people are allowed to ride approved hire e-scooters, but not privately owned ones, on roads, bike lanes and cycle tracks - although not on pavements.The Department for Transport has set the speed limit on the gadgets at 15.5mph and said riders will have to be at least 16 and hold a provision driver’s licence.Riders are advised to wear a helmet, but it will not be mandatory, along the same lines as cycling.The AA also backed suggestions from MPs that e-scooters should have bells or buzzers on them to warn people of their approach.Lorna Lee, Campaigns Manager for the AA, told the committee: “Some kind of audible device on them would be something we would support.”Meanwhile, the committee was also warned that e-scooters could make young people more unfit as the majority of journeys the devices are being used for replaced walks or bike rides.Rachel Lee, policy and research manager of the walking charity Living Streets, said: “I don’t think it (riding e-scooters) has any benefits in terms of being active and in some ways it could be a disbenefit.”Phillip Darnton OBE, Chairman of the Bicycle Association, which represents some e-scooter sellers, warned MPs that it would be “very difficult” to stop people riding the gadgets on the pavement.He added: “My much greater concern is that people will use e-scooters, frighten themselves on them, and actually ride them on the pavement and it be very difficult to stop. “It’s not clear at all what offences are now going to be applicable to riders and users of these scooters.”Mr Darnton, also said that the current generation of e-scooters were not  eco-friendly as they were difficult to fix if things went wrong, meaning the average hire scooter lasted around 12 weeks before being thrown away.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"premier league should have thought twice getting bed black lives","story":"The problem with virtue signalling is that, at best, you’re appeasing a vocal minority and at worst you’re alienating the silent majority. I’m certain most Brits are already against racism, making the moral grandstanding we’ve seen from organisations such as the Premier League over the past few weeks utterly pointless and, as it turns out, rather counter-productive.Quick to jump on the Black Lives Matter bandwagon, the Premier League supported footballers getting involved by taking the knee and wearing BLM slogans on the back of their shirts. Had they taken some time to research the Black Lives Matter movement upfront, considered the people behind the campaign and the message they’re trying to portray, perhaps they wouldn’t have been so hasty.At last, some of the prominent people who leapt to back the movement in this country have woken up to the fact that Black Lives Matter UK is an anti-capitalist, anti-democratic organisation – just as many of us have been warning for weeks. The signs were there in the disturbing manifesto published on their website for all to see.Its abhorrent views were further highlighted this week when the BLM UK team published unmistakably anti-Semitic messages online. On their Twitter account, they posted: “As Israel moves forward with the annexation of the West Bank, and mainstream British politics is gagged of the right to critique Zionism, and Israel’s settler colonial pursuits, we loudly and clearly stand beside our Palestinian comrades. FREE PALESTINE.” A message taken straight out of the Corbynite handbook of anti-Semitic tropes. If it walks like Momentum and talks like Momentum…Who exactly is “gagging” anyone’s “right to critique Zionism”? Not only did BLM UK refuse to recant or apologise for the statement, they doubled down with a timeline full of anti-Israel, anti-Zionist tweets. Zionism is not racism, fascism or colonialism, nor is it about endorsing the policies of every Israeli government. Zionism is the movement for the self-determination of the Jewish people around the world, and their yearning for a safe homeland, against the backdrop of persecution and genocide. Regardless, what does any of this have to do with black lives mattering in the United Kingdom?The former Southampton player and now Sky Sports pundit Matt Le Tissier was one of the first to question the organisation, saying he would “review” whether or not to wear BLM badge on television. Stronger condemnation came from former Wolverhampton Wanderers captain Karl Henry, who tweeted: “I think the majority of the UK have now had enough of that organisation… Black people’s lives matter! The isive #BlackLivesMatter organisation, however, DOES NOT.” Sir Keir Starmer is another who was quick to subjugate himself by taking a knee for Black Lives Matter, only to say later that its desire to defund the police was nonsense. As organisations begin to wake up to the foul, racist and un-British undertones of the BLM movement, I suspect we’ll see many more begin to distance themselves. We all agree racism has no place in British sport. There are some fantastic movements around, including Show Racism the Red Card, or Kick It Out, with whom I did some work when I first moved to London fifteen years ago. These are mature organisations with respectable goals. There was no need for the Premier League to get into bed with BLM.Let’s hope the Premier League and other equally silly organisations learn from this mess. Do your research. Don’t fall foul of social-media peer pressure to back a political campaign, especially one that’s quite openly calling for capitalism to be smashed. Black Lives Matter defiles British values and should be ignored and disregarded as the opportunistic and extremist Marxist organisation it is.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed areas could face local coronavirus lockdowns within","story":"The new PHE figures show Barnsley has the third highest rate per 100,000 population with 54.7 cases, followed by Rochdale (53.6) and Bedford (42). Former Government scientific adviser Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College London, said these places were clearly of concern.  Search for your area in the table below to see the difference between previously published case counts and revisions including Pillar 2 dataAs it is, we\u0027re having to spread our resources over a wide area rather than targeting them effectively.

Such a move should be made in exceptional circumstances, following discussions with parents, and the full curriculum should be restored no later than the summer term.Pupils in their first year of secondary school may need to be re-taught the Year Six syllabus for English and maths, and GCSE pupils may be asked to drop subjects so they can concentrate on getting good grades in English and maths.Pupils should be assessed regularly through quizzes and close scrutiny of their work to make sure they are not falling behind. The guidance stresses that, as an overriding approach, schools should teach a broad and ambitious curriculum which includes a wide range of subjects.Social distancing will not be applied in schools at all times, and pupils will instead be grouped into bubbles to limit the risk of transmission between class or year groups.The bubbles will either be a class or an entire year group who have their lessons, breaks and lunchtime together. In primary school, class bubbles will be the norm, whereas in secondary school bubbles will be expanded to include entire year groups.This approach means that, if a pupil tests positive for coronavirus, it is easier for a school to identify which of their classmates also need to self-isolate.Older children should be encouraged to keep their distance from their peers where they can, but the guidance recognises that this is not possible for younger pupils.Teachers should stay at the front of the class and avoid close face-to-face contact within one metre of pupils.Schools should adapt classrooms to give pupils as much space as possible, such as removing unnecessary furniture.Windows should be kept open where possible, and desks should be set out with pupils sitting side by side, facing the front of the class, rather than sitting face-to-face with their peers.Year groups should be kept apart, meaning that assemblies or any other large gatherings, such as communal prayer, are banned.School choirs and ensembles are also banned, as the guidance warns that there is an additional risk of infection where pupils are singing, chanting, playing wind or brass instruments or shouting. These activities could take place with special controls in place, such as limiting group sizes to 15 pupils and ensuring they stand back-to-back or side-to-side. It should be outdoors where possible, with extended social distancing.Schools should conduct sports lessons outside where possible, and if this is not possible then a large indoor space should be used. Children should do sports lessons within their bubbles, and equipment must be thoroughly cleaned after being used by each year group.Schools should stagger break times and lunchtimes where they can, to make sure that each bubble of students stays apart from other bubbles as much as possible. Outdoor playground equipment should be cleaned more often.School kitchens should be fully open from the start of term, but must comply with the Government\u0027s Covid-19 guidance for food businesses. Dining room surfaces should be cleaned between use by different bubbles. All the normal legal requirements will apply for schools to provide lunch for those who want it, as well as those eligible for free school meals.Schools should stagger the start and end of the day to alleviate congestion and to prevent different year groups or classes from mixing with one another.The school day does not need to be extended to accommodate this, but break times or free periods could be moved around to make it work. The start and end of a school day should not coincide with rush hour, and parents must be told not to congregate at the gate or come on to the premises unless they have an appointment.Schools need to make it clear to pupils and staff that any face masks they wore while travelling to school must be removed on arrival.Schools should update their behaviour policies to include sanctions for breaching the new hygiene or bubble regimes, and the new rules must be clearly explained to pupils and their parents.Teachers are told to prepare for an increase in bad behaviour among children who may have suffered from adversity, trauma and a lack of routine during lockdown.Pupils may struggle to re-engage with learning, and teachers will need to work hard to reintegrate them into school life. Schools can discipline unruly children, but should only expel them as a last resort.The guidance reminds teachers that off-rolling is never acceptable and that parents should not be pressured into home-schooling their child.Pupils should walk or cycle to school where possible and avoid using public transport, particularly at peak times such as rush hour.Schools could set up walking buses, where a teacher accompanies a group of children walking to or from school. Where pupils do need to use public transport to get to school, local councils will be asked to prioritise taking them on buses.Where pupils are using dedicated school transport, they do not need to socially distance from one another, but pupils should remain in their bubbles where they can. If they are mixing with other bubbles, they should wear face masks. Children should use hand sanitiser when getting on and off a school bus, while vehicles should be regularly cleaned.Children and staff should wash their hands immediately when they arrive at school, as well as regularly throughout the day.The mantra of catch it, bin it, kill it should be drilled into all pupils, meaning anyone who coughs or sneezes should use a disposable tissue and then throw it away. Schools need to make sure there are enough tissues and bins in the school for pupils to follow this directive.Frequently-touched surfaces should be cleaned using detergents and bleach, and the whole school premises should be regularly cleaned.Face masks are generally not necessary in schools as they inhibit communication, and personal protective equipment (PPE) is only necessary if a child develops coronavirus symptoms while at school and a teacher is unable to stay two metres away while waiting for them to be picked up by their parents.Teachers have been told to make sure that remote learning is fully integrated into their lesson plans since it may need to be an essential component of children\u0027s learning if there is a local lockdown and a school is closed down.Schools must have contingency plans in place for remote learning by the end of September at the latest. This should include high quality online resources for children and teaching videos, as well as printed worksheets and textbooks for those who do not have computers.Children who are leaning at home must be set meaningful and ambitious work in different subjects every day, and this must be equivalent in standard to what they would have learnt during a normal school day.Remote learning plans should also be in place for any students who are self-isolating, as well as pupils who are shielding.Read more: Home-schooling tips and secrets for parentsAll league tables are suspended for the next academic year. GCSEs and A-levels will take place in summer 2021, but with some adaptations, including those which will free up teaching time.The exam regulator, Ofqual, will publish detailed proposals on this in the coming weeks. Schools will also be expected to put on a full series of GCSE and A-level exams this autumn for pupils wishing to appeal against the predicted grades they are given this summer.  All statutory tests, including the phonics screening check, Year Four times tables tests and Year Six Sats, will take place next academic year as normal.If a school has two or more confirmed cases of coronavirus within two weeks, or an overall rise in sickness or absence where coronavirus is suspected as a cause, this will be seen as a possible outbreak. In such a case, the school must liaise with their local health protection team who will advise on whether further action is needed.The health protection team may recommend that a number of other pupils stay at home and self-isolate as a precaution. This could include an entire year group or even all pupils in the whole school.School closures will not generally be necessary and should not be implemented unless on the advice of health experts. If an outbreak in a school is declared, a mobile testing unit may be sent to the school so that any pupils or staff can be tested. Testing will initially focus on the ill pupil\u0027s class, followed by their year group and, if necessary, the entire school.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"schools face closure just two pupils get covid new guidelines","story":"Mr Hancock said extra testing carried out to contain a surge in virus cases revealed that a large number of children had become infected.The draft Government guidance says teachers must step up the quality of their remote learning provision because this may end up as an essential component of children\u0027s learning if there is a local lockdown and schools are forced to close.Downing Street has faced criticism over the failure to reopen schools ahead of shops, cinemas, theme parks and zoos.Ministers have come under fire over their handling of reopening schools, having rowed back on plans to get all primary school pupils back to the classroom before summer, then later said they would encourage this after all.It adds that schools should take robust measures to re-engage parents whose children were persistently absent prior to the pandemic or have fallen behind.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"significant number people may have natural immunity coronavirus","story":"Professor Sarah Gilbert, of the vaccine team, said: It\u0027s possible that we are underestimating natural or already acquired immunity to this virus, and we really need to keep an eye on it.A recent study suggested children may be protected from coronavirus because they catch so many colds. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/06/24/16/coronavirus-lockdown-internet-use.jpg","title":"coronavirus internet use uk lockdown facebook google","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.\u0027Lockdown\u0026nbspmay leave a lasting digital legacy,\u0027 says Ofcom\u0027s director of strategy and researchPeople in the UK have been spending record amounts of time on the internet during the coronavirus lockdown, new data has revealed.In April 2020, UK adults spent longer than four hours online each day – more than a quarter of their waking life.It marks an increase of more than half an hour since January and means people now spend substantially more time online than watching television or listening to the radio.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe figures were revealed in Ofcom’s Online Nation report, which detailed the habits and trends of internet users between November 2019 and April 2020.People aged 18 to 24 were the most heavy users, clocking an average of more than five hours spent online per day.A large portion of the study focussed on internet habits in 2019, which revealed that technology giants now control an even greater share of internet traffic.The research by the regulator showed that more than a third of time spent online was spent on sites owned by either Facebook or Google.The shift towards platforms like Facebook-owned WhatsApp and Messenger appears to have been accelerated during lockdown, with nearly half of all adults using the messaging apps to make video calls at least once a week.Data shows Trump is wrong about US doing more Covid-19 testingOfcom\u0027s research found that the use of video calling services doubled to 70 per cent of the population during the lockdown, as people sought new ways to stay in touch.One of the biggest benefiters from this trend has been the app Zoom, which saw a huge surge in new users at the start of the lockdown.Lockdown may leave a lasting digital legacy, said Yij-Choung Teh, Ofcom\u0027s director of strategy and research.Coronavirus has radically changed the way we live, work and communicate online, with millions of people using online video services for the first time.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A volunteer workforce of expert scientists, technicians and students were drafted in to help get the Lighthouse Laboratories up and running at the beginning of the UK lockdown. As the first tranche of staff arrived on site in Milton Keynes, the challenge became clear.“The simple fact is the Milton Keynes site wasn’t a lab at all,” said one insider. “Most of the equipment we were using was donated and it all had to be set up quickly. All the tests failed in the beginning.”Another added: “They spent the whole first week getting the process up and running and validating the tests with a hospital checking the work. It would have undoubtedly been a faster response mobilising existing labs.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOne said: “It was 200 unpaid people who knocked out the first 300,000 tests and essentially winging it in a very controlled and sensible way but when you talk about preparedness, that doesn’t strike me as being very prepared.”This article was funded by our supporters. If you would like to see more of this important work, please make a contributionSpeaking to The Independent as part of our investigation into the UK’s private coronavirus labs, funded by our Supporter Programme, staff questioned the initial set-up of the three labs, which were opened as part of a centralised push to increase coronavirus testing. Accountancy giant Deloitte managed the operations. The first lab, in Milton Keynes, was opened on 9 April, followed by Alderley Park in Cheshire on 20 April and a third lab in Glasgow a few days later.At the Alderley Park base, nestled on a business park in Cheshire, the feeling was the same: “It was just an office space to begin with, which had to be completely refitted. They started from nothing really.”Local health officials say they’ve been left in the dark on Covid-19How German coronavirus testing stormed ahead of the UK’s modelThe labs received test samples with barcodes, but no other information, then were required to send the test results for each barcode to NHS Digital. The Independent was told the labs did not follow the same standardised processes, meaning there were disagreements on issues such as when to discard damaged or poorly labelled samples, leading to big variations in the void rates between Milton Keynes and Alderley Park.One source said the rates reached as high as 40 per cent and were still at around 20 per cent earlier this month. The Lighthouse Labs and Department of Health said these numbers were not accurate but declined to give an alternative figure.One insider said: “We did have a number of samples that we couldn’t test because the swab had been taken and then it hadn’t been put in the transport tube, which means you can’t test it. Or the sample tube leaked. These are all things that happen when you’re relying on long distance transportation to a testing lab.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

You wouldn’t have had to iron out those things if you were using experienced lab staff.”Another described tube errors as the “biggest issue”, adding: “In the early days when we were trying to ramp up to 20,000 it became impossible because the tubes weren’t processable at all. Deloitte have really got on the case with that now.“Everyone has been given the impression these labs were networked and working to a single protocol but that wasn’t the case at all. They were each left to figure it out for themselves.”When the issue of large variations in the void rate between Milton Keynes and Alderley Park emerged, a meeting was held between the labs in May. A source within the labs said: “It was a big issue, with Alderley Park very unhappy. They felt Milton Keynes was trying to make them look bad.”During April, as the virus reached its peak in the country, staff in the labs described setting up the test process and having to overcome problems and errors that many felt were caused because they were starting from scratch.Staff described being moved to tears when they saw the scale of viral infection in care homes.There were several occasions where it all went really badly wrongOne technician said: “One night we thought there was something wrong with the machines. The signals were so strong from the samples from a care home. It was a shocker you could see how strong the virus was. I admit it made some of us quite upset.”When health secretary Matt Hancock triumphantly announced the UK was now carrying out 100,000 tests staff in the labs said they were “hurt and upset” at the obvious use of postal home-test kits to increase the numbers.One scientist said: “People were upset when they announced the target had been met. I felt quite hurt at that, we had achieved so much so just to lie about it sort of devalued it a lot. A lot of us were p***ed off. We had done brilliantly to get to 65-70,000 tests at that stage.”As many staff begin to return to their normal lives, some told The Independent they had been unaware private companies were behind the labs and felt “exploited” as the labs now looked to recruit paid staff and expand further.“I didn’t really realise there was profit to be made, perhaps I was naive,” said one volunteer who has since returned to their university: “The way things are changing at the labs now, it does make a lot of sense that they’re private companies.They added: “I think they’ve really underappreciated how fragile the processes are. It’s all very well getting these guys in without the experience. And it’s fine when it’s running smoothly but it’s when it goes wrong. There were several occasions where it all went really badly wrong, and we stood the risk of losing thousands of tests.”The Milton Keynes Lighthouse Lab was based at UK Biocentre, a not-for-profit company set up to do academic biomedical research. It employed only 27 staff before the crisis and had no experience of providing infectious disease testing, with one source saying: “It was a very odd choice to create a lab there from nothing.”The company was established in 2011 as a subsidiary of the UK Biobank charity and is funded by the taxpayers via the National Institute for Health Research and the Department of Health, which has gave the company a grant of £653,000 in 2017 after it made a loss. Its latest accounts for the year to September 2018 show it made a loss of more than £11,000 and reported it expected to continue making losses until it could expand services at the site.The Cheshire Lighthouse Lab is run by Medicines Discovery Catapult, described as a technology and medical innovation incubator funded by Innovate UK, an agency of the UK government. It also had little experience in running large-scale infectious disease testing.Along with the third site in Glasgow, these labs have been operating without formal accreditation to confirm they meet the same standards followed by most UK laboratories.Allan Wilson, president of the Institute of Biomedical Science, said: “When you set Lighthouse Labs up, running only with volunteers without registered staff, which are largely unaccredited, then I think that runs significant risks and that’s not a risk many other countries are prepared to take.“The testing strategy for this country has been constantly shifting with more political targets than clinical. Before May there was no clear testing strategy. We should be using testing in a targeted way to try and reduce the transmission of disease.”Medicines Discovery Catapult said the integrity of samples and packaging received by the labs varied and any samples deemed unsafe or which could not be identified were classed as void and not tested. It said efforts were ongoing to improve the packaging across testing sites.MDC said the labs had been working under an open book not-for-profit contract with the Department of Health, and all volunteers have been offered salaries with many taking on the roles.It said the success of the labs meant there was now a need to maintain them, which is why they were now recruiting for longer term staff.A Department of Health spokesperson said: “The Lighthouse Labs form part of the biggest network of diagnostic laboratories in British history and has been set up in a matter of months.“The UK has one of the largest testing programmes in the world and it draws on the expertise and resources of a number of public and private sector partners which has undoubtedly curbed the spread of the virus and saved lives.”Read the rest of our Failing the Test investigation:Slow start and flawed decisions in Britain’s coronavirus testing have cost lives, warn health leadersHow German coronavirus testing stormed ahead of the UK’s modelLocal health officials say they have been left in the dark on spread of coronavirusThis article was funded by our supporters.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.As the UK barely managed 5,000 coronavirus tests a day in early March, Germany was already nearing 100,000 tests per week – significantly ramping up testing with the virus raging in nearby Italy.While Britain had stopped most testing of the virus and entered into lockdown, Berlin took a different path, mobilising its network of laboratories and involving dozens of private labs and companies in what was seen as a national effort.In our investigation into Britain’s efforts to rapidly expand testing, funded by The Independent\u0027s Supporter Programme, multiple sources referenced the German approach as an example of what the UK could have done had decisions been taken earlier. Though the German diagnostics industry is better established than the UK’s, they also pointed to a fundamentally different approach for expansion and conveying results.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis article was funded by our supporters. If you would like to see more of this important work, please make a contributionTom Lewis, national lead for pathology in the NHS Getting It Right First Time programme, said: “If you look at Germany in particular, here is an integrated public health response with testing at the core of that but it’s testing with a purpose. They had a much smaller problem than we did.”Colin Fink, from Micropathology Ltd, said: “Germany is very interesting. There is no public-private ide in the sense that there’s no Victorian prejudice against trade like there is in the UK. They are controlled price-wise, by the government and their competition is really their turnaround time, and their portfolio of organisms.Inside the coronavirus mega-labsLocal health officials say they’ve been left in the dark on Covid-19“They instantly geared up when they saw this coming and so they had a much better infrastructure to be able to address the problem.”When the first cases emerged in Germany in February many of the existing private labs in the country recognised the threat and began to work on increasing testing.Daniel Hefel, from Medicover Diagnostic Services and a member of Germany’s Association of Certified Labs, or ALM, told The Independent: “We started very early to bring together all the competition, usually the laboratories were never talking to each other, but we decided very early in the Covid-19 crisis that we needed to share information.“The most important thing was speed and to scale up very, very quickly so that we can deliver results the same day or one day later.”He said that by the first week of March the country was delivering just under 100,000 tests a week but this rapidly increased and is now in the region of 350,000 tests a week after 10 weeks with the capacity to do much more if needed.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailHe said spreading out the labs as opposed to centralising testing was easier, logistically, and meant faster results.Alongside the mass testing he said any positive result was communicated to local health authorities immediately, initially by phone, though the system is now automated.“We were the laboratory who picked up the first two cases in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, that’s the state in the northeast,” Hefel said. ”We reported at four o’clock on the results and two hours later it was in the media. In these two hours we informed the health authority, the health authority went to the media, but in parallel they contacted the patient and started immediate isolation. This was in the beginning of March.The biggest challenge is when you have a huge centralised lab, and you want to funnel everything into the central lab, and that was also what the US did in the beginning where they had a couple of monster labs set up, but it was not covering the whole state so they opened up to many other labs in the US and then scaling is much easier.”Asked about the UK approach he said: “Building up something from scratch is certainly very difficult. I would have it done differently.”A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “The Lighthouse Labs form part of the biggest network of diagnostic laboratories in British history and has been set up in a matter of months.“The UK has one of the largest testing programmes in the world and it draws on the expertise and resources of a number of public and private sector partners which has undoubtedly curbed the spread of the virus and saved lives.”Read the rest of our Failing the Test investigation:Slow start and flawed decisions in Britain’s coronavirus testing have cost lives, warn health leadersLocal health officials say they have been left in the dark on spread of coronavirusInside the coronavirus mega-labsThis article was funded by our supporters.

Parents will struggle to find a place for their child. This will affect their ability to go to work. Now is the time, when the world has been turned upside down, to prioritise support for children and families.A survey found that a third (34 per cent) of early years settings in the most disadvantaged areas said they were unlikely to still be operating next year, compared to 24 per cent\u0026nbspin the most affluent areas.The poll, of 6,300 early years providers in England, also suggests that 69 per cent\u0026nbspof those in deprived areas expect to operate at a loss over the next six months and 42 per cent\u0026nbspanticipate making redundancies.\u0026nbspPeruvians come out for end of 106-day lockdownBlocks-long lines formed at bus stops, food markets and shopping centers in Peru\u0027s capital Wednesday as people left their homes en masse to go to work or shop as a 106-day\u0026nbspcoronavirus\u0026nbsplockdown ended in many parts of the country.For the first time in months, food vendors offered breakfasts for 50 cents from street carts covered in clear plastic in Lima\u0027s historic center.

An estimated 70 per cent\u0026nbspof Peru\u0027s workforce is employed in the informal economy.However health minister Victor Zamora told the newspaper La Republica the lockdown that began on 16 March saved 145,000 lives and prevented more than a million people being admitted to hospital.It would have been a real massacre without quarantine, Mr\u0026nbspZamora said.Associated Press\u0026nbspA customer\u0027s temperature is measured at a store in Lima (AFP)Texas reports record daily rise in cases\u0026nbspAnother 8,076 cases were reported in Texas today, the highest daily increase since the pandemic started.It brings the total in the state to 168,062, according to the health department.Brazil death toll passes 60,000A further 1,016 deaths have been reported in Brazil, bringing the total to 60,610.The health ministry said the number of confirmed cases had risen by more than 45,000 over the last 24 hour period, to 1,447,523.UN Security Council calls for global truce - after three months of talksThe UN\u0026nbspSecurity Council has finally adopted a resolution calling for a global truce amid the\u0026nbspcoronavirus\u0026nbsppandemic, after a long-running dispute between the United States and China.The resolution, drafted by France and Tunisia, and backed by UN chief Antonio Guterres on 23 March, urges all parties to armed conflicts to engage immediately in a durable humanitarian pause for at least 90 consecutive days to allow for the delivery of humanitarian aid.Negotiations on the resolution were stymied by a standoff between China and the United States over whether to urge support for the World Health Organisation. The United States did not want a reference to the global health body, while China did.

Those determined to have been in close proximity with an infected person will be ordered to self-quarantine for two weeks from the date of contact.The law grants the Shin Bet permission to track cell phones for a three-week period on a case-by-case basis and only in instances in which other epidemiological tracking methods are insufficient in determining contact between a patient and other potentially infected persons.APPrague throws party to celebrate \u0027end of crisis\u0027Prague\u0026nbsphas celebrated a self-proclaimed end to its\u0026nbspcoronavirus\u0026nbspepidemic – by throwing a massive party attended by thousands of people all sharing food and without any social distancing.The\u0026nbspCzech\u0026nbspcapital held the unorthodox gathering to say a “symbolic farewell” to the infection and to show residents should no longer be scared to meet with friends or visit local businesses.Indoor bar seating too close in MichiganMichigan governor\u0026nbspGretchen Whitmer on Wednesday said she was closing indoor seating in bars in parts of the state following recent outbreaks.Whitmer also signed a bill allowing bars and restaurants to sell to-go cocktails in an effort to help those businesses.However bars won\u0027t have to close down completely\u0026nbspand the Upper Peninsula and much of northern Michigan are not subject to the order due to low numbers of reported COVID-19 virus cases. All bars may still keep open their outdoor patios. The order takes effect at 11 pm.Following recent outbreaks tied to bars, I am taking this action today to slow the spread of the virus and keep people safe, the governor\u0026nbspsaid in a news release. If we want to be in a strong position to reopen schools for in-person classroom instruction this fall, then we need to take aggressive action right now to ensure we don\u0027t wipe out all the progress we have made.Louisiana reports more than 2,000 cases in a dayLouisiana saw its largest daily\u0026nbspcoronavirus\u0026nbspcase spike since the peak of its outbreak in April, with nearly 2,100 cases confirmed over the last 24 hour period.Hospitalizations also continued to increase.Baton Rouge mayor Sharon Weston Broome said she would sign an executive order that requires people to wear face coverings when they are inside businesses.My message is simple.

That allows them to look inside the interior of the world and learn about its composition.The newly discovered planet orbits a star similar to our Sun, and is found about 730 light years away. It is known as TOI 849 b, and conditions there are intense: it is so close to its star that a year takes 18 hours, and the surface temperature is around 1,500C.That places the planet right in the Neptunian Desert, the region near stars where planets the size of Neptune are rarely found.Scientists find which exoplanets could host alien life“The planet is strangely close to its star, considering its mass,” said David Armstrong from the University of Warwick, the lead author of the study, in a statement. “In other words, we don’t see planets with this mass at these short orbital periods.”Researchers were able to conclude that it was just a planetary core by conducting detailed measurements, which found that the planet is about 40 times heavier than the Earth, but only 3.4 times as large. That density must mean that it is made up mostly of iron, rock and water, with only small amounts of hydrogen and helium.“The fact that we don’t see those gases lets us know TOI 849 b is an exposed planetary core,” said Dr Armstrong.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

It was then further analysed by the HARPS instrument run by the European Southern Observatory, which uses the Doppler effect to measure exoplanets by looking for the wobble in their light that happens as they move nearer and further from us.“One way or another, TOI 849 b either used to be a gas giant or is a ‘failed’ gas giant,” said Dr Armstrong.“It’s a first, telling us that planets like this exist and can be found.“We have the opportunity to look at the core of a planet in a way that we can’t do in our own solar system.“There are still big open questions about the nature of Jupiter’s core, for example, so strange and unusual exoplanets like this give us a window into planet formation that we have no other way to explore.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.From fashion stylist to farm hand: meet the people helping to harvestThe bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms. Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo?

That’s why there\u0027s never been a better time to try something new.Among the wide range of different species found in UK waters are mussels, crab, mackerel, herring, rainbow trout, hake and coley (or saithe).

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them. They are very comfortable to wear.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And today, because of the enormous generosity of Virustatic Shield, whose innovative anti-viral snoods we’ve also been producing, 10,000 of London’s most vulnerable people will receive a vital face covering, delivered to them via The Independent’s fantastic campaign.Which star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day It is now mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport, but these coverings are in short supply.That’s why we started The Big Community Sew to encourage people to make face coverings for their friends and neighbours, and by doing so preserve vital supplies of PPE for NHS workers and care home staff who are fighting this virus on the frontline.The science behind face coverings is simple: they help prevent the wearer from unwittingly spreading the disease.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are among the stars who have today urged Londoners to bid on sections of Sir Peter Blake’s pop artwork Our Fans to raise money for Help the Hungry.Last Friday, The Independent announced that the giant mural — draped over the London Mandarin Oriental hotel in Knightsbridge during its 2017 renovation — would be cut into 100 sections and auctioned off.The work, which echoes Sir Peter’s famous 1967 artwork for The Beatles’ Sgt Pepper album, is his largest piece, the size of 38 London buses. Each section features a famous face, including Morgan Freeman, Whoopi Goldberg and Sir Paul McCartney, and is signed by Sir Peter, 87.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesProceeds will go to two beneficiaries, including The Independent\u0027s Help The Hungry Now appeal partner The Felix Project.Today, Ms Lumley said it was an “honour” to be part of the fundraising effort. She said: “Double honour — to be a face in Peter Blake’s awesome collage for the Mandarin and to be a tiny part of helping Help the Hungry. It is a fabulous way of making life worth living.”Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mDame Judi said: “How wonderful that Peter Blake’s amazing artwork will have a new lease of life for such good causes. I’m very glad that maybe my left eyebrow has gone to good use.”Italian actress Caterina Murino, who also stars in the work, said: “The world is upside down. We fight for our life, we fight for the life of our brothers, and this is the feeling I have when I contemplate Sir Peter Blake’s masterpiece! A hundred stars that reflect the ersity of our world fighting to help Help the Hungry. I can’t be more honoured.”The piece was originally commissioned by London Advertising, whose founder Michael Moszynski said: “We’re looking forward to seeing the final figures raised.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I would not be here if it wasn’t for this project,’ one helper saysWhat has it been like to volunteer during the pandemic? Social enterprise Bread n Butter – one of the charities supplied by our Help The Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project – closed its doors at the end of March.However, its founders saw a growing need among the city’s most vulnerable for regular home-cooked, nutritious meals, so they joined with community centres Stonegrove Community Trust and the Hive Trust.Since then, Bread n Butter’s team, aided by volunteers, have been cooking and delivering more than 1,000 meals a day to Londoners in need in Barnet, Enfield and Brent. Here, we speak to four people who keep this project going.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRichard Simon, a furloughed IT worker, joined the Stonegrove Community Trust’s OneStonegrove project in Edgware at his wife’s suggestion. The 52-year-old said: “Working in the kitchens was like being on Ready Steady Cook. You don’t know what ingredients you’re going to be working with, so you have to think on your feet.” The father of two, who dedicates 20 hours a week, added that the biggest thing he had learnt was the power of “working together”.“For a group of people who don’t know each other, we just get on with it, working flat out. No one is being paid, we’re just working for a great cause. It has been extraordinary.”How to support our campaignBid on Sir Peter Blake’s artwork in Help the Hungry auction, say stars4.3 million meals to be delivered as Help The Hungry appeal passes £7mJoanne Karbritz, 47, works up to five hours a day, four days a week at OneStonegrove community centre. The former Oxfam shop worker, who has high-functioning autism, said that because of her condition, having a “structured day” is incredibly important. “Without routine, I can’t cope,” she said. “I would not be here if it wasn’t for this project.”Ms Karbritz, who is also anorexic, said working with food had been transformative. “Working to create healthy, nutritious food everyday has changed my relationship with it. I have also learned how to cook, whereas before I lived out of tins.”Mariana Bassi Da Silva, a software developer, wanted to volunteer as she was not working due to the pandemic. A keen cook, the 34-year-old volunteered for OneStonegrove and said the project had helped develop her love of cooking. The Brazilian-Italian, who moved to London seven years ago, said the greatest impact the project has had on her was the sense of “belonging”.“It is hard to settle in when you move,” she said. “Here, I have a community.

It’s great to help out.”Readers have just three more days to bid for a piece of Sir Peter’s Blake’s pop artwork, Our Fans, to raise money for Help The Hungry. The auction of the giant mural – which echoes Sir Peter’s design of The Beatles’ Sgt Pepper album and was draped over the London Mandarin Oriental hotel during its 2017 renovation – closes at midnight on Friday.

And it’s a lovely unicorn.”After the newsreader’s input, Scarlett then begins to ask Dr Wenham: “What’s his name? What’s his name mummy?”Minister’s BBC interview interrupted three times by other callsVirtual Supreme Court hearing is interrupted by flushing toilet Arnold Schwarzenegger interview interrupted by donkey and tiny horseBBC News viewers in stitches as Robert Kelly returns with childrenThe mother gently shushes her daughter as Fraser says “do stop me if you need to crack on,” before telling the girl: “My name is Christian.”“Christian,” Scarlett repeats, before adding: “I’m just deciding where it can go. Where mummy wants it to go. Mummy where do you want it to go?”Dr Wenham agrees the artwork would look great on the shelf and apologises to the interviewer as they both share a laugh.The footage was reminiscent of a similar BBC interview in 2017, in which an interview about South Korean politics was crashed by two youngsters.A live interview with an MSNBC correspondent was similarly interrupted by her daughter in 2019.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There would be no objection, they say, to servicemen and women taking the knee or going on marches for human rights when they are wearing civilian clothing.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThere is, however, no central directive from the Ministry of Defence on taking the knee, and service personnel in uniform have regularly taken part in LGBT Pride marches without censure.The issue under discussion, it is believed, is whether the gesture would be seen to be tied to an overtly political movement. Defence officials acknowledge, however, that taking the knee has a history with  the US civil rights movement,  and any decision on it will take this into account.There is an apparent element of confusion in the government about taking the knee. Foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said recently that the gesture came from TV series Game of Thrones, triggering social media postings of photographs of Martin Luther King carrying out the action during the struggle against segregation in the American South.

The service’s union, the Police Federation, said this showed “we are all human beings.”A Ministry of Defence spokesman said “We do not tolerate racism and promote ersity and equality. The recent protests have reminded us that we all have a role to play shaping a better future.” Officials point out that the military has consistently won awards over the years for being among the best employers for racially erse personnel in the country.Dominic Raab says taking the knee has ‘feudal connotation’Education minister says he would take the knee in support of BLMRaab ridiculed for claiming taking a knee comes from Game of ThronesSenior officers say they accept much more needs to be done to eradicate racism in the armed forces. In a letter to members of the Army, Royal Navy and the RAF, General Sir Nick Carter said recent protests “have brought the issues of racism and discrimination sharply into focus. We owe it to our black, Asian and minority ethnic servicemen and women, who will be feeling concerned at the moment, to try to look at this from their perspective, to listen and to continue to make change happen”.The chief of defence staff said that although the armed forces is a “rich mix of faiths, colour, gender and creeds reflected in British society”, it must be ensured that people are judged on their abilities and “not for what they look like or where they come from”.Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, recently stressed that the military must “reset” its “woeful” record on discrimination against black and minority ethnic personnel. In an interview with The House magazine he said it had historically “not done well enough” in either recruiting or welcoming people from a black, Asian and minority ethnic (Bame) background.Ministry of Defence\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Despite the vast differences between the two situations, Fawcett’s extensive military experiences and qualifications have helped him and his team develop a robust response to the Covid-19 crisis.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I was the only doctor there for about 300 people, which was quite an eye-opening experience,” says Fawcett of his first stint in Afghanistan in 2007 as part of the Army Reserves. Working at the Role 2E Field Hospital in Camp Bastion and at the Forward Operating Base, Fawcett provided key treatment on the Afghanistan frontline.On his second stint in 2007, he spent three months in Camp Bastion as a Trauma Team Leader, and on his third tour in 2011, he was the clinical lead for the Medical Emergency Response Team, a four-person medical team operating from a Chinook flying over Afghanistan, picking up wounded soldiers on the battlefield.What’s more, Fawcett – who also counts a role with the Midlands Air Ambulance Charity as a helicopter doctor amongst his impressive repertoire – has completed an MSc in Disaster Healthcare. Playing an instrumental part of Stoke hospital’s response to the Coronavirus pandemic is just one more string to his bow.“I was able to take a lot of stuff I learnt and apply it from the very start,” Fawcett says of putting his Masters in Disaster Healthcare into practise. “Before the patients even get to the emergency department, we make sure there’s clear boundaries, and patients are directed to the right areas to avoid any cross-contamination.”His army tours also contributed: “Looking at the designs of how they set up field hospitals and stuff helps,” he adds. “And working with international colleagues – it’s good to get a non-UK perspective on how other countries deal with certain circumstances.”This involved an overhaul of the whole emergency area and its processes. “We now run two emergency medicine departments out of one department,” he explains. “We’ve had to basically split the whole department in half.”Now, Stoke hospital features red zones and green zones: the former is for those displaying potential Covid symptoms and the latter is for those who aren’t. As such, the pathways and patient-flow of the hospital have had to be changed to avoid any instances of contact between these areas.“We have separate ambulance entrances for red and green patients. We have two resuscitation departments, two areas for major patients, two areas for walk-in patients, two minor injuries areas, two paediatrics departments, as well as designing alternative pathways to try and stream those patients that don’t have to come through the emergency department to other places.” he explains, noting how such isions have had to be executed throughout the whole hospital to prevent crowding and maintain social distancing.How schools in England are helping pupils return to the classroomThe task may have been monumental, but Fawcett takes pride in the hospital’s response: “This is what we’ve always trained for and it’s been good to see how us as an emergency department have responded to it. We’ve ensured patient safety and staff safety has always been at the forefront.”Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Here are some of the measures that schools are implementing to make the transition easier for pupils, staff and parentsIn association with the UK GovernmentHinchingbrooke School is an academy school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, with more than 1,900 pupils and 200 staff. Teachers started welcoming back A-level students last week.“We’ve only had the Year 12s in so far, but for them it was really clear they were delighted to be back,” says Mark Patterson, school principal, pictured above. “You could see it on their faces. It’s getting back to some sense of routine, structure and normality.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe continues: “I think a lot of them have been surprised by how much they’ve missed school. I think if you’d asked them before lockdown ‘Would you like a week off?’, they’d have said ‘Please!’. I bet if you asked them now, they’d say ‘Can I come back?’. I think the parents and students now realise how important school is.”Prior to the return, teachers organised a virtual assembly for Year 10 and 12 pupils, and sent a booklet home detailing the new guidelines which would be in place.5 back-to-school tips for parents\u0026nbsp“Don\u0027t give them a lot of small instructions – recognise your child would have had an enormous amount of\u0026nbspinstructions during the course of the day.”“If you are rewarding your child\u0027s behaviour, it\u0027s very important to do it every time.”“For a child who\u0027s been finding it tough,\u0026nbsptalking to another child who\u0027s been in the same situation is by far the best way of letting it out.”“It\u0027s important to encourage a child to work for themselves and get on with their own inner task.”New measures include red circles marked on the ground that are two metres apart and one-way systems throughout the school.“We’ve reorganised all the classrooms that we’re using so the desks and chairs are two metres apart,” Patterson explains. “We’ve got designated areas set aside at break and lunchtime for each group to go to, and we’ve got signage around the school reminding everybody of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand washing and keeping their distance.”Implementing new measuresRheeya Makwana is one of the Year 12 students who has returned to Hinchingbrooke. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom,” she says. “The structure was really good and I felt like I learned a lot more being back at school. I came home in such a good mood.”Rheeya’s father Yogesh Makwana did have some initial worries about his daughter returning to school: “There’s always some concern, but all the communication from school has been excellent in the build up to it and all the measures that have been put in place have reassured us. If you offered our 13-year-old the chance to go back to school tomorrow, he’d do it in a heartbeat. He misses his classes the social interaction. He loves PE and he does so much at school that he misses.Year 10 pupils Vahine and Lucia will also be returning to the school this week. “The twins are really looking forward to it,” says their mother, Alesia Dickinson. “They’ve been messaging all their friends to find out what group they’re in. Less than a week after we said yes to going back we found out what bubbles they were in and we had clear guidelines about times, rooms and what they can expect when they go back to school. They’re raring to go.”Both Makwana and Dickinson agree that their children have missed the structure of school lessons and that the transition back to the classroom has been easier than expected. “I think it’s a positive thing,” says Dickinson. “I think it’s a step in the right direction. We need to let the children start that process.”Going back to Embark schoolsTrust leader at Embark Matthew Crawford, pictured below, has been welcoming back primary pupils to the Federation’s schools across Derbyshire.“The feedback we have had so far from all the schools across the Trust is that it’s going really well in terms of welcoming the children back,” he says. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all. Each school has done a risk assessment based on what they can do.”Most Embark schools are now back at around 25-30 per cent capacity, Crawford says. It\u0027s up from around two per cent when lockdown began, when it was just key workers’ children and more vulnerable pupils in the classroom.“It’s lovely to hear the children playing and see schools becoming vibrant again,” he adds. “As soon as lockdown began, we started work on our Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme, a nine-stage support package to welcome children back safely.”Keyworker Vicki Ellis has two children who have returned to one of Embark\u0027s schools Richardson Endowed Primary - Amelia in Year 3 and Darcey in Year 1, pictured below.The first day the girls were back I was wondering how they were all day. I knew the school had done everything possible to welcome the children back in a happy, positive way but I worried whether Amelia and Darcey were enjoying themselves. But when they came home they were so happy to have had that day at school – and eager to go back next day. Crawford explains that the school has tried to make the transition back to the classroom as fun as possible for the children: “We’re following the guidelines but in a way that’s fun for the children. We aren’t marking big Xs on the floor. Some of our schools, for example, are painting snakes in bright colours to show the way.”Embark has also shared its programme with schools as far as Devon, Durham, South Gloucestershire and Wales.“It’s a suite of resources and activities that schools can adapt to their own settings, taking the bits that work for them,” explains Crawford. “It’s lovely that the brilliant work of our staff is making a difference and impacting the lives of millions of children across the country, not just the 3,000 within our Trust.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

There have been more than 170 new cases of Covid-19 since last week, marking the biggest increase since the virus\u0027s spread was close to being eliminated in April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Oiled by the Kremlin’s election machine, the result of Vladimir Putin’s vote on constitutional reform – one that would allow him to rule until 2036 – was never in doubt.But the decision by Russia’s election commission to publish “preliminary” live results five hours before polling closed was a novelty that shocked even the most cynical of observers.The initial projection of 73 per cent in favour of amendments was broadly in line with exit polls published by state pollsters FOM and VTsIOM. They projected 70 per cent and 76 per cent respectively, also before the end of polling. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOpposition groups painted an altogether different picture. At 5.30pm local time (3.30pm GMT), their own exit polls projected a near tie in Moscow (47.76 per cent for, 52.24 against) and a heavy defeat for the president in his home city of St Petersburg (38.2 percent for, 61.8 per cent against).The constitutional plebiscite was an unusual electoral exercise for Russia, with polling stretched over seven days and in the middle of a coronavirus pandemic. Authorities said the unprecedented measure was necessary to ensure safe voting.Why is Putin changing the constitution?For critics, it was a trick to boost turnout from a population tired of their longtime leader.The vote is taking place in a tricky period for Mr Putin, who has lost much of his glow after a torrid few months of largely absent Covid-19 crisis management. According to Levada Centre, Russia’s most independent pollster, Mr Putin is still trusted by 59 per cent of Russians, but that figure is down 30 per cent from a post-Crimea high of three years ago.In open polling, ie when Russians are asked to name the politicians they most trust themselves, support drops to 29 per cent. The figure is lowest among young voters, with less than one in 10 expressing affiliation.This week’s ballot asked for a “yes” or “no” answer to 206 amendments in entirety, with the proposal to reset term limits buried deep amongst them. It was “technically impossible” to ask voters to go through the changes one by one, authorities claimed.Invariably, official campaign literature focused on the other 205 amendments, targeting populist pressure points from marriage as a heterosexual union, to indexation guarantees for pensions and other social benefits. In his address to the nation on Tuesday, Mr Putin made no mention of the all-important clause on term limits.The poll has also been marred by allegations of vote-rigging, but given the prevalence of home and electronic voting, this is difficult to verify.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailOn their part, officials claimed the vote to be Russia’s cleanest yet. Deputy elections chief Nikolai Bulayev talked about a “breakthrough” in the low number of complaints received.Mr Putin said that election manipulation methods such as forced voting, “rounding errors” in counting and inflating turnout were “inadmissible”. But there was evidence of all methods being rolled out – and more.On Thursday, the first day of voting, Pavel Lobkov, a journalist for the independent Dozhd television channel, reported he had managed to vote twice. He was later questioned by police for his efforts, with prosecutors now threatening criminal charges for “election fraud”.‘Like two guys in a steam bath’: Source describes Trump-Putin callsSupport for Putin wanes in his former Russian strongholdPutin says coronavirus is retreating and condemns anyone who disagreesPutin looms over Russia’s latest vote – but it’s not all about himA week earlier, a colleague from the same channel was taken in for questioning after he uncovered a corrupt scheme to register elderly voters for electronic voting. Some of the most egregious manipulations during the week were recorded in the northern capital of St Petersburg.There, election officials were recorded by local journalists stuffing papers into the ballot box. At another polling station, an election observer claimed officials refused to give him access to voting numbers.When journalist David Frenkel followed up on these claims a day later, he was seriously assaulted by a police officer and another unidentified man. He ended up in hospital with a broken shoulder bone.The election monitoring group Golos reported a total of 1,500 separate infringements during the seven-day vote. Ella Pamfilova, Mr Bulayev’s boss at the election commission, dismissed the claims, and Golos as a “toxic and degraded” organisation.Ilya Azar, the journalist who has become an unexpected alternative protest figurehead, has announced a protest for 6pm local time (4pm BST) in Pushkin Square. He was responding to a “coup d’etat”, he said in a Facebook post. But in an open admission of the impossibility of protesting in Russia, he said he would not be openly encouraging others to join him.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

As he looks to rebuild, he will rightly see this as an opportunity not only to revive our economy, but to set it on a firmer, fairer foundation than before.I’ve been working with the Centre for Policy Studies since we went into lockdown, coming up with ideas to help my colleagues in government secure the strongest possible recovery as we come out of it.I want to make sure that left-behind regions not only share in our economic comeback, but that our plan is specically designed to spread prosperity to every corner of the country, leaving no one behind.Thankfully, we’re not short on options.One of the first things we can do is bring forward plans for a revolution in regional infrastructure.Investing in roads, railways and broadband will increase economic activity and boost communities by creating new jobs and helping businesses grow.Alongside investment in training and skills, this will transform the regions.The Government should also take advantage of record-low rates to massively step up the amount of cash it is willing to invest in overlooked areas.Where this cash goes shouldn’t be led by bureaucrats in Whitehall, but local people who really understand the problems in their area.City and Town Deals have proved a huge success, as have visionaryMayors such as Ben Houchen in Tees Valley and Andy Street in the West Midlands.We shouldn’t be afraid to devolve wider and deeper across England, increasing the powers of local authorities and setting up models that have proved successful.Finally, we need to find new ways of putting money back in people’s pockets, and change the tax system where it is grossly unfair. For towns and cities across the North, we can do both by changing the way council tax works.Bizarrely, your council tax is calculated using property values that are  years out of date.If you move into a new-build, the valuation office tells you what band you’re in based on a guess of what it might have been worth in .Because the value of their homes has soared since then, this system effectively hands rich homeowners a massive discount.That isn’t fair. We should consider a full council tax revaluation to make sure that hardworking people in less well-off areas are not subsidising the rest of the country.This pandemic will change many things about our country. One thing that won’t change is the need to address profound regional inequalities, and spread opportunity and prosperity to every part of the UK.The case for levelling-up is stronger than it has ever been before.With better regional infrastructure, more local decision-making and fairer taxes, we still can — and must — make it happen.  To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

With Great Britain, we have agreed to speed up these negotiations to be able to agree on a deal in autumn, which would then also need to be ratied until the end of the year.Yet, Merkel also fired a warning at her UK counterparts, adding: With Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the British government wants to define for itself what relationship it will have with us after the country leaves.It will then have to live with the consequences, of course, that is to say with a less closely interconnected economy.This comes as Parliament passed the Immigration Bill last night that would end the UKs Freedom of Movement with the European Union, which will see EU nationals and their families will be subjected to UKs immigration laws.Face-to-face talks on a deal between the EU and the UK have now begun in Brussels, after both sides pledged to intensy discussions.Follow our Brexit live blog below for all the latest updates…The Chairman of Germanys Bundestag Foreign Affairs Committee Norbert Roettgen has had some strong words to say about a no-deal Brexit.

The German chancellor said: #We need to let go of the idea that it is for us to define what Britain should want. That is for Britain to define – and we, the EU, will respond appropriately.#With Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the British government wants to define for itself what relationship it will have with us after the country leaves.#It will then have to live with the consequences, of course, that is to say with a less closely interconnected economy.#Lord Heseltine, the architect of government plans for urban renewal in the s, said he believed Brexit added uncertainty and unpredictability to the issues created by the coronavirus pandemic. “Brexit and COVID add-up to one great question mark,# he said. #Its no use just making speeches that just talk about bouncing this way or that. The people who are going to be making the decisions are hard-headed, responsible iniduals. #Theyre not going to listen to political speeches before they make political decisions. #They will look at the hard facts as they see them on the ground.

But until you answer those questions you are spitting in the wind”.He said he believed that taxes would have to rise as a result of the pandemic, saying that “someones got to pay for the spending round that COVID has injected in to our economy”.Brexit-basher George Soros has predicted the coronavirus crisis could doom the EU and #destroy capitalism as we know it#. Soros fears because the EU project is not finished its struggling to deal with the fast developing Covid- catastrophe.The Hungarian-born currency speculator, now a US citizen, also predicts the extraordinary economic slump that is expected to unfold in the coming months could change the face of capitalism.The anti-Brexit campaigner and donor to the second referendum campaign made the forecasts in an interview with the Independent.He said: #I am particularly concerned about the survival of the EU because it is an incomplete union.#It was in the process of being created.#But the process was never completed and that makes Europe exceptionally vulnerable – more vulnerable than the US not just because it is an incomplete union but also because it is based on the rule of law.#And the wheels of justice move very slowly, while threats such as the Covid- virus move very fast.#Hopes of a COVID- vaccine pulled European stocks from losses earlier on Wednesday, after fears of a no-deal Brexit and anxieties relating to the European Unions recovery fund had weighed on sentiment.Ending a choppy session, the pan-European STOXX  index rose . per cent, with blue-chip indexes in Paris, Milan and London down about . per cent.

by restricting the flow of vehicles.One of the big Brexit stories this week is that British businesses exporting to the EU will have to wait for permission from HMRC before moving their goods.Its part of new plans to stave off chaos at ports.Plans drawn up by officials and reported by Bloomberg say lorries will only be allowed to begin their journey to Doverthey have a valid reference from the new # and so far, untested # Goods Vehicle Movement Service.The system, which is still under development six months from the end of the Brexit transition period, will bar trucks without prior clearance from heading for the channel.Michel Barnier slammed Britains #unacceptable# demands on financial services in a speech to bankers.Addressing a think tank he fumed: #The UK is trying to keep as many single market benefits as it can. #It would like to make it easy to continue to run EU businesses from London, with minimal operations and staff on the continent.#He added a decision on #equivalence# so British banks can carry on trading with the continent has been delayed by the UK failing topaperwork.But British officials blamed Brussels for sending over more than a thousand pages of questions, many of which are irrelevant. Image: ReutersGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel has said the EU must prepare for a possible failure of talks with Britain over a new its new trading relationship.She said the talks will be sped up to achieve an agreement in autumn so it could be ratied by the end of the years.She told the lower house of parliament that the EU #must and should prepare for a situation in which an agreement does not happen#.Scottish ministers #need to wake up to the fact that we have left the EU#, the Scotland Secretary told MPs.Alister Jack said: #I know the Scottish Government dont like the outcomes of referendums when they dont go their way, but this is another one were delivering on.#SNP MP Pete Wishart asked: #An opinion poll recently found that  per cent of the Scottish people back a Brexit extension on top of an overwhelming majority who opposed a Brexit disaster in its entirety.#And the Secretary of States probably seen an opinion poll that finds  per cent of the Scottish people now want an independent Scotland. #What does the Secretary of State believe links these opinion polls and what does it tell him about where our countrys headed #Mr Jack replied: #I think the whole House would like to congratulate him on giving up his own independence getting engaged last weekend. #The answer is that we had a general election, we had a resounding majority across the UK for a manesto that said we would leave, we would honour the result of the referendum. #We are going to honour that result, were going to take back control of our laws, our borders, our money and were going to leave the hated Common Fisheries Policy # heres the independent bit forwere going to become an independent coastal state.#Boris Johnson has urged caution as the lockdown eases and Brits get back to work.“What were trying to do now involves striking a balance,” he says.“It is very, very important as we open up the economy that we do not go too far and risk a second spike and further outbreaks.“People can see whats happening with Leicester.“We need to make sure were doing this in a prudent way.”Image: ReutersMajor companies including Easyjet and Airbus are among those to announce thousands of redundancies this week alone.This has of course been discussed extensively during PMQs.Labour leader Sir Keir, who asked about Boris Johnsons big speech on the economy yesterday, said: “Next weeks financial statement could be the last chance to save millions of jobs.“Will the Prime Minister start now by extending the furlough scheme for those parts of the economy which are still most at risk ”Mr Johnson says the best thing to do is to get people back in work and make sure the virus is “defeated and under control”.Answering another question about redundancies in the arts sector, he said: “Keep supporting your workers with the furloughing scheme – its much, much better now to wait for times to get better, rather than laying people off.”Image: AFPMr Johnson says “the best single thing we can do is get our economy back to health by getting our people back into work”.He says he needs the opposition to “emphatically support ending the lockdown and emphatically support kids being back into school rather than being bossed around by the unions.”He says of Labour: “Were the builders, theyre the blockers – were the doers, theyre the ditherers.”Sir Keir refers to Mr Johnsons big speech on the UK economy, delivered yesterday from Dudley.The Labour leader picks out one line from that speech – “We know that the jobs many people had in January are not coming back” – and asksits the equivalent of something the PM said at the beginning of the crisis – “I must level with you. Many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time.”“We know what happened next,# he says.“Thats why there needs to be a laser-like focus on protecting jobs.”Mr Johnson says Sir Keir should pay tribute to the Government for protecting million jobs with the furlough scheme and says he wont put a figure on the jobs that could be lost.“Thats why were proceeding with the New Deal, the fair deal for British people,” he argues.“We are going to build, build, build and provide jobs, jobs, jobs.”Boris Johnson is facing off against Sir Keir Starmer for PMQs this afternoon.Sir Keir says the local authorities in Leicester, where the lockdown has been extended, had just half of the information they needed – and didnt even know the real figure of people affected until last week.“The local authority thought there were  positive tests in the last fortnight, when the real figure was ,” he says, adding that theres been a “lost week when the virus was spreading”.Mr Johnson hits back – he says the Government shares its data with all local authorities across the country.However, in defending the whack-a-mole strategy, he does acknowledge there were issues in Leicester.“There were particular problems in implementing the advice and getting people to understand what was necessary to do,” Mr Johnson says.Following on from that last blog post, we thought wed revisit a story from April about the UKs drive to get enough PPE.At that time, Brussels insisted the British Government was given “ample opportunity” to join an EU scheme to bulk buy medical equipment.Officials said officials from the UK apparently missed a series of key meetings on it.And they said the plan to pool procurement of key kit including ventilators and PPE had been a “recurring topic” at virtual meetings British officials attended.Heres that story.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab says the UK missed out on the chance to take part in European Union procurement schemes for PPE because the information was sent to an outdated email address.He suggested Brussels officials were to blame for not updating their contact details.In a letter to the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, he said: “The relevant EU committee, the Joint Procurement Agreement Steering Committee , was relaunched by the European Commission in September , after three years of not meeting.“The UK provided up-to-date contact details for the UK representatives to the JPASC in September .“Despite this, however, we understand from the commission that the UK contact details on their circulation list… were still those of the previous UK representatives – ie those who had last attended JPSAC in .”Image: GettyOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Until his recent election the Tories had it easy, confronted by an opposition led by Marxist radical Jeremy Corbyn, whose incompetence was matched by his extremism. But Sir Keir is a far more formidable opponent. He is sharp where Corbyn was dim, pragmatic where Corbyn was dogmatic.Corbyn constantly pandered to the left-wing fringe because he was part of it. But Sir Keir has just proven his toughness by sacking leadership contender Rebecca Long Bailey from the shadow cabinet, after she expressed her support for actor Maxine Peake who used a newspaper interview to peddle conspiracy theories about the Israeli secret service. Corbynista zealots were appalled, moderates celebrated.Furthermore, the dismissal of Long Bailey was just part of a systematic removal of hard Left influence in the party.Much to the fury of left-wing agitators, Starmer yesterday dismissed calls for the police to be “defunded” in the wake of anti-racism protests. Emphasising his past work with the police as Director of Public Prosecutions, he labelled such demands as “nonsense”. Out are Corbyn allies like Jennie Formby, the former General Secretary. And in comes the new chief David Evans, described by admirers as “a stanch opponent” of the hardliners.According to the latest polls, the British public is warming to the new Labour leader. In one survey last week,  per cent expressed a preference for him as Prime Minister, two points ahead of Boris Johnson.Interviewed by the BBC on Sunday, former leader Ed Miliband joined in the cheer-leading, saying: “I never had his approval ratings. I think he has made a great start.”Yet it would be wrong for Labour supporters to be carried away. Sir Keir might be a better leader than Corbyn and Miliband, but those two set the bar very low. The truth is that Labour still has a mountain to climbStarmer is to become Prime Minister. His party is still a deluded rabble, dominated by the worst kind of toxic identity politics, contempt for Britain and student union dogma. Labour is ready for neither victory at the ballot box, nor for the governance of our country.Parallels are sometimes drawn with the situation now and that of , when John Major’s Government was engulfed by the financial crisis of Black Wednesday five months after winning the General Election against Neil Kinnock’s Labour. But the huge dference is that Labour was on the advance, having won a further  seats at the election. Power was almost within the party’s grasp, given that Major only had a tiny majority. But today, Labour is still reeling from the humiliation it suffered last December, when it lost  seats, the biggest loss for any opposition in a century. Moreover, the party is in the wilderness in Scotland. Once Labour’s Caledonian fortress, the party has just one MP there.In total, the Conservatives have no fewer than  more MPs than Labour.That means the job that now faces Starmer is daunting. To be the biggest party, Labour would have to make  net gains from the Tories on a swing of  per cent. Even in the phenomenal landslide of , the swing to Tony Blair was only . per cent.And there is not the slightest sign of that happening at the moment, in spite of all the Government’s recent problems. It is a remarkable fact that the latest two opinion polls both show that the Conservatives, after ten years in office with a very mixed record, are still seven points ahead of Labour.Indeed, there is even a danger that Labour could slip back further. A recent internal review by the party into the disastrous  defeat warned that a further  seats in Labour’s heartlands could be vulnerable on a very small swing to the Tories.The central problem for Starmer is that his party, fixated by fashionable theories of social justice, has alienated its traditional voters. It will take more than the sacking of Rebecca Long Bailey or reassuring words about the police to bring them back. As the sensible former MP Natascha Engel wrote this month, Labour must recognise how far it “has shted from it core. If it wants to sht back again, the party will have to find the right road and prepare itself for a very long walk.” But the journey has barely begun. A party that is willing twice to elect Jeremy Corbyn as its leader is not going to change overnight.In reality, Labour remains gripped by far Left ideology, as shown by its eager embrace of the cultural revolution. Decent, patriotic working-class voters, once the bedrock of the Labour movement, are bound to be repelled by the endless posturing against Britain or the police or family le or even common sense. Despite the change of leadership, the insanity remains. At the weekend, Labour front-bencher Lloyd Russell-Moyle was forced to apologise after disgracefully attacking JK Rowling for using her own experience of domestic sexual assault as “a justication for discriminating” against transgender campaigners.In the same vein, senior Labour MP Dawn Butler recently declared on Good Morning Britain that “a child is born without sex”, a piece of biological nonsense that is about as sane as saying the Earth is flat. The atmosphere of a cult still hangs over the party. The lunatic Left has certainly not gone away, as reflected in MP Richard Burgon’s celebration that teaching unions thwarted “Tory attempts to force schools to re-open. When the row about statues was at its most hysterical, Lisa Nandycalled for imperialist murals to be removed from the magnicent interior of the Foreign Office. Similarly, the Nottingham MP Nadia Whitthome, sounding asshe lived in an occupied country, expressed her thrill at the movement to topple monuments of the past: “I celebrate these acts of resistance.”Sir Keir is not the figure likely to win back the traditional working-class, particularly not in the Red Wall seats of the Midlands and the North. This is, after all, a figure who used to edit a radical magazine called Socialist Futures, who built his reputation as a metropolitan-based human rights lawyer, who presided over the Crown Prosecution Service when it gained notoriety for its failure to take a tough stance on crime, and who battled ferociously for a second referendum on Brexit. For all the ordinariness of his upbringing as the son of a toolmaker and a nurse, he is now the personication of the North London liberal elite. Moreover, he lacks both authority and charisma. With his strangulated vowels and permanently anxious expression, he frequently sounds like a teacher who is surprised at this promotion to be head of department.The political landscape could have changed dramatically by , when the next election is due. Britain may have enjoyed a strong economic recovery. The culture war may have petered out. Public services may have been reformed. Mrs Thatcher was in desperate trouble in , battered by riots and rising unemployment. Two years later she won a landslide. It is perfectly possible that Boris Johnson could enjoy the same fate – especiallyLabour fails to change.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Barnsley, Rochdale and Oldham are also being monitored.They are all reporting around  cases per , residents — nowhere near Leicester’s rate of .A government source said: “It’s not spreading more there because of skin colour but because of living arrangements and workplaces.”Yesterday Leicester was a ghost town as its shops shut again for another two weeks — just as the rest of the country was preparing to open up this weekend.Last night only a \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"few people were seen in the streets of the city centre, all wearing face masks.Residents voiced their concerns to The Sun. Marley Bless, , said: “I’m really scared about what’s happening. I’ve been taking precautions and thought I could see the light at the end of the tunnel, but this spike has worried me.”Magda Raszowska, , added: “It’s frustrating, obviously. It’s like we’re going back to March. “Closing schools, closing shops again. It’s scary, it just shows how a second wave can be not far off.”Jacob Donald, , a mechanical engineering student at De Montfort University, said he was not surprised at the lockdown as people had been acting as“it’s normal times again”.He said: “People have stopped following the guidelines and there’s little social distancing. We’ve been hearing more parties recently in gardens.”In contrast to the city centre, local supermarkets were busy yesterday as hundreds of people rushed to load up with essentials.As staff struggled to keep shelves stocked, shopper Jaqruei Laiseta, , said: “Last time, I couldn’t get anything — no pasta, no milk, no flour. It was really worrying.“I can’t afford to stockpile loads because I’m on benefits, but I’m terried we will be left with nothing again.

My friend spoke to me this morning and said she can’t get any loo rolls.”Health Secretary \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"Matt Hancock placed Leicester back into lockdown after other measures failed to contain the outbreak.Officials had recently ramped up testing for residents and spent  days working with factories that experienced spikes. A government source said: “The garment and textile factories in Leicester have been a particular problem.

They are likely to employ extremely vulnerable people who will be scared to come forward for testing.”Leicester mayor Sir Peter Soulsby admitted there is an issue with “illegal manufacturers” in the East Midlands city but said he had not seen any data linking them to viral “hotspots”.Residents are being advised to stay at home as much as possible and to avoid all but essential travel.Police revealed they will issue fines as a last resort for those who breach the lockdown measures and travel from Leicester to Nottingham to shop or visit pubs this weekend.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

However, Grigory Melkonyants, co-chair of the independent election monitoring group Golos, has called the overall vote numbers suspicious.We look at neighboring regions, and anomalies are obvious there are regions where the turnout is articially , there are regions where it is more or less real, he told The Associated Press.The ballot comes after Putin surprisingly first proposed the constitutional changes in a state-of-the-nation address in January.He offered to broaden the powers of parliament and redistribute authority among the branches of the Russian government, stoking speculation he might continue calling the shots as parliamentary speaker or as chairman of the State Council when his presidential term ends in .The Russian leaders true intentions only became clear hours before a decisive vote in parliament when legislator Valentina Tereshkova suddenly proposed a measure to let him run two more times.The amendments, which also emphasise the priority of Russian law over international norms, outlaw same-sex marriages and mention a belief in God as a core value, quickly sailed through the Kremlin-controlled legislature.Putin later said he would decide later whether to run again in . He argued that resetting the term count was necessary to keep his lieutenants from looking for possible successors instead of doing their jobs.Among those turning out to the polls was a bear cub in Siberia who decided against backing Putin’s plan to become leader for le.Three month old Glasha looked unimpressed at an outdoor polling station set up for Russia’s constitutional plebiscite.The cub almost tipped over some anti-coronavirus sanitiser before  grabbing a pile of voting papers and chucking them on the ground.The handler admitted the bear had been invited to  the polling station, at a secondary school, in a stunt to encourage voters to come to the poll. We received a call last night and were asked to come, said zoo keeper Alexander Chenotaryev.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

After six months away from their desks, stringent measures will be put in place to ensure things go smoothly and the chance of coronavirus outbreaks are minimised. A key part of the plan will see the curriculum overhauled so that holes in pupilsapos aposcore knowledgeapos can be quickly filled, Thereports. This could see Year Seven students retaught parts of the Year Six syllabus and some subjects entirely removed from timetables to make way for more English and Maths classes. Even GCSE students may be asked to drop classes to concentrate on core subjects, it has been claimed. The plans, reportedly seen by The , says pupils will be assessed through regular quizzes to ensure they donapost fall behind. Although social distancing will not be applied at all times, pupils will be grouped into aposbubblesapos to limit the risk of transmission between class or year groups. This should make it easier to identy which groups of students have the coronavirus,they catch it. The aposbubblesapos will either be a class or an entire year group who have their lessons, breaks and lunchtime together.

Katie’s evidence will once again shine a much-needed spotlight on these key issues,” she writes. “Our inquiry, backed by hundreds of thousands of petitioners, represents a watershed moment. “If the Government fails to tackle online abuse, the impact will only get worse, and the potential consequences of that are unthinkable.” Katie, previously known as Jordan, has insisted the criminalisation of online trolling should not be restricted just to those targeting the disabled.  She told MPs last year: “I know I’m here because it started off because Harvey and his disabilities but this isn’t just for people with disabilities.

Hotel supports hospital heroes with meals  When the coronavirus pandemic hit, Laura McKenzie had a flood of cancelled bookings at her Glasgow hotel, Cathedral House. The McKenzie family had spent  months building up business at the boutique hotel, which offers a luxurious “home from home” atmosphere, so they were shattered. But within days Laura, who runs the hotel with husband Shane and two of their children Callum,  and -year-old Anna, was inspired to help out staff at nearby Glasgow Royal Infirmary. First, they block booked rooms for hospital staff at a reduced rate then with the help of a donation from Celtic FC Foundation, set to work making meals for them. “I made a few phone calls and straightaway we had the team we needed to start producing the meals. It was probably ten days from thinking: ‘This is horric, this is the end’ to thinking ‘We can do something good and support the local hospital here.’” Laura knows the pressure that NHS staff are under because her daughter, Emily, , is a junior doctor in Dundee, so she was desperate to help. With the hotel’s staff all on furlough, Laura assembled a team of volunteer chefs from the city. The Red Onion’s patron chef John Quigley was one of the first to volunteer and Laura worked with the head nurse at the Infirmary to set up the menu.  “We decided we were going to do  meals a day,” she says. “We did  veggie options and  meat options and bought little takeaway tubs and labelled them all up with little stickers that said: ‘With love from Cathedral House’. And every night at quarter to seven the driver from the hospital would come and take the big boxes of food away. He said there was always such a buzz. People were like: ‘Oh, the food’s coming! What have we got today ’” The hotel has now delivered more than , dishes such as jambalaya, bangers and mash and Thai curry. “It was a simple menu, all cooked fresh with lots of veggies and the sort of dishes you’d cook for yourself when you get home from work,” says Laura. Doctors staying at the hotel were delighted because Laura would text them to seethey wanted a dinner putting aside – and they could pop down to the kitchen to collect it. Laura’s home-from-home hospitality was a real comfort to her guests."},{"url":null,"title":"kids think dads better drivers","story":"NewsKids think dads are better drivers than mums but are also angrier and speed moreA survey of six to -year-old asked about the preferences of kids when it comes to sitting in the car, with many suggesting their male parents are better drivers than their female onesShareCommentsByMilo Boyd:,  JUL NewsApparently most kids think their dads are angrier drivers\", url\"News, views and top stories .

A study of , six to -year-olds, whose parents both drive, found  per cent named dad as the aposbestapos behind the wheel, with only  per cent opting for mum. Unfortunately for women,  per cent of children also said their mum is most likely to bump the vehicle on a kerb or another car, compared to just a sixth who believe their dad would do this. Mums play the best music though, according to  per cent of children, while only  per cent prefer dadaposs tunes. But  per cent of youngsters admitted to preferring to listen to their own playlists in the car to avoid hearing their parentsapos choice. Reasons for choosing dad as the best driver include the fact he drives for his job, has a van and is the designated holiday driver for the family. But almost two thirds claim their dad drives the fastest - and  per cent think he experiences the most road rage. Despite this,  per cent of youngsters prefer being in the car with their mum, naming her as the parent most likely to join in with car games, such as I Spy, while on a journey. Tfany Wilcox, from MG, which commissioned the research to celebrate the family friendly model range, said: The results paint an interesting picture of family car journeys and how kids see their parents.  Everyone remembers family road trips from when they were younger, the discussions which are had, games that are played and music choices. Itaposs amusing to have an insight into childrenaposs views of their parentsapos driving habits and clearly the results show dad wins when it comes to driving but mum is more fun to be with in the car. Families donapost have to compromise on practicality and style with our family model range and the built-in technology will help keep the kids entertained on both long and short journeys. The research also found dads win at all driving techniques, including being best at both reverse and parallel parking, hill starts and three-point turns. Children also think their dad is more successful than mum at switching lanes on a motorway and parking in tight spaces. And two thirds said their old man is better at changing a tyre compared to just eight per cent who favoured their mother. It also emerged men are more likely to take the driving seat for family car journeys, according to  per cent of the youngsters polled. But this may be because half of the respondents said their mum is more susceptible to getting lost and having to ask for directions.  Dads were found to be most strict when driving, with the top in-car rules including no arguing , no wrappers or rubbish to be left in the vehicleand no shoes on the seats . On the other hand, mums were typically found to be more talkative while in the driving seat. The study, carried out via OnePoll, also revealed  per cent of kids prefer being in dadaposs car with half of them stating this is because itaposs bigger, while  per cent put it down to the fact it has more technology, such as Apple Car Play. A quarter favour their mumaposs vehicle due to it being a nicer colour , having comfier seatsand because the roof comes off . Tfany Wilcox, from MG, added: Itaposs interesting to see how family dynamics play out while on the road, especially through the eyes of children.

And today, in the fourth part of our Helping Hand series, we look at the struggles people have been facing and how to tackle some of the most common issues – such as how we can all be mentally weighed down… literally. Ever since I can remember, I’ve had an issue with my weight. When I was six, my mum bought me a new swimsuit for my holiday and asked me to try it on to show my auntie. I remember feeling very self-conscious and came downstairs covering my tummy with my arms. My mum told me I was being silly, but I felt so uncomfortable. The negative comments started in primary school, but it was when I went to secondary school that the bullying went up a notch. I’ll never forget the day a girl pushed me off the parked school bus shouting: ‘You’re too heavy, the bus can’t take it!’ Back home, safely hidden from the bullies, I’d comfort myself with huge portions of steak pie and rice pudding. Years passed and though I tried to put school behind me, my anxiety didn’t go away. I loathed anyone looking at me, ever – after all, they’d have nothing nice to say. Even surrounded by my loving family – my parents Kevin and Helen, my husband Mark, and my children, Jamie and Louise – my happiness was always clouded by my low self-esteem. My mental health was at an all-time low, and physically my health was very poor, I had crippling IBS and problems with mobility. I knew I had to do something about my weight. Leaving the house became a huge hassle. If I had to walk, I knew I couldn’t go far, my back, knees and ankles would throb, I’d be sweating after a short distance and I would get so anxious of being seen and judged.  I felt like I was banging my head against a brick wall when I tried to lose weight. I tried so many plans and fad diets and I couldn’t stick to any of them. I’d try my hardest then fall back into bad habits – a quick chocolate bar for breakfast and snacking on crisps and sweets. Then in  my grandfather, who I called Papa, fell ill with cancer. We were very close, and I was visiting him in hospital when he said: ‘I’m not scared of dying because I’ve lived a wonderful le – now, lass, it’s time you started getting out and living yours.’ It was with his words ringing in my ears that I walked into a Slimming World group. It was the only plan I hadn’t tried. I asked a mum outside school, a nurse, about it. She said she’d heard it was very good. The first time I went to the group was nerve-wracking, I felt sick. I’ve always been shy and not very good in social situations, but I needn’t have worried.  Everybody was so nice. There was no judgement, no humiliation and people were being honest, I thought it was amazing. I decided to go back the following week. Standing in the queue for weigh-in, I started to panic I’d be the first one to gain on their first week. I thought there was no way I could eat so much and still lose weight. I couldn’t believe it. After a week of cooking from scratch, eating lots of fantastic food and feeling fuller than ever. I’d eaten lasagne, sweet and sour chicken with egg fried rice, mince and potatoes – and I’d lost lb. This was no diet. This was a sensible healthy eating plan, and the lestyle change I was looking for.  I lost weight every week. My family all commented on the improvement to not only my figure but my self-esteem. When my husband was posted to the Falklands for five months, I worried it might send me back to comfort eating. But my group kept me motivated. When he came back, he hardly recognised me. I had lost an extra st while he had been away. In two years, I lost st and now I am happier and more confident than ever. I feel I am a better role model for my children too with my positive attitude to healthy meals that they love helping to prepare. We’re much more active now too. Before I lost weight I used to joke I was allergic to exercise but now I love walking and I’m no longer afraid of people looking at me, my confidence has grown so much.  I often think about how proud Papa would be of me, socialising with friends I’ve made in my group while wearing a size- dress. I’m enjoying le for the first time in years. I know I can be there for my parents as they get older. I am there for my children and my husband and I now enjoy a social le.

German prosecutors suspect paedophile Christian Brueckner, now , abducted the three-year-old British girl from her familyaposs holiday flat in Praia da Luz, Portugal, and murdered a short time later. New details about a phone call - involving a mobile number allegedly used by Brueckner and an unknown person - are set to be revealed on a German TV crime programme. Rudi Cerne, the host of Aktenzeichen XY… Ungelöst , told Focus: The call came from the same place where the little girl was last seen alive. I get the impression something important is happening now. German prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters previously said a phone allegedly used by Brueckner pinged on a mast at the Ocean Club apartment complex shortly before Madeleine disappeared. Christian Hoppe, an investigator with Germanyaposs Federal Criminal Police Office , is set to discuss new details about the McCann case when he appears on Mr Cerneaposs programme on Wednesday night. Last month, Mr Hoppe broke the news that police had identied a German man as the new chief suspect in Maddieaposs disappearance on the night of May , . German prosecutors say they have evidence Madeleine is dead and they are investigating Brueckner for murder, but they do not have enough evidence to charge their suspect as no body has been found.  Brueckner, who is in jail for drug trafficking and raping a -year-old American woman in Praia da Luz about  months before Madeleine vanished, has claimed through his lawyer he had no involvement in the McCann case. Mr Cerne gave a preview of what will be revealed on Wednesday nightaposs programme. He told Focus: The only thing I can say at the moment is that this also includes the telephone number of the Portuguese prepaid card that was called from the German suspectaposs cellphone. Not even an hour before Maddie disappeared. The call also came from the same place where the little girl was last seen alive, in Praia da Luz in the Algarve. Mr Cerne said he is very excited about what Mr Hoppe will reveal on the programme, which airs on the German TV station ZDF, after last monthaposs show generated hundreds of phone calls to investigators in Germany, the UK and Portugal. He added: I get the impression something important is happening now. He said detectivesapos appeal for help on Wednesday night will focus on the phone call and the mobile numbers that were involved. Mr Cerne said: Iaposm not an investigator. But I know that they work through every single clue, whatever it is. If you keep getting similar information over and over again, then you prick your ears up. That is why they are now looking for public help again.  Clearly this telephone number, which was called from the suspectaposs mobile phone shortly before Maddieaposs disappearance, has a very large role in the investigation. I would imagine the BKA would need all the information about who owned this prepaid number, who called it, who was called from it. Every little clue, however small, counts - and is processed. Police said previously that a phone linked to the suspect received a call that lasted  minutes between .pm and .pm, close to the Ocean Club about an hour before Madeleine disappeared.  The unknown caller, who is not thought to have been in the Praia da Luz area, is not being treated as a suspect, but is said to be a key witness. Earlier in the investigation, police took the unusual step of releasing two phone numbers from the call. The first phone number,  , is believed to have been used by the suspect. The number for the other Portuguese mobile was  . In a recent interview with  Minutes, Mr Wolters said a phone linked to Brueckner was used in the immediate area of the McCannsapos holiday flat the night she disappeared. Mr Wolters said the phone was connecting in the mast belonging to Ocean Club. Madeleine was last seen alive at the Ocean Club complex where her family, from Rothley, Leicestershire, was staying days before her fourth birthday. Her parents, Kate and Gerry, left her and her -month-old twin siblings, Sean and Amelie, sleeping alone while they had dinner with friends at a tapas restaurant nearby.

The Duchess of Sussex also for the first time named five friends who criticized her dad, Thomas, after the pair had a spectacular falling out in the lead up to her May  nuptials. In a series of statements made in legal papers submitted to the High Court, the -year-old claimed her wedding raised £billion in tourist revenue. The papers say this “far outweighed” the contribution of taxpayersapos money towards crowd security. This figure has been previously doubted by consulting firm Brand Finance, MailOnline reports, with a figure of £million closer to the mark. Meghan also says she was prevented from defending herself against reports concerning the acrimonious relationship with her father, which left her friends “rightly concerned for her welfare, specically as she was pregnant” . The former actress is suing Associated Newspapers Limitedowner of The Mail On Sunday newspaper over five articles, which included reproduced parts of a handwritten note she had sent to her father in August . Meghan claims her dad’s decision to make the letter public breached her privacy,and data protection rights. In a major development this evening it emerged in confidential papers that Meghan not only identied her pals who spoke anonymously to People magazine, but insisted she didn’t know they were doing so.  Meghan said she did not know about the interview having been given, and only found out about it, and any reference to the Letter, after the People magazine article was published. The friends have never been named, with the magazine only referring to them as “Meghanaposs inner circle – a longtime friend, a former co-star, a friend from LA, a one-time colleague and a close confidante”. They are detailed as friends A, B, C, D and E in redacted documents but named in confidential papers submitted to the court. Meghan’s lawyers insist the Duchess “discussed with Friend A that she was writing a letter to her father at the time of penning itapos, which was seven months before the article was published in People in February .Legal experts predict the associates could now be called to testy in court during a sensational trial - dubbed “Markle versus Markle” expected at the end of the year or early . The documents state: As her friends had never seen her in this state before, they were rightly concerned for her welfare, specically as she was pregnant, unprotected by the Institution, and prohibited from defending herself. At the beginning of May Associated Newspapers asked Mr Justice Warby to strike out the following allegations in Meghanaposs case: - That the defendant acted dishonestly and in bad faith. - That the defendant deliberately dug up or stirred up conflict between the claimant and her father. - That the claimant was distressed by the defendant’s “obvious agenda of publishing intrusive or offensive stories about [her] intended to portray her in a  and damaging light”.

But behind the white painted mask of Marcel Marceau was a story he never wanted to tell. Unknown to his legions of fans, he saved the lives of more than  Jewish children from the Holocaust, risking his le to take them across the Alps from France into Switzerland. Marcel’s remarkable story is told at last in Resistance, a new film in which he is played by Social Network star Jesse Eisenberg. Director Jonathan Jakubowicz knew Marcel as the performer who changed modern theatre and even inspired Michael Jackson’s moonwalk. But he admits he knew nothing about Marcel’s most incredible achievement until he began researching his le before writing the script. Jonathan says: “I had no idea that he was Jewish or that he saved children in the war, that he found his art through the very act of saving children. I felt likethat is the story behind him it needed to be told. “I was going to the Cannes Film Festival so I felt like since I’m going to France maybe I can meet some of the people involved in that story.” Marcel died in France in , aged , but Jonathan tracked down his cousin Georges Loinger, who headed the Jewish Boy Scouts of France and Jewish Resistance during the war.  Jonathan says: “He was at the centre of this whole network that ended up saving , children. He was the man who recruited Marcel to the Resistance.” Born Marcel Mangel, he and his father, a kosher butcher, mother and younger brother lived in Strasbourg, France, on the border with Germany. But while they could see the growing Nazi threat from across the border, Marcel at first ignored the rumbles of war and the growing threat to German Jews, instead continued pursuing his ambition to be a theatre performer and playwright. Laughing off disapproval from his father, Marcel would mime in theatres with a toothbrush moustache prop that could transform him into Charlie Chaplin – and Adolf Hitler.  But that all changed in  when, during Kristallnacht, rioters across Germany destroyed Jewish businesses and killed Jews in the street, leaving hundreds of children orphaned. A wealthy Strasbourg landowner “bought”  children orphaned in the slaughter from the Nazis and took them across the border to live in her chateau. She turned to Georges for help, and he recruited his cousin Marcel – simply to entertain and soothe the traumatised children. Jonathan says: “The Jewish Boy Scouts get a phone call from the woman asking for their help. So this very small, unprepared group of boy scouts suddenly had to take care of  orphans. They’re crying, they’re desperate and they are traumatised.  “They only had Yiddish as the common language because the kids were German and Austrian and these guys were French.” There was a huge language barrier and that’s when Georges, who died in , decided to ask his cousin Marcel Mangel to help. To Georges, Marcel was a clown, a performer, a mime, an actor, an artist. He wasn’t taken seriously. Jonathan says: Marcel reluctantly agreed to help them, and I found it really beautul how he completely changes. He goes from being an egotistical human being to a person who is truly devoted to saving the lives of these children. Unable to communicate with words, Marcel began using mime to help put the children at ease, first with a simple gesture that would later make him famous – a hand passed over his face from happy to sad and back again.  He then found ways to make them laugh, include a walk-against-the-wind routine that would later become his signature. When Hitler invaded France in , Marcel and the Jewish Boy Scouts fled with the children to Lyon, hiding with families in the city. In , Klaus Barbie was made head of the Gestapo in Lyon. Known as the Butcher of Lyon, he delighted in torturing and murdering Jews, children and members of the Resistance. Marcel and his brother forged documents to change the ages of French youths to make them too young to be sent to labour camps or, in the case of the non-Jewish children, to work in German factories.  He also changed his own surname from the Jewish Mangel to the French Marceau. As Jews in the city started to be rounded up, the Jewish Resistance decided to get the orphaned children to safety in Switzerland. Marcel led the children across the Alps on three trips. He used his mime and clowning to calm them when their papers were checked by the Nazi soldiers. Jonathan says: “Growing up in Strasbourg he knew German, so he taught the children German songs. It helped that he could talk to the soldiers in their own language.  “He was incredibly courageous. Switzerland had this law that said they weren’t accepting refugees, butyou were a child refugee and you made it to Switzerland they wouldn’t report you because it was a neutral country. “Once they were there, Save the Children would claim them. It was a safe haven so the whole effort was to get them there without the Nazis stopping them.” Jonathan says: “Marcel was involved in three operations at the beginning but the rest of the operation of the Jewish Boy Scouts together with Save the Children saved , children.” Marcel’s father Charles was caught by the Gestapo and killed in Auschwitz in .  Jonathan says: “The most moving story I heard is that Marcel tracked down where his father was sent, but nobody knew what Auschwitz was. He would sit and wait for the train that came back from Poland to seehis father would come back from this place.” After the war, Marcel became the most famous mime in the world, creating Bip, a melancholy clown with a white face, striped jumper and battered hat with limp flower. After success on the US stage and television in the mid-s, he performed Bip internationally for decades. His work inspired numerous stars, from actor Gary Cooper to magician David Copperfield. Michael Jackson famously asked him to create “the choreography of my lost childhood” and Marcel’s sketch Walking Against the Wind inspired Jackson’s moonwalk.

A campaign has been launched to build a statue of Jack Leslie. He was picked to play for England against Ireland in , before being suddenly ditched. The Jack Leslie Campaign says: “After his selection, his name mysteriously disappeared from the team-sheet, seemingly because FA officials had come to look at him in person and discovered that he was black.” Viv Anderson became the first black player to represent England at senior level –  years later in .

They weren’t watching his football – they were looking at the colour of his skin.” Campaigners hope to raise over £, and want the statue to be erected at Argyle’s ground Home Park.

The elderly man was reportedly sneaked up on from behind and punched as he went on a stroll in Aigburth, Liverpool.He was then kicked while he lay on the ground, The Liverpool Echo reports.Bella Low, , was one of the teenagers who spotted the man covered in blood before rushing to his aid. She said: We were walking through Sefton Park, just going to the chippy on Lark Lane. Next thing I turn around and I seen this man sat on a bench. The amount of blood on him was quite shocking. My friend, Lily Hamer, was next to me and I said Lily we need to go and help this man. Bella and her friends used the first aid training they learnt at Army Cadets to help the injured man and stem the bleeding. They found he had a cut above his eye and a large cut on the back of his head. She said: He told us he had been walking along near Sefton Park, he was just walking and a man ran up behind him and hit him. Then he was on the floor and he said all he could see were feet flying at him. One of the group, David Southern, , said: We used tissues to stop some of the bleeding and asked for a lady who was pushing a pramwe could have a nappy to try and stem the blood coming from his neck. He was in quite a lot of shock so we made sure that people didnapost crowd him and waited with him until police and ambulance arrived. The victim is now thought to be recovering at home following the ordeal. Passersby noticed the care and attention shown by the teenagers, and posted on social media about their selfless actions. One witness, Genene Knight, said: These amazing girls and boys were administering first aid to the man... They calmed him down, held tissues and wipes to the multiple cuts on his head and face. They were so quick thinking and just sprung in to action. I was in awe of them and how they handled the situation. I just wanted their mums and dads to see this and to say how proud you should be of them. Bella said: It sounds strange but at the time we didnapost think of it as a big deal, we were just helping an old man who needed to be helped. We didnapost think we were going to get a big reaction.Speaking about how the post went viral on Facebook, David said he was surprised by the reaction.He said: We were just doing what we had been taught and wanted to make sure he was okay.

Imperial College Londonaposs Professor Neil Ferguson, who was a government adviser at the start of the pandemic, says it is only a matter of time until more places impose local lockdowns as Leicester has done following a spike of Covid- cases. Leicesteraposs flare-up means it will not emerge from parts of lockdown as swtly as the rest of England on July , when pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and other non-essential businesses will reopen. Residents have been told to stay at home, with schools and shops to shut this week with the city being one of the countryaposs Covid- epicentres. And it is feared both Doncaster and Bradford could both see similar lockdowns following a worrying rise in the number of cases. Prof Ferguson told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: Itaposs inevitable we will , we are relaxing lockdown rules and that means that contacts in the population are going up and thataposs a very iable process. Asked about Bradford and Doncaster, he said: Those are areas, where not as high as Leicester, but they have some of the highest numbers of cases per , of the population, which is the relevant measure, so theyaposre clearly of concern. Oxford Universityaposs Professor Peter Horby, who chairs the new and emerging respiratory virus threats advisory group , also thinks England should expect more local lockdowns. Unfortunately I think we should, he told BBC Radio aposs Today programme. Weaposve seen the epidemic is focal, which is often the case, itaposs not the same in all places. And we saw that London unfortunately led the way in the UK and now Leicester is unfortunately leading the way and we can expect more of that, so I think there will have to be local responses to local outbreaks.  Doncaster reported two more coronavirus deaths on Tuesday, taking the death toll in the South Yorkshire town to . Figures show there were  new  coronavirus  cases in Doncaster between June -, which more than doubled the following week. Between June -,  new infections in the town were confirmed, taking the total to . Doncaster was the only place in South Yorkshire to record new coronavirus deaths yesterday and is second behind Leicester as an area that has seen a worrying spike.  But, Dr Rupert Suckling, Director of Public Health at Doncaster Council, said he is not concerned about any potential lockdown in the town. “More data is now becoming available nationally and this will be open to scrutiny and speculation, he said. Since the reporting of both pillar  and pillar  testing we have seen a high number of positive cases beginning with the week th to st May and this coincided with widespread testing in our care homes where we identied a number of asymptomatic positive cases. We have also seen cases in health and care workers, with sporadic cases in schools. However, the weekly testing from the week th -th June shows a signicant reduction.  We are not complacent and encourage everyone with symptoms to self-isolate and arrange to be tested. We are working closely with the local Public Health England centre which has not raised any concerns with us.

This is because the company is adhere to Government guidelines that says: “All venues should ensure that steps are taken to avoid people needing to unduly raise their voices to each other. This includes, but is not limited to, refraining from playing music or broadcasts that may encourage shouting, includingplayed at a volume that makes normal conversation dficult. This is because of the potential for increased risk of transmission, particularly from aerosol transmission.” A statement from the pub reads: As our pubs reopen, our focus will be on meeting social distancing requirements and keeping our customers and staff safe. For this reason and to avoid crowds congregating, no football or sporting events will be shown on our TVs during July. As well as not playing sports matches, the pub chain has also introduced several other rules, including asking customers to order and pay for food and drink via the Wetherspoon app and only allowing small groups inside.  People may have to queue to get in when the maximum capacity has been reached inside. Wetherspoons will also introduce in their pubs one-way systems, socially distanced tables and hand sanitiser dispensers installed throughout.

Alaska Airlines has warned passengersthey repeatedly shun face coverings they could face bans from future flights.It comes after passengers in the northern US state complained people werenapost wearing masks on board as they travelled during the coronavirus pandemic. According to the Seattle Times, some passengers on a flight from Phoenix to Seattle last week repeatedly ignored crewsapos requests to don masks aboard the journey. The issue has become politicised in the US, where some are refusing to wear face coverings in public spaces where social distancing is required, and President Donald Trump has left it to inidual states to make their own rules.In the UK, wearing masks has been made mandatory by the government on public transport only.  But most British and European airlines have opted to make mask-wearing mandator y to curb the spread of Covid-.All major airlines now request passengers over six years old to wear a mask as part of new safety measures, meaning Brits must carry the face coverings as flights for holidays abroad slowly . Alaska Airlines has looked to the world of football for inspiration for its face mask warning system, which kicked in at the start of this month and is designed to catch passengers who repeatedly flout its rules. In a blog post, the airline said from early July, its flight attendants will be empowered to issue a final notice to any guest who repeatedly refuse to wear a mask or face covering on board its flights.  With that warning – in the form of a yellow card handed to them – the guest’s travel with us will be reviewed and could be suspended for a period. That would be a decision we do not take lightly. By working together, we do more for the common good. Alaska added: We realize a piece of fabric across your nose and mouth is probably not your ideal way to travel. Butwe all take that small step while flying, we’ll be better off in the long run. There would be some exceptions to the rule, the airline continued.  That included children aged under two, anyone with a medical issue that creates trouble breathing, passengers who cannot remove a mask without assistance, or anyone with a disability that prevents wearing a mask. The airline added removing the mask temporarily to eat and drink while passengers are seated will be allowed. From yesterday, passengers were being made to sign a mandatory health agreement during check-in to agree to the airlineaposs face mask policy.

She had received a notication through her Nest doorbell while she was out that somebody had been to the door, and the device also sends her footage for home-monitoring and security. The video she was sent had no audio, but when she ed home she reviewed the full clip to work out why the driver had fled so quickly after the aposweirdapos incident in Delaware. And she quickly learned her young son had been behind it, having snuck a very unique set of delivery instructions onto the Amazon order. Before the order went out for delivery, under a box titled aposDo we need any additional instructions to find this address apos, her son had written: No but knock on the door  times and scream abra cadabra as loud as you can and run super fast away. Incredibly, the clip shows the woman place the package on the porch before banging on the door and screaming the magical phrase before jumping down the steps and sprinting back to her van - exactly as instructed.Itaposs had more than two million views and , shares after Lynn posed it on Facebook, along with a screenshot of her sonaposs instructions, with the caption: Thank you to this great Amazon delivery woman! Apparently, my youngest son had put some aposadditional instructionsapos for delivery and she went along with it. It made us smile even though my son should not have done that so I apologize for that.  I do appreciate that the driver looked closely enough at the instructions though because I know a lot of people wouldnapost.

If you donapost clean it as you go, the grime and dirt builds up pretty easily, which leads to a lot of hard work later on. Whilst there are a tonne of products and methods online that promise to give you a gleaming oven - like The Pink Stuff Cleaning Paste that Mrs Hinch raves about or baking soda and vinegar - this one is new to us. A savvy mum has revealed just how easy it is to clean your oven without having to spend - what feels like - hours scrubbing it - and all you need is tin foil and a dishwasher tablet. She shared the video to TikTok and avid cleaners praised her for her aposle-changingapos hack. The woman starts by removing the trays from the oven, and then covers them completely in kitchen foil. She then pops them into the bath, before filling it with hot water - just enough to submerge the trays.  Finally, she puts a dishwasher tablet into the bath with the pans and leaves them to soak for two hours. Then you wait. After two hours remove the foil and youaposll be blow away. The once greasy and grotty pans, look brand new.  It might seem like magic but the secret is that a chemical reaction occurs between the foil and the tablets which breaks down all of the dirt. Now youaposll never have to scrub your oven again - genius. And many others thought so too as they praised the woman for sharing the idea. One said: Thank you! This is going to be le changing in my house! Another person in the comments said: You forgot to add: place the aluminium foil shiny side down onto the metal, thatapos the surface that attracts the dirt.

At .am, the moment battle began, a French bagpiper walked around the huge Lochnagar crater in pouring rain playing “The Battle of the Somme”. As he finished, those present, including children, symbolically blew whistles, the signal for soldiers to “go over the top” and advance on the German lines, only to be mown down. It is the first time in  years the crater’s owner Richard Dunning could not attend the annual event in Northern France.

The disturbing incident took place in the city of Piripa, Brazil, just  days after twins Anne and Analu were born. Local media reports their mother Elaine Novais heard a sound coming from the room the twins were in while chatting to a neighbour. She was horried to find a their family dog attacking her daughters. She managed to rip the dog off them and called a family friend who is a nurse to help the tots. Mrs Novais, a council worker who had struggled to conceive for nine years, pulled the violent dog away from the twins, but it had already inflicted fatal damage on their abdomens.  She gave the girls first aid before they were taken to Maria Pedreira Barbosa Municipal Hospital, with doctors saying one of the girls was declared on arrival, whilst the other was in a serious condition. Doctors tried all they could but could not save the second girl’s le. The doctor at the hospital who was responsible for Elaine during her pregnancy said the mother had always shown adequate care for her babies.  The local council said in a statement: Faced with this immeasurable loss, we express our condolences and sympathy with parents Elaine and Regis, and their friends and family in this moment of sadness and pain. May God comfort your hearts and give you the strength to transform all the pain of this irreparable loss into faith and hope. The local authorities have said they do not plan to launch an investigation into the incident.  An unnamed family member told local media the dog - believed to be a Labrador cross -  was normally docile. We think that with the birth of the twins, the animal was left out in a way, and it no longer had the attention and affection of its owners provided before.

The line I had pasta tonight is not someone who is talking about what they had for dinner but is instead a cry for help. Other phrases used include I finished my shampoo and conditioner at the same time and are often used by TikTok users. One Reddit user believes the words have been taken from Hannah Dainsapos poem aposDonapost Kill Yourself Todayapos, which explains why a person struggling with depression should choose to stay alive. One line reads “finish your shampoo and conditioner at the same time” and another says to “tell someone your best pasta recipe.” Although some TikTok users actually talk about pasta or shampoo, many others post about these items for completely dferent reasons. But the comments to these meaningful posts can be powerful. One TikTok video captioned “Told my mom about my favorite pasta recipe and she made it for dinner tonight” received over three million views and , comments — all of which can be summed up by one user’s comment: “This comment section is my new therapy. Thank you.” “You’re so loved,” one person replied. “You haven’t come this far to only come this far,” another posted.“I love you all so much it’s beyond words,” the poster commented. “Thank you so much.

He is a victim of this global pandemic.“It is a tough one for me and the players but it is even tougher for Jimmy and Cammy, who has also left the club.“It is an absolute gutter for the two of them. But no one could have predicted how this virus would affect clubs like ours.”The Dark Blues are all but certain to promote first-team coach Dave Mackay to take over as number two but no decision has been made yet.McPake made the point that he has other things on his mind right now.“I think it is too early to say what will happen,” said McPake.“Thatis not what’s in my head just now.“What I am thinking about is losing members of staff due to cost-cutting measures.”McPake yesterday confirmed he will not be involved in pay cut talks between the club and its players.The Dark Blues’ squad members have been asked to agree to salary reductions of around % and while Meekings said no and headed off to pastures new, experienced midfielder Paul McGowan has gone the other way and agreed to stay.McPake stressed it will be up to iniduals to do what is best for themselves and their families, and the pay discussions will be done at managing director level by John Nelms.He said: “I can confirm that there have been talks about deductions but that’s for iniduals and that’s way above me.“That’s something that I am not really involved in and, evenI were, it wouldn’t be fair for me to speak about as we are talking about people’s livelihoods and salaries.“Cuts have been offered but what each inidual’s cut is, that’s private between them and whoever is dealing with it at the club.“It will just be inidualised. Theymay come back to the club with dferent ideas, I don’t know.“They might all come back and say yes or they might say no. It is a tough one for me to predict and, as for a deadline, I genuinely don’t know.”Askedthe coaching staff had also been asked to take a pay cut, the Dens boss replied: “That’s not something I will go into.”As for Meekings, there were definitely no hard feelings towards the defender from his now former gaffer.McPake added: “Meeks is gone and that’s a shame because he did great for me as captain of this club.“He was offered a deal and it was his choice to say whether it was acceptable or not.“He chose to reject it but I wish him well for the future.“It is sad to see him go but I fully understand decisions that people make, particularly under the circumstances we are in with the pandemic.“I have no bad words to say about him at all.”On a brighter note, McPake was understandably upbeat regarding McGowan’s decision to say yes to his new terms.He said: “I am delighted that he committed himself to the club.“Gowser is a leader without even realising he is a leader.“He might moan a lot on the pitch at times but that is because he has high standards and he is often the one to express an opinion when he thinks the players are not hitting those high standards.“At times like these, you need people with character at your club and Gowser certainly has that.“He never shirks responsibility and that is why he has such real affinity with the Dundee fans.“I think the talks with him were over and done within a day or so.

He really liked the club and the region where the club are based. It was just a good fit between the club and Steve himself.#Our area in Holland is full of people who are down to earth and Steve loved that. He#d gone from the pressure of getting the sack from England and all the attention that carried with it, to a small region in the east of Holland which is very quiet and he relished that.#The club was well run and well organised. You can ask anyone in Enschede and they all have nothing but positive things to say about Steve.#Hopefully, it will be the same with him and Dundee United too.#Brama says McClaren wouldn’t go into Tannadice and make wholesale changes – and he raved about the former Middlesbrough manager#s man-management skills.He recalled: #Steve had two periods with us as manager and, of course, he won us the league for the first time in our history in his first time at the club.#Him being manager made it a very, very positive experience for me.#When he first came in, the important thing for him was not to change everything straight away. In the beginning, he didn#t change a lot of things, he just observed.#He also didn#t bring in his own coaches, he kept the very good Dutch coaches we had at the club. He had Erik ten Hag, who is now Ajax manager, at the club as a coach and Alfred Schreuder as his assistant manager, who went on to manage Hoffenheim in the Bundesliga.#So he used the coaches who were there and their knowledge and allowed the coaches here to do their job without interference and that certainly helped too.#He was a great manager for us. He was liked and respected by the players, coaches, everyone at the club in a very good way. He was the boss and everyone knew it.#For me as a player, he was fantastic. I was out of the team when Steve arrived because there were two new players who were in my position.#But he played me in a game against Arsenal in Europe when he needed a more defensive midfielder and I played just about every game since then.#He could trust me. I was only  at the time and I liked that he showed enough confidence in me as a young player to discuss tactics with me.#It was a very Dutch way to work and it was another example of how he adapted. He wanted to integrate with the Dutch way of playing, training and thinking and that#s what made him a big success.#Hopefully, he will be as big a success at Dundee United as he was at Twente.#LEE WILKIE: Malky Mackay#s past mistakes are well-documented#he deserves the chance to be Dundee United manager\" title\"#LEE WILKIE: Malky Mackay#s past mistakes are well-documented#he deserves the chance to be Dundee United manager# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp lee-wilkie-malky-mackay-dundee-united embed # secretlLVCwFjUQ\" data-secret\"lLVCwFjUQ\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Wearing them can drastically reduce the spread of Covid-. It has been shown to work in other countries, and it can work here too –people would only wear them. So it was concerning to see images of so few people heeding this aspect of advice from the Scottish Government.“So many people have done so well for so long in taking the steps necessary to suppress this virus. Wearing a face covering is no more inconvenient than washing your hands regularly or remaining physically distanced, yet too many people seem unwilling to take this easy step.“It is always a last resort to impose restrictions on people, ideally you want to take the public with you without the need for legislation. But this virus is not going away, it is still highly contagious, and wearing a face covering can drastically reduce the chances of it spreading out of control.“I have been struck by how many people have got in touch with me to say how nervous they are to go outdoors because the majority of people are opting to shop without a face covering. I think this is an issue for our elderly citizens, who are after all at most risk. I also thing we owe it to our shop workers to do what we can to protect them.“We have a chance in Scotland to eliminate the virus, to get to a stage where it can be managed while we live a new normal way of le. But not wearing face coverings makes that prospect hugely more dficult to realise. That’s why I’ve written to the first minister, and why I hope they take a step I’m sure we hoped they wouldn’t have to.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

In addition, a payment of £, was made in relation to the former principal, for #outplacement support#.#Sir Ian, who is now the head of the Office for National Statistics, is now being asked to£, to Aberdeen University.A working group set up the university’s governing body recommended asking Sir Ian for the money.Esther Roberton, senior governor at Aberdeen University, said: “Following publication of the Scottish Funding Council’s review into the payment made to the university’s former principal, a small internal working group was formed to undertake a review and address findings of that report.“Court # the university’s governing body # met yesterday and considered the working group’s report. A series of actions to be taken by the university in response to the SFC report, around responsibilities, guidelines and governance procedures, were approved.“Court also resolved that as the SFC had required the university to repay a proportion of its grant in respect of the settlement made to the former principal, we should invite him to consider a repayment of the same amount to the university. The university repaid £, to the SFC in February.“Decisions reported on in the SFC review were taken three years ago. Now the university has new leadership and is progressing with a new strategic vision.”North-east Labour MSP Lewis Macdonald said: “When the university repaid £, to the SFC following the review it effectively meant that it was the staff and students that were paying for the mistakes made by the previous leadership.“It’s entirely reasonable therefore that the university under new leadership is attempting to recoup the money from the former principal. I hope Sir Ian will agree that the staff and students at Aberdeen University should not lose out.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"midweek joy for golfer david","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDavid Ronald took the honours in the first midweek stableford at Tarbert Golf Club, with a fantastic score of  points.He was on target to break  for the first time but finished with a double bogey for a , still a great score.

Theyrsquore because of public reaction and public perception of Tourettersquos.ldquoThe fact that Irsquom ticking doesnrsquot make me depressed and it doesnrsquot make me anxious.\"Itrsquos how other people react. Itrsquos only such a huge part of my le because of other people.ldquoItrsquos instinctive for people to turn around and look, but it doesnrsquot take away from the fact that it makes me feel uncomfortable and embarrassed over something that I cannot control.It was not only the tics that made Jack stand out from the crowd during childhood.As a gay teenager, he says he struggled to make any male friends because of his sexuality, which he has never hidden.And the struggles, although manesting in dferent forms, have continued into young adult le.As a result of years of relentless twitching and involuntary leg movements, Jack is battling chronic muscle pain and nausea.Cognitive behaviour therapy reiki reflexology ndash Jack has tried everything to relieve the pain but to little avail.He is prescribed strong painkillers, and at times has had to keep his neck in a brace because of his tics.,params: .pushWhen attempting to enter bars or nightclubs, bouncers sometimes reject him because they believe he is under the influence of illegal drugs.Alcohol consumption can trigger his tics, making them more prominent and frequent.Even in university lectures, he sometimes must call out people for continually turning around and staring at him, despite knowing his condition.Jack insists that suffering from Tourette syndrome has given him a ldquothick skin\".He has always felt fully supported by his parents but has chosen to be independent from a young age, refusing to let his condition prevent him from doing the things he wants to achieve.Attending doctors appointments on his own from the age of , Jack preferred to handle everything by himself.In his third year at Peebles High School, Jack ran a public campaign and was successfully elected as a Member of the Scottish Youth Parliamentfor the region.He said: ldquoI ran because Irsquove always been interested in social issues and wanted to meet like-minded people, which I sometimes felt starved of growing up.ldquoI think I would be a really confident, extroverted guy without my tics ndash they are the one thing holding me back.Since his darkest days battling anxiety and depression, Jack has made friends andhad part-time jobs in bars in Peebles and Edinburgh.Mental health struggles may have stolen parts of Jacks childhood ndash and he continues to live in the spotlight of Tourettersquos ndash but it hasnrsquot stopped him embracing student le."},{"url":null,"title":"primary-school-galashiels-records-bruno-mars-cover","story":"A GALASHIELS primary school has recorded its own version of a Bruno Mars song to mark the

flights to European countries are expected to resume from next month in a bid to kick-start the tourist economy.This is what you need to know about air bridges and travelling abroad.What are air bridges Also known as travel corridors, air bridges will allow Britons to go on holiday to certain destinations without needing to quarantine for  days on theirto the UK.Which countries are likely to be included The Government is expected to announce next week Britainrsquos first air bridges with ldquolow-risk European destinations, including France, Italy, Spain, Greece and Germany.According to reports, air bridges will be announced in batches, with the second set of destinations likely to include other European countries such as Denmark, Norway, Finland and Holland and ldquolow-risk Caribbean islands.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said air bridges would only be agreed with countries which have a coronavirus test and trace system of the same standard as that used in Britain.When will air bridges be introduced The first air bridges to low-risk countries could be in force from July , but Mr Shapps said no announcement will be made until June  when the quarantine measures will be officially reviewed.Which countries are unlikely to be included There were mixed reports over whether Portugal would be included in the UKrsquos plans next week after a spike in coronavirus cases in the country.Long-haul flights to destinations such as Vietnam, Singapore, Hong Kong are reportedly not expected before late summer.Flights to Australia are thought to be more complicated due to the need to stop over in other countries, which increases the risk of contracting or spreading coronavirus.What are the rules on quarantine Since June , all passengers ndash bar a handful of exemptions ndash have been required to go into self-isolation for  days when they arrive in the UK.People who fail to comply can be fined pound, in England, and police are allowed to use ldquoreasonable force to

passengers.Edinburgh Airport has implemented a colour-coded one-way system to maintain social distancing, while protective screens have been installed at check-in, security and arrivals, and staff wear face coverings and personal protective equipmentin ldquopassenger-facing areas.At Gatwick Airport, hand sanitiser stations, protective screens, regular deep cleaning and social distancing instructions have been introduced throughout the site, with face mask vending machines selling four masks for pound.Pre-booked airport security slots are being trialled at Manchester Airport, in which

% in towns and cities, according to new research.Data gathered on behalf of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairsfound dramatic drops in nitrogen oxides and nitrogen dioxide between the start of lockdown and April .While the positive effects of the shutdown on air quality was not felt evenly across the country, urban environments saw drops in the levels of nitrogen oxides of between % to % on average.There is signicant evidence these gasses exacerbate and may even cause asthma over time, and have been linked to heart disease, diabetes and may have an impact on birth outcomes.Nitrogen dioxide also dropped by an average % to % in urban centres, with the greatest falls recorded at roadsides.The gas was of particular interest to scientists during the coronavirus pandemic because it inflames the lungs and can reduce immunity to lung infections.One of the biggest drivers in the drop in pollutants is believed to be road traffic, which fell by % over the period in question according to the Department for Transport.The data was published following a call for evidence by Defrarsquos Air Quality Expert Group.More than  organisations submitted data by the close

quality on viral infection.It said it would ldquonot be surprisingthere was a link between an inidualrsquos exposure to air pollution and the occurrence or the severity of Covid- infection.But it added: ldquoSuch studies require very careful control for confounding influences, and further work is needed before there can be confidence in their findings.Another of the initial findings was a % drop in daytime carbon dioxide emissions in central London, and around % across the country.While not a gas of specic concern to lung health, the report said it can act as a marker for ldquooverall reduction in fossil fuel combustion from all sources and associated pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and fine particulate matter.The reportrsquos authors warned much of the data obtained has yet to

all well behaved but a small minority have been engaging in signicant anti-social behaviourand disorder.North Berwick, Tranent and Longniddry have caused us some issues recently, with intoxicated youths verbally abusing passers-by, vandalising items, smashing bottles and leaving a mess behind. This is not acceptable.East Lothian Countryside Rangers have reported a signicant rise in rubbish, empty alcohol bottles, broken tents and ious other items on our beaches and parks.When you visit the coastal areas, you expect it to be clean, tidy and safe, and the Rangers do an exceptional job keeping up with the disgusting mess left behind.However, what they are now regularly cleaning up is way beyond what should ever be expected.During a clear up at Longniddry Bents last week,  canisters of nitrous oxide, or laughing gas, were found discarded, along with hundreds of empty alcohol bottles. This appears to be a trend amongst youngsters, to get a temporary high, and as a parent of two young girls I find this extremely concerning.You may see these small finger-sized silver canisters in parks or discarded in the street.I wanted to provide some information on this gas to help you understand the risks so you can explain these to your children.Inhaling the gas slows down messages between the brain and body, causing temporary feelings of calmness and joy.Negative effects can include dizziness, headaches or fainting. It can also cause confusion and cloud judgement. Sometimes the user can see or hear things that arenrsquot real. The risks include it preventing the ability to breathe and, in extreme cases, death.It can cause the heart rate to beat irregularly, increasing the risk of heart failure, and heavy use has been linked to vitamin B deficiency which can cause nerve damage. The user can also become confused and panicky, which may lead to accidents.This is not something we want our children and young people experimenting with. This is a gas that dentists and medical professionals use under controlled conditions to sedate patients for minor medical procedures.I have arranged a multi-agency meeting to raise awareness of the risks and to prevent someone from becoming ill, injured or dying from this.Please talk to your children and discuss the dangers of these canisters and the impact of ASB.Eventhey havenrsquot been part of the group, they may know who has.

Britons to go on holiday to certain destinations without needing to quarantine for  days on theirto the UK.Which countries are likely to be included The Government is expected to announce next week Britainrsquos first air bridges with ldquolow-risk European destinations, including France, Italy, Spain, Greece and Germany.According to reports, air bridges will be announced in batches, with the second set of destinations likely to include other European countries such as Denmark, Norway, Finland and Holland and ldquolow-risk Caribbean islands.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said air bridges would only be agreed with countries which have a coronavirus test and trace system of the same standard as that used in Britain.When will air bridges be introduced The first air bridges to low-risk countries could be in force from July , but Mr Shapps said no announcement will be made until June  when the quarantine measures will be officially reviewed.Which countries are unlikely to be included There were mixed reports over whether Portugal would be included in the UKrsquos plans next week after a spike in coronavirus cases in the country.Long-haul flights to destinations such as Vietnam, Singapore, Hong Kong are reportedly not expected before late summer.Flights to Australia are thought to be more complicated due to the need to stop over in other countries, which increases the risk of contracting or spreading coronavirus.What are the rules on quarantine Since June , all passengers ndash bar a handful of exemptions ndash have been required to go into self-isolation for  days when they arrive in the UK.People who fail to comply can be fined pound, in England, and police are allowed to use ldquoreasonable force to make sure they follow the rules.What measures have airports taken Last month, Heathrow Airport began trialling thermal screening technology to detect elevated temperatures of arriving passengers.Edinburgh Airport has implemented a colour-coded one-way system to maintain social distancing, while protective screens have been installed at check-in, security and arrivals, and staff wear face coverings and personal protective equipmentin ldquopassenger-facing areas.At Gatwick Airport, hand sanitiser stations, protective screens, regular deep cleaning and social distancing instructions have been introduced throughout the site, with face mask vending

who questioned whether the council would use the money to introduce long-term changes proposed before lockdown which brought mixed reactions form the public.One person on social media accused them of using a ldquoback door to get what they want.While Haddington councillor Craig Hoy warned that improvements had to be made without creating unnecessary restrictionsHe said: ldquoIt is important that our high streets are capable of allowing pedestrians to be able to socially distance, giving people the confidence to get out and about.ldquoBut, at the same time, itrsquos important we donrsquot

called for pavements to be widened and speed reductions on some streets, as well as improved cycle lanes and footpaths.The council initially said it was applying for pound, from the Spaces for People

said detailed plans of the changes to be introduced were still being discussed and no maps or additional information were currently available.However, it said a staged approach would be taken, with measures to be introduced including temporary widening of some footways, mph speed limits, some segregated space for cycling and opportunities for businesses to use pavement space for customer

decade, all eyes will be on the skies early on Sunday morning.Here, we bring you everything you need to know ahead of the penumbral lunar eclipse.A penumbral lunar eclipse takes place when the moon moves through the faint, outer part of earths shadow.A lunar eclipse happens when the Earth comes between the sun and the moon, therefore blocking some or all of the sunrsquos light from reaching the moon.Therefore, the moon cannot shine ndash because its surface is not reflecting the sunrsquos rays.The eclipse will be visible over ScotlandAccording to TimeAndDate, a penumbral lunar eclipse occurs when the sun, earth and moon are imperfectly aligned.When this happens, the earth blocks some of the sunrsquos light from directly reaching the moonrsquos surface, and covers all or part of the moon with the other part of its shadow.People in Scotland are urged to find an unobstructed area with a free sight to the southwest for a best view of the eclipse.Unlike solar eclipses, which can only be seen along a narrow path from a small part of the earth, eclipses of the moon can be observed all across the night side of earth when the eclipse happens.According to TimeAndDate, these are the local

He knew how to whet my appetite.\"Yet the characters arent the only element getting a makeover: billed as the originals \"spiritual descendant\", the brand-new -part series will transport viewers from Ripper-era London to the Golden Age of Hollywood in  Los Angeles.A time and place deeply infused with social and political tension, the sequel - which opens with a grisly murder - sees detectives Tiago Vegaand Lewis Michenerbattling the citys rich history. From the building of the first freeways and its traditions of Mexican-American folklore, to the dangerous espionage actions of the Third Reich and the rise of radio evangelism.In amongst the uprising, Kinnear plays Dr Peter Craft, a father of two who flits between caring paediatrician and his turn as head of the German-American Bund, an organisation he hopes will keep the United States isolated from the growing threat of war in Europe.\"Peter has a lot in common with a lot of characters in the show in that theyre all complex, conflicted, and struggling to do the right thing whilst coming up against temptation,\" says the star, whos also worked with screenwriter Logan on Bond films Skyfall and Spectre.\"He has a troubled home le, in that his we is an alcoholic and has seemingly cut herself off from looking after their children,\" he continues. \"And his profession is all about looking after kids, so were expecting that [viewers] sympathise with him.\"But obviously in meeting Elsa, the path thats in front of him changes, and as a result the audience may have their sympathies change as well.\"Elsa is just one of a number of guises adopted by Natalie Dormers character, Magda.Dubbed a supernatural demon who can assume the form of anyone she chooses, the Game Of Thrones actress - whose character believes humankind is evil - has her work cut out, as she shts between blonde German housewe Elsa, government assistant Alex, and androgynous freedom fighter Rio.Her goal: to prove her point by nudging the city towards a race war.It was a major endeavour, says the -year-old, \"in so far as its a physical and mental exercise because its four characterisations for the price of one\".\"We realised quite quickly that I had to play them as separate entities becauseyou dont play Elsa and Rio and Alex as fully fleshed out, three-dimensional characters, not only are you doing a disservice to your co-stars, the truth of the entire thing gets completely lost.\"And that actually, speaking in a pure sense as an actor, in terms of craft, its a joy because it means you have a lot of fun playing with the physicality, with voices, accents, and the costume and hair department...\" she notes.\"I was very pleased to be a stage-trained, classically trained British actor because I really did go right back to my training, in order to do this sort of exercise. It was a nice challenge.\"Similarly, Kinnear states: \"I like playing characters with lots of dferent shades [and] Peter comes upon a fairly invincible force in the shape of Elsa and Magda.\"But we dont know how much strength he has in him to withstand that temptation,\" he teases. \"You see over the course of the  episodes that he does try, and hes also trying to stand up to the more radical, Nazi wing of the German-American Bund as well, to try and make the claim for peace.\"Peter is almost the inverse of the Creature, really he is trying desperately to push down his true identity and create someone completely anew. Whereas the Creature was in constant search of his origin and identity.\"\"Magda has this theory that all mankind needs to become the monster he truly is, is to be told that he can, Dormer follows.\"For me, theres a bit of a premise that good people do bad things, whether its to do with threatening their family, their country or their vulnerability. Its that philosophical question of what it takes to bring out the uglier side in all of us.\"As for the shows key political themes - take othering, racism, and isions in society, for example - it seems theyre as relevant today as they ever were.\"What this shows is that all the tensions and dficulties of any large city, which has had a history of oppressing minority groups, have not gone away, and that they will continue to resurfacetheyre not fully addressed or addressed honestly,\" recognises Kinnear.Can he pinpoint a link between the first iteration and this \"I think its that focus on how the supernatural plays out in real peoples lives and the strength of feeling that it can still provoke not only in the s, but today as well,\" he muses.\"The first Penny Dreadful was all about the monsters that lie within us and it was using largely pre-existing literary characters,\" reasons the father of two.\"This one focuses on that same thing, but also the sense of no matter how much you study and learn, there are things that exist beyond us, beyond our comprehension, which we try to give names to.\"That can lead to fears, whether irrational or not, but it can also give succour and strength as well.\"Is there room for another series \"John is always several steps ahead,\" Kinnear finishes. \"Not only is he so extraordinarily prolic in terms of all the output that he has, across so many dferent disciplines, he really enjoys it - and Penny Dreadful was his first time doing long-form TV!\"There are lots of surprises thrown up in that, but you do have to plan your first three series because thats always the hope!\"Watch all episodes of Penny Dreadful: City Of Angels on Sky Atlantic and streaming service NOW TV from Wednesday, July ."},{"url":null,"title":"Opinion  Marianne Taylor  We   re all public health guinea pigs now    but that   s just the way it has to be","story":"Irsquove also started planning a wee holiday up north and have booked a hairdressersrsquo appointment.

Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus. Uncertainty permeates through every part of our lives now, and we must find ways to live with and even embrace thiswe are to make it through the tough months ahead.

The mood music is not great. Last week, the UKrsquos chief negotiator castigated the EU on Twitter for ldquounrealistic positions that ldquowill have to change while re-stating the UKrsquos ideological positioning on its sovereignty.Covid- is, of course, the centre of political and public attention. But that doesnrsquot mean there is public support for the type of hard Brexit that Boris Johnson and his Brexiters want. In fact, a recent Kantar poll found % of UK voters now back remaining in the EU. But the UK has left the EU, so \"remain\" is not possible ndash only a rather unlikely re-join option .\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Brexit briefing:  days until the end of the transition period\",\"description\": \"Brexit briefing:  days until the end of the transition period\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media DtdhjwmQ poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests DtdhjwmQ.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": :Kirsty Hughes: Scotland needs to start working now to cement its Euro credentialsBut, in Scotland, the re-join option is not so unlikely nor absent from debate. Independence in the European Union is the Scottish Governmentrsquos clear, long-standing position. Any independent European state can indeed apply to join the EU ndash and despite plenty of hoops to jump through, there is, for now, plenty of goodwill in EU capitals towards Scotland.Meanwhile, in London, Keir Starmer is playing a cautious game on the EU-UK talks ndash hanging back, unlike the other opposition parties, from calling for a two-year extension of transition. Doubtless, Starmer will be ready to critique any basic free trade deal that emerges. But he is playing a long game, and any clear position on Labourrsquos preferred EU-UK deal is not obviously in the offing.In contrast, the Scottish Governmentrsquos Brexit policies are many and ied ndash from independence in the EU to keeping the whole UK in the EUrsquos customs union and single market, or keeping Scotland alone in the single market, or devolving migration policy to enable something akin to free movement of people.But, with deliberate continuity from Theresa May to Boris Johnson, the UK Government has chosen not to engage in any serious way with the devolved administrations. May and Johnson never tried to mend the Brexit ide across the UKrsquos four nations ndash their focus was solely on their core voters and their own backbenchers.So the Brexit fragmentation of the UK has deepened over the last four years, not least since Brexit day on January . Scotland not only voted Remain, together with Northern Ireland, four years ago, but the European debate here remains substantively dferent too.And itrsquos a debate that is intimately intertwined with the independence debate. A recent poll put support for independence at % ndash others have shown a smaller majority or a : split. One factor behind the increase in support for independence is previously pro-UK, Remain voters switching to Yes. While the Conservatives drive Brexit forward and Labour has accepted it, in Scotland, the SNPrsquos option of re-joining the EU will stay a core part of political debate and dynamics.This fundamental dference in English and Scottish political debates is there too in the more specic aspects of the EU-UK talks. The UK Government continues to reject EU demands for a level-playing field to ensure neither side undercuts the other on environmental and labour standards or state aids. Johnsonrsquos agreement, in last autumnrsquos EU-UK political declaration, to negotiate a level-playing field has been discarded by this most ideological of governments.:Kirsty Hughes: Brexit, lies and the Johnson charadeBut the Scottish Government wants its own partial level-playing field in devolved areas, including replicating EU environmental standards as far as possible. How that will play out in the context of other UK trade deals or in UK-devolved politics is an open question.The EU-UK talks are also blocked over fisheries, over judicial and police co-operation, and on overall governance and dispute settlement. Any hints of progress on the technical side in the talks are soon halted by new political pronouncements from London. And consultation between UK and Scottish governments remains non-existent beyond some granular technical discussions between officials.Yet, despite the UK bluster, a deal is perhaps slightly more likely than a no deal outcome. If London can portray a major compromise on its side, with a small sht by Brussels, as EU capitulation, then late October might see a deal ndash allowing time for the European parliament to raty it.But a deal will be thin and damaging. It will re-establish customs and regulatory barriers to trade it will hit the services sector particularly hard. It will slow growth and reduce investment compared to staying closer to the EU. And a no deal outcome will create more chaos and a harder economic hit ndash albeit with the withdrawal agreement still in place, so EU citizensrsquo settled status and the special deal for Northern Ireland will remain.A UK publicity campaign is due in July ndash pushing iniduals and organisations to prepare for the end of transition.

The tourism industry will reopen in full on July .However, the Arran Ferry Action Group says some tourism businesses on the island are deciding whether to ldquohunker down and remain in mothballs until next year.Sam Bourne, a spokesman for the group, said: ldquoI know some businesses have decided not to reopen, hotels, guest houses, and self-catering accommodation providers. They do not have the confidence to hire staff, they do not have the confidence to buy stock and consumables to feed people.ldquoTo ramp up to open you have to spend money that there is no guarantee you will get back.He added: ldquoEvenit [tourism] is back up and running [businesses are worried] they wonrsquot have enough revenue to cover costs.The timetable brought in by CalMac on Sunday increases the number of daily sailings undertaken by the MV Caledonian Isles between Ardrossan and Brodick to five from two, and restores a service on Sundays, with four sailings on those days. However, because of the two-metre social distancing rule, the vessel will still only run at about  per cent of its usual , capacity.While as many as , passengers are normally ferried between Arran and the mainland per day in July, numbers are currently limited to .Mr Bourne said that eventhe service s to its usual summer frequency after the tourism industry reopens on July , the reduced capacity means it may not be viable for businesses on Arran to reopen.In addition to the limitations on capacity, Mr Bourne said the new timetable exacerbates the situation facing Arran locals because CalMac will no longer reserve spaces for people who need to travel to the mainland for vital medical appointments.He noted that by the time people receive notice of medical appointments, which is often less than one week in advance, the  places for the key morning sailing off the island andcrossing will already have been taken.Mr Bourne said this contrasts with the position for residents on the Western Isles, who he said have been given a commitment that places will always be made available for people travelling for medical appointments.Mr Bourne said: ldquoThere is no guarantee [for people on Arran]. Is there a special deal for the Western Isles  This is critical. The backlog for medical appointments is huge.Meanwhile, the Arran Ferry Action Group has welcomed confirmation from CalMac that it will permit passengers to stay in their vehicles on the crossing between Lochranza on Arran and Claonaig on the Kintyre peninsula when it resumes on July , after securing an exemption from the Marine and Coastguard Agency . The route is served by the MV Catriona.Mr Bourne said: ldquoWe are slowly making progress, [but] even the north ferry is  passengers maximum and one sailing a day. It is marginal.The intervention from the group comes after it warned earlier this month that ferry capacity constraints due to coronavirus were making le on the island ldquounsustainable.A spokesman for Transport Scotland said the organisation has worked with CalMac to try and move from the essential leline timetable introduced during lockdown to a ldquoshoulderrsquo timetable by July . ldquoHowever, capacity challenges will remain as a result of physical distancing requirements on vessels that are required to protect public health and to ensure compliance with MCA regulations also, he added.The spokesman said CalMac will retain % capacity for ldquoturn up and go travel after consulting islanders who raised concerns over securing space for ldquofamily visits and other allowable trips."},{"url":null,"title":"Opinion  Rosemary Goring  Why the Border must regain its old role as the country   s first line of defence","story":"Yet she is clearly unsettled at the idea of some kind of checkpoint on the A, A, or whichever route she might take. Speculation over testing or quarantining travellers between England and Scotland has been raised as part of a discussion of how to prevent infection from a neighbour with a higher incidence of Covid  than here. As a result, almost overnight the Border has begun to assume a signicance it has not held for centuries.:Thousands back petition to close Scottish border to all but essential trafficThis pandemic might one day be viewed as a textbook illustration of the geopolitical fault lines across the UK. What was once a united front has splintered into four distinct nations, each with a dferent solution to the same problem. Nothing more starkly demonstrates the gulf between the laissez-faire ethos of the Westminsterrsquos panjandrums and the commonsensical attitude at Holyrood than the ways in which they have eased restrictions.The increasingly relaxed English regime appears to be fuelled by wishful thinking rather than science the Scottish situation, meanwhile, is characterised by caution. Long before talk of checkpoints, this was already causing tension. When Englandrsquos routemap out of lockdown was weeks ahead of Scotland, John Lamont, Conservative MP for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk, said those of his constituents close to Borisrsquos bailiwick were confused. Why did one rule apply to their very near neighbours, and another to them The answer seemed obvious ndash it was far too soon to relax ndash but the question vividly demonstrated the nature of this area. Many who live where Hadrianrsquos men boldly marched have a foot in both countries. They might work in one, and live in the other, hail from this side and have relocated to that. They could have family and friends in either camp, who remained out of reach for so long as the Scottish government prohibited meeting.Those Border villagers who defied lockdown to visit a garden centre in Berwick were making a political rather than a horticultural statement. In this, they echoed attitudes since the days of the great reiving clans, who roamed freely on both banks of the Tweed. The Scottish and English kings were so appalled at the regionrsquos lawlessness that, despite being sworn enemies, they worked in tandem to subdue it.Given the way Borderers were treated by their lieges, itrsquos no surprise they thumbed their noses. These days, towns and villages are awash with folk from both sides, thereby creating a unique and strongly bonded region. Little wonder Unionism still pertains hereabouts.:Tourists from England could face -day quarantine in ScotlandCovid- cases flareThat there have been no deaths from Covid  in Scotland for the past few days suggests we are heading in the right direction. But there is a long way still to go. The First Ministerrsquos aim is to eradicate the virus, not merely contain it. Seeing the daily tally of new cases and deaths in England, she seeks confirmation that the Prime Minister has the same objective. But, as she said earlier this week, without such assurances she fears Englandrsquos strategy is ldquoletting it circulate at higher levels as long as it doesnrsquot threaten to overwhelm the NHS.If that is indeed the case, then monitoring passage between the countries is in some respects no dferent from policies implemented by a place like New Zealand. It initially imposed an outright ban on entry, followed later by quarantine on new arrivals. The problem is, as a devolved nation within a union, the consequences of such a step are potentially inflammatory. Some will view it as independence by stealth, a confrontational declaration of autonomy, or simply authoritarianism run rampant. Yet with a summer of staycations approaching, the repercussions of allowing untrammelled travel could be dire.Before the prospect of imposing controls was mooted, people around where I live in Roxburghshire have been scowling at visitors from only a few miles away, let alone the depths of the English shires. When a couple of walkers dared ask a neighbour directions over the hills last week, they narrowly avoided a tirade.The idea of the Border ing to its roots as a frontier inevitably creates a troubling sense of Them and Us, or Friend and Foe. Affront will be taken at any restriction on free transit between south and north. Presumably residents of Scotland who visit England will also be tested or quarantined on their , making it a two-way injunction. Suddenly a weekend break in Northumberland looks a lot less appealing.:YouGov Poll: Half of Conservative voters in England support English independenceYet how exactly would it work  Is it only tourists who will be checked, or will those travelling back and forth for work, be they lorry drivers or business reps, also be subject to testing  Will every road, rail and sea route across the Border from Berwick to Workington be patrolled  Might we see a surge in midnight crossings over no-manrsquos land and rivers, four-by-fours finally justying their existence and canoes retrofitted to ferry families plus their luggage across the Tweed As things stand, there have been no new cases of the virus in the Scottish Borders in two weeks. This beautul, windswept district is starting to feel like a cordon sanitaire, a buffer between the haves and,not precisely the have-nots, then a population beginning slowly but steadily to paralyse the disease.Given our reputation as one of the sickest countries in Europe, we need to take every precaution to protect lives. Reimposing the Border as a barrier and guard would not be popular, and the war-time and military resonances are unsettling. Yet, in light of the high risk of contagion still posed by parts of the south, in the short term it would make sense. If the first thing passengers see as they arrive is not a sig welcoming them to Scotland but an NHS squad, then for the first time since  ndash the last pitched battle between England and Scotland ndash the Border will have regained its old role as the countryrsquos first line of defence.All columnists are free to express their opinions.

happens when the Earth comes between the sun and the moon, therefore blocking some or all of the sunrsquos light from reaching the moon.Therefore, the moon cannot shine ndash because its surface is not reflecting the sunrsquos rays.The eclipse will be visible over ScotlandAccording to TimeAndDate, a penumbral lunar eclipse occurs when the sun, earth and moon are imperfectly aligned.When this happens, the earth blocks some of the sunrsquos light from directly reaching the moonrsquos surface, and covers all or part of the moon with the other part of its shadow.People in Scotland are urged to find an unobstructed area with a free sight to the southwest for a best view of the eclipse.Unlike solar eclipses, which can only be seen along a narrow path from a small part of the earth, eclipses of the moon can be observed all across the night side of earth when the eclipse happens.According to TimeAndDate, these are the local times to see the penumbral lunar

Competition and Markets Authority said a new regime should have the power to fine both new media giants for any anti-competitive behaviour.The regulator said its existing powers were insufficient and an entirely new approach was needed.It even wants powers to restrict Googlersquos ability to secure its place as the default search engine on mobile devices and browsers in order to introduce more choice for users.And it wants Google to open up its click and query data to rival search engines.The recommendation to government is the result of a year-long examination of the markets which uncovered the power of Google and Facebook online.It said there was a \"potential barrier\" to new competition and that together Google and Facebook \"work to reinforce each other and are extremely dficult to overcome\".\"The scale and nature of these issues mean that a new pro-competition regulatory regime is needed so that users can continue to benefit from innovative new services rival businesses can compete on a level playing field and publishers do not find their revenues unduly squeezed,\" it said.UK spending on digital advertising was around poundbn in , equivalent to about pound per household - with % of that earned by just two companies - Google and Facebook.Google enjoys a more than % share of the pound. billion search advertising market in the UK, while Facebook has a share of over % of the pound. billion display advertising market.Googlersquos revenue per search has more than doubled since , while Facebookrsquos average revenue per user has increased from less than pound in  to over pound in .CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli said: Through our examination of this market, we have discovered how major online s like Google and Facebook operate and how they use digital advertising to fuel their business models. What we have found is concerning ndashthe market power of these firms goes unchecked, people and businesses will lose out.\"People will carry on handing over more of their personal data than necessary, a lack of competition could mean higher prices for goods and services bought online and we could all miss out on the benefits of the next innovative digital .\"Our clear recommendation to government is that a new pro-competitive regulatory regime be established to address the concerns we have identied and regulate a sector which is central to all our lives.\"The CMA say that Google and Facebooks large user base is a source of \"market power\".It means that Facebook is a ldquomust-have network for users to remain in contact with each other, and enables Google to train its search algorithms in ways that other search engines cannot.\"Each has unmatchable access to user data, allowing them to target advertisements to inidual consumers and tailor the services they provide,\" the regulator said.\"Both use default settings to nudge people into using their services and giving up their data.\"It said Google paid around pound.bn in  to be the default search provider on mobile devices and browsers in the UK, while Facebook requires people to accept personalised advertising as a condition for using their service.But the regulator added: \"Their presence across many dferent markets, partially acquired through many acquisitions over the years, also makes it harder for rivals to compete.\"These issues matter to consumers. Weak competition in search and social media leads to reduced innovation and choice, as well as to consumers giving up more data than they would like.\"Further,the poundbn spend in the UK last year on digital advertising is higher than it would be in a more competitive market, this will be felt in the prices for hotels, flights, consumer electronics, books, insurance and many other products that make heavy use of digital advertising. The CMA found that Googlersquos prices are around % to % higher than Bing when comparing like-for-like search terms on desktop and mobile.\"It said that Google and Facebookrsquos market positions also have a profound impact on newspapers and other publishers.The CMA found that newspapers are reliant on Google and Facebook for almost % of all visits to their sites.\"This dependency potentially squeezes their share of digital advertising revenues, undermining their ability to produce valuable content,\" it said.The CMA has proposed that within the new regime a Digital Markets Unit should have the ability to enforce a code of conduct to ensure that s with a position of market power, like Google and Facebook, do not engage in \"exploitative or exclusionary practices\" or in a manner likely to reduce trust and transparency, and to impose finesnecessary.It wants powers to restrict Googlersquos ability to secure its place as the default search engine on mobile devices and browsers in order to introduce more choice for users.The unit should also have powers to insist Facebook give consumers a choice over whether to receive personalised advertising.It wants Google to be ordered open up its click and query data to rival search engines to allow them to improve their algorithms so they can properly compete.\"This would be designed in a way that does not involve the transfer of personal data to avoid privacy concerns,\" it said.And it said there should be teeth to insist Facebook increase its \"interoperability\" with competing social media s.The unit would also oversee a ldquofairness-by-design duty on the s to ensure that they are making it \"as easy as possible for users to make meaningful choices\".And it could order the separation of s where necessary to ensure healthy competition.Whilst the recommedations recommendation are UK-focused, many of the problems that the CMA identied were international in nature.So the CMA said it will therefore continue to take a leading role globally in relation to these issues as part of a wider digital strategy."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11540105.jpg?type=article-full","title":"pictures-remembering-princess-diana-scotland-59th-birthday","story":"The Princess of Wales won the hearts of ordinary Scots during her many visits north of the Border.Her charity work, sense of style and dedication to Prince William and Prince Harry made her truly the Peoplersquos Princess.The respect she garnered across the country was put on display following her tragic death in , with thousands of mourners packing out Princes Street Gardens in Edinburgh and George Square in Glasgow to pay tribute.Here, we take look back at Princess Dirsquos most memorable moments in Scotland.The Princess of Walesat the Braemar Highland Games on September .Princess Diana visit to Malcolm Sargent house, Prestwick, September .Princess Dianaat Rottenrow Maternity in the early s.Prince Charles points out someting of intrest to Princess Diana at the Braemar Highland Games inSeptember .Princess Diana is presented with a bunch of white heather at the Braemar HighlandGames inSeptember .Prince Charles and Princess Diana on tram at the Glasgow Garden Festival in .Princess Diana meets the people of Possilpark during a walkabout after her visit to the Possil Drugs Project in .Princess Diana at the opening of the Prince and Princess of Wales Hospice in Cathcart.The Queen, the Queen Mother, Prince Charles and Princess Diana at the Braemar Highland Games in .Princess Diana at the Maryhill community Centre in Glasgow in .Prince Charles and Princess Diana at the Glasgow Garden Festival opening in ."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-sir-toms-vision-scotland-needs-left-leaning-input","story":"First, that it wasnt presented in any way as an attack on the Government , indeed it was gracious in recognition of \"what government does best\". Secondly, I appreciated the reference to the Enlightenment so many people forget about history and what we can and should learn from it. Finally, I was glad that he put an emphasis on small businesses. Weve been doing our best to support independent bakeries, butchers and bookshops, and small restaurants offering takeaway meals, who have continued to trade through the crisis by whatever means they can. Personally I would like to see these businesses thrive, rather than multi-national companies like Tesco and McDonalds.However, I would like to add a couple of points. Sir Tom proposes that business leaders should be in the vanguard of the economic recovery in Scotland he also claries that he is not an economist. But surely economists should also be at the forefront here, with the entrepreneurs,we are really to be led by experts  And please, here, include economists with what might be considered by some to be a more left-leaning vision, such as Ann Pettor , and,we are to include international experts , invite Yanis Varoufakisto contribute his ideas.The other addition I would like to see to Sir Toms proposal would be the nurturing of alternative forms of enterprise. I believe it would be hugely positive for Scotland to see a big increase in social enterprises, whose profits are reinvested for the benefit of society and the environment. Similarly, I would like to see a big growth in co-operatives it could be very useful and informative to look at the successes and achievements of the Mondragon Corporation, which was born in the Basque Country, and now has a presence on five continents. It is a cooperative, but also the biggest company in the Basque country, which now has the most equal distribution of wealth in Europe.Finally, please, please dont forget cultural enterprises . Theatres, music venues, galleries and museums and independent cinemas are all vital to the soul of the nation.Cathy Benson, Edinburgh EH.RECENTLY Herald columnists have taken to comparing the response to the coronavirus crisis of the Scottish Government and governments where in the UK, especially that of England. Recent developments provide them with further ammunition.On the one hand we have Boris Johnson proclaiming a New Deal comparable with that implemented by Franklin Roosevelt in the US in the s. Leaving aside for the moment the fact that Roosevelts programme was far greater in scope than that proposed by Mr Johnson ., what is interesting is that a Tory leader should come forward with such a series of measures in the first place. Where are the calls for a small state  Where are the calls for free markets  What has happened to the Masters of the Universe in the City of London Sir Tom Hunter appears to take a dferent view and, in terms of his economic principles, a more consistent one. In Scotland business must come to the fore and the rest of civil society marginalised with no apparent role or voice for, among others, universities, trade unions, environmental campaigners, political parties or the myriad of pressure groups which campaign on many key issues. It is not, I have to say, a prospect I find appealing.Before the crash in America with soup kitchens and \"bread lines knee deep in wheat\" there was a slogan, \"The Business of America is Business\". Scotland should strive for a broader, more rounded and inclusive view.Brian Harvey, Hamilton.TO put Boris Johnsonrsquos pound billion ldquoNew Deal package into some context, the UK Government is spending pound billion to refurbish the Palace of Westminster, including pound million for a House of Lords rooftop restaurant.Norway, which has produced roughly  per cent more oil and gas than Scotland, plans to spend a record  billion kronerof its sovereign oil wealth fund this year to weather the brutal Covid- downturn and announced a Government Bond Fund providing up to NOK  billionto be invested in bonds issued by Norwegian companies.Fraser Grant, Edinburgh EH.BORIS Johnsonrsquos Recovery Plan is certainly modest incorporating an investment of poundbn when compared to the probable cost of HS at poundbn as predicted by a Government review in Jan . With the changing circumstances brought about by Covid-, how can this project still be justied especially as one of the outcomes of the pandemic may well be less travel and more working from home  These two sums of money are outrageously out of perspective with the needs of the British people at present.Stewart Jamieson, Dumfries.BORIS Johnson is among the most amiable of men, with the gt of the gab. However, his honeyed words seldom come to fruition. His latest speech on his ldquoNew Deal spending plan appears to be no more than fluff shuffling the same pack of cards not one extra penny of spending for England, Scotland, Northern Ireland or Wales, but then, Mr Johnson always promises more than he delivers. And,he had referenced ldquoEngland instead of ldquoUK, it would have been just the same speech.Under the guise of ldquoreform he is also getting rid of the most senior civil servant and National Security Advisor and replacing him with a political appointee. It used to be a commonly shared belief that the impartiality of the civil service was a jewel in the crown of the British State. Thus, for Tory party advantage, the foundations of that British state get a wee bit more shoogly, and our common ldquoSocial Contract less relevant.GR Weir, Ochiltree.NICOLA Sturgeon says she is \"extremely underwhelmed\" by Boris Johnsons economic recovery plan. She needs to look a little closer to home.Whilst her efforts to keep Scots healthy are laudable, her efforts on the economy are far less so, her latest gaffe being damaging the already hard-pressed tourist industry. Kate Forbes, her Finance Secretary, has had to \" request\" extra financial aid from Westminster but this is not helped by the general attitude of the SNP that suggests any refusal will simply be another reason to go for independence.Our current SNP Green government is far too blinded by this prospect to actually notice the reality that,Scotland actually voted for independence, then there are no viable answers to running the finances successfully. Talk is cheap, nothing  is.Ms Sturgeon must stop governing by spurious poll results and deal with the real situation on the ground. Currently we have almost no productive economy to speak of but rapidly rising costs and debts. If Scotland is going to be an independent country soon, then there should be no need to ask Westminster for money. Surely we ought to be demonstrating our own \"economic powerhouse\" abilities right now with the multitude of powers we already possess. Anything less is just an excuse.Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow G.NICOLA Sturgeon has said that she is \"extremely underwhelmed\" by Boris Johnsons post-lockdown spending plans.

It reflects the additional constraints faced by farm businesses in these communities and provides much needed financial stability.“In the midst of a pandemic, with the UK’s impending departure from the EU, there is no lack of challenges facing the farming sector at the moment. At a time of such uncertainty, retaining the benefits that LFASS delivers would seem both sensible and desirable.“The group established by the minister to develop proposals for future farm support post-Brexit is due to report shortly. It is right that consideration is given to the way funding is allocated across the board.“However, as Fergus Ewing rightly acknowledged, LFASS has shown itself to be particularly good at targeting support where it is most needed.  Moreover, in helping sustain farming and crofting in some of our most fragile areas, it also plays a pivotal role in building community cohesion.“These are ‘public goods’ we should value and protect and I am pleased that the minister seems up for the fight in ensuring this happens.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This comes as the prevalence of the condition in the county was predicted to double between  and .Anna Buchanan, of the Le Changes Trust – a charity that invests in and supports three groups, including people living with dementia and their unpaid carers # described the strategy document as an “exemplar for where” and has told members they would be contributing up to £, to support an independent the evaluation of the impact of the strategy.The meeting of the Integration Joint Board , last Wednesday, saw board members agree that the strategy document was a “formidable piece of work” and vital at a time when almost all families in Orkney will be touched by dementia in some respect.Presenting the strategy, Gillian Coghill, NHS Orkney Alzheimer Scotland Clinical Nurse Specialist, outlined the work undertaken and their aspirations for the future. She said: “The purpose of the Orkney Dementia Strategy - is to set out a renewed vision for dementia care and support in Orkney. It draws on a wide range of evidence and inter-related policies, including Scotland’s Third National Dementia Strategy. Most importantly of all, it draws on the experiences and views of people living in Orkney whose lives are affected by dementia. Some of these people are living with dementia and others are unpaid carers, often family, supporting people living with dementia.“There is often a lack of awareness and understanding of dementia, resulting in stigmatisation, inequality and barriers to diagnosis and care. The impact of dementia on carers, family and wider society can be physical, psychological, social and economic. We need to adopt a social model of dementia as a disability, recognising the challenges people with dementia face and affording the same priority to reduce impact, as we do for physical disabilities. Dementia is one of the foremost public health challenges worldwide. There is currently no cure for dementia. However, there are treatments, therapies and supports which are effective in maintaining skills and independence and contributing positively to the experiences of people with dementia and unpaid carers.”With an ageing population within Orkney, a projected increase in numbers of people with dementia presents a range of challenges, not only for the people who develop dementia, and their families and carers, but also for the statutory and voluntary services that provide care and support, Gillian Coghill explained.She said: “If the estimated prevalence rates remain similar, the number of people living with dementia in Orkney is set to almost double between  and , increasing from  to  people. We need to develop innovative ways to build capacity, resilience within financial constraints.”The five-year strategy provides a framework for improvement in support and services for people with a diagnosis of dementia and those who provide unpaid support for them throughout communities in Orkney, Ms Coghill added.“This strategy aspires to highlight the importance of risk reduction, early diagnosis and access to high quality post diagnostic support which is dynamic to needs, strengths and identied personal outcomes for people with dementia.“It recognises the positive contribution and need to support carers, volunteers and staff and has been developed from a grass roots perspective. It supports Community Led Support and the need for integrated systems, which promote enablement and uphold rights for people with dementia, the building of dementia friendly communities and increasing community capacity to enable people with dementia to live well, without stigma as a valued part of their community and in their own homes when possible.“This strategy evidences the importance of planning and developing services and supports for and with people living with dementia. It addresses the challenges involved in meeting the needs of the growing number of people who will be diagnosed with dementia, recognising the unique challenges and strengths of the Orkney community. It supports the right care, in the right place at the right time by the right people.“There is recognition of the need to do things dferently, both in relation to people’s experiences and to ensure a sustainable model of support. We need to work together with all relevant people and groups to design and deliver the best care and support we can. This provides us with an opportunity to make changes which support the appropriate level of priority and investment needed for dementia in Orkney. We need to ensure that dementia is prioritised and kept firmly on the agenda in all relevant policies, procedures and plans.”Members of the IJB approved the strategy and consultation will now take place with key stakeholders, results of which will be presented to the board at a future meeting, no later than September .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The GREAT Inspirations campaign will recognise companies that have gone above and beyond to continue to operate for their employees, serve their customers and contribute to their local communities. Here are some examples of the many thousands of companies that have proved to be an inspiration.Rooms and pamper packages for NHS workers away from their families, prepping more than  meals a week for vulnerable people in the community and projecting light shows every week for Clap for Carers are just some of the things one hotel team has done during the coronavirus outbreak.The team at the Queens Hotel in Southsea have been working hard since lockdown began in March to support everyone in the community across Portsmouth.Duty manager Megan Lockyer has been working with the small team who have welcomed more than  NHS workers to the hotel, which during the Second World War served as a hospital for recovering servicemen, for a place to rest away from their jobs.She said: “I watched the NHS workers come back to the hotel after a challenging day and I really wanted to let them know how much we appreciate what they are doing.“I came up with the idea of making hampers for the NHS workers who are currently with us at the hotel.“I shared my idea with the Facebook group and it was amazing how the community responded.“The NHS staff had told us how sore their hands were due to constant washing and we were able to include aloe vera hand cream along with items such as face masks, relaxing bath gels, slippers and Easter eggs.”Staff also worked with Medusa Hairdressing in Southsea to create more hampers which were distributed to key workers in local nursing homes.The hotel’s managing director Farid Yeganeh said: “I am delighted with the small team we have working at the hotel who have ensured it is clean and safe for our NHS guests.” vw, px\"  More than , meals have been sent out in lockdown to vulnerable people around the city thanks to a collaboration between the hotel, a collective of voluntary organisations called Portsmouth Hive, Portsmouth City Council, NHS Portsmouth CCG, the charity arm of Portsmouth Football Club called Pompey in the Community, as well as Anghel Niko Nedelcu, head chef from Portsmouth’s Brasserie Blanc and Royal Beach Hotel head chef Paul Playford. The initiative received two £, anonymous donations, as well as food donations from local businesses including butchers Buckwells. Farid said: “We got an email from the council at the start of lockdown about whether any businesses had any stock that was going out of date. It just snowballed from there really and we teamed up with the Hive to get meals distributed and it means so much that we could help our community.”Each week for Clap For Carers, projections showing support for the NHS were displayed on the Edwardian era hotel as part of the team’s commitment to supporting local health workers. Farid added: “I have always been aware that we have a really special team working at the hotel and this just underlines it. I look forward to being able to welcome back the whole Queens Hotel team once the lockdown is over.”When coronavirus started appearing in Inverness, care home manager Victoria Connolly was determined no one who worked or lived there would fall ill.So she asked the staff of the Isobel Fraser home in Invernessthey’d be prepared to live onsite and was thrilled when  said they would.But then came the problem of where to put them.The -year-old said: “There are a couple of rooms upstairs I could fit six people into. But then I thought, ‘Where am I going to put everyone  ’”“I have a friend with a campervan so I phoned her and askedwe could use it. She agreed but I needed more so she suggested I hire one.”Victoria got in touch with Highland Auto Campers whose owner Mark Jarratt, , immediately agreed to hire her three vehicles for cost.While they’d normally charge £ a night for their practically-new fleet, the care home got them for just £ each a week.Mark says: “We’ve only been going two years but earlier this year, things were going well – March was picking up and April and May were fully booked.“But we only get an eight-month window to make our money because of the tourist season so lockdown came at the worst time for us, the start of our season and was a complete disaster.“Then around April , we got a call from the Isobel Fraser home. Stories were, by then, beginning to emerge that some care homes had been really badly hit by coronavirus.“They said that while the home was free of coronavirus, they knew they needed to take steps to keep both staff and residents virus free and by providing accommodation for their staff on site.hey wanted to rent three of our vans to do this.“We were surprised to get the phone call – there are a lot of similar companies in the area – but quite pleased and we immediately agreed to assist in any way that we could. We just wanted to help.“It was also a win-win situation for us. The campervans hadn’t been used for a few weeks, they were just sitting quarantined and this was income – not a great deal of income but better than nothing.“Even though they hadn’t been used for weeks, and one was so new it had never been used, we gave them a thorough clean before driving them over and setting them up.“The staff and some of the residents were quite excited when we arrived and were looking out of the windows.”Six care home staff slept in the vans for between three and five weeks. Manager Victoria said: “They really enjoyed it – they were warm and comfortable. Most have said they’d take them out on holiday!”The care home, which has  residents, hasn’t had a single case of coronavirus. Mark said: “We were really proud to have been able to help. It’s good to do something for the community.”Newtownards-based company Shnuggle ersied into making PPE when the coronavirus pandemic hit the firm’s core business.Sinead and Adam Murphy were building the company into a leading name among parents with products such as an air bedside crib, air flow mattress, rocking stand, toddler baths, bath stands and many other creations.But the growth was interrupted when Covid- arrived in the UK, and the country went into lockdown.Although UK sales remained strong, imports were hit and Shnuggle’s owners turned their attention to designing and creating a face covering that would help save lives.Adam and Sinead quickly realised that they could help make a dference in the national effort to provide Personal Protective Equipment items. After taking measures needed to sustain the business, including taking advantage of UK Government furlough and business loan schemes, they set about creating and growing not-for-profit business Hero Shield.Adam said: “We had seen a few initiatives that had popped up all around the world.“A lot were printing D face shields so we kind of sat down with our head of design who was on furlough and said, ‘can we come up with a design here that we could start producing at rock bottom price and we’d prefer it to be a reusable one rather than a disposable one ’.“We came up with designs over the course of a weekend, by Monday we had done  dferent designs and D printed them on our prototyping printer and we’d put out a call on LinkedIn to local companies who wanted to get involved and within a very short space of time we had about  dferent businesses all saying, ‘Yep, we can do that bit and we’ll do it free of charge or we’ll do it at cost’.“We said that we weren’t doing it to make money. We were trying to help the NHS and other care workers so we founded another company which was Hero Shield Ltd and we set it up as not for profit so nobody could take any money out of it. Alongside that we did a crowdfunder to cover the costs so we raised £, in the end.“We managed to produce and ship out about , face shields in about six weeks.”Adam and Sinead are working to secure charitable status for Hero Shield Ltd, which is still running on a non-profit basis, and is now focussing more on charities and care services that don’t have the funds for whatever PPE they might need to get back up and running.Sinead said: “The businesses that were actually producing the face shields, we passed the orders to them and they have turned it into more of a commercial venture because we got a massive order from the NHS.“It was worth shy of £m and we needed to focus back on Shnuggles, so we passed it over to them and they pay a royalty into the Hero Shield charity for every one that they make.”So having helped the NHS in Northern Ireland, Adam and Sinead are now focused again on their core business – creating and marketing clever products for babies and children.Read about more inspiring GREAT stories at greatbritaincampaign inspirationscopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

She agreed but I needed more so she suggested I hire one.”Victoria got in touch with Highland Auto Campers whose owner Mark Jarratt, , immediately agreed to hire her three vehicles for cost.While they’d normally charge £ a night for their practically-new fleet, the care home got them for just £ each a week.Mark says: “We’ve only been going two years but earlier this year, things were going well – March was picking up and April and May were fully booked.“But we only get an eight-month window to make our money because of the tourist season so lockdown came at the worst time for us, the start of our season and was a complete disaster.“Then around April , we got a call from the Isobel Fraser home. Stories were, by then, beginning to emerge that some care homes had been really badly hit by coronavirus.“They said that while the home was free of coronavirus, they knew they needed to take steps to keep both staff and residents virus free and by providing accommodation for their staff on site.hey wanted to rent three of our vans to do this.“We were surprised to get the phone call – there are a lot of similar companies in the area – but quite pleased and we immediately agreed to assist in any way that we could. We just wanted to help.“It was also a win-win situation for us. The campervans hadn’t been used for a few weeks, they were just sitting quarantined and this was income – not a great deal of income but better than nothing.“Even though they hadn’t been used for weeks, and one was so new it had never been used, we gave them a thorough clean before driving them over and setting them up.“The staff and some of the residents were quite excited when we arrived and were looking out of the windows.”Six care home staff slept in the vans for between three and five weeks. Manager Victoria said: “They really enjoyed it – they were warm and comfortable. Most have said they’d take them out on holiday!”The care home, which has  residents, hasn’t had a single case of coronavirus. Mark said: “We were really proud to have been able to help. It’s good to do something for the community.”Newtownards-based company Shnuggle ersied into making PPE when the coronavirus pandemic hit the firm’s core business.Sinead and Adam Murphy were building the company into a leading name among parents with products such as an air bedside crib, air flow mattress, rocking stand, toddler baths, bath stands and many other creations.But the growth was interrupted when Covid- arrived in the UK, and the country went into lockdown.Although UK sales remained strong, imports were hit and Shnuggle’s owners turned their attention to designing and creating a face covering that would help save lives.Adam and Sinead quickly realised that they could help make a dference in the national effort to provide Personal Protective Equipment items. After taking measures needed to sustain the business, including taking advantage of UK Government furlough and business loan schemes, they set about creating and growing not-for-profit business Hero Shield.Adam said: “We had seen a few initiatives that had popped up all around the world.“A lot were printing D face shields so we kind of sat down with our head of design who was on furlough and said, ‘can we come up with a design here that we could start producing at rock bottom price and we’d prefer it to be a reusable one rather than a disposable one ’.“We came up with designs over the course of a weekend, by Monday we had done  dferent designs and D printed them on our prototyping printer and we’d put out a call on LinkedIn to local companies who wanted to get involved and within a very short space of time we had about  dferent businesses all saying, ‘Yep, we can do that bit and we’ll do it free of charge or we’ll do it at cost’.“We said that we weren’t doing it to make money. We were trying to help the NHS and other care workers so we founded another company which was Hero Shield Ltd and we set it up as not for profit so nobody could take any money out of it. Alongside that we did a crowdfunder to cover the costs so we raised £, in the end.“We managed to produce and ship out about , face shields in about six weeks.”Adam and Sinead are working to secure charitable status for Hero Shield Ltd, which is still running on a non-profit basis, and is now focussing more on charities and care services that don’t have the funds for whatever PPE they might need to get back up and running.Sinead said: “The businesses that were actually producing the face shields, we passed the orders to them and they have turned it into more of a commercial venture because we got a massive order from the NHS.“It was worth shy of £m and we needed to focus back on Shnuggles, so we passed it over to them and they pay a royalty into the Hero Shield charity for every one that they make.”So having helped the NHS in Northern Ireland, Adam and Sinead are now focused again on their core business – creating and marketing clever products for babies and children.Read about more inspiring GREAT stories at greatbritaincampaign inspirationscopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I am adaptable to suit many environments and job roles.” vw, px\"  In the military he saw firsthand soldiers suffering poor mental health. One of his friends, also serving in the army, committed suicide.He said: “I entered the NHS through the Step into Health programme, which has been brilliant.“I have been able to prove myself and have had really positive feedback.“I won an award for Outstanding Impact Since Joining the NHS at the programme’s first ceremony.”Joshua is helping to treat patients through more dficult times than usual.“We are doing absolutely brilliantly,” he said. “It would be abnormal, with all the constant changes,we did not experience stress and anxiety.“We have adapted and made changes.“Here our patients have been brilliant.“We have got a good team here, a good mix of people with dferent skills. We all support each other and do everything we can for our patients.”Joshua has also been a volunteer with men’s mental health charity Men Unite, supporting males in crisis.He ran a half marathon last year to raise £ for Mental Health UK.“And this month I am running  miles, having so far raised £ for the same charity through JustGiving.” he said.Former service personnel have helped dferent communities deal with all manner of problems, making urgent deliveries of food and medicines to vulnerable people while also helping those who are shielding receive what they need.Many others have helped ensure those who need a test for the virus have been able to get one by setting up mobile testing sites, allowing them to run smoothly and safely to daily test thousands of people with symptoms.A lot of this work has required specic skills our veterans have learnt throughout years of military service.The work of these veterans goes to show the military gives you key skills, transferable to civilian le – be it healthcare, business or organisation.Veterans form an important part of our NHS workforce and, throughout COVID-, many more have come forward to support the continued fight against this pandemic.Working across a iety of roles, both on and off the frontline, the NHS has benefitted from their military expertise and experiences, invaluable at this challenging time.From redesigning hospital departments to safely supporting virus and non-virus patients, to providing care for those in Nightingale Hospitals and supporting nurses using military mental health resilience techniques, vets have once again served our country with pride.This is in addition to many who have continued to work in dedicated NHS services for ex-service personnel, such as Veterans’ Mental Health Transition, Intervention and Liaison Service and Veterans’ Mental Health Complex Treatment Service to ensure care and treatment remains available throughout this period, virtually or via phone. vw, px\"  Minister for Defence People and Veterans Johnny Mercer, pictured right, said: “Those who’ve served in the armed forces have developed a vast array of skills during their career, meaning they can play a huge part now in our national effort to tackle coronavirus. “We have seen many veterans making a fantastic contribution during the pandemic, through helping out the vulnerable in their local communities, to running mobile testing sites nationally.

This time round she doubled that.A few days later and this time a quintet of girls flew in formation round the course again this time competing for the Lochalsh Ladies Stableford prize.Sandi Beatson, fresh from victory in the first competition of the season, registered her second straight win but on this occasion only by the very narrowest of margins # the dreaded #better inward half# which is a count-back method used to declare a result when scores are tied after  holes.The player with the better score for holes - is then declared to be the winner.Apparently, the weather conditions were favourable so it#s dficult to see why the recorded #numbers# were so comparatively poor against the par of the course.New club member Shona Jackson very nearly started off her campaign with victory but I#m sure that even after one bf she#ll be able to settle in and join our girls in chat, combat and competitions.By my calculations Sandi#s two loops were +pts whereas Shona#s were +pts and that my friends was how the result was decided.With the threat of the coronavirus still hanging over us the committee decided at short notice to add a Skye Community Response fundraising competition to the club fixture list to be played over a period of two days with all the entry fees being donated to that worthy local cause.Players both male and female could submit as many rounds as they liked in the two day period and despite the rather fy weather several took the opportunity to sharpen their respective games and submit more than one ##.Playing on day one Robbie Macaskill and Chris Hanley # the latter proudly brandishing a new set of sticks # ed the day#s best scores of pts in the Stableford format with the former easing the latter courtesy of the better inward half.Despite a rocky , prelude to his round Robert settled well toloop scores of  and .Chris was on fire on the first nine with a fine  but the old fella must have been eating too many chocolate bars during lockdown and faded to  #coming home#.Donnie Macphee took third place one point in arrears.Some of the boys ed next day for another bf and another contribution to the charitable cause of choice but it was Hamish Philp, who had apparently been #shooting the lights out# in the winter league, who ed the best score of the occasion # a blistering pts.Had the competition been an official #counter# for handicap purposes Hamish would have graciously received a reduction of a couple of shots from his current mark but the omens for his season look promising.A distant speck in the rear view mirror was Ryan Macaskill on pts with John Maclean weighing into bronze position courtesy of pts for his honest endeavour on the day.However, pause for drum roll.The award for #the moment# must go to Club Captain Kenny Macleod who bodaciously eagled the par  th hole # all yds of it # and into the prevailing wind too!One wonders how many stones or sprinkler heads the old boy#s ba# must have bounced off to propel him to the distant target in three miserly shots.This is not aggrandisement # it was a truly remarkable effort by the bodach!The most prestigious competition in the gents fixture list # the Club Championship # is coming soon and there should be better than average competition this time round in pursuit of the title won by Ryan Macaskill in .One can#t help noticing that the assimilation of the three young lads into the fold last year caused some of the higher single-figure handicappers to emerge from their possible casual slumber of complacency and do something to improve both their game and their handicaps to ward off the challenge from these youngsters.It worked and not just to the benefit of the players themselves but to the general enhancement of the playing calibre of the gents section of the golf club.Two qualying rounds will be played to determine the four successful candidates eligible to compete in knockout matchplay semi-finals in their quest to be crowned Club Champion and subsequently have their name added to the Roll of Honour in the clubhouse #it#s doors ever swing open again Emerging from this prolonged and enforced period of omphaloskepsis and procrastibaking one can confidently predict a healthy turnout of golfing gladiators irrespective of the weather!CSS or Competition Scratch Score is a reflection of the playing dficulty of the course based on the scores ed with the handicaps represented on any particular day.Stableford format awards points as follows. Eagle, two under parpts: birdie, one under parpts, parpts and bogey, one over parpt.This form of play is very popular as a very high score on one or two holes doesn#t ruin the player#s chances of winning as would be the case in medal or strokeplay competition.Generally speaking the better players prefer the former while the rest of us favour the latter!Par is the score expected to be recorded on the hole by a #scratch# player and is determined by the number of shots the player should take to reach the green then add on two for putts.A par can be three # one shot plus two putts four # two shots plus two putts or five # three shots plus two putts. .

While NIE Networks staff will still not be entering customers’ homes to obtain a meter read at this time, they will call at customers’ doors and ask them to read their meter while they wait. Meter readers will be able to take readings from meters located in outside positions as normal.NIE Networks is urging customers to protect its meter readers and themselves by continuing to observe social distancing protocols. Ben Cupples, Meter Reading Manager at NIE Networks, explained the importance of recording a precise meter reading for the customer.“Providing a precise meter reading will ensure that your electricity bills accurately reflect your consumption,” he said. “Our meter readers will call to your home and will record the reading you provide while we wait.“If you are unable to read your meter for any reason oryou are not at home when we call, we will leave a card with information on how to submit your meter reading online via the NIE Networks website, via email or over the phone.”Mr Cupples explained that while meter reading activity would resume it would only be carried out with the health and safety of the public and meter readers in mind.“The safety of our employees and customers is our utmost priority. “If you see our meter readers out and about, we would ask that you please help them by standing at least two metres away. Likewise, we will stand at least two metres from customers’ doors at all times.“We are continually reviewing how we undertake our meter reading activities in light of COVID- and we are looking forward to being able to resume our normal way of working with customers at some stage, but we will only make that decision when it’s safe to do so.” NIE Networks is reminding customers that you only need to submit your reading to either NIE Networks or your supplier – there is no need to do it twice. Customers unable to submit a meter reading will receive an estimated bill from their supplier based on their usage history.If a member of the NIE Networks team arrives at the door, they will always show identication.

Twenty cows undertook the voyage to the island of Inishfendra, where they will stay until swimming back to the mainland for the winter. It#s part of an old tradition that was been ongoing for many years since Crom Estate was founded as part of the Plantation of Ulster in the early s.Matthew Scott is a National Trust ranger who works at Crom, where parcels of land are rented out to local farmers. His job is to maintain the grounds look after the wildle on the estate and work with farmers who rent land. It#s quite unusual to see cows swimming - it#s about  metres they swim and there usually isn#t too much resistance, he said. The cows at Crom have made their annual swim across Lough Erne for summer pasture. From today, you can set sail for Crom too as it reopens. Book online at www.nationaltrust.org.uk cromPosted by National Trust Fermanagh - Florence Court, Castle Coole and Crom on Wednesday, July , It#s part of a process that begins a few days before the swim, when farmers will electric fence a small parcel of land for the cows to graze in for a number of days before being herded towards the water. There are always a few cattle within the group who have done the swim before and they have a bit of memory of where to go and what to do and they lead the pack and the rest will follow. If there are any calves in the group, they usually get a bit of a shock because they#re just following their mothers and next thing they#re up to their neck.The cows are usually supervised and farmers and rangers make sure there are no passing boats on the narrow channel on Lough Erne the cows have to swim across. Ideally, we don#t want it to be windy or waves on the water, said Mr Scott. Going way back this would have been a traditional practice, not just in Fermanagh but in Strangford Lough.

She said it also came at the “worst possible time” given many victims were just about to go into isolation due to the coronavirus emergency.“The message of that was appalling,” she told MPs.Ms Peake noted that the first paragraph of the two-page Government statement focused on the need to protect veterans.“So we were waiting for Stormont House , we felt there was an agreement among the British and Irish governments and the Assembly, we were waiting for an action for that,” she said.“We had no warning and, all of a sudden, in the middle of Covid, a two-page statement came out that really was a demarcation away, with absolutely no warning, at a time when victims and survivors were most vulnerable.“The first paragraph was around the need to protect veterans and then moved on to victims and survivors.“As of last week, we have had one call with the Secretary of State , we’ve had nothing since. We have asked for meetings with the NIOofficials, we’ve had two, which we have asked for, and we were told there’s going to be extensive consultation, we haven’t seen that.“We were told that there would be papers, they haven’t come, and I understand maybe they won’t come.“So it’s really a very, very dficult position for victims and survivors to be in and I really can’t emphasise enough it really feeds mistrust, it feeds a sense that we don’t matter, and that this simply is about veterans and is not about addressing the needs of victims and survivors, and that is grossly unfair.“It’s very unfair to victims and survivors to do that.”Member of the South East Fermanagh Foundationvictims’ group also gave evidence to the committee on Wednesday.Seff has four outreach bases across Northern Ireland and also operates a service in London for the benefit of victims and survivors in Great Britain.Director of Services Kenny Donaldson said the Stormont House proposals were “unacceptable and unworkable”.Mr Donaldson insisted it should be the PSNI’s role to investigate legacy crimes, rather than bringing in officers from where in the UK.He also told MPs the Irish government needed to fully participate in the process and disclose relevant information.The campaigner said any new legacy mechanisms should be founded on the principle that there was never any justication for the use of criminal violence for political objectives.“Over the - period there should have an acknowledgement that criminal violence was wrong and wholly unjustied, that didn’t happen but a quarter of a century later it must now happen, otherwise whatever we seek to achieve on legacy will continue to be built on sand,” he said.“There is a need to re-calibrate society now”.He added: “The Republic of Ireland State sought to portray itself as an onlooker to the problems of Northern Ireland, this is not accurate and there must be a sea change within that attitude, we seek a dferent level of commitment on these issues from the new government recently elected.“There needs to be a much closer collaboration between the ious jurisdictional governments on these issues, no innocent victim or survivor should be left behind.“We believe that we have submitted alternative proposals around an investigative body being housed within the PSNI which are workable, fair, affordable and crucially can deliver outcomes for victims and survivors and we ask for this committee’s detailed consideration of those proposals and moreover, the UK Government’s”.PAMost ReadBobby Storey funeral a kick in teeth, says woman forced to miss mum#s burialNoah Donohoe: Private funeral for Belfast teenBobby Storey funeral a #kick in the teeth# for those who respected Covid- restrictions, claims DUPCo Armagh teachers say goodbye to final-year students with touching video of Coldplay songStorey funeral #very clear breach# of Covid- regulations, says Health Minister Swann,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We were putting the bears out for three weeks before someone suggested raising funds, which of course we did.Marie Curie is a cause so many people identy with and they have an office close to our house. That#s how we chose them and we are over the moon with the amount we raised.I had initially hoped that we would collect somewhere in the region of £, or £,, so to raise over £, has been amazing.While being able to make such a generous donation to Marie Curie was an unexpected outcome, receiving a coveted Harrods bear in the post was another.My we has about  Harrods bears in her collection, Morris explained.I gave her a bear every Christmas before I retired and was travelling back and forward to London. Of course, these were part of our daily display.I never could have imagined anyone from Harrods would see our story in the Belfast , let alone send this year#s bear as a thank-you to us.It was such a generous gesture and a big surprise when the bear arrived in the post with a lovely note from Harrods.I wrote back updating them on the final tally collected for Marie Curie and to say a big thank-you.The bear, which is called Nicolas, is a very welcome addition to the collection. It will be a constant reminder of this very unusual time we have found ourselves in.

The move was backed by the DUP, Sinn Fein and the SDLP, while the UUP, Alliance, Greens and People Before Profit gave their support to an amendment from TUV leader Jim Allister.The North Antrim MLA proposed that an independent body be given the role of setting future allowances, subject to Assembly Commission guidance.However, Mr Allister#s proposal was rejected by a vote of  to , with one abstention.He said he feared that those behind the proposal had failed to learn from previous abuses of the expenses system.Those who tabled the motion must have short memories. I do not think that the public have, added the TUV leader. The public well remember that when the system that is proposed in the motion was in operation - namely, that MLAs controlled, through the commission, their own expenses - it was abused and the product was scandal.Alan McQuillan was part of the  in an independent review which previously determined the salaries, expenses and pensions paid to MLAs.He said: This decision takes them back  years. They will be the only legislative body in the UK or Ireland doing this.My fear is that, give it two or three years and we will find ourselves in the original situation, causing serious damage to the reputation of the Assembly.DUP MLA Keith Buchanan, who put forward the allowances proposal, said the current rules failed to recognise economic realities facing MLAs.The motion will enable the Assembly Commission to ensure that members can legitimately purchase basic items to help them to deliver services to our constituents, that an MLA#s contact details can be promoted on the constituency office, and, most notably, to ensure that the terms and conditions of employment of the staff who work in our offices are fair and reasonable, he added.Sinn Fein#s John O#Dowd argued that the TUV amendment would cause further delays to expenses reforms.Mr O#Dowd said: Go back to your staff in your constituency offices, or some of your staff may be sitting in offices in this building.

This was a % increase on the  figure .The fixed speed camera site on the Upper Newtownards Road in Belfast accounted for more than one-thirdof the , speeding detections by fixed cameras in .Over halfof all speed related detections were on mph roads.The highest speed recorded in  was mph. This was detected on the A Dunman dual carriageway near Cookstown, a mph road.Other bad examples included a driver caught at mph in a mph zone and another doing mph in a mph zone.RSP vans were deployed , times in , an increase of % on deployments in , partly explaining the rise in detections.The data is contained in the NI RSP#s latest annual bulletin. There are four fixed speed cameras, six fixed red light running cameras and one average speed enforcement camera system here. Eight speed camera vehicles also operate at ious locations throughout the region.The number of speed detections in  was more than four times the total recorded in  .The main reason was the reduction in the speed threshold at which a driver can be detected speeding. Additional sites for enforcement were also added in  and .Detections at fixed camera sites totalled , - down by % when compared with .The fixed site on the Upper Newtownards Road, Belfast, accounted for % of detections by fixed cameras, followed by Springfield Road, Belfast , Antrim Road, Belfastand Saintfield Road, Belfast . The Saintfield Road cameras had signicant downtime throughout .The number of detections at mobile camera sitesincreased by % between  and .This followed an increase in deployments of safety camera vans, resulting in more detections.The , other cases were detected by #average speed# cameras.Inspector Leech said everyone had a responsibility to make our roads safer.She added: Removing excess speed from the road safety equation should be the easiest thing that every road user can do. If we all stop speeding, more people live. If we all stop speeding, fewer people have to contend with le-changing injuries.All right-thinking and law-abiding motorists will realise that speed restrictions are not there to inconvenience them but to make our roads safer for everyone. Our aim is to prevent people from being seriously injured or killed. As speeding is considered one of the major causes in road traffic collisions, we make no apology for adopting a tough approach to enforcement.All motorists have a duty to drive in a responsible manner, butthey do not then we have a duty to detect and prosecute them.Infrasturcture Minister Nichola Mallon said: Unfortunately, for many families excessive speeding is persistently one of the main causes of death and serious injury on our roads and this is unacceptable.Speeding isn#t just about doing  or  miles per hour. It is about going too fast for the conditions.As a driver, it is your responsibility to adapt your driving - according to the weather, the type of road, your own ability and enough to expect the unexpected.So far  people have lost their lives on Northern Ireland#s roads this year.

His coffin was draped in the Tricolour.Thousands of mourners congregated on each side of the Andersonstown Road as the cortege left the family home at Owenragh Park at around .am for the short journey to the church.Men and women dressed in black trousers, white shirts and black ties formed a guard of honour, while black flags hung from the windows of houses along the street, and two kilted pipers played airs that included The Minstrel Boy, Sean South of Garryowen, A Nation Once Again and On Raglan Road.In accordance with coronavirus regulations, about  people were permitted to walk behind the hearse, including Mr Storey#s partner Teresa, children, grandchildren and other family members. Also among them were Sinn Fein presidents past and present Gerry Adams and Mary Lou McDonald, the party#s northern leader and deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill and members of her late predecessor Martin McGuinness#s family.Thousands more lined the footpaths as far as the eye could see.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ba .ece AUTOCROP w BT_KA.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph

This is dferent.He told the congregation that Mr Storey was raised during a time when communities were under threat and the Army were constantly patrolling the streets... ultimately the family were intimidated from their home and spent several days sheltering in Girdwood Army Barracks.Mr Storey would later rise in the republican ranks, becoming the IRA#s director of intelligence and the northern chairman of Sinn Fein. He spent many years in jail for ious offences, played a key role in the mass IRA breakout from the Maze Prison in  and was widely regarded as one of the most feared and formidable members of the republican organisation.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseThe late Bobby StoreyKevin Scott   Belfast  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappThe late Bobby StoreyHe is also credited with having played a prominent role in the peace process.Fr Donegan said that, having worked as a confessor for the past  years, he thanks God for not being confined to the limitations of human compassion and mercy.Often the biggest task of a confessor is to convince people to follow God#s example and to forgive themselves, he told the congregation.Reflecting on Mr Storey#s le, Fr Donegan described him as a devoted partner to Teresa with a gt of humour extended to all he met.The priest recalled how Mr Storey#s -year relationship with Teresa began to develop from the time of Bobby#s first parole in  and how his partner spoke of Bobby the family man and the great love he had for sister Geraldine and brothers Seamus and Brian.She told us of the great mutual love shared between Bobby and her sons Emmett, Fergal and Sean, he continued.The priest added that Bobby Storey will be fondly remembered by those who knew him.Ironically, his funeral may be remembered more by those who did not.

Lavey Parish pooled their energies to raise almost pound, to contribute to the recent work on St Mary’s Church of Our Lady of Mercy. Parish priest Fr Eamon Graham was delighted to see the community coming together. “Weve just come to end of a very extraordinary week in our parish and community,” he said. “Ive certainly been overwhelmed - I think we all have - by the level of generosity, but I think something even more important was that so many aspects of our community pulled together. googletag.cmd.push “You know, we enjoyed it, enjoyed it very much. At the end of the lockdown period I think we were all, kind of, looking for a lt of some kind and it certainly gave us all a great lt. “I want to say a sincere thanks to everybody who was involved - everybody who was at the organising end of it, and particularly to the groups that took part.” The fundraiser received huge community support, with local sports clubs in the area all taking on a specic challenge to help with the chapel’s restoration. Erin’s Own GAA’s underage footballers and hurlers ran km each, while their senior counterparts ran a collective km. googletag.cmd.push Termoneeny Hill Walking Club had originally pledged to walk a collective km, but upped their target to ,km during the course of their challenge. Termoneeny Cycling Club members each cycled km, while the Erin’s Own camogie players each clocked up at least km. -year-old Harry Boyle’s remarkable contribution saw him cycling around all the townlands in the parish, while Fr Graham and his parochial team got involved by running in their Lavey gear. The challenge was not just limited to Lavey, though, and their diaspora throughout the world got involved via social media, sharing photos of them completing their contribution.

The GREAT Inspirations campaign will recognise companies that have gone above and beyond to continue to operate for their employees, serve their customers and contribute to their local communities. Here are some examples of the many thousands of companies that have proved to be an inspiration. CASE STUDY QUEEN’S HOTEL Rooms and pamper packages for NHS workers away from their families, prepping more than  meals a week for vulnerable people in the community and projecting light shows every week for Clap for Carers are just some of the things one hotel team has done during the coronavirus outbreak. googletag.cmd.push The team at the Queens Hotel in Southsea have been working hard since lockdown began in March to support everyone in the community across Portsmouth. Duty manager Megan Lockyer has been working with the small team who have welcomed more than  NHS workers to the hotel, which during the Second World War served as a hospital for recovering servicemen, for a place to rest away from their jobs.  THERE FOR YOU: Queen’s Hotel lit up for NHS andpreparing food in the kitchen Megan put a post on the Portsmouth Coronavirus Support Group on Facebook asking members to support her idea and it has since taken off with donations pouring in from iniduals and businesses. googletag.cmd.push She said: “I watched the NHS workers come back to the hotel after a challenging day and I really wanted to let them know how much we appreciate what they are doing. “I came up with the idea of making hampers for the NHS workers who are currently with us at the hotel. “I shared my idea with the Facebook group and it was amazing how the community responded. “The NHS staff had told us how sore their hands were due to constant washing and we were able to include aloe vera hand cream along with items such as face masks, relaxing bath gels, slippers and Easter eggs.” Staff also worked with Medusa Hairdressing in Southsea to create more hampers which were distributed to key workers in local nursing homes. The hotel’s managing director Farid Yeganeh said: “I am delighted with the small team we have working at the hotel who have ensured it is clean and safe for our NHS guests.”  More than , meals have been sent out in lockdown to vulnerable people around the city thanks to a collaboration between the hotel, a collective of voluntary organisations called Portsmouth Hive, Portsmouth City Council, NHS Portsmouth CCG, the charity arm of Portsmouth Football Club called Pompey in the Community, as well as Anghel Niko Nedelcu, head chef from Portsmouth’s Brasserie Blanc and Royal Beach Hotel head chef Paul Playford. The initiative received two pound, anonymous donations, as well as food donations from local businesses including butchers Buckwells. Farid said: “We got an email from the council at the start of lockdown about whether any businesses had any stock that was going out of date. It just snowballed from there really and we teamed up with the Hive to get meals distributed and it means so much that we could help our community.” Each week for Clap For Carers, projections showing support for the NHS were displayed on the Edwardian era hotel as part of the team’s commitment to supporting local health workers. Farid added: “I have always been aware that we have a really special team working at the hotel and this just underlines it. I look forward to being able to welcome back the whole Queens Hotel team once the lockdown is over.” CASE STUDY HIGHLAND AUTO CAMPERS When coronavirus started appearing in Inverness, care home manager Victoria Connolly was determined no one who worked or lived there would fall ill. So she asked the staff of the Isobel Fraser home in Invernessthey’d be prepared to live onsite and was thrilled when  said they would. But then came the problem of where to put them. The -year-old said: “There are a couple of rooms upstairs I could fit six people into. But then I thought, ‘Where am I going to put everyone  ’” “I have a friend with a campervan so I phoned her and askedwe could use it. She agreed but I needed more so she suggested I hire one.” Victoria got in touch with Highland Auto Campers whose owner Mark Jarratt, , immediately agreed to hire her three vehicles for cost. While they’d normally charge pound a night for their practically-new fleet, the care home got them for just pound each a week. Mark says: “We’ve only been going two years but earlier this year, things were going well – March was picking up and April and May were fully booked. “But we only get an eight-month window to make our money because of the tourist season so lockdown came at the worst time for us, the start of our season and was a complete disaster.  TEAMING UP: Highland Auto Campers owner Mark Jarratt with girlfriend Alicia “Then around April , we got a call from the Isobel Fraser home. Stories were, by then, beginning to emerge that some care homes had been really badly hit by coronavirus. “They said that while the home was free of coronavirus, they knew they needed to take steps to keep both staff and residents virus free and by providing accommodation for their staff on site. They wanted to rent three of our vans to do this. “We were surprised to get the phone call – there are a lot of similar companies in the area – but quite pleased and we immediately agreed to assist in any way that we could. We just wanted to help. “It was also a win-win situation for us. The campervans hadn’t been used for a few weeks, they were just sitting quarantined and this was income – not a great deal of income but better than nothing. “Even though they hadn’t been used for weeks, and one was so new it had never been used, we gave them a thorough clean before driving them over and setting them up. “The staff and some of the residents were quite excited when we arrived and were looking out of the windows.” Six care home staff slept in the vans for between three and five weeks. Manager Victoria said: “They really enjoyed it – they were warm and comfortable. Most have said they’d take them out on holiday!” The care home, which has  residents, hasn’t had a single case of coronavirus. Mark said: “We were really proud to have been able to help. It’s good to do something for the community.” CASE STUDY SHNUGGLE Newtownards-based company Shnuggle ersied into making PPE when the coronavirus pandemic hit the firm’s core business. Sinead and Adam Murphy were building the company into a leading name among parents with products such as an air bedside crib, airflow mattress, rocking stand, toddler baths, bath stands and many other creations. But the growth was interrupted when Covid- arrived in the UK, and the country went into lockdown. Although UK sales remained strong, imports were hit and Shnuggle’s owners turned their attention to designing and creating a face covering that would help save lives. Adam and Sinead quickly realised that they could help make a dference in the national effort to provide Personal Protective Equipment items. After taking measures needed to sustain the business, including taking advantage of UK Government furlough and business loan schemes, they set about creating and growing not-for-profit business Hero Shield. Adam said: “We had seen a few initiatives that had popped up all around the world. “A lot were printing D face shields so we kind of sat down with our head of design who was on furlough and said, ‘can we come up with a design here that we could start producing at rock bottom price and we’d prefer it to be a reusable one rather than a disposable one ’. “We came up with designs over the course of a weekend, by Monday we had done  dferent designs and D printed them on our prototyping printer and we’d put out a call on LinkedIn to local companies who wanted to get involved and within a very short space of time we had about  dferent businesses all saying, ‘Yep, we can do that bit and we’ll do it free of charge or we’ll do it at cost’.  DREAM TEAM: The Shnuggle staff “We said that we weren’t doing it to make money. We were trying to help the NHS and other care workers so we founded another company which was Hero Shield Ltd and we set it up as not for profit so nobody could take any money out of it. Alongside that we did a crowdfunder to cover the costs so we raised pound, in the end. “We managed to produce and ship out about , face shields in about six weeks.” Adam and Sinead are working to secure charitable status for Hero Shield Ltd, which is still running on a non-profit basis, and is now focussing more on charities and care services that don’t have the funds for whatever PPE they might need to get back up and running. Sinead said: “The businesses that were actually producing the face shields, we passed the orders to them and they have turned it into more of a commercial venture because we got a massive order from the NHS. “It was worth shy of poundm and we needed to focus back on Shnuggles, so we passed it over to them and they pay a royalty into the Hero Shield charity for every one that they make.” So having helped the NHS in Northern Ireland, Adam and Sinead are now focused again on their core business – creating and marketing clever products for babies and children.

Despite not yet being built, the futuristic eco-house, which is called The Qube, has gone up for sale in the Prehen area of the Waterside with a price tag of pound,. The five-bedroom property called The Qube will be built on land beside the Everglades Hotel. It has been advertised as one of Northern Irelands only passive houses, which means it will use very little energy and leave a small ecological footprint. The three-story dwelling will also be a smart home and the lights, heating and blinds can all be operated from a tablet or smartphone. googletag.cmd.push  The , sq ft building will be locatedon a triangular piece of landat the junction of Prehen Road andHazelwood Avenue. This heavily-wooded area is home to a number of mature trees which arecovered by a Tree Preservation Order . Although work on the property is yet to begin, it has full planning permission. However, the journey to obtaining this was not a smooth one. In Northeern Ireland, local councils are responsible for most planning decisions. Each council has planning officers who make recommendations about planning applications. However, the Planning Committee, which is made up of councillors, has the option to reject these recommendations. googletag.cmd.push The planning application for The Qube first came before Derry City and Strabane District Councils Planning Committee last September. Council planners provided councillors with a detailed report which recommended that planning permission be refused for the building.  The meeting was also told that  letters of objection had been sent by local residents. Among their concerns werethe destructionof ancient woodland and mature trees and the suggestion that the buildingis out of character and proportion with theexisting neighbouring properties. The report said thatthe building went ahead it would have adversely affected thecharacterandenvironmental quality of theof thesurrounding area through the loss of an important and well establishedurban woodland greenspace. Councillors agreed to defer the decision for a site visit, which took place on September  last year and which was attended by seven councillors. On September , the Planning Committee voted not toaccept the recommendation to refuse the planning application and agreed to reconsider itfurther information on the Tree Protection Order was provided. The council sent out additional notications to all neighbours, objectors and supporters ofthe scheme in January this year and  more letters were received, with six in objection to the application and  in support. The letters in support said the site was an eyesore and the owner of the proposed building would have a vested interest in maintaining it. On March  this year, the Planning Committee met again and was told council planners had not changed their position that planning permission should be refused. The Principal Planning Officer told elected members an Arboriculture Impact Assessment had been carried out which broadly agreed with the initial recommendation that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate the proposed scheme would not have a detrimental impact on the Tree Preservation Ordersite. DUP Alderman Hilary McClintock, who attended the site visit, told the meeting she did not believe the protected trees would be affected by the proposed building. She proposed to overturn the decision of the planning officer and for approval to be granted subject to conditions provided by planners. The proposal was seconded by SDLP councillor Angela Dobbins and was passed after seven votes for, three against and three abstentions. On Friday, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council confirmed that that an application for the Prehen building came before the Planning Committee in September  with a recommendation to refuse as it would result in the loss of a valuable urban woodland green space and the applicant had failed to demonstrate that this dwelling would not have an adverse impact on existing trees. The recommendation was not accepted by elected members and the application came back before the committee on March of this year as a reconsidered application, following a visit to the site by elected members and the submission of further information, said the spokesperson. Whilst the officers presented an unaltered opinion to refuse, elected members voted to approved the application.” The sale of The Qube, which was designed by architect Gerard McPeake, is being handled by McGuinness Fleck Estate Agents   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The championship was put on hold for three seasons, at the start of the  season. Derry won back to back titles in  and , but have not contested a final since the the  final at Owenbeg. Goals from Ruairi Convery and Paddy McCloskey had Derry well in the hunt. Convery, who scored -, levelled the game before Daniel McKernans winner. Antrim have won the last  in succession, with Down not lting the title since . Armagh reached the final in  and , losing to the Saffrons, before the competition was paused for three years, given the new tiered All-Ireland structure which has saw Derry play at Nicky Rackard and Christy Ring level. googletag.cmd.push The  season was the final year of the experiment with the Ulster hurling championship.  The County Derry Post contacted Ulster GAA for clarication of the future of the competition andthere were any further developments. “No decision has yet been taken on this matter. Its a matter for CCCC and Coiste Bainisti and we dont have any detail as to when it will be discussed,” read a statement from Ulster GAA PRO Declan Woods. In a special feature this week, we get the thoughts from Derry, Antrim and Down on the Ulster championship and where it could fit into the calendar. googletag.cmd.push “A provincial championship is a provincial championship. I think there could be a window for it before the Christy Ring,” felt Derry senior manager John McEvoy. Kevin Kelly, a former Derry selector, is on the Ulster Hurling Development committee feels there are four options available, but the best option would be after the league. Antrim captain Conor McCann said the Saffrons would welcome it back, but there needed to be the reward of an automatic spot in the All-Ireland series for the winner. Down boss Ronan Sheehan hit out at the Ulster Council for not having a championship in place.“I make no bones about this, I think the Ulster Council are reneging on their responsibilities by failing to have an Ulsterchampionship,” he said.

Ciaraacuten McShane died last Monday as a result of a road collision on a stretch of the M motorway in County Louth. On Sunday, mourners at the Church of St John the Baptist heard how the -year-old father-of-two had been working to establish a family home for what he called his ‘wee unit’. Fr Charles Kearney told those gathered for his funeral that the former Crossroads PS and St Paul’s pupil had a great sense of humour. googletag.cmd.push “The fourth and youngest of his family, he turned out to be great craic, very quick-witted,” he said. “He had many, many friends. He was a good son and brother. When he began to go out and about, he ended up in Maghera, in Walsh’s Hotel, where he met the love of his le. “They were together for eleven years, and six, of course, as man and we. They have two beautul children, Conan and Carina.” The congregation heard how Ciaraacuten, a plumber by trade, lived for a Sunday, which he designated as a day to be spent with his young family. googletag.cmd.push “Another important thing for Ciaraacuten was a Sunday,” said Fr Kearney. “Sunday was his family day and he played with the children. They watched movies and had great fun together. He adored them and they adored him. “He had built his own house and was working to establish a good family home for his ‘wee unit’. He was a real family man and he is going to miss so many firsts. “One was coming up very soon, when Conan starts school just across the road in September. In his short le, Ciaraacuten McShane brought so much love, joy and goodness to people. “He most certainly will be rewarded for all of that.” Local Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Councillor, Sean Bateson, described Ciaraacuten as a ‘proper gentleman, one of the good guys in le’. Pearse’s GAC, Kilrea, where Ciaraacuten played football in his younger days, said they were ‘deeply saddened’ by his passing. “Ciaran played underage with the club and then came back to kit out for the reserves on many occasions. “One thing that everyone will tell you about Ciaran was that he always had a big smile on his face and his sense of humour was infectious.” Ciaraacuten will be sadly missed by his we Shauna, their children Conan and Carina, his parents Bertie and Patricia and siblings Siobhaacuten, Damian and Odraacuten and all his wider family and friends. Fr Kearney summed things up by telling mourners to look back on all Ciaraacuten achieved. “Sometimes bad things happen accidentally, and we know that’s part of le, but it’s devastating when it happens. “We should look back at his years among you and see what he achieved, and it was much.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Cha’s - victory over Manchester City on Thursday confirmed the Merseysiders could no longer be mathematically caught and sparked wild celebrations. For local fanatic Gerard Harraghy, the overwhelming emotion was relief, rather than ecstasy. “The main emotion is a little bit of relief that it’s finally confirmed, to be honest,” he told the County Derry Post. “We knew it was going to happen for a while, but there was that bit of doubt over the last three months that it might not actually get finished is now over. googletag.cmd.push “In a cup final, you have that one moment when you win it, but because it is the league, you don’t really get that. “While we may have clinched it last night, there were actually three or four moments throughout the season that were bigger in inidual terms.” Supporters Barry Craig, Kieran Patterson and David McLaughlin celebrate in a marquee off the new Dungiven bypass. The Magherafelt native, known affectionately to some of his old school friends as ‘Gerry Scouse’, admits the success was dampened a little with supporters not being able to witness it. “I definitely never envisaged being stuck over here and not being able to go to the match,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “A few friends did send me pictures and videos from last night in Liverpool and everyone seemed to be having a good time anyway. “I’ve been supporting Liverpool since I was about six or seven, I would say. I started going regularly before I started uni and for the past ten years it’s been pretty much every home game. “I’ve been on the waiting list for a season ticket for about  years, maybe more. I’m still only about ,th on the list!” While Liverpool’s stretch without a league title lasted three decades, they were not without success in the interim, winning the Champions’ League twice. The emotion of Istanbul in , when Liverpool came from three goals down at half-time to win the Champions’ League on penalties, will always be the pinnacle for Gerard. “I still don’t think anything will ever come close to Istanbul, for me,” he recalled. “It was right in the middle of my A-Levels and I had an exam the next morning, but I did not care one bit! “I would say the league is probably bigger than last year’s Champions’ League, just because it’s the first time we’ve done it in my memory.” As well as ending a -year drought, Liverpool’s th title brings them within one of fierce rivals Manchester United after the latter surged ahead with a period of dominance in the s and s. Gerard watched the game that clinched the  title at home with a few friends. One of them was a Manchester United fan, and the Magherafelt man took great pleasure in his discomfort. “A couple of mates came round and we watched it in the house,” he said. “One of them was actually a Man United fan. He tried to sneak out with about five minutes to go, but we had to lock him in! “I’m pretty sure I’m going to have him deleting his Facebook account by the end of the week with the amount of stuff I’ll be posting. It’s nice to get a bit of revenge after all these years.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Those behind the ambitious project are confident that the ious stories will appeal to both locals and visitors alike.Other interpretative  will tell of the emigration of families from Saintfield to the United States over the last  years, using the example of the three Maffett brothers who left Leggygowan for America, the first in , followed by a further two brothers in .It is one of their descendants, David Moffett, who has made this precious community asset possible.Saintfield Development Association officials, who played a lead role in securing the new community centre, approached the owners of the Windmill Road field and began protracted negotiations to secure the site, with the all-important funding to acquire the land obtained through Mr Moffettrsquos generous donation.A successful business executive with a well-known company in America, his family had links with the area dating back to the early th century, with Mr Moffettrsquos ancestral, family including James and Isabella Maffett and their children, buried in the graveyard at Saintfield Parish Church.Explaining the background to the heritage park proposal, a spokesman for the Development Association explained that a successful funding bid was submitted to the Heritage Lottery Fund for money to carry out necessary feasibility studies on the field.ldquoThese studies have since been completed to the satisfaction of the funder and have shown that there are no impediments for the field to be developed as a community heritage park, he explained.ldquoThese studies will also provide evidence for the necessary planning application for the change of use of the field from agricultural to community use.The spokesman also confirmed that consultants who carried out the feasibility studies of the field also compiled a list of proposals for the development which include measures to obviate as much as possible any disruption or annoyance to neighbouring residents through noise or anti-social behaviour.Public consultation on the proposals will be undertaken once the current pandemic restrictions are sufficiently eased and, following this process, the Development Association intends to raise the funds needed to implement the agreed proposals by applying for suitable grants.There will also be community fundraising.In addition, Newry, Mourne and Down Council has been asked to approve a new link being created between the community centre and proposed heritage park. The issue was under discussion prior to the coronavirus pandemic.Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess has praised all those involved in the project and hopes that the remaining pieces in the development jigsaw fall into place.ldquoThis is a terric development that not only local people can enjoy, but one which visitors to the town can also enjoy and learn so much about Saintfield and its people, he said.ldquoWe are fortunate to have the new community centre up and running and developing a new heritage park would represent further success for the town. Great credit must go Saintfield Heritage Society and townrsquos hardworking Development Association.Cllr Burgess added Saintfield was ldquovery fortunate to have extremely committed community iniduals who have the town and its people very much at heart.Full details of the proposes heritage park proposal are available at discoversaintfield..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Butler look after royalty and presidents  ","story":"FRANCIS McBriar has been a butler to four generations of the Royal Family, served US and Irish presidents and Northern Ireland Secretaries of State.However, he has only one mantra in his mind every time he dons his smart unorm mdash and that is he treats everyone the same.The farmerrsquos son who lives just outside Saintfield with his we Heather has butlered for  years. For those in the know, hersquos the man to reach out foryou have a special occasion or dinner event coming up.Regularly employed by the Earl of Erne at his Fermanagh residence, Crom Castle, Francis was recently featured doing what he does best in the RTE food series, Lords and Ladles.The  year-old was introduced to Hillsborough Castle, the Royal Familyrsquos official residence when they are in Northern Ireland, by the castlersquos late and highly regarded former house manager, David Anderson.ldquoI wouldnrsquot be where I am today without David Anderson, itrsquos as simple as that, said Francis.ldquoWe met through First Saintfield Church which David joined when he moved into the area. We were part of a group looking after senior people of the congregation and we would have worked together hosting dinners and bus outings and so on.ldquoOne day David turned to me and said, lsquoFrancis you are a very adaptable person, you could be a great help to meyou would like to bersquo.ldquoI was invited up to Hillsborough Castle to work with him and things just took off from there. I enjoy working with people and always went out with the intention of helping others and to make sure that they enjoyed their day, or their dinner. I also always found it easy to chat away to people.At that time, Francis was working as a distribution manager for a group of fashion shops and was the father of three young children with no thoughts of a future career in butlering.Today, he works mostly at Crom Castle and, closer to home, at Montalto House in Ballynahinch, but also looks after an American family when they travel to the British Isles.They take Francis wherever they go, sometimes to the Scottish Highlands and hopefully inSeptember to their Dorset property.ldquoIrsquom hoping that it still happens, admits Francis, whose work, like many others, has been affected by the Covid- pandemic.ldquoI really enjoy it and I love to travel. It doesnrsquot bother me being away from home for maybe several weeks at a time. My family are grown up with families of their own and I think my we is quite content to see me going out and about as she gets her head showered.He and Heather have three children, Robert, Anita and James, and a grandchild, George, who will be one year old soon. A second grandchild is due any day now.Having, in his words, ldquolooked after the late Queen Mother, the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh, their children and Prince Charlesrsquo children, the likes of President Bush, Irish presidents Mary McAleese and Michael D Higgins, Francis admits his disappointment at missing out on meeting Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge.He said: ldquoItrsquos been lovely to look after the Royal Family and a few years ago I was invited up to look after Prince William. I was so looking forward to looking after the couple but unfortunately that was the day the Duchess announced she was pregnant with Prince Louis and couldnrsquot fly over. So I missed that opportunity and would have loved to have met Kate.He believes that having served royalty, he can serve anyone and his nerve has never let him down so far.ldquoI think perhaps once you have attended to the people at Hillsborough Castle, it takes any nerves away, said Francis. ldquoYou think wellI can serve the Queen, then I can serve anyone. No-one is better than anyone  in my eyes. I just go in and do my best for whoever Irsquom looking after.For most people, the role of butler is quite rare today but in the days of stately and larger homes a bulter was the head male servant in a large household and his job was to manage the work of all the other servants.Francis agrees that his role is similar to that of the most famous butler in recent times, Carson, from the hit TV series and movie, Downton Abbey.ldquoThe whole point of being a butler is be unobtrusive but close at hand in the backgroundyou are needed. You need to judge when not to overstay your welcome when you are at the table.ldquoWhat happens there, stays there. I suppose I have developed a reputation for being discreet and I try to be. I would never tell others the conversations I hear around the table. As far as Irsquom concerned, everything is private.ldquoI treat everyone the same, no matter what their position in le, These people are paying my wages. I believe that nobody is better than anyone . If they are there at the table, then Irsquom there to look after them.Unlike Carson, who had to extract Lady Mary out of a number of compromising situations, Francis has never come across anyone who was the worst for wear for drink or found in an embarrassing situation.ldquoI must admit that in the circles I would be in, Irsquove never come across anyone over-indulging. My job is really to be able to turn my hand to anything and to look after people. The butler is really in charge of the household. When I go to work at Crom Castle, the Earl tells me lsquoFrancis, yoursquore in charge, itrsquos over to yoursquo.Working with some of the best chefs around, Francis admits that hersquos been treated to some delicious dining experiences through his work.ldquoI honestly donrsquot see what I do as work. Itrsquos not workyou love what you do, he said..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Developers asked to show interest in Irish Street site  ","story":"DEVELOPERS will shortly be asked to submit expressions of interest in transforming a major site in the heart of Downpatrick to help bolster the townrsquos economic recovery.The Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council are driving ambitious plans to redevelop a near two acre site encompassing the former Irish Street police station, a number of adjacent empty buildings and the local authority-owned car park.While it was feared that the coronavirus pandemic could delay plans to redevelop of the huge site, work has continued on the project with a new brochure produced to provide would-be developers and other interested parties with an overview of the sitersquos potential and secure expressions of interest.The development site stretches as far back as St Patrickrsquos Avenue and is also adjacent to the Irish Street car park, with council officials looking to make the brochure available to the public virtually.Described as a ldquostrategic and prominent location in the heart of Downpatrick, senior council officials, politicians and members of the business community are excited at the Irish Street sitersquos development potential and are working towards drawing up a development brief.While the former police base enjoys protected status, it is hoped that potential developers will be able to come up with an imaginative plan for the historic building and that a preferred bidder will be appointed as early as October and as late as the end of the year.The council and the Department for Communities are keen to revitalise Irish Street and hope its redevelopment will act as a catalyst for the wider economic and social regeneration of the town.Council officials say that the Irish Street project is vital to the recovery of the local economy, improving the wellbeing of the community and a welcome confidence boost for the construction sector.In addition, they insist that theyrsquore committed to working with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the site and want to hear their feedback on the way forward.The steering group set up to oversee the Downpatrick scheme held a recent progress meeting and council chairwoman Laura Devlin said she was delighted with the projectrsquos momentum.She confirmed that councillors and local authority officials have been working with the Department for Communities and local stakeholders to develop an lsquoonline engagement processrsquo.She explained this is designed to inform the preferred end uses for the Irish Street site and allow key stakeholders to have input into the development brief which is critical to the success of the project.ldquoWhile the Downpatrick regeneration scheme is in the early developmental stages, it will also stimulate signicant investment for the local economy, she added.John Armstrong, from the Construction Employers Federation, said the scheme and a number of others the council is planning for the Newry area, will provide a boost for the local construction sector.South Down MP Chris Hazzard and Downpatrick councillors Dermot Curran and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed the progress being made on redeveloping he site.Mr Hazzard described the regeneration project as a ldquounique and exciting opportunity, one which has the potential to unlock much-needed economic and social opportunity for the town centre and wider community.ldquoThis regeneration project must act as a catalyst for the long overdue expansion of the townrsquos evening and weekend economy its new heartbeat in some respects, he continued.ldquoGiven the sitersquos close proximity to nearby homes, the project must also be viewed as more than a commercial development. It must seek to bind together the town centre with the outlying housing developments and consequently look to improve the economic and social wellbeing of the local community.Cllr Curran agreed that the Irish Street site offered a ldquounique opportunity for the development of business, employment and tourism.He thanked council committees and Department for Infrastructure for supporting the project.He said: ldquoThe Irish Street project represents the single biggest change to the town centre in a generation. It has the potential to transform Downpatrick and itrsquos vital everyone works together to make the regeneration proposal a major success.ldquoThe planned redevelopment is one of the most important projects ever proposed for Downpatrick and it is vital to make the most of the opportunities it presents. The proposal has the potential to add a new vibrancy with local people helping shape how this key site will be transformed.Cllr Hanlon said she was pleased that the next stage of the sitersquos redevelopment is ready for launch, allowing potential developers and interested parties an opportunity to view the site online, with feedback from the local community welcomed.ldquoPeople will be able to give their views on the potential for the site and the likely constraints within any proposed project, she explained. ldquoAny feedback would be used to assist both the council and Department for Communities to prepare a development brief for the site.Cllr Hanlon added: ldquoThe project to redevelop the former police base and surrounding area provides an opportunity to reinvigorate the Downpatrick town centre. This is the opportunity of a generation to restore a vibrant town centre and will build on the ongoing regeneration of the Irish Street area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"DNA testing plans to catch owners over dog fouling  ","story":"DOG owners who fail to clean up after their pets could soon find themselves in court after local politicians agreed to investigate the potential of using DNA testing to catch offenders.Newry, Mourne and Down Council officers have been instructed to examine the merits of testing dog dirt in a bid to trace animals whose owners allow them to use public areas as open air toilets.Under the scheme, a sample of dog dirt would be taken for analysis to trace the identity of the animal, with the owner being subsequently prosecuted.Agreement for officers to research the DNA issue was given at last weekrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee following a proposal tabled by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown.Dog dirt poses a major health risk, especially to children, who could potentially lose their sight as a result of coming into contact with it.Cllr Brown said there was a need to consider innovative ways of tackling the issue which has been raised on a regular basis by elected representatives across the local authorityrsquos seven DEAs.He is keen for the local authority to investigate the viability of using DNA testing in a bid to identy offenders and aid enforcement officers to dish out fines, suggesting that council officers draw upon best practice from other organisations who have introduced such a scheme in a bid to crack down on the dog fouling issue.Council officials say they will need to understand the time and resources required to implement such a scheme before compiling a report on its potential implementation.Cllr Billy Walker has welcomed the decision to investigate the DNA issue and says he cannot understand why dog owners to do not clean up after their pets.He said that the problem was district-wide and hoped that offenders will end up being prosecuted.ldquoI am an advocate of naming and shaming people on this particular issue but it is not a road which the council has been keen to go down. However,we use DNA technology to catch dog owners who allow their pets to foul public areas, their identity will be made publicthey end up in court, he continued.ldquoDog fouling problem is a highly contentious issue and, without doubt, one of the single most complained about problems across our district. It is something that we have not yet to got to grips with, but perhaps the new initiative under consideration will change that.Cllr Walker said it was important to remember that the overwhelming majority of dog owners across the district cleaned up after their pets, but there was a hardcore who did not.He added: ldquoWe have talked about this issue for years and the problem has not diminished in any way.

Photo: Victoria Jones PA WireThe protests were against police officers’ use of force, their attitudes to black people and a lack of accountability for their actions.The demonstrations took place, of course, at the same time as the country was addressing the coronavirus emergency, as the whole world still is.Despite the sense of a crisis within a crisis that developed, it was good to hear Microsoft Corporation co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates telling the BBC that, despite being “very imperfect”, the United States is still “amazing in a lot of ways” not least when it comes to medical research into vaccines and despite “current challenges”.Canon Ian M Ellis, who is a former editor of The Church of Ireland Gazette \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

This was done in a time of deep hurt and pain in our country, and his action did nothing to help us or to heal us,” Presiding Bishop Michael Curry said.The Bishop of Washington, Rt Rev Mariann Budde, told ‘The Washington Post’ she had been “outraged”, adding that everything Mr Trump “has said and done is to inflame violence. We need moral leadership, and he’s done everything to ide us”.Perhaps one of the most striking responses to the George Floyd killing and President Trump’s actions came with the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, pausing speechless for over twenty seconds before answering a reporter’s related question.He then said: “We all watch in horror and consternation what’s going on in the United States. It is a time to pull people together but it is a time to listen. It is a time to learn what injustices continue despite progress over years and decades.”Yet he went on to call on Canadians to accept that there is a parallel problem in their country, stating: “It is a time for us as Canadians to recognise that we too have our challenges, that black Canadians and racialised Canadians face discrimination as a lived reality every single day.”Indeed, racism is a global scourge and a real human indignity.Claire Stam, a writer for the ‘Euractiv’ website which focuses on EU policy and politics, recently recalled the first anniversary of the murder of the former president of Germany’s Kassel district, Walter Lübcke.Mr Lübcke had been responsible for the accommodation of refugees and had been threatened because he stood for democratic values and a humane refugee policy, Claire Stam wrote, adding bluntly: “On  June , he was found dead, shot in the head.”She went on to point out that over the past year “two racist-motivated murderous attacks” followed in the German cities of Hanau and Halle and that this month Senegalese-born German MP Karamba Diabyhad been sent a tweet telling him he is “not welcome” in Germany.Closer to home, Northern Ireland does not have a good reputation either as far as race relations go.Statista, the data providing company, has analysed the number of racially motivated hate crimes in Northern Ireland during the period -, reporting a low point of less than  offences in  , but indicating that “a drastic growth of race crime was recorded in the following years”, rising to a new peak in   with , racist incidents.Belfast has been called the race-hate capital of Europe, which is nothing less than a disgraceful epithet for Northern Ireland’s capital.However, the public expressions of protest at George Floyd’s killing that have taken place in Belfast, while rendering social distancing dficult to say the least, have highlighted a dferent attitude.At the same time, Chief Constable Simon Byrne and the Public Health Agency’s head of health protection, Dr Gerry Waldron, both rightly issued important warnings.The chief constable tweeted that while he condemned the murder of George Floyd, “public protests at this time will endanger lives”, adding: “We must support #BlackLivesMatter but also stop the spread of Covid-.”Dr Waldron said: “We’ve got to bear in mind that the virus hasn’t got any conscience and ... doesn’t recognise good causes.”The death of George Floyd in such tragic and disturbing circumstances must surely cause every person, here and around the world, to think deeply about their own attitudes.• Canon Ian Ellis is a former editor of The Church of Ireland Gazette——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The vast majority of the applications appear to be by bands for July , a Monday, with only a handful of Orange Lodges applying. Many of the applications relate to greater Belfast.The News Letter asked the Parades Commission it would be approving applications which adhere to guidelines andit had any advice for organisers in how to comply with restrictions.A spokesperson for the Parades Commission said:“During lockdown, the majority of band parade organisers agreed to withdraw their notications to parade.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...“Since the easement on Monday evening permitting up to  persons outdoors, bands have submitted new notications, mostly for the Twelfth. Fty parade notications have been received today and yesterday, with more anticipated. Details are on the Commission’s website.”It added that parades are subject to Covid- Regulations, the enforcement of which is a matter for the NI Executive and PSNI.The Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland has restated its position that traditional Twelfth of July parades will not take place this year in light of the pandemic. However it approved the small paradesthey complied with safety requirements.A spokesman said: “We note that several bands have indicated their intention to apply for parades within their communities, with no more than  members and adhering to the social distancing guidelines for the purpose of entertaining people in their gardens and at their front doors. Bands have rightly asked members of the public not to follow them. Instead, they have encouraged a ‘stay at home’ message with the band bringing music to them. This is a model the Institution would support as it compliments our ‘Twelfth at Home’ campaign.”It has been reported that the Attorney General has told the Parades Commission that it has no legal powers to prevent bands from marching on The Twelfth.Aletter, seen by the Belfast , was reportedly sent to the watchdog from the Attorney General’s Office earlier this month. It reportedly said that the Coronavirus health regulations do not “ban parades of any nature” and as such, the Commission has “no enforcement powers”. The Commission declined to confirm to the News Letter whether it had received such a letter.Last month Broughshane man Craig Sloan expressed “shock” to the News Letter after the Commission declined to process his application for a socially distanced parade of six people on July , which he believed was within lawful limits at that time. The commission argued that Coronavirus legislation forbade parades because because they came under restrictions on movement and gatherings.Meanwhile, First Minister Arlene Foster was asked by RTE at a press conference todaySinn Fein’s conduct at the funeral of leading republican Bobby Storey this week would be likely to encourage unionists to ask why they could not parade in July Mrs Foster replied: “Nobody enjoys the marching season as much as I do ... and I have to say the leadership of the Orange Order and the Black Preceptory and the Apprentice Boys has been very clear that they want to protect the community that they live in.”They don’t want people to catch the Coronavirus. They do want to celebrate in a way that is not only safe but that recognises the time of the year that we are in.”And you know what.... two wrongs don’t make a right... I am asking them to continue to work with the Executive as they have been. I met with the officers of the Grand Orange Lodge last Friday.“We had a hugely constructive meeting about how we could celebrate in a way that did not put people in danger and I will continue those conversations.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Powys.NRW proposed the dam as one option to alleviate potential flood risk.More NewsVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldMillions become unpaid carers due to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become an exemplar of good practice. community involvement and support will remain key features of our campaign.He added: ldquoWe are grateful to people far and wide who have supported our campaign, including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the A to reduce flood risk.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquolsquoFollowing our meeting on May  Sir David Henshaw chairman of NRW wrote to me on May  to say that NRW received almost  responses to our consultation on the Outline Business Case with the vast majority being opposed to the upstream storage option on the Cadoxton Brook.NRW chairman, Sir Henshaw said: ldquoWhen we consider the marginal case for this option, it is therefore clear that we will not be pursuing an upstream storage scheme. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

ldquoThe best part of le-boating is working well as a team.ldquoWe maintain this team spirit by regularly exercising and training both ashore and afloat.ldquoSince opening our new station at the south

favourite rsquoshoutsrsquo are oddly those which occur in the early hours of the morning on a spring day.ldquoBy the time the job has been completed and the boats are washed down and prepared again

These include:Communication of health information, and how effective it isCultural issues relating to the suitability of health and social services for BAME communitiesIncome and employment insecurity, which is experienced disproportionately by BAME communitiesPoor quality of ethnicity data, which is preventing accurate analysisHousing overcrowding and environmentThe financial burden created by migration statusThe role of structural and systemic racism and disadvantage.The report is by the BAME Covid- expert advisory group, set up by First Minister Mark Drakeford to look at the reasons why people from BAME communities were more likely to be adversely affected by coronavirus.:One of its two sub-groups was tasked with examining the socio-economic factors, chaired by Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna, professor of management and organization at Cardf Business School, Cardf University.\"Therersquos an overall theme running through our research for this report. It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females. Signicant dferences also remain for Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Indian men. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Photo courtesy of Google.A ferry, carrying cars and animals as well as produce had operated at the Bannfoot for generations but shut in the s.Recently an online campaign calling for afootbridgeover the Bann River at this point has received almost  signatures of support.However there has been opposition from residents in the Charlestown village close to the Bannfoot.Mr O’Dowd said:“It is not sustainable for cycling and walking around the Lough to be impeded by the failure to bridge the Bann foot, whether it’s a road bridge or foot bridge the opportunity should now be seized to use some of this £m windfall to deliver what is needed.“Bridging the Bann foot is of regional importance and as with any such projects the concerns of locals should be upheld where possible but the project must be delivered. “As with so many regional projects the greater benefit has to be taken on board and to date this has not been the case by decision makers.“I would call on the Minister and the Council to now move forward with this important infrastructural project and open up Lough Neagh and its adjoining communities to the true economic potential of cycling and walking tourism.”The Department for Infrastructure was asked for a response but none was received at the time of going to press.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

reopenArmagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council has confirmed its camping facilitieswill reopen at three sites in the borough.By The NewsroomFriday, th June , : pm\"\"Photo by Aaron McCracken HarrisonsThe matter was raised at a Council’s monthly meeting by UUP Alderman Jim Speers who asked when caravan sites across the borough would be reopening.“Gosford generates businesses for Markethill and we want to see that opening up as well as a site in Clare Glen,” said the Alderman.“A lot of people will want to be out and about andit can be done safely at these sites, it should be.”In response to these comments, Council’s strategic director,Mark Parkinson, confirmed caravan sites at both Gosford Forest Park and Clare Glen would open from Friday, June .“Gosford will open on June  and so will Clare Glen,” said Mr Parkinson.“The site at Kinnego will reopen on Friday, July , and at all these sites the caravan, camping, toilet and shower facilities will be available.”SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon askedthose who had made bookings before the outbreak of the COVID- pandemic and subsequently had their bookings cancelled, were being contacted to ensure they could still avail of the service.“Some people had booked their slots at these sites early in January and paid for them,” said Cllr O’Hanlon. “They were quickly refunded during the outbreak and that was good and the right thing to do but have we made contact with those people now “They had been on the ball and made their bookings early, it wouldbe a shamethey were now to miss out, when the sites have reopened, through no real fault of their own.”His question went unanswered on the night and when the Local Democracy Reporting Service asked Council for an answer, a spokesperson said it is working to accommodateall bookings.“As Council begins to reopen its caravanning and camping facilities at Clare Glen, Gosford Forest Park and Kinnego Marina, we are working with the public to accommodateall bookings where possible based on reduced capacity and in compliance with social distancing and PHA guidance,” said a Council spokesperson.“We will continue to keep this under review.”\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\"
