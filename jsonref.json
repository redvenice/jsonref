She was in blue jeans and a twin-set with pearls, which she fingered constantly.As I walked into the flat, Diana\u0027s shoulders were bowed as though standing straight would draw too much attention. Her skin was transparent and she blushed continuously, especially when talking about Charles. \u0027It\u0027s absolutely maddening to see things written about me, and him, when I haven\u0027t said anything.\u0027 She paused. \u0027But I don\u0027t know what the future holds.\u0027I asked if anyone was advising her on how to handle the situation. \u0027No!\u0027 she said, shocked. \u0027I don\u0027t think the Royal Family is aware of what is happening here. At least we didn\u0027t talk about it when we were in Norfolk.\u0027Apparently she\u0027d crept away at night the previous weekend to stay at Sandringham, managing to evade reporters. I wondered aloud if she\u0027d wound sheets together to climb out of the window. She laughed. \u0027No, I got a very fast driver and we shot off in a puff of smoke. I had my new car delivered somewhere else where I stayed the night, then shot off to Norfolk.\u0027 It was Prince Charles\u0027s 32nd birthday party. \u0027Unfortunately,\u0027 she added, \u0027somebody found out I had a new car and even though I parked it miles away they found it.\u0027So the siege went on. \u0027I\u0027ve no idea why the whole thing has built up to such a peak,\u0027 she shrugged. \u0027I think it\u0027s because everything happens for the Royal Family in November. Princess Anne married and had a baby in November. It\u0027s the Queen and Prince Philip\u0027s anniversary. And of course it\u0027s Charles\u0027s birthday and everyone is dying for him to get married, and I was the one who was around this time.\u0027A little disingenuous perhaps. Not every pretty young woman is asked to stay at Sandringham for these highly personal events.         Every morning when she tried to jump into her red Mini, photographers would race her to the first set of traffic lights, hoping she would be stopped long enough for them to get a shot or, worse, that they would cause a little accident, which would give a more dramatic shotThen she changed the subject, apologising for what a nuisance all the attention must be for other people in our building. \u0027It must be so bloody for everyone who lives here,\u0027 she said. \u0027I feel so awful about it.\u0027 I assured her we were taking it in our collective stride.I knew she wanted me to write what she said, although she was afraid to say much. She thought she was \u0027suitable\u0027 for a future king, only because she did not \u0027sleep around\u0027. It was clear she thought herself second best to her older sister, who had been Prince Charles\u0027s girlfriend for almost a year but had been crossed off the eligibility list. Not for lack of blue blood – the Spencer blood was probably bluer than the Windsors\u0027 – but for reportedly telling journalists she\u0027d had \u0027thousands of boyfriends\u0027. Diana strongly implied she was a virgin, and she obviously felt that was the only reason \u0027The Family\u0027 had approved her as a future bride, although I did not write that in my interview. \u0027I don\u0027t really know why they like me,\u0027 was what I wrote. \u0027You see my sister Sarah was going out with Charles last year and she talked about it to the Press but she talked too much and they murdered her.\u0027I\u0027m OK because I haven\u0027t got a background.\u0027 I looked surprised. No background? Daughter of the 8th Earl Spencer, distantly related to the Royal Family, directly related to the Churchills? No, it turned out she meant a background of leaping in and out of bed with people. \u0027That\u0027s what everyone else seems to have. I mean I haven\u0027t had a chance to have that kind of background, I\u0027m still only 19!\u0027 She looked shocked and embarrassed. \u0027But people are longing to dig something up about me.\u0027 She looked at me sideways. \u0027It\u0027s like the story about me meeting him on the Royal Train in the middle of the night.\u0027She was referring to reports, denied by the Palace, that she\u0027d had an assignation with the prince when the train was in sidings in Wiltshire. \u0027I simply couldn\u0027t believe it,\u0027 she exploded. \u0027I\u0027ve never been near the train, let alone in the middle of the night!\u0027 I was told later, by a reliable source, that the woman on board was Camilla.I was very sympathetic, but as I turned to go, realising a cup of tea was not on the cards, she apologised again for the disruption she\u0027d caused to others in our building. \u0027I am so, so sorry for interrupting the lives of the people who live here,\u0027 she said.She told me when she was finally allowed a bodyguard, a woman dressed in black who shadowed her like a, well, shadow, a very dark one, but effective. I could see the top of the woman\u0027s head as I slipped down the stairs behind Diana, neither of us waiting for the old Victorian lift. None of the other members of the Press spotted her, that\u0027s for sure. Diana, soon to be HRH Princess of Wales, was learning her lesson.                 "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/06/29/16/15417522-7195757-image-a-43_1561822219895.jpg","title":"Meghan shares hug stars Boston Red Sox Harry meet team ahead Yankees match","story":"Make like Meghan in a dress by Stella McCartneyShop the label at NET-A-PORTERThe Duchess of Sussex made a rare appearance during her maternity leave this weekend when she met the Red Sox players with Prince Harry at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.We first noticed that Meghan had swapped her beloved Aquazzura stilettos for a pair of the designer’s ballet flats before our eyes jumped to her gorgeous Stella McCartney dress.

After spending a few hours there, which earned him the local nickname Photie Man, he would head over to watch the football, surrounded by men.But at the market the crowds were mostly made up of women. Wood became fascinated with the family relationships of those around him the features shared across different faces the interactions between the women and girls, now celebrated in his latest show, Mothers, Daughters, Sisters, opening tomorrow at the Arles photography festival.“Liverpool is a really matriarchal city in many ways,” he says. “When all the riots were going on, and unemployment was high, it was women who held everything together.” Wood’s Irish background helped him get to know the market-goers. “Everyone in Liverpool has some kind of Irish relative. A lot of women, I’d look them in the eye and it was like looking at my mother. It’s like a shared understanding.”The market was an ongoing source of inspiration for Wood. “When you see women in town, around Marks \u0026amp Spencer and those shops, people have a kind of a mask on – the face they present is not themselves. But because this was out of town and everybody kind of knew each other, the women were just really natural and open, not dressed up particularly.”Wood now lives in north Wales, but visited the market again a few weeks ago. “It’s smaller, it doesn’t sprawl along the road as it used to. But it was just as exciting and interesting. I don’t think I would have made the pictures I’ve made anywhere else in the UK. There’s an energy in the place and the people are really generous and open. It was a pleasure going there every week – the pictures are made out of absolute affection.”Tom Wood’s exhibition Mothers, Daughters, Sisters will appear at Les Rencontres d’Arles, France, from 1 July to 25 August.

Oh, how Wolfe throws those words up, around, over and through - everything.“I am not sure why,” says gavernism, “but I am re reading The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde by Stevenson”:Perhaps because I feel that social media today plays the role that chemicals play in that novel: it opens up a dark side of us that can roam around in the dark, anonymously, doing as it pleases. The issue now, as with the novel, is that hidden never really stays hidden, does it?The Silk Roads: A New History of the World by Peter Frankopan is “outstanding” according to darrylxxx:So many interesting stories, connections, insights and so easy to relate to where we are now as a global population. Shows how things ebb and flow over time – our current “reality” isn’t fixed in stone.“I do love Home Front diaries,” says NicolaVintageReads, who has been reading May Smith’s wartime diary These Wonderful Rumours:Ration books, Time and Tide magazine, sitting in a cold cellar waiting for the all-clear siren, tennis parties, wartime wedding cakes with cardboard imitation icing, seeing the newly released Disney films Dumbo and Pinocchio at the cinema, billeting evacuees, fear or Goering’s plans but spirit of the Blitz.WebberExpat is also “loving” Lucia Berlin’s A Manual For Cleaning Women:A bitterly hilarious, brutally truthful, elegantly incisive collection. Wonderful, just a brilliant, up-front, trusthworthy voice. One which does not overstay its welcome, nor get too repetitive meandering between stories.The sense of growing unease is palpable. I like the way Roth explores events – mainly a growing wave of anti-semitism in an isolationist America in WW2 governed by a right wing president – through the experience of a really well-defined young Jewish boy and his family.Becoming by Michelle Obama has impressed nicegirl2:I’m not really one for reading non-fiction but this is brilliant – so well written, smart, funny and humble (so far).Visions of Gerard by Jack Kerouac haunts dylan37:A childhood in the 1920s, a saintly hero brother who disappears too soon, Catholic dreams in a Massachusetts winter, survivor guilt and a family struggling with mourning.There’s a different kind of Kerouac energy here introspective, spiritual, angelic and natural. The ghosts of the great wanderers float through these words – William Blake and Walt Whitman, with the touch and feel of sad autumn leaves. There’s that strange melancholy of a dying season, disappearing like smoke from a slow burn bonfire. A haunting and beautiful small book, about the biggest of subjects.Red Bones by Ann Cleeves has intrigued jimitron5000:There is a certain slow burning intrigue about this book. The location adds an immense amount to the story and covers for the times when not much happens. It develops nicely into a really enjoyable novel. I have read the first two and will endeavour to read the rest of the series. Funnily enough I have never managed to sit through a whole episode of the TV show.Finally, a fascinating literary nugget from Zdzisław Najder’s, Joseph Conrad: A Life, courtesy of interwar:Pursuing Joseph Conrad’s beginnings as a writer, I came across this:In March 1893 the Torrens, “one of the most famous sailing ships of its day”, set sail from Adelaide, Australia on its return voyage to London. On board was a wealthy young English barrister who had been travelling round the Pacific. From shipboard he wrote to his mother about meeting a remarkable man, the ship’s Polish mate:“A capital chap, though queer to look at he is a man of travel and experience in many parts of the world, and has a fund of yarns .... He has been right up the Congo and all around Malacca and Borneo and other out of the way parts…”John Galsworthy had not yet turned to writing and his new friend, Konrad Korzeniowski, though secretly working on a novel, had not yet become Joseph Conrad. Both would remain friends, however, as they gained fame for their fiction.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

Accountancy firm EY is assisting with the sale process.Network Rail said: “We have made an indicative offer for some railway critical assets although our overwhelming preference is that a purchaser for the entire business is found. We are very clear that our offer will not undermine that.“Our role is to safely run the railway for the millions of people who rely on it every day and we are exploring all options to make sure we can continue to do that.” The government-owned company said it would only pursue its offer if another buyer is not found.British Steel collapsed in May after Greybull asked the government for £30m to help avert its collapse. The government declined to bail out the company, opting instead to look for a new owner.Greybull had bought Tata’s long products ision in 2016 for £1 and revived the British Steel brand. The company quickly returned to profitability in the 2016-17 financial year, but has since struggled.Greybull, which made millions of pounds in fees from British Steel, said that Brexit-related uncertainty had added to problems, with European buyers wary of committing to purchases that could be hit by tariffs if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.A bid by Greybull for parts of the business, which could include British Steel’s Dutch or French operations, would be highly controversial.Greybull said it had been the only party willing to step in to save the Scunthorpe plant in 2016, keeping it running.The spokesman said: “While we tried to create a viable long-term business, the challenging economic environment and the uncertainty caused by Brexit made that unattainable.“EY are conducting a worldwide search for parties willing to invest in the entire group. If that search fails, we remain keen to rescue many of the activities of the wider business and offer sustainable employment for as many of the highly skilled workforce as possible.”Nic Dakin, the Labour MP for Scunthorpe, said Greybull should not be able to walk away with parts of the business. Greybull has some “serious questions to answer” over British Steel’s collapse, he said, adding that a spinoff of parts of the business to the company would be a “fairly outrageous outcome”.Dakin said he hoped that the business would be preserved whole, preserving the jobs of the British Steel workers and a further 20,000 jobs in the broader economy.British Steel has continued to run as normal during the sale process, with the government giving the receiver an indemnity, allowing it to continue to pay wages. Workers, the bulk of whom are based at the blast furnace in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, have broken output records since the financial failure, according to the government.Unite assistant general secretary Steve Turner said it would be an “economic and industrial disaster” for British Steel to close. As one of the UK’s last two blast furnace steelworks, the Scunthorpe plant is considered by many to be vital to preserving the UK’s defensive capabilities.Turner said: “Should a responsible buyer for the whole of the company not be found then we would urge the government to bring the steelmaker under public control. Steel is a foundation industry and British Steel is a central pillar of UK manufacturing, sustaining communities and thousands of jobs.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eebf178c48ae37bd20a750e2099f1a4d150de3ac/0_51_4612_2767/master/4612.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49af0c8371b82d5cc77420e477895119","title":"western democracy putin g20","story":"Next year, an Arab country will host the G20 summit for the first time. Which country has earned this honour? Such recognition as a player in this powerful global club? Its impressive climb in this regard is even more remarkable given that only a few short months ago, this Arab state was supposedly on its way to pariah status.That’s right. Saudi Arabia is hosting the 2020 summit, managing to not only overcome the reputational damage of the murder of Jamal Khashoggi in the country’s consulate in Turkey less than a year ago, but also doing so just weeks after more grisly details of the killing were revealed. Saudi officials were reported to have referred to Khashoggi as “the sacrificial animal” while discussing how he was to be dismembered. Saudi’s moment of coming in from the (relative) cold even had an official photo at last week’s G20 summit. All the world leaders lined up, looked at the camera and waved, apart from Donald Trump and Mohammed bin Salman – lost in mutual adoration – who only had eyes for each other.Vladimir Putin’s comments to the Financial Times at the G20 about the death of liberalism (an idea that has “outlived its purpose”) could not have come at a more appropriate moment. It felt like a eulogy to the memory of Khashoggi’s murder. Putin’s just a troll, some said, best ignored. He wants attention, it’s a ersion, have you seen the state of Russia’s economy? And how do you define liberalism anyway? All this is true. Putin might not be the best qualified political scientist to define what liberalism is and when it is in decline, but I think it is fair to say that liberalism is not in the greatest of health.Before we get lost in definitional defensiveness, I don’t mean the everyday sort of liberalism, one that is probably better described as cosmopolitanism. The kind that makes you look around your erse locality, the quiet tolerance of the majority and think that all is well. Not the kind of liberalism that is borne out by polls showing that there is increased acceptance of immigration or LGBT people. Or the liberalism of technical democracy, where we still elect leaders in free and fair(ish) elections. This is corporate campaign liberalism, new Arsenal kit launch, urban fist-bumping liberalism.What is in trouble is the liberalism that underscores political process, legislation and mobilisation. We live in a time where inidual liberty and the spoils of freedom are meted out based on a racial and economic hierarchy, where political victories are won by promising that rights and privileges will be taken away from those who haven’t “earned it” – the poor, the undocumented and the simply different – a ide between the deserving and the undeserving. It is more than rhetoric lives are directly affected by this, further disenfranchised by the loss of benefits, the impossibility of full and legal settlement in a new country, and the everyday stigmatisation of Muslims. “Plain speaking” and being “done with political correctness” is cover for this segregation of rights.That was the most chilling aspect of Putin’s comments – it is not hard to imagine them being spoken by a supposedly more genteel western politician. Criticism of multiculturalism, scaremongering on trans identity (“They claim now that children can play five or six gender roles,” said Putin) and the rhetoric of the elite abandoning the “real people” is all too common. As much as we try to put clear daylight between the state of Anglo-American liberalism and Putin’s shambolic dictatorship, the more the facts confound us.Donald Tusk, presumably imagining himself in a sort of West Wing version of the EU, disagreed so much with Putin that, unfortunately, in his indignation he ended up reinforcing the point. What Tusk finds “really obsolete is authoritarianism, personality cults and the rule of oligarchs”. Authoritarianism, personality cults and the rule of oligarchs? We certainly could not see that in the UK, where the Conservative party is on its way to self-destruction while it drags the country with it for the sake of power sought through appealing to an authoritarian populist streak. And where a man such as Boris Johnson is about to become prime minister on the back of a personality cult worshipped by a narrow Conservative electorate, and billionaires (we don’t call them oligarchs here, that’s reserved for foreigners) are investigated for breaking the law in funding political campaigns.Just to drive Putin’s point home even more brutally, Trump exchanged some friendly badinage with the Russian president at the beginning of their first formal meeting at the summit. Referring to journalists, Trump said, “Get rid of them. Fake news is a great term, isn’t it? You don’t have this problem in Russia but we do.” Putin responded, in English: “We also have. It’s the same.” A warm chuckle followed. A few days later, Trump became the first sitting US president to set foot in North Korea after making overtures to Kim Jong-un. Trump looks no longer like an anomaly – more like a member of the demagogue gang.There is still a fixation on the practical differences between straight dictatorships such as Saudi Arabia, Russia and North Korea and western countries where the practical processes of universal suffrage and rule of law are still in place. No one is seizing power by force or suspending constitutions here. But the belief in this rigid distinction is a narcissism that fails to account for all the ways a liberal order can be undermined within the confines of what appears a robust democracy. Putin put it rather well when pressed by the FT on the fact that he was handed power from Boris Yeltsin 20 years ago. He shrugged: “So what?”Sitting in the UK as Johnson is about to be the second unelected PM in a row, ruling a party and a country paralysed by a hastily and poorly planned referendum, I would say the same to those who argue that at least we live in a democracy. So what?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0dac89af8c7b5cb1241be0028d84b84a724e15c/0_163_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9555ec4c59a45a54d03d2814f4857ed5","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of radiant","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘radiant’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘radiant’.Share your photos of what radiant means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 3 July at 10am.

Tasneem-Summer Khan meets a coach, an umpire, and a player inspiring girls and the game to come togetherYou won’t often hear cricket described as trailblazing it’s more commonly thought of as reactionary. However, spurred on by a summer of World Cup and Ashes cricket, women and girls all over Britain are making their mark on the sport.Asma Ajaz-Ali, a third-generation British Pakistani who grew up in inner-city Birmingham, experienced a variety of socioeconomic and cultural barriers to playing the game. Despite this lack of access to the formal game, she taught her brothers to play on an informal basis, then began running sessions for women and girls who had never before held a bat, supported by Warwickshire CC.“People think cricket is all upper middle-class men,” says Ajaz-Ali, who joined the ECB’s ambitious South Asian Action Plan, supported by NatWest, that aims to transform community engagement by recruiting 2,000 female mentors. “I go to mosques, temples, community centres, and get children and women from everywhere involved. Children see their mothers coaching and feel pride. It tells them they can do that too. These initiatives change opportunities and cultural attitudes for generations.”Ajaz-Ali prefers to focus on the future than lamenting her own lack of opportunity growing up. “I can’t bring back that time for me, but I can offer something to these girls,” she says. She sees change happening in the sport and aspires to generate more: “I have women playing in shalwar kameez, I coach asylum seekers. The point is to break down barriers and build inclusivity. Cricket is such a cool sport. It’s vibrant, it’s dynamic, and we have to try harder to make more people, particularly girls of all backgrounds, understand that.”Much like Ajaz-Ali, Laura Caughey found it hard to get a game of cricket. Growing up in Northern Ireland, she attempted to join a team as a child, only to be told she could practise with the boys but, lacking female peers, could not play in matches. “That stuck with me through adulthood and it’s not something I want more girls to experience.”Caughey decided to focus on a different aspect of the sport – umpiring. “I’d watch Simon Taufel and study what he did … he was my cricket idol growing up.” She became Ireland’s second female umpire this year when she was appointed to the representative panel of match officials.Through umpiring, Caughey has met like-minded people and helped to shape the conversation through administrative panels, eventually helping to set up and develop a women’s side at her local Carrickfergus CC. Reflecting on the enduring dismissive attitudes towards women in the sport, she says: “I just want to enjoy my season and let my on-field speak for me.”Ellie Threlkeld has been playing cricket for 10 years. She credits her experiences in mixed-gender cricket for developing skills which saw her move from the age-group county setup to playing for Lancashire Thunder in the semi-professional Kia Super League.Recognising the limited prospects for women cricketers, she opted to study psychology at Loughborough. The university’s enviable facilities and MCCU membership enable her to simultaneously develop her game and prepare for another option if cricket doesn’t work out.Threlkeld – who has ambitions to replace her England wicketkeeping heroes Sarah Taylor and Amy Jones one day – volunteers, coaches, and does ambassador work to grow interest and participation. “Assemblies get a great turnout, and girls can see how good it is to be a cricketer, but kids don’t just need role models – they need more thrown into the game so it’s an actual career.“A lot of women don’t have the option to train full-time – they need to work to earn a living. If there was money involved in the game, everything would improve faster.”With women all over the country dedicating their time and energy to the sport, barriers are shifting – new generations of girls are becoming women under the tutelage of these inspirational characters, and it’s hard to imagine anything but a positive future for British women’s cricket.For almost four decades, NatWest has supported cricket, with a mission to make the game easier for everyone to play and enjoy. A proud partner of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and the charity Chance to Shine, NatWest champions cricket at all levels - from grassroots support for local clubs and getting more people involved in the game to supporting current and future England stars and helping fans cheer on their teams, however and wherever they choose.With NatWest, cricket is a game that has #NoBoundaries.

It remains at large, police confirm.The snake is a reticulated python, which can grow up to 9.6 metres (31.5ft), making them the largest of the Pythonidae family.Native to Asia, they are able to survive in urban and suburban areas in spite of their large size.They are non-venomous. Instead the animal uses its powerful bite to catch its prey – typically mammals and birds – usually followed by constriction, squeezing it tightly in the coils of its body.The charity released figures in April revealing that it rescued more than 4,000 exotic pets last year.The RSPCA believes that the high number of incidents involving these pets could be due to inexperienced owners being misinformed on how to care for them, resulting in the animals escaping or being abandoned or neglected.An abandoned three-metre long boa constrictor found in the backseat of a Bristol car was among the 15,790 emergency callouts the RSPCA received across England and Wales in 2018.It also appears this is not the first time Cambridgeshire constabulary has dealt with snakes, after officers found a large corn snake in May. Suspected to be a lost pet, it was taken to a wildlife centre in Stretham.Police urge anyone who sees the missing python not to approach it, but to phone 101, the non-emergency number."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf75df32c69db778c09cce6d53c45364ff4f33d0/0_107_3052_1831/master/3052.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=000cb43852a4b827d0ec705f1dc7645b","title":"uganda v egypt african cup of nations live","story":"The hosts stride on to the next round with a perfect record - three wins from three matches and no goals conceded - and they will be joined by Uganda, who have them a real fright here and should have scored at least one goal. It was a thoroughly entertaining match. The Pharaohs and Cranes may be joined in the next round by DR Congo, who found form at last and crushed Zimbabwe 4-0. 90+2 min: El Mohamady leaps to win a header but then lands horribly, smashing his face into the grass. There’ll be another break as he receives attention.Egypt substitution: Gaber on, Elmohamady off. The manager daren’t withdraw Salah, apparently. No rest for the sainted.90 min: There will be at least five more minutes. Enough time for Uganda to get a goal to reward their vibrant attacking? 88 min: After much ado about a freekick, Egypt eventually decide who’s going to take it ... and they waste it. Still, they managed to run down the clock, brining them that bit closer to victory. 87 min: Salah, wide on the right, chops back on to his left foot and tries his luck from the corner of the box. The shot flies over the bar.86 min: Freekick to Egypt wide on the right. El Said delivers, but Hegazi can’t reach it.82 min: Corner to Uganda, as Abdu tears down the right again and sends in a cross that’s put behind. El-Shenawy makes a mess of his attempt to cut out the incoming corner but gets lucky, as no one anticipated him missing the ball at the near post, so it bounces across the face of goal to safety.GOAL! Zimbabwe 0-4 DR Congo (Assombalonga 78) Their ‘best third-placed’ prospects are improving by the minute. 79 min: A flash of trickery brings yelps of joy from the home crowd, who haven’t had much to cheer about in this half, which has been dominated by effervescent Uganda. 75 min: Ashraf pads down the left and hoists over a cross. It sails beyond the back post.73 min: A long ball from the back catches out Hegazi, whose nod back to the keeper isn’t strong enough. Okwi latches on to it and nudges it past the advancing keeper ... and a yard past the post! Uganda still haven’t scored. Incredible! Uganda substitution: Odongkara on, Onyango off. The first-choice goalkeeper leaves on a stretcher. It’s still not clear what happened him: it doesn’t seem to be a contact-injury. Might it be heat-related? There has been no water-breaks in this match. GOAL! Zimbabwe 0-3 DR Congo. Bakambu has struck his second of the game for the Leopards, suggesting that he and his team have found form at last. And it just might be enough for them to sneak though as one of the best t third-placed teams. Uganda are definitely going to finish second (unless they come back and beat Egypt here).67 min: Onyango goes down and asks for treatment. The ball was nowhere near him at the time so it’s not clear what’s wrong. 65 min: Better from Egypt. They pop the ball around for a bit, deflating Uganda’s vim and then try to up the tempo in the final third and wrench open the opposing defence. But Uganda stay vigilant and fend them off. 63 min: Salah tries to wriggle free in the centre circle but can’t get away from Aucho, who eventually takes the ball off him. 62 min: Well Uganda aren’t going to get a goal if they keep shooting like that: Miya wastes a promising freekick with a useless shot wide of the near post. 61 min: Elmohamady booked for tripping Okwi just outside the Egyptian box, at the left-hand corner of it. Uganda will be sick if they don’t finish this match with a goal, at least, given the amount of pressure they’ve put on the hosts. 60 min: What a let-off for Egypt! A freekick from the right reached Aucho beyond the back post and when he flashes it hard and low across the face of goal, Ashraf tried to clear hastily but shanked it just wide of his own post! 59 min: Kyambadde catches Elmohamady with a very late sliding challenge. Then he complains when shown a yellow card. 57 min: Miya sends a good effort spinning over the wall ... and on to the roof of the net. 56 min: This isn’t about counter-attacking any more: Uganda are controlling possession and have corralled the hosts into their own half. Egypt are forced into conceding a freekick some 25 yards out, bang centre. 54 min: Elmohamady fails to clear a cross from the right, letting the ball bounce to Miya, who lets fly from 10 yards. but Elmohamady reacts quickly enough to get a slight deflection on to it, causing it to whizz over the bar. It’s quite surprising that Uganda haven’t scored yet. They continue to create great chances. 51 min: Ashraf wins possession authoritatively to launch a counter-attack. Trezeguet nips a lovely ball through to Salah, who has a great chance to claim his second goal. Running at speed in to the right-hand corner of the box, he tries to curl it around the keeper and into the far corner, but Onyango makes a terrific save! 49 min: El Mohamady harassed into conceding another corner after another promising move orchestrated by Miya. Another bad delivery, though.47 min: Uganda threaten again, MIya driving inches wide from 12 yards! The flag was up for offside but the replay confirms that he was on. 46 min: Uganda get the second half going. They’ve made no personnel change - Kaddu still on standby - and surely won’t change their counter-attacking zest. It’s been an exhilarating half, and the scoreline doesn’t tell the story well. Because Uganda were the better side for most of it, their speed and enterprise seriously troubling the hosts. But the Pharaohs look to be heading to the top of the group thanks to a fine freekick by Salah and a nice goal on the break by Elmohamady, who now has four goals in his last eight matches for his country. Uganda have shown enough attacking quality to suggest this game is not quite done and the good news is they are likely to secure second spot in the group even if they lose, because DR Congo are leading 2-0 against Zimbabwe in the other game in this group. Stay tuned!Trezeguet charges down the left and crosses low. It’s fractionally beyond Salah, but Elmohamady retrieves at the right-hand side of the box and lashes a crisp low shot into the bottom corner from 12 yards!43 min: Kyambadde bothers Egypt again with his searing pace, and then releases Abdu, running in to the right-hand side of the box. Abdu’s shot is weak but El-Shenawy decides against trying to catch it and instead pushes it out for a corner. 42 min: Salah scoots down the right but fails to deliver a useful cross. 40 min: Emad slides in to disposses Kyambadde on half-way. He won the ball but send the forward flying. One of the most satisfying things a defender can do, but many refs frown upon that these days."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06f4d05b38134b4a0a3ca6be283da1c9cb0629a0/22_618_8178_4907/master/8178.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f2cf13d12490bda83b680d504e746e0","title":"house plants bloom economy wellbeing","story":"Instagram-friendly and bursting with ‘wellbeing benefits’, pot plants are being repackaged and reinvented by smart online entrepreneurs. Alex Moshakis reports on a growing trendIn October last year, an American entrepreneur named Eliza Blank raised $5m in venture funding for the Sill, a New York brand described on its website as “A modern plant destination for the modern plant lover.” Blank established the Sill in 2012, with the help of a Kickstarter campaign. “We want to make it fun and easy to own a plant!” she wrote then. It had not been fun and easy for Blank up to that point. Every time she moved from one city apartment to another, she would “try to integrate plants into my home,” she says, but, “I would just kill every single one of them.” She noticed friends facing similar struggles: they neither knew of convenient places to buy plants nor, crucially, how to look after them. Monsteras slowly dwindled peace lilies faded to stem fronds slumped to an unhappy limp… You couldn’t call it a bloodbath, really, but there was slaughter.“Plants are assuredly good!” Blank says. But where to buy them in the city and how to become a dutiful plant parent? “I asked: ‘Why isn’t there a consumer brand that can elevate this to commodity status?’” She became frustrated at first, then excited, the way entrepreneurs do, I suppose, when landing on a new growth opportunity. She would sell plants online! Bird’s nest ferns. Cheese plants. Moss balls… then offer consumers helpful information about how to not kill them.Blank’s Kickstarter campaign raised $12,632, hardly big money, but enough as a seedling. She was banking on houseplants becoming rising stars of commerce – snake plants as retail phenoms. The market was ripe, she thought, or at least ripening, because she had noticed houseplants appearing more frequently online. And she was right. In the years since the Sill launched, business has grown month by month, in tandem with the increased standing of the houseplant as an arbiter of millennial taste. The American gardening industry alone is now worth $48bn, according to the National Gardening Association. That is big business and it is getting bigger. Younger fingers in particular are becoming greener. Last year Blank sold more than 100,000 plants, more than 270 a day, predominantly to millennials, pulling in around $5m in revenue, she says – profits succulent enough to keep investors chirpy.To meet consumer demand, the brand recently opened three bricks-and-mortar stores, two in New York and one in Los Angeles. It is no great leap to assume that the yucca you just “liked” on Instagram, positioned carefully in the corner of a Brooklyn loft, or a Manhattan brownstone, or even some condo in Middle America – the Sill does not discriminate by postal code – comes from Blank’s stock.Plants were not one of Blank’s childhood passions. Before launching the Sill, she worked in marketing, and she thinks like a retail strategist: how can we best reach consumers and ensure they’re happy? How can we convince our customer base of the must-have status of the kentia palm?The same can be said of Freddie Blackett, also a former marketeer, also once not so green-fingered. In 2015 Blackett launched Patch, an online platform that sells houseplants to homes in London. By his own admission, he had few horticultural credentials before setting Patch up, but he too sensed an opportunity: how the millennial interest in technology, wellness, the climate and interior design might converge to transform the houseplant into a valuable commodity. Last year, Blackett sold 120,000 plants, more than 320 a day, and created a video series that helps customers care for their recent purchases. In my experience, the videos have gone viral in a kind of traditional sense. They pop up in my Instagram feed like troublesome weeds.In the millennial mode, the Patch website is easy to use but idiosyncratic enough to be inviting and the brand’s packaging is elegant and simple. The same is true of the Sill. Sometimes the delivery is as much a draw as the product itself. In an unboxing video posted online, one YouTuber described a package as “kinda big” but “really cool”. “We’re in a new era of e-commerce,” the YouTuber says, with excitement, “where everyone is questioning what can and can’t we ship through the mail. The Sill is proving that you can ship a beautiful houseplant to you safe and sound!” A message on the delivery reads: “Plants Make People Happy.”Both the Sill and Patch focus a large part of their marketing on a curious fiction: that plants are somehow active care-givers, able to alleviate all sorts of modern ills: anxiety, loneliness, indoor air pollution, the problem of great social-media content. An article posted on the Sill’s website titled, “Why You Need Plants in Your Life” includes a list of benefits that the brand says are backed by scientific studies. In an age of mental fatigue, houseplants “boost mood, productivity, concentration and creativity”. In an era of climate disaster, they “clean indoor air by absorbing toxins”. As work continues to define us, they “reduce stress”, and can prevent “sore throats and colds”. Plants “are therapeutic,” one line reads, “and cheaper than a therapist”.This language is savvy enough to acknowledge the fact that millennials, craving comfort, have been widely reported to be relying on houseplants to fill a vacuum. We are struggling to connect with each other. We are struggling to connect with our planet, which is not-so-gradually falling to pieces. We are invited to think: might a houseplant help?Blackett, in a clever early move, decided to baptise Patch products with human names – Chaz, the Swiss cheese plant (from £14) Fidel, the fiddle-leaf fig (from £12) – so as to rely less on Latin terms, which he worried might become a stumbling block for consumers, but also, you’d have thought, to suggest a more personal connection between houseplant and owner. Somehow, not long ago, the phrase “plant parenthood”, often prefixed with a hashtag, entered the lexicon as a legitimate term. It is no longer unusual to nourish and attend to a parlour palm as if it were offspring. “My fussy calatheas are starting to get brown tips because they lack humidity,” one Twitter user wrote recently. “I mean, seriously girls? It’s been hella humid!”Can a houseplant fill so big a void? The answer, really, is hardly. A peace lily will never replace a partner, nor a child, nor even a pet (though sometimes you wonder). As far as I’m aware, no proud plant parent has launched an Instagram account dedicated to his cute monstera, in the way pet lovers frequently do for their animal dependents. And it’s doubtful whether a houseplant can affect the air to the degree necessary to create human benefit, though the marketeers will try to sell you on it. Both Patch and the Sill include links to lists of “air-purifying plants” – “Grow your own fresh air” – though neither seems to agree on which plants are most purifying. “In theory, the claims are true,” Curtis Gubb, a PhD student in environmental health at the University of Birmingham, who is investigating how effective housplants are at removing harmful indoor pollutants, told me. Plants have been found to remove all kinds of pollutants, he said, “but just because a plant removes something doesn’t mean it’s affecting the room. You’d need 100 plants in a small room,” to have a significant effect. He added that, really, houseplants are “very unlikely to clean the air.” The science, he says, is well behind the claims.Most of us can agree that plants are good, fundamental to our existence somehow, though often the benefits are subjective. In a recently published essay, the late neurologist Oliver Sacks praised the “healing power of gardens”. “As a physician, I take my patients to gardens whenever possible,” he wrote. “In 40 years of medical practice, I have found only two types of non-pharmaceutical ‘therapy’ to be vitally important for patients with chronic neurological diseases: music and gardens.” A line on the Sill reads: “Even brief exposure to nature has been shown to make us more altruistic and co-operative,” and later, presumably to hammer home the point: “It’s true when we say plants make people happy.”A few months ago, I ordered a peace lily from Patch. It arrived wrapped in plastic and planted in a distressed ceramic pot I’d bought as an add-on. I placed it immediately in my bathroom, because I’d read somewhere, rightly or wrongly, that it would thrive in all that after-shower humidity. When a couple of weeks later I went on holiday with my family, strict care instructions were given to my neighbour. To my surprise, the plant was the first thing I checked when we arrived home. Was it still alive? Had it missed me? Yes, it was thriving – my neighbour had done an excellent job of not killing it. And, no, of course it hadn’t missed me. I am not too proud to admit I felt a little disgruntled. I might need the plant, I thought, but the plant does not need me."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc5543a6aba7696e0d4258ac2de974898f0b925b/833_0_3220_1932/master/3220.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63b91f7caa999c0709a8b6a55ea6126d","title":"living with hormones understanding period cycles","story":"For decades, being ‘hormonal’ has been used to diminish women. But why? Eleanor Morgan argues that monthly cycles are just another part of learning to be ourselvesOn the rush-hour train one evening last summer, I looked around at all the women in the carriage. Middle-aged women hurtling towards the suburbs. Pregnant women holding their lower backs. Teenage girls slick with sebum. Elderly women standing stoically by the doors. I realised every one of them will have some story about how their reproductive systems have affected their lives. And I thought: how much have you kept secret?Because one day in our early lives as women, everything changes. We start bleeding. And in an instant we’re no longer a child. I was on a crazy golf course overlooking Cromer pier when I experienced period pain for the first time. My lower body rippled with a new sensation. It was a pain that didn’t fit inside my body, burning through my thighs. I explained to Dad that I didn’t feel well. I was aware of the shift in his gaze towards me in a way that I absolutely did not have the language for. That British coastal perfume, thick with sun-roasted kelp and old deep-fat-fryer oil, took the nausea that came with these sharp churns to another level. I had to sit down on the grass. The pain spoke to me. It told me my human fabric had changed. As evidence of the encoding that happened, now when I hear seagulls, I still have flash visions of lying down holding my belly.I have spent years trying to gain autonomy over the way my hormones seem to make my mind and body behave. Around five years ago, prompted by a breakdown-of-sorts, I sought help for the anxiety I had done my very best to conceal from everyone, including myself, for well over a decade. After talking to my GP, I tried all sorts of interventions in my quest for emotional stability. I was referred to (almost exclusively male) gynaecologists whose conversations and hormonal prescriptions made me feel either a) madder or b) ever so slightly less mad for a short amount of time. I tried acupuncture, vitamin supplements and diet changes. I realised this precise, reliable emotional state I sought was elusive at best. Instead, I was surprised by a growing sense of peace. Addressing the patterns of my mood with a therapist, we looked closely at the shame I attached to being sensitive, sad or scared in the second half of my cycle and asked where it came from. After researching anxiety, I started training to become a psychologist and began researching hormones. I started to see things in a way I never thought I would. I had a new question, and that was: what am I seeking relief from?I’ve come to believe that greater awareness of our hormonal processes can help us not only to manage our corresponding moods, but also to conceptualise what a mood actually is: a state of being that is, by its nature, temporary, and rarely directly attributable to one thing. It’s an interesting dichotomy, that we can be quite disconnected from what’s actually going on when our hormones are fluctuating – when oestrogen dramatically rises, for example, during ovulation – and yet be so ready to self-police when we feel anything other than sanguine and pain-free.We blame so much on being “hormonal”: irrationality, “bad” decision-making, angry outbursts, low self-esteem. That wasn’t the real me, we might think, agonising over a knee-jerk decision we made at work, or taking offence at a throwaway comment in the pub. It was my hormones. The same phrase could cover everything from wanting to kill your partner at the dinner table to having frantic sex with them on it.In some ways, “hormonal” is the modern-day “hysterical” – a word most women will have their own associations with. Mine are profuse. Years and years of secretly believing that I am just on the cusp of losing control: of my emotions, my appetite, my sexuality. Sometimes, I think I’m a hair-trigger away from exploding. Because I’ve quietly believed I’m… well, too much. Almost every woman I have known well has spoken of this belief one they mostly keep tucked up, because admitting the fear means facing the idea that maybe we don’t have inherent autonomy that our woman-ness will always “get” us in the end. What if there was a different way of looking at things? What if we could work towards dismantling the self-blame and, therefore, stop othering this fundamental part of who we are?Acknowledging that the stigma surrounding female reproductive processes is still alive and well is the first rung, I think, on the ladder towards self-acceptance. Most women know the crack of relief when someone dares to start talking about periods, the reality of birth, miscarriage or menopause, and other women say, oh thank God. This stigma is like an iceberg. The tip above the surface is women’s day-to-day suffering with whatever process they’re going through a suffering they feel unable to fully express, perhaps through fear of embarrassment, of disgusting others or that they’ll be dismissed. Underneath the surface is the way women’s health and pain has been, still is, viewed and treated in society.It is sweet fantasy to say that all the myths, misinformation and ickiness surrounding female reproductive processes have been – finally – banished into the fusty past. It’s silly, really, because the word “hormonal” applies as much to a testosterone-charged City banker as it does to a woman about to have her period. The metabolic processes of all organisms can only take place in very specific chemical environments and, in the human body, hormones are special chemical messengers that, as part of the endocrine system, help to control most major bodily functions. Male, female, or anywhere on the spectrum of gender, hormones keep us alive. Yet “hormonal” is still a tool for explaining away a woman’s experience of her changing biochemistry. And so we try and keep schtum, lest we be slapped with such a historically damaging label: hysterical.When I effectively ran out of PMS treatment options, it made me realise how entrenched my analysis of my own thoughts and behaviour was in more general ideas of how I “should” or “shouldn’t” be as a woman. In therapy and in my psychological study, I realised how the workings of my inner world are often in collision with the outer world and all the expectations I perceive it to have of me. A better understanding of what goes on inside us, of the connection between our bodies and minds, is an important part of reclaiming meaning. We are not post-biology. We are protecting no one by pretending that we don’t bleed. We are not protecting ourselves by ignoring the external factors that may affect our bodily experiences, including the way modern medicine still doesn’t take the variance of women’s pain – or the voice describing that pain – seriously.Women can wait between four and 10 years after first seeing a doctor with symptoms of endometriosis and a diagnosis. The average is seven-and-a-half years. In 2017, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence released guidelines urging GPs not to overlook symptoms of the disorder, because for it to be repeatedly inferred that you are overreacting to your pain, your experience of that pain is going to become stained with confusion, fear and guilt. It is difficult to argue that medicine does not have an inherent bias against women. Women presenting at hospitals with pain are not only given fewer painkillers than men, but are often offered sedatives instead. Treatment for women with coronary heart disease is delayed compared to men. All these facts are corroborated by robust data. When a woman says how she feels, what she wants or what she needs, someone always knows better.Knowing ourselves better gives us the power to ask for better. For example, I used to panic sometimes at the pain I can have with ovulation. I knew I always felt it, but didn’t know why. Learning that mittelschmerz (the German words for “middle” and “pain”) is thought to be caused by one of our eggs rupturing through a sac (follicle) on an ovary, releasing fluid and a small amount of blood that can travel through the ovary wall and irritate nerves in the lining of the abdominal cavity, was a strange comfort. So, too, was learning from a prominent gynaecologist that he has seen women presenting in A\u0026ampE in tears with acute pelvic pain, whose only clinically significant finding turns out to be recent ovulation. This shit is real and it hurts. What’s sad is that my private experience alone didn’t feel like good enough evidence to finally ask for pain relief.On some level, a focus on a woman’s changing biochemistry throughout her cycle – or any other reproductive process – might be seen to remove some of the stigma. It’s just my hormones. That there could be a clear, chemical “reason” for a certain type of behaviour or way of feeling is, on the surface, legitimising and reassuring. Although, if any woman is able to ride out days of feeling low each month by being aware of her cycle patterns or finds that telling herself that the way she’s feeling is “just chemical” is a strategy that stops her going up into that second gear of self-analysis and existential woe, I absolutely lift my hat to her. Personally, given what I now know about the imprecision of the science of how our hormones can affect our mood, I try to resist thinking that I am a chemically controlled robot. I try to see my distress as part of a mini-ecosystem that includes my changing hormones, asking myself: what else is going on to upset my mind? How physically well am I right now? What helps?Research tells us that our hormonal fluctuations do seem to affect how chemical signals pass through our brain – as any neuroscientist would tell you, we just don’t know exactly how or why. In all fields of brain study it is accepted that mental distress is not caused by one thing in isolation. The electrical, chemical brain is not extricable from the subjective mind. What we talk about is multi-causality: a fancy word for the concept that lots of different factors contribute to how we feel mentally. Therefore, when we talk about processes happening in a woman’s body that place us at “increased risk” of depression or anxiety, it seems not just blindingly logical, but respectful to consider that body in the wider scheme of things.Perhaps, then, a more realistic phrase than, “It’s just my hormones,” would be, “My hormones might predispose me to feeling terrible sometimes.” Our fluctuating biology is not the whole story but a significant part of our emotional lives. The hormonal changes and symptoms of menopause are very real and can be very hard. When my hormone levels change, notably at ovulation (soaring oestrogen) and in the week before I get my period (soaring progestogen, high oestrogen), it really can feel like I’ve stepped inside the skin of a different person – that I am not myself. But what is “myself” if not a sensitive-by-design brain and body that is always changing and responding to the world it inhabits and the people around it? From what fixed, ideal state do I feel I am slipping when I am more emotional for the second half of the month?As human beings, rhythm is part of our deep core. Breathing, pumping, contracting: these are all actions of the body that keep us alive and keep our species going. Menstruation is another rhythm unique to women. But while our biology and what is happening inside us is important, we cannot act as if the body is an anatomical drawing floating in space that it is nowhere. Clearly, if a woman’s premenstrual distress is such that she feels unable to function, she should, in an ideal world, be receiving dedicated healthcare and support. Is there something wider we should be asking about how, as a society, we frame what women say and do when they are anything other than sanguine, nurturing and polite?Are we saving up anger, our base need for affection, and our tears for three weeks of the month? As our hormonal levels shift, could they be acting as a kind of “truth serum”, lubricating the passage of what we really want to say or do? It’s a radical idea and I quite like it. What if what we feel during those times of the month when we are so quick to say we are being irrational is the most “real” we are? The science surrounding whatever signalling changes happen in the emotion-processing parts of our brain during the menstrual cycle is too fuzzy to definitively say otherwise. Could it be that, when the mantle of self-censorship drops and we are less caught up with fearing how we’ll be seen, we’re accessing all that historical oppression and, in short bursts, letting it go? All that so-called “excess”, the stuff that makes a woman “hysterical” could just be… truth.Hormonal by Eleanor Morgan is published by Virago, £13.99.

We meet the man whose orange brick has people queuing round the blockOn an early summer’s evening on the outskirts of Basel – a city almost certainly in Switzerland, but sometimes in France and occasionally Germany – hundreds of well-heeled men and women stand in line, giddily, champagne flutes in hand, waiting to buy a £140 brick. It is, naturally, no ordinary brick. It’s flag-down-a-passing-aircraft orange, and prominently branded in an edition of just 999. But, crucially, the brick – or “ceramic block” as its parents have christened it – has been designed by Virgil Abloh, a 38-year-old from Chicago, in conjunction with the timeless Swiss furniture company Vitra. Right now, Abloh is an alchemist: anything he touches in the worlds of fashion and design turns to gold (or often orange). The people jostling in this queue know that they could buy a brick and own a cherished piece of design history – or walk out and resell it immediately for at least double what they paid.And yet, it really does look like a brick. Abloh, whose day job is artistic director of menswear at Louis Vuitton, makes no wild claims for its utility. “It is sort of reminiscent of a cinder block, which is obviously a building unit to build structures such as we’re in,” he says, at the launch at Vitra’s headquarters. “But we decided to make that a ceramic household accessory. It gets adapted to your living space as an object itself, or it can be a paperweight, or it can hold objects within it.”For others, though – and it’s an army that is beginning to drown out the doubters – Abloh is nothing less than a new Marcel Duchamp, the Andy Warhol for our times. His work is reliably playful, ironic and totally unreverential: one of his signatures is to add a lurid zip-tie to Nike sneakers. In March, Justin Bieber was stopped by police, who thought he still had a store security tag on his Air Max 90s. “Virgil, my God, bro,” Bieber posted on Instagram. “You freaking – you’re killing me, man!” Other trademarks are horizontal stripes, quotation marks, brash capital letters in Helvetica type. You’ll see them everywhere now: Kendall Jenner, Drake, Beyoncé, Serena Williams.Abloh is also a pioneer, a relentless polymath. In March 2018, he became Louis Vuitton’s first African-American artistic director, and a rare black designer in the fashion establishment. His streetwear label Off-White, founded in 2012, is neck and neck with Gucci as the “hottest” brand in the world, according to the influential Lyst Index. He’s lectured at Harvard and the Architectural Association in London, and had a series of exhibitions at the Gagosian galleries with cult artist Takashi Murakami. The New Yorker recently called Abloh “menswear’s biggest star” last year, Time named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world.What Abloh taps into is a generation – millennials, essentially – who, until recently, have been ignored as serious consumers. His reach is shown most conspicuously by his Instagram followers, of whom there are 4.1m. This makes him tremendously desirable for established companies looking for a jab of Botox. Ikea has commissioned him to design a range of products, available from November. When, in May, the homewares giant “dropped” a rug from the collection – a grey and black wool-nylon blend with “KEEP OFF” across the middle – it sold out in a finger-click.It’s a version of this frenzy that I’m witnessing at Vitra. The company – the European manufacturer of the designs of Charles and Ray Eames, Verner Panton and Jean Prouvé – has worked with Abloh on three new designs: the ceramic block and two “hacks” of classic Prouvé designs, the Antony chair and the Petit Potence wall lamp. There’s a commercial aspect to the collaboration but, for Abloh, that’s not the most exciting part. He sees the Virgil Abloh co Vitra project as an opportunity to reach and inspire a young person – in his head, aged 14 to 17 – who has never heard of Prouvé and probably has no interest in design.So it’s a brick, sure, but maybe for the neophyte it’s also a way into an intimidating, expensive world. “Design is often something the general public doesn’t notice until it’s broke,” says Abloh. “You don’t notice a door handle until it doesn’t work. You don’t think about the history related to architecture, cars or phones – you just use them. Whereas I think we would all benefit from having a knowledge of design. At least that’s the premise that I operate under.”Abloh is a big man with a gentle manner. He doesn’t often crack a smile this afternoon, but you can tell when he’s into an idea by the fact that his speech cadence, usually languid, quickens. He has offices in Paris, Milan and London, homes in Paris and Chicago, but no desk anywhere. His design work is mainly done on two phones that sit between us as we speak. I’d love to say that our conversation is so compelling that they remain untouched, but that isn’t the case. A sound engineer records our exchange for Abloh’s “archive”.Abloh is not, by most accepted definitions, actually a millennial himself: most have that category starting with a 1982 birthdate. Certainly his academic career followed a more traditional Generation X path. His parents wanted him to learn a trade, so he studied first civil engineering and then trained as an architect. His heroes were an eclectic crew: Kanye West, Rem Koolhaas, Pharrell Williams and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe.The story goes that he engineered a meeting with West by finding out where the rapper screen-printed his merchandise in Chicago. Now, he says that they probably would have run into each other anyway. “We’re from the same city, so it’s a small circle.” Either way, they clicked and, for a decade from the mid-2000s, they worked on projects together (Abloh is sometimes called West’s creative director). When, in 2009, West decided to slum it as an intern at the fashion house Fendi in Rome for six months – with a salary of £400 a month – Abloh tagged along.Abloh is sometimes described as a dilettante, but he points out that nothing he’s achieved has been easy. “My career had been 15 years long and there’s only been people paying attention for the last three,” he says. “I’ve been doing this exact amount of work and type of work for a long time. It’s the life of a designer and artist that not everything works, but when everyone’s watching hopefully it’s working.”In 2019, everyone’s watching, everything’s working. On the day we meet, Abloh has flown into Switzerland from Chicago, where the Museum of Contemporary Art is staging a career-ning retrospective: he is, to confirm, 38 years old. His latest collections for Off-White and Louis Vuitton were presented at Paris Fashion Week this month (his LV jamboree, which featured floral harnesses, Arsenal’s Héctor Bellerín and a red bouncy castle, was “the standout show” of the week, said W Magazine). He’s had to finish off this project with Vitra and go back and forth with Ikea. Most of us, it’s safe to say, wouldn’t last five minutes as Virgil Abloh.The reason for this punishing pace is that he loves what he does and perhaps knows that this is his time. “I feel like now is a tremendous time in culture,” he says, at the Vitra launch. “I feel like it’s the Renaissance. I feel like Bernini just sculpting away, defining a moment of enlightenment. I’m just an eager kid who looks at every day as a possibility to make something and leave a good impact.”Abloh’s private life is mainly that – private – but we know he is married to Shannon Sundberg, whom he met in high school, and they have two young children, Lowe and Grey. It’s been estimated that he’s on the road 320 days a year – “a myth,” he counters – but he doesn’t deny he has to be obsessive about his work. “Any person you can cite: Steve Jobs, Karl Lagerfeld, Michael Jordan – they are not common names because they did it nine-to-five,” he says. “There are people on Earth that dedicate themselves to their practice or whatever. I’ve always been like that.”In his staff, Abloh looks for and expects a similar work ethic. At Vitra, he notes that he makes most of his hires straight from social media. “If you have an awesome Instagram, I’ll follow you, DM you and say, ‘Hey, do you want a job?’ And if you are self-motivated, you’re going to get promoted in two seconds because that’s ultimately the shot I wanted when I was a kid.”Working at this speed also means that Abloh doesn’t spend a lot of time thinking about how people (especially trolls) are responding to what he’s doing. He’s adamant that his gaze is set 30 years down the line, not at the comments on an Instagram post. As he puts it: “I’m not waiting for someone else to tell me what grade I get on it.”And how does he feel about his work reselling for inflated multiples of their original price? Another shrug. “Like on my list of things to worry about… I can’t control it,” Abloh replies. “I’m just the creator of the idea, the company is more in control.”On the evidence of his Vitra project – whether Abloh is interested or not – he appears to have another hit. The range sold out in days, and it does seem to have initiated a conversation about design among a new crowd. At the end of a public talk he gave at the Vitra Campus, the stage was mobbed by teens and 20-somethings, many of whom were standing in their socks, thrusting up sneakers for Abloh to sign. “He’s a rock star!” says a design writer that I’m sitting next to. It’s definitely hard to think of another contemporary designer who would inspire such a response – even harder to name one who would later play a 90-minute DJ set, until 12.30am, at the Vitra summer party (unexpected highlight: Journey’s Don’t Stop Believin’.)Of course, Abloh’s designs will likely never be for everyone – perhaps inevitably for someone who confronts, and affronts, the status quo so directly. At Basel airport the next day, I try to put one of his cinder blocks through the X-ray machine. The security officer looks bemused and pulls me aside for clarification. “Français, Deutsch, English?” he asks. “What is this?” I explain to him that it’s a ceramic design object. He takes a knife, slices the tape on the cardboard packaging. I’m travelling with a PR and he opens Abloh’s Instagram page, showing the brick in situ. The image already has 40,000 likes. The security man’s expression is unchanged: he picks up the brick, spins it around in his hand, puts it back and waves me through without comment.There will be another drop of Virgil Abloh co Vitra this autumn.

So, before you head off to warmer climes, check out this simple guide to holiday insurance to make sure you’re fully covered …Travel is said to broaden the mind, but for peace of mind it makes sense to secure the right travel insurance before you head off.According to Compare the Market, almost one in four people fail to take out travel insurance, leaving themselves at risk of returning home with a hefty bill should the worst happen – according to the Association of British Insurers, the average cancellation claim is £816, while the average medical claim is £1,300. Ouch!That’s not to say that the world of holiday insurance is easy breezy. With so many different policies on the market, narrowing down the right one for you can feel like an overwhelming chore.But fear not, travel fans – we’ve simplified the world of travel insurance to help you secure the right policy for your trip in a jiffy …Is travel insurance really necessary?Look, no one’s going to stop you from travelling without insurance, but it really wouldn’t be advised. We all head off in the hope that our trip will be all sunshine and poolside margaritas (well, some of us do!), but sadly not every trip is quite so blissful.Medical claims are one of the highest costs facing insurance companies. The NHS might treat us for free, but medical care in other parts of the world can come with a sizeable price tag, and some hospitals overseas may not even treat you unless they know you can pay for the care.So whether you fall ill, have a valuable item stolen or have to cut short or extend your trip due to an emergency, forking out for travel insurance could save you big bucks in the long-term.One size does not fit allTravel insurance is like a good suit – it’s got to be tailor-made. There are almost endless variables to consider from whether you want single trip or annual cover, to the number of people you want to include on the policy, and the activities and eventualities you want to insure against.Yes, finding the right travel insurance can be a tricky business. If you’re not sure where to start, Compare the Market is a good port of call. Not only can it provide you with an impartial and independent comparison of policies from a range of UK providers – based on your specific needs – in just a few clicks, but the travel insurance section of its website also has FAQs and helpful pointers (including sections specifically dedicated to different types of trip, such as golf holidays, backpacking and family trips) to help you narrow down your options.Read the small printAs with all insurance policies, when purchasing travel insurance, it’s really important that you READ THE SMALL PRINT! Check you’re happy with the excess (ie the amount you’ll have to pay towards any claim you make), ensure you’re definitely covered for all the activities you’re planning on doing, and double check you’re satisfied with the circumstances under which you’ll be able to make a claim.There is one more vital detail to check with travel insurance – how the country you’re visiting is classified geographically. Yes, you might think a country’s location is set in stone, but that’s not quite the case when it comes to travel insurance. Insurance providers group some countries differently for instance, while some classify Egypt and Turkey as Europe, others class them as “worldwide” destinations.Don’t leave your travel insurance to the last minuteIf you’re one of those people who gets their travel money at the airport, this point is probably for you! Smart shoppers bag their travel insurance as soon as they’ve booked their trip. Why? Because if your holiday is cancelled or delayed you should, depending on the terms of your precise policy, be able to claim for it – which ought to take some of the sting out of the situation.Head over to comparethemarket and get a travel insurance quote for your next trip.

How famous London pubs are adapting to a changing worldMilky tea, fish and chips, the local pub: these were once the enticing mainstays of British life. They’re all still there, of course, but outside the home we drink far more coffee than tea, and on the high street the curry house and chicken takeaway long ago supplanted the deep-fried attractions of the fish and chip shop. Of the traditional triumvirate only the public house remains in a primary position, but that too is under threat.Is this a loss to the British way of life? Has some vital part of the social fabric been neglected and left to slowly fall apart? Listen to the doomsayers, like the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra), and that’s certainly the impression. Last year it described the situation as “dismal”. Almost on cue, Soho’s celebrated Coach \u0026amp Horses closed its doors last week after its freeholder, Fuller’s Brewery, took back possession from the leaseholder, Alastair Choat. The pub has been a Soho institution for many decades, with the previous landlord, Norman Balon, famed for his rudeness and, paradoxically, the permissive atmosphere he fostered.It was the scene of Private Eye lunches and the base, as it were, of the notoriously unsober Spectator columnist Jeffrey Bernard. Choat tried to maintain its idiosyncratic spirit, by turning it into what he called London’s first vegetarian and vegan pub and getting a licence to serve naked guests.He made a desperate campaign to keep hold of the pub, even staging a shortened version of the play Jeffrey Bernard is Unwell with Cold Feet’s Robert Bathurst in the lead role, and organising a 12,000-signature petition to halt Fuller’s. But all to no avail. Fuller’s moved back with a promise to restore the pub to its “former glory”.Given that its former glory was all about its inimitable ambience, it is not clear how that restoration is going to be achieved. What is significant, though, is that Fuller’s is appealing to a vanished heyday as the vision of its future. But heydays are accidental or inspired and certainly can’t be recaptured through corporate planning.In truth the Soho that the Coach and Horses epitomised – bohemian, transgressive, hopelessly drunk – no longer exists, and any attempt to return to the “features that have made it such a famous pub”, as Fuller’s pledges to do, are doomed to be an exercise in museum curation. What we most love about the past is that is no longer here.Yearning for the idealised pub of yore is not, however, a new pastime. It’s probably almost as old as pubs themselves. Indeed, reminiscing about how a given pub used to be is a staple of pub conversation. The nostalgic lament is, after all, practically a symptom of inebriation.Seventy-three years ago George Orwell wrote his famous essay about his favourite public house, the Moon Under Water. He listed 10 qualities possessed by this pub, only to reveal at the end that no such pub existed. It was an ideal he’d wished into being.Of the pubs that have closed, the majority have been small, and therefore perhaps the kind that struggled to attract women. At the same time, micropubs that, with a nod to Orwell, prioritise authenticity, good beer, and abjure games and machines, have flourished in recent years. Turnover across the pub business has actually remained the same, which suggests that things are not as bad as the closures suggest. Other elements of Orwell’s checklist – that the pub be tobacco-smoke stained and that motherly barmaids should address customers as “dear” (“pubs where the barmaids call you ‘ducky’ always have a disagreeable raffish atmosphere”) – have not aged so well.For pubs are seldom just pubs. They are not just somewhere you buy alcoholic drinks. They reflect the tastes, interests and prejudices of their owners and customers. You don’t like that place with nonstop Sky Sports, St George’s flags and a carpet that makes you want to throw up the bland lager you’ve had little choice but to drink? Well, perhaps not everyone’s a great fan of that precious polished wood, real ale and toasted-ciabatta haven that you like to frequent.Viewed from abroad, of course, these differences dissolve into a wholesome image. It’s notable that the only British selection in TripAdvisor’s annual Travellers’ Choice awards list of the top 25 travel experiences was, at number 18, Liquid History Tours’ guided tour of historic London pubs. Not Shakespeare or the royal palaces or the Lake District, but a pub crawl. In the words of the late Derek Jameson, do they mean us?Last Thursday evening in Southwark, I joined John Warland, who set up Liquid History Tours eight years ago, and a Californian couple, John Rae and his wife Colleen, who had arranged their own private pub tour. Rae has already twice been on the main tour that made the Travellers’ Choice awards list, which he describes as the best he has ever experienced.“I like learning about history while getting a little bit drunk,” he explains, not unreasonably. We started at the George, off Borough High Street, the last surviving galleried coaching inn. It dates to at least 1543, and quite possibly back to Chaucer’s days – The Canterbury Tales (written in the late 14th century) begins at a similar nearby inn, the Tabard, which has not survived.As Warland reminded us, Dickens mentions the George in Little Dorrit, and was a frequent visitor to the pub himself. But then he was a frequent visitor to many pubs around London and Kent. Any serious study of the subject will sooner or later come back to literature, which has enjoyed a long and fruitfully symbiotic relationship with pubs.If you want to know about the London demi-monde in the 1930s and 1940s, for instance, then there is no more vividly informative place to turn than the novels of Patrick Hamilton. His prose hits you with the smell of beer and cigarettes as if you’d opened a saloon bar door from that the period. Hamilton, it should be noted, died of cirrhosis of the liver.Warland is a font of major and minor cultural knowledge, as he leads us through Borough Market, with two brief pale ale pit-stops, and past the Globe theatre, with full Shakespeare digression, over the Millennium bridge, where he points out the artist Ben Wilson’s micro-works on flattened chewing gum, to two pubs, the Cockpit and the art nouveau wonder the Black Friar, that, coincidentally, were past watering holes for the Observer’s ever-thirsty staff.The ever-welcoming Cockpit abuts a building on St Andrew’s Hill that used to be one of of the Observer’s many previous homes. As Peter Corrigan, a former sports editor of this newspaper, once put it: “If you had taken away the Cockpit, the Observer would have collapsed in more ways than one.”We move on to Fleet Street, where the word and the wine once lived in productive if unruly unison. Nowadays newspapers, following Rupert Murdoch’s lead, have long since departed the area, journalism runs on sparkling water, and newspaper offices are about as wild and hectic as those of your average accountancy firm.At the Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese, dating from 1538, I leave the tour, and in a parting comment Warland observes that, in his experience, good pubs tend to survive. No doubt he’s right, although it does raise the question again of what makes a good pub.Seeking more objective criteria, I went in search of Britain’s oldest pub. It turns out that this is a fool’s errand, so rich in complexity that it could turn you to drink. Oldest can refer to the actual building, the site, or the longest continuing licence, and each of those categories is fiercely disputed, with competing claims coming from as far a field as the Clachan near Loch Lomond, the Adam and Eve in Norwich, Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem in Nottingham and the Skirrid Inn in Abergavenny.According to Guinness World Records, the oldest pub in the UK is Ye Olde Fighting Cocks in St Albans. It was apparently first established in 793AD (although its licence only goes back to the 17th century). What’s the secret of its success? Location, location, location.It sits a short walk from St Albans cathedral, handy for pilgrims and tourists alike. At its lovely oak bar I find Tony Breeze, nursing a non-alcoholic lager. Now retired, he comes here most lunchtimes from Hemel Hempstead because he enjoys the “friendly atmosphere”.It is certainly cosy, with the wooden-beamed ceiling just a couple of inches above my head and a sturdy carpet beneath my feet, all within a hexagonal-shaped building that has several discrete bars.Breeze used to run a pub in the 1970s, which he describes as “a bit stressful”. It used to serve food – far from standard in those days. He recommends the lunch at the Ye Olde Fighting Cocks, and says there are completely different gastronomic demands these days compared with when he was a landlord. “Now people have travelled some distance,” he says, “and they expect the food to be very good.”Yes, we have come a long way from the terror of the steak and kidney pie. Across the bar Lawrence and Grace Mungai are enjoying a refreshing pint with a visiting friend from Kenya. The Mungais are big fans of the pub.“I love the way it has conserved its heritage, the way it’s kept its original structure,” says Grace. ”You walk in here and the history comes back.”The couple live in Dunstable, where they frequent a friendly local. “When we lived in London,” says her husband, “some pubs we could not go in. We knew we were not welcome. They wouldn’t tell you to leave, they just wouldn’t serve you.”But he says one of his favourite experiences of recent years was meeting his cousin in a pub in Elephant and Castle that was full of people from all over the world. “There were all these different cultures, all getting along. It was such a beautiful evening.”In the end, that’s what all of us long for in a pub: somewhere to go in which we can have a relaxing drink in a convivial atmosphere and perhaps meet others with a similar aim. When it’s done well then it can feel like you’re in the only place you want to be in the world at that moment. And the very best pubs are timeless places in which that moment seems like it could last forever.No pub visit is complete without a visit to the toilet – a neglected but essential part of any pub. On the door of the gents is a sign, “By the gracious ordinance of the Honourable lords of the royal courts of justice” states in large lettering “No cock fighting”.Despite all the commercial pressures and competing attractions, the changing population and social habits, it’s a sign that the British pub, like its humour, is in rude health.Largely, and surprisingly, tourist-free, the pub is the local of Ian Rankin’s fictional detective Inspector Rebus. The Ox retains the authenticity of an old-school hostelry. Dating back to 1730, the former brothel appears in George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four where it was the model for the “Proles” pub, the down-at-heel drinking den of the mistreated underclasses in his dystopian work. Famous for its appearance in James Joyce’s 1922 novel Ulysses. The pub is an essential stop for fans of the book whose main character drops into the pub for a lunchtime gorgonzola cheese sandwich and a glass of burgundy while wandering through Dublin.Originally The Bunch of Grapes, a pub has stood on pebbled Limehouse beach in east London for nearly 500 years. Charles Dickens described the pub in the opening chapter of Our Mutual Friend after first visiting it as a child in 1820. Actor Sir Ian McKellen is one of the current co-owners.Built as a coaching inn in 1750 and atmospherically sited on Cornwall’s Bodmin Moor it’s the setting for Daphne du Maurier’s 1936 novel. It is believed the inn takes its name from the smugglers bringing rum from Jamaica.This atmospheric inn in Hampstead, north London, first opened in 1545. Dick Turpin is thought to have been a regular – the pub lies on the route plundered by the highwayman. The inn has some significant literary connections, appearing in Dickens’sThe Pickwick Papers and then, above all else, Bram Stoker’s Dracula."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f6d3cfd112e473a16ef4c34507882beada96497/0_150_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d51fb42e14d30e204994c8afa3c4c39","title":"flags at glastonbury ranked","story":"Love them or hate them, flags in a bewildering variety are an inescapable part of the Glastonbury experience. We scanned the best and worst on show“Shurrup Yew Ye Tick was a meme!” says Tom from Dublin. “Tick is Irish slang for someone saying you’re silly or something. It’s like: ‘Shut up you tick.’”“It’s nobody’s dog, it’s just a meme!” his friend Andy, also from Dublin, says. We’ve all learned something about Irish internet culture circa 2015, but the dog is frankly terrifying.“We play in a softball league and our team is called Base Invaders – it’s a pun!” says Steven from London. Great pun, but possibly the most extraordinary thing about Steven’s flag is that there are at least five softball players at Glastonbury. Apparently it’s “huge”. “Why have I got Dave Grohl on a stick? Because he was headlining two years ago and I’m too lazy to change it,” says Ryan from south Wales. Can Ryan’s friends find him with a flag so small that it’s the size of a human head? “I’m 6ft 2in, so that’s quite high up when my arm’s stretched.”Sharon Dainton from Melbourne in Derbyshire has been coming to Glastonbury since 1986. “In the old days, I used to carry a pig on a stick flag so my mates could find me. Then one year, there were 15 pigs on sticks so I had to rethink. Now “piiig” is a catchphrase among my friends.Catherine Caddy and her mates have come from London to Glastonbury as traffic cones for no other reason than to have a laugh. “We’ve been stopping traffic,” she says, “and letting the tractors pass!” The flag, which features three cones with her face on, reads: “Sees tickets, buys tickets.” This is because she was extraordinarily lucky, managing to buy tickets for all 18 of her friends. So the flag is a homage to Catherine and her supernaturally fast internet connection. She wins for sheer tenacity and dedication to the cause."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59a1af466d3995061344eb5070e0f72588f16c06/0_93_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae292adbea9bf5ffbf00566a2e5f19df","title":"kylie at glastonbury 2019 review","story":"Pyramid stageBelatedly making her debut at the festival, the star managed a seemingly impossible combination of sincerity and camp, pop perfection and pure emotionThe “legends” slot at Glastonbury is always a font of audience goodwill. By mid-afternoon on Sunday, when morale is low, songs you know as intimately as your parents’ phone number, played by icons who are very often older than your parents, offer a particularly welcome kind of comfort. But with Kylie, it’s different. She was supposed to play Glastonbury in 2005, she reminds us, back when she was a regular icon, perhaps not yet a living legend. But then, she says, “circumstances” struck: she was diagnosed with breast cancer and had to watch from her bed in Australia, moved by the sight of some bands covering her songs in tribute.She cries as she tells this story, but doesn’t mention cancer explicitly – an omission that reflects how incongruous this dark moment was in her world. Kylie was about lightness, about transcending time’s limitations. Stock Aitken Waterman pop stars weren’t built to last, let alone evolve beautifully through decades’ worth of shifts in the fabric of pop and experience second, third, fourth heydays. That this was under threat in 2005 didn’t compute, to the degree that it felt like a national crisis in her adoptive home land.Thank god, she survived, and made it to Glastonbury 14 years after her initial appointment and to a hero’s welcome. One of the artists who covered her at the festival in 2005 was Coldplay, and she brings Chris Martin on to perform with her. Worryingly, he’s carrying an acoustic guitar, another thing that frankly has no place in Kylie’s gloriously ritzy world. They proceed to perform Can’t Get You Out of My Head – one of the 21st century’s most futuristic pop songs – in a stripped-back style. While tantamount to forsaking her official gay icon status, the goodwill and charm of the moment carries them through.Fortunately, the rest of the set is solid gold unadulterated Kylie: that peerless mix of total sincerity and fierce camp that she’s been serving up for more than 30 years. Dancers in pastel trousers waggle 7ft-tall letters spelling out her name during I Should Be So Lucky, then she brings out a man dressed as Klaus Nomi, the German-via-New York performance artist who died of aids in 1983, and they dance tenderly on Je Ne Sais Pas Pourquoi and Hand on Your Heart. It’s all as silly – she adds a Chic-style “Choo-choo, beep beep” breakdown to The Locomotion – as it is sexy. During Slow, revamped as a bassy, throbbing club track fit for the festival’s queer haven NYC Downlow, she interpolates the lascivious riff from Bowie’s fashion and grinds against the microphone in a manner that raises the already significant temperature. Nick Cave comes on for Where the Wild Roses Grow, and they share a similarly potent, intimate embrace.The showmanship, the incredible run of hits – it is absolutely phenomenal. So much so that the crowd keep bursting into chants of “Kylie! Kylie!” and bringing her to tears. Never mind the legends slot next stop, headliner."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ed3a4a2c10c0ee6ff8820bff6b92dfa223dae64/0_694_5824_3494/master/5824.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31111994f90037ac290e9ca99e1d833b","title":"nyc downlow glastonbury celebration 50 years lgbt culture","story":"Half a century after the Stonewall riots, this haven of after-hours partying pays homage to a golden age of gay creativityThis year, Glastonbury festival coincides with a momentous anniversary. It is 50 years since the Stonewall riots, when the boozers at a New York gay bar decided that they had been hassled one too many times. When the cops raided it, they fought back. That night sparked the modern LGBT rights movement – which some may say took a while to arrive at Glastonbury.It wasn’t until 2007 that gay culture found full-throated expression, in the shape of the NYC Downlow, a meticulous recreation of a sleazy 70s gay club, complete with drag queens, go-go dancers and even a darkroom round the back of the speakers, for those who would like an intimate moment soundtracked by pulverising house music served up by DJs including Midland and Eric Morillo. In the 12 years since, it has become the highlight of the Block9 area, a haven of after-hours partying.On Sunday night, the Downlow is due to mark the Stonewall anniversary with a show by the performer Jonny Woo, who promises 60s drag, a communal listen to Judy Garland’s Over the Rainbow (Garland’s death a few days earlier was said by some to have triggered the riot in 1969) and a moment in which he will say: “It’s 50 years we’ve come this far. Look at the rights that you have and the sacrifices that people made, the lives lost, the shit that people went through, and remember the work that still needs to be done.”There may also be a surprise performance by a pop star: Kylie Minogue and Miley Cyrus are rumoured both are due to play the Pyramid stage earlier in the day. “It’s about finding that moment in the madness where we come together for a minute, do a big show and then get off our tits,” says Woo.NYC Downlow is a space where queer culture is celebrated, says its co-creator Gideon Berger. “Our music, our culture, our identity – the Downlow is trying to create a space for that to be revered.” There’s another side-effect, too, he laughs: “Hot straight trade in the darkroom.”The retro ambience pays homage to a golden age of gay creativity, but it also serves as a reminder of more repressive times. “The Downlow aims to repoliticise gays,” Berger says. “It’s about saying: ‘Come on then – we’ve got a good thing going here, but look at our brothers and sisters being stoned to death or pushed off buildings in the rest of the world.”It is also a reminder that, as well as good times, nightspots have provided refuge and community to gay people going right back to Stonewall itself – safe spaces that are more necessary than ever, with backlashes against the gains of the LGBT movement never far away. “Nightclubs are political spaces,” says Woo. “You’ve got permission to express yourself, chill out and forget what society tells you are the acceptable ways of behaviour. If you come to Downlow, you can chuck that out of the window.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45fb69053b03152dc32b9bcc2b2f0d49bdf59fa9/1728_163_2622_1573/master/2622.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=603de9921ed5df818be7273307a64d2c","title":"tony bennett review albert hall london","story":"Royal Albert Hall, London Advancing years have altered the tone of the singer’s celebrated voice, but not its power, and song references to passing time prove intensely soul-stirringTony Bennett is 92 years old, and at an age when most of us will hope to have been retired for a quarter century, he’s playing two consecutive sold-out nights at the Albert Hall. He surely doesn’t do it for the money – the New York native won back the fortune he squandered in the 70s via a career renaissance that began almost 30 years ago, and never really abated. He remains a busy recording artist, following 2014’s Lady Gaga collaboration Cheek to Cheek and high-profile duets with Norah Jones, Aretha and Amy Winehouse with last year’s chart-topping revisit of the Great American Songbook in the company of contemporary jazz star Diana Krall, Love Is Here to Stay.Tonight, his Tony Bennett Quartet keep things spry, their swing never less than mellifluous, but with a restless bustle and combustive solos that prevent the hall ever feeling like the world’s roomiest elevator. They also back the opening singer, Donna Byrne, who’s at best a cruise-ship crooner, her voice a maudlin blancmange, wobbling in all the right places but never making the songs hers.By contrast, Bennett’s voice, once so smooth, has weathered over recent years, growing raspy, yellowing like old newspaper, and not always able to hit every note of his melodies. But while this mars a sprightly I’ve Got Rhythm, this aged quality, this vulnerability – Bennett’s very 92-ness – lend new poignancy to these songs. The setlist seems hand-picked for wry references to age – Bennett laughs gently after singing “As I approach the prime of my life,” in This Is All I Ask, and requesting: “Beautiful girls, walk a little slower when you walk by me.” But he’s not only poking fun at his advanced years there’s a sadness, too, the weight of the years passing, so his voice breaks as he sings “I will stay younger than spring”, with a yearning for this to be true.Weaved among his more upbeat standards, these darker, more impassioned moments are perhaps unexpectedly resonant Duke Ellington’s (In My) Solitude is brittle and moving, Bennett taunted “by memories that never die”, while James Ingram’s How Do You Keep the Music Playing? takes on a new meaning as he sings “How do you keep the song from fading?”, clearly reluctant to relinquish the stage that he loves. Deftly escorted there by his quartet, he reaches closing crescendos of torch song emotion that are almost operatic, and anything but easy listening.He closes with Fly Me to the Moon, and if the subtlety of his voice is gone, the power remains. And while pretenders-to-the-throne like Bublé might deliver such songs with a polish now beyond Bennett’s reach, they can’t sing them as if they’ve lived every word of them, every last disappointment and fleeting spark of love, the way Tony does tonight. That he can do it at all, at his age, is remarkable enough that his cheating of the final curtain is so moving and ultimately joyous tonight makes Bennett treasurable.

Most of Disintegration doesn’t.Back to the Cure for In Between Days, being taken at a brisk clip. And now there are flares alight in the crowd, and visible dancing a long way back. QPR rating: introduction of Bradley Allen as a late sub for Devon White.’s David Levene was in the pit at the start of the Cure’s show.I’ll be honest with you. I wanted something that sounded a little less like living in a damp bedroom in a shared house. Christine sounds sharp and tight. Pop that is seductive and disruptive, and lets you in even if you’re not a superfan. The cheers from the Other Stage are louder on the iPlayer than the ones from the Pyramid are on the telly.I lost track of the set, because I was tying, but we’re back with a single, Fascination Street. Guess which album it’s from. Go on, guess.OK, so here’s the question. What should bands do at festival headline sets? Should they do whatever they please, or should they play the hits, given the crowd is largely made up of the curious rather than the devoted. I used to think the former. More unpredictable, more exciting. I changed my mind at Glastonbury in 2016, standing in the mud, watching New Order, when they played a set that eschewed the hits until the end. Indoors, at a New Order show, I would have loved it. Outdoors, in a big crowd, I wanted to feel part of something bigger. And a set that delivers to the committed fans does not make you feel part of something bigger. I felt the same away when Springsteen played here – he shouldn’t have played a Boss set he should have gone outright for everything that neutrals know, whether or not he wanted to – he should have given them Born in the USA and I’m on Fire and so on. Something can be brilliant and unsuited to its environment at the same time.It’s back to Disintegration for Lovesong. I suppose it’s not surprising they’re leaning heavily on that album so far: they’ve been playing it in full in various places around the world. It’s a fan favourite, and it was their highest charting record. But this is shaping up to be a set that devotees hail as a masterpiece, while neutrals shrug. And Lovesong is followed by Last Dance from … Disintegration.High gets a QPR rating of Jan Stejskal. Solid performer. Now on to A Night Like This, from The Head on the Door, which sounds fantastic. I bet the fans are in raptures: this isn’t a greatest hits set, but it’s creating a solid mood – not of euphoria, but a kind of relaxed intensity. Bet it sounds amazing just a bit stoned. This is swelling and flowing like an ocean. Giving it a QPR rating of Shaun Derry: deserves more recognition.It all sounds lovely, but as Jeff observes: “They’re not giving it the full Kylie, are they?” Still, they’ve left Disintegration behind. High is from 1992’s Wish.Behold Jeff Goldblum and his trousers and shirt. It will not surprise you to learn this man consults a stylist every day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac0b7cd86e3e7bda5ed22c75821e7ef99c498270/0_207_5895_3537/master/5895.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a14cd8904226a1e646f99813b958d695","title":"ebola is back can it be contained podcast","story":"The current outbreak of the deadly virus in the DRC has been called the most complex public health emergency in history.

Here is a rundown of her visits in Brussels’ version of the Big Brother house.It started with a “pfff”. Asked about May’s Brexit comments at her first EU summit, the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, gave a gallic shrug and did his impression of a tyre with a slow puncture.In October 2016, three months after becoming leader of the Conservative party and taking the keys to Downing Street, the then unknown quantity that was the second female UK prime minister had arrived in Brussels – and treated the 27 other heads of state and government to their first blast of Maybot.In a five-minute slot at 1am, after a six-hour session on the migration crisis and Russian aggression in Syria, May delivered her “clear message” that the UK was leaving the EU but would play a full role until that point. “We had no special event with Theresa May,” said Junker.Staring at an empty table with only a row of plant pots for company, the image of a dejected-looking May at the October 2017 European council offered a neat pictorial summary of the state of the Brexit negotiations that autumn.Britain was desperate to move on from talking about the withdrawal agreement – citizens’ rights, the orce bill and the Irish border – and on to talks about the future trade relationship. The EU felt that “insufficient progress” had been made.Juncker used a summit press conference to deny reports that May had  pleaded for her political life at a recent dinner and was “anxious”, “tormented”, “despondent and discouraged”. She had been in “good shape” and “fighting”, Juncker insisted.The prime minister had weathered the resignations of her Brexit secretary, David Davis, and her foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, after unveiling her Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU that summer. The EU27 joining her in September 2018 at a meeting in Salzburg in the Austrian alps had intended to offer warm words as the British prime minister sought to finalise the withdrawal agreement in Brussels, and then try to sell it at home.Instead, provoked by an ill-thought-out editorial from the prime minister published in a German newspaper accusing the EU of demanding the unacceptable over Northern Ireland, the leaders went on the attack. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, ripped up Chequers. “Those who explain that we can easily live without Europe, that everything is going to be all right, and that it’s going to bring a lot of money home are liars,” said Macron.Later an image circulated via Instagram. A cake had been offered to a few leaders and their aides, including May. “A piece of cake, perhaps? Sorry, no cherries,” read the caption alongside the picture of May and the European council president, Donald Tusk. With relations soured, Tusk was accused in the media, to his horror, of mocking the diabetic British prime minister. The next day, back in Downing Street, May made a statement asking for mutual respect.“You called me nebulous?” It was 14 December 2018, and a few moments before the European council – the EU’s 28 leaders – were to sit down to discuss the issues of the day.It was unclear whether the prime minister was aware but the TV cameras had yet to be turned out of the summit room. May made a beeline for Juncker. “What did you call me? You called me nebulous.” “No I didn’t, no I didn’t”, responded a startled European commission president.Juncker had hours earlier used exactly that word to describe the negotiating positions emerging from Britain.“We were not dancing … she thought that I did criticise her,” Juncker later admitted of their “robust discussion”. “And in the course of the morning after having checked what I said yesterday night, she was kissing me,” he added with a smile.The emergence of the former Dutch foreign minister Frans Timmermans as front runner to replace Juncker as the next European commission president leaves May in a tricky spot. Hungary, Poland, Czech Republic and Slovakia looked likely to try to block Timmermans as he has been a strident advocate for the rule of law in countries where it has been threatened in his role as vice president of the commission. Italy’s populist government could go the same way, leaving May with a casting vote. She arrived at the summit and lived up to the dramatic moment by promising to be “constructive”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef13c545f6e57c19d1e9e1124ef855e135fef30b/0_385_2732_1639/master/2732.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7248d3017320dac32f8a83e9cfd214f5","title":"jeremy hunt i would tell bust businesses no deal brexit was worth it","story":"Tory leadership hopeful says he would tell bankrupt firms their sacrifice was worth itBusiness groups have expressed anger after Jeremy Hunt said he would willingly tell people whose companies went bust after a no-deal Brexit that their sacrifice had been necessary.In a notable escalation of his rhetoric on Brexit, the foreign secretary, who is trailing Boris Johnson in the Conservative leadership election, also said he would actively pursue no deal if a new departure plan looked impossible by the start of October – less than 10 weeks after the new prime minister takes office.Hunt’s shift towards the harder language associated with Johnson, who has promised to deliver Brexit by 31 October “do or die”, has alarmed some fellow Conservatives. A senior party source said it was “shocking to hear an allegedly sensible politician talk so frivolously about the livelihoods of millions of people”.Throughout the leadership campaign Hunt has stressed the potential damage from a no-deal departure, saying he would only pursue it if there was no other way to deliver Brexit.But interviewed on BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show, Hunt said it could become a policy goal if his plan to renegotiate a departure deal with the EU – dismissed by Brussels as unrealistic – proved impossible.“At the beginning of October, if there is no prospect of a deal that can get through parliament, then I will leave at the end of October because that is our democratic promise to the British people,” Hunt said.Asked whether, under such a policy, he would be willing to look the owners of family businesses in the eye and say they should be prepared to see their companies go bust to ensure a no-deal Brexit, Hunt said: “I would do so but I’d do it with a heavy heart precisely because of the risks.”Hunt said he would tell business owners that a no-deal Brexit was necessary to maintain the UK’s image abroad as “a country where politicians do what the people tell them to do”.He added: “So if, in order to do what the people tell us to do, we have to leave without a deal, I would do that. But I would find support for those companies to help them weather the storms.”His style is notably technocratic, with few rhetorical flourishes and an emphasis on his consensual approach and long record as a minister, notably during more than five years as health secretary, a traditional graveyard of ministerial careers. Hunt’s attempts to talk up a backstory as an \u0027underestimated\u0027 entrepreneur can fall flat given he is also the son of an admiral and was head boy at Charterhouse. Overall, Hunt’s approach can seem uninspiring and hard to pin down in terms of core beliefs, hence the \u0027Theresa in trousers\u0027 nickname among some Tory MPs.His campaign team have decided to take the fight directly to rival Boris Johnson though, with Hunt taking part in a Twitter Q\u0026ampA session as a direct response to Johnson\u0027s refusal to appear on a Sky TV head-to-head debate. The hashtag: #BoJoNoShow.He says a new deal with the EU is possible by 31 October and he would send a cross-party negotiating team to Brussels, including members of the DUP. He would countenance leaving the EU without a deal but is notably more wary than rival Boris Johnson.Before the campaign began he called for a doubling of defence spending, but he has since pulled back slightly, saying only that it should increase. He has argued that cuts to social care budgets had gone too far.Hunt backs the 2050 target for zero net carbon emissions and has called for \u0027sensible tax incentives\u0027 to encourage green initiatives, but very little beyond this.A likely strength for him, as he has been seen as a solid foreign secretary, an impression burnished by taking over from the chaotic Johnson. This has been a key part of his pitch.Leading business groups have been careful to not criticise either Hunt or Johnson directly during the leadership campaign, but the comments prompted strong warnings against such policies.Make UK, which represents manufacturing and engineering firms, said these companies were “the backbone of British industry, and the suggestion that losing them is a price worth paying leaves many speechless”.Leaving without a deal would be “an act of economic vandalism”, a spokesman said. “We call on any and every politician advocating no deal to think carefully about the enormous harm it would do to businesses and the millions of families who rely on them.”Claire Walker, the co-executive director of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: “Politicians must remember that it is businesses that create jobs and opportunities across our communities, and it is the role of government to create the conditions necessary for these firms to survive and grow, now and in the future. A focus on ideology rather than practicalities does not serve the interests of the UK, or its people, well.”A CBI spokesman said: “The case for any new prime minister to secure a good deal with the EU is clearcut. Jobs and livelihoods will depend on it.”The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said the comments showed that to win votes from Tory members Hunt was “willing to sacrifice the jobs and living standards of millions”, calling this “the height of irresponsibility”.The senior Conservative source said there was intense worry within the party that Hunt’s comments showed both candidates were trying to “pander to the hardcore right of the party”.They said: “It’ll be the poorest who will be hit the hardest by no deal. People who use a wage to keep a roof over their heads and food in their stomach – not Jeremy or Boris or any other taxpayer-subsidised MP.“Those in ivory towers need to realise that this is real people’s lives we’re dealing with, not just party politics. The leadership candidates need to get over themselves and do what’s best for the country and deliver a deal.”One leading centrist Tory MP said should be appealing to “the mainstream moderate business wing of Conservatism”.They said: “He will never win by aping Boris as the toughest Brexiter. Theresa May tried that and ended up tying herself in knots.”Hunt has faced criticism from Johnson over his insistence that if a deal was very close by 31 October he might briefly extend the deadline to finalise it. He told Marr that this was actually more likely to make Brexit happen.“If we got to the end of October and we’ve got a deal and we’re trying to get it through parliament but we need a few more parliamentary days, I’m not going to rip up that deal. Boris is,” he said.In his own TV interview, Johnson insisted he was happy to take responsibility for the consequences of Brexit.In sometimes tricky exchanges on Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday, during which he appeared to not know the current hourly rate for the national living wage, Johnson denied that he tried to avoid accountability for his words and actions, saying he accepted liability for Brexit.“I played a part in that campaign and I’m very proud of what we did but I take personal responsibility now for what is happening to our country, for the drift and the dither, and the indecision, and the failure to be sufficiently robust in the negotiations which we’ve seen so far,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/164d109bbb1e5726f3aa12f250a6c8e4b069d340/0_137_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dad59c0d0ec73bca5bb628c92d78bfe9","title":"labour calls for inquiry into civil service claim that corbyn is too frail","story":"Shadow minister says the comments leaked to the media have ‘disturbing implications’Labour has written to the head of the civil service to request an independent investigation into anonymous warnings leaked to a newspaper that claimed Jeremy Corbyn could be too frail to function as prime minister.Jon Trickett, the shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, told the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, that the comments amounted to a “totally unwarranted and indeed unconstitutional political intervention, with disturbing implications for our democratic system”.Corbyn and his party have rejected the claims made in the Times on Saturday, which said that, at a recent event, senior civil servants had discussed their worries about what might happen if the Labour leader became prime minister.The report cited anonymous senior civil servants who warned that they were concerned about Corbyn being put into Downing Street after an election as he seemed to lack a firm grasp of issues and was being “propped up” by his advisers.One was quoted as saying: “There is a real worry that the Labour leader isn’t up to the job physically or mentally but is being propped up by those around him. There’s growing concern that he’s too frail and is losing his memory. He’s not in charge of his own party.”Corbyn has called for an investigation, saying it was “very concerning” for officials to brief against an elected politician.In his letter to Sedwill, Trickett wrote: “Discussion of these matters, based on false assumptions, should not be taking place. Worse, it is without precedent in my experience that any high-level discussion about senior politicians, let alone the leader of the opposition, should be shared with a newspaper.“I must now formally say to you that it is hard to avoid the conclusion that this has been a totally unwarranted and indeed unconstitutional political intervention with disturbing implications for our democratic system.“There clearly needs to be an investigation into what appears to have been a breach of civil service neutrality, independent of the Cabinet Office, in order to avoid any real or apparent conflicts of interest.”Trickett also said he wanted a meeting with Sedwill to discuss the matter, and to get “clear assurances that the basic principles of British public life will not be undermined”.Earlier on Sunday Len McCluskey, the leader of the Unite union and a close associate of Corbyn, told BBC One’s Andrew Marr show that he believed the comments could have been entirely made up by the journalists concerned.“They ought to be ashamed of themselves,” he said. “It was fake news. It was lies. It was distortion.“Jeremy Corbyn is fit as a fiddle. He is one of the strongest people I have ever met – people 20 years younger struggle to keep up with him. I don’t believe them at all. It’s the Murdoch press. Of course they are going to attack and try to undermine Jeremy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6209b0dac03dc07ae87c3946a6b7b61e70505c86/0_20_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9084d58c453e4af4f55584c52f91c69","title":"we need to move now john mcdonnell voices labour brexit policy frustration","story":"Shadow chancellor wants more openly pro-referendum and pro-remain approachJohn McDonnell has expressed renewed frustration at the slow pace of change on Labour’s Brexit policy, praising Jeremy Corbyn for seeking a consensus view, but warning: “We need to move now.”In a sign of the continued splits within the party over whether and how to seek a second referendum, and what side to campaign for if one happened, a key Corbyn ally, Unite’s Len McCluskey, said the Labour leader should not be “bullied” into action by his frontbench.A shadow cabinet meeting last week, billed as key in deciding Labour’s position, failed to reach an agreement after Corbyn said he wanted to consult unions and others further before making a decision, going against the view of several shadow ministers.Speaking to Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday, McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said he was among those who wanted a more openly pro-referendum and pro-remain approach.“I’ve said publicly I would vote remain, I’d campaign for remain. Jeremy then said we need to consult our executive committee members,” McDonnell said.Before the shadow cabinet meeting, McDonnell said, he thought “we were going to move further”.He continued: “The unions asked for a bit more time – fair enough, I don’t mind that. The type of leader that Jeremy is is a consensus-builder, and that’s what he’s trying to do: bring people together, have those consultations, those discussions, and bring people together.”Asked whether he had privately described Labour’s Brexit policy as a “slow-motion car crash”, McDonnell declined to comment, but also did not reject the idea that this was his view.He said: “What I’ve been trying to say is we need to move now, and Jeremy said a month ago, we’re going to put this issue back to the people – I fully agree.”Some Labour sources have said the delays were in part prompted by pressure from McCluskey’s union, Unite, and people in Corbyn’s office such as his chief of staff, Karie Murphy, a close friend of McCluskey.But speaking later on Sunday to BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show, McCluskey argued that there was no need to rush, and that Corbyn would not be pushed into a decision even if shadow ministers wanted the party to seek a second referendum, in which it would back remain.“That’s perfectly legitimate for them to express that view,” McCluskey said. “What Jeremy Corbyn is doing – and that’s why Jeremy Corbyn is such a strong leader – he’s not being bulled into any position by anybody.”McCluskey said that while he vehemently opposed a no-deal Brexit, he believed the most nationally unifying policy could be for Labour to win a general election and negotiate an economically robust form of Brexit.He criticised what he said was unnecessary pressure to make a decision: “There seems to be a panic to rush in order to establish a different position from one the Labour party has had for a couple of years now, which is respecting the result of the 2016 referendum and trying to negotiate a deal which would unite the nation.“Unfortunately we have had a prime minister who has made huge mistakes and a government which has been incapable of delivering Brexit. And we have had a well-funded remain lobby that has turned the nation into a toxic situation.”He said: “The reality is there is no panic to do anything. We’ve got a policy conference coming up in less than 12 weeks. Let Jeremy Corbyn consult.“My message to Labour MPs and to our Labour members is: Jeremy’s done OK so far, so let’s trust him to consult and see what emerges.”Elsewhere in his Sky interview, McDonnell, who was wearing a badge with the logo of the green direct action protest group Extinction Rebellion, defended Labour’s plan to consider delisting from the stock exchange companies who cause excess environmental damage.Extinction Rebellion had “put climate change at the top of our agenda, so it’s the priority for the next Labour government, basically”, he said.“We’ve got to ensure that there’s proper regulation of activity. We’ve got to have a just transition from a fossil fuel economy to a net zero economy as soon as we can,” McDonnell said.“But also, if there are companies that aren’t fulfilling their environmental responsibilities, undermining everything that we do, putting our planet at risk, there has to be some sanctions as well, and that’s regulation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba8b00ff06ab1ed616df3a5b552b81070802e306/0_1_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2029a93f716c507079d24fec9fb3266","title":"the science of influencing people six ways to win an argument","story":"Hidebound views on subjects such as the climate crisis and Brexit are the norm – but the appliance of science may sway stubborn opinions“I am quite sure now that often, very often, in matters of religion and politics a man’s reasoning powers are not above the monkey’s,” wrote Mark Twain.Having written a book about our most common reasoning errors, I would argue that Twain was being rather uncharitable – to monkeys. Whether we are discussing Trump, Brexit, or the Tory leadership, we have all come across people who appear to have next to no understanding of world events – but who talk with the utmost confidence and conviction. And the latest psychological research can now help us to understand why.Consider the “illusion of explanatory depth”. When asked about government policies and their consequences, most people believe that they could explain their workings in great detail. If put to the test, however, their explanations are vague and incoherent. The problem is that we confuse a shallow familiarity with general concepts for real, in-depth knowledge.Besides being less substantial than we think, our knowledge is also highly selective: we conveniently remember facts that support our beliefs and forget others. When it comes to understanding the EU, for instance, Brexiters will know the overall costs of membership, while remainers will cite its numerous advantages. Although the overall level of knowledge is equal on both sides, there is little overlap in the details.Politics can also scramble our critical thinking skills. Psychological studies show that people fail to notice the logical fallacies in an argument if the conclusion supports their viewpoint if they are shown contrary evidence, however, they will be far more critical of the tiniest hole in the argument. This phenomenon is known as “motivated reasoning”.A high standard of education doesn’t necessarily protect us from these flaws. Graduates, for instance, often overestimate their understanding of their degree subject: although they remember the general content, they have forgotten the details. “People confuse their current level of understanding with their peak knowledge,” Prof Matthew Fisher of Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas, says. That false sense of expertise can, in turn, lead them to feel that they have the licence to be more closed-minded in their political views – an attitude known as “earned dogmatism”.Little wonder that discussions about politics can leave us feeling that we are banging our heads against a brick wall – even when talking to people we might otherwise respect. Fortunately, recent psychological research also offers evidence-based ways towards achieving more fruitful discussions.Thanks to the illusion of explanatory depth, many political arguments will be based on false premises, spoken with great confidence but with a minimal understanding of the issues at hand. For this reason, a simple but powerful way of deflating someone’s argument is to ask for more detail. “You need to get the ‘other side’ focusing on how something would play itself out, in a step by step fashion”, says Prof Dan Johnson at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia. By revealing the shallowness of their existing knowledge, this prompts a more moderate and humble attitude.In 2013, Prof Philip Fernbach at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and colleagues asked participants in cap-and-trade schemes – designed to limit companies’ carbon emissions – to describe in depth how they worked. Subjects initially took strongly polarised views but after the limits of their knowledge were exposed, their attitudes became more moderate and less biased.It’s important to note that simply asking why people supported or opposed the policy – without requiring them to explain how it works – had no effect, since those reasons could be shallower (“It helps the environment”) with little detail. You need to ask how something works to get the effect.If you are debating the merits of a no-deal Brexit, you might ask someone to describe exactly how the UK’s international trade would change under WTO terms. If you are challenging a climate emergency denier, you might ask them to describe exactly how their alternative theories can explain the recent rise in temperatures. It’s a strategy that the broadcaster James O’Brien employs on his LBC talk show – to powerful effect.If you are trying to debunk a particular falsehood – like a conspiracy theory or fake news – you should make sure that your explanation offers a convincing, coherent narrative that fills all the gaps left in the other person’s understanding.Consider the following experiment by Prof Brendan Nyhan of the University of Michigan and Prof Jason Reifler of the University of Exeter. Subjects read stories about a fictional senator allegedly under investigation for bribery who had subsequently resigned from his post. Written evidence – a letter from prosecutors confirming his innocence – did little to change the participants’ suspicions of his guilt. But when offered an alternative explanation for his resignation – to take on another role – participants changed their minds. The same can be seen in murder trials: people are more likely to accept someone’s innocence if another suspect has also been accused, since that fills the biggest gap in the story: whodunnit.The persuasive power of well-constructed narratives means that it’s often useful to discuss the sources of misinformation, so that the person can understand why they were being misled in the first place. Anti-vaxxers, for instance, may believe a medical conspiracy to cover up the supposed dangers of vaccines. You are more likely to change minds if you replace that narrative with an equally cohesive and convincing story – such as Andrew Wakefield’s scientific fraud, and the fact that he was set to profit from his paper linking autism to MMR vaccines. Just stating the scientific evidence will not be as persuasive.Each of our beliefs is deeply rooted in a much broader and more complex political ideology. Climate crisis denial, for instance, is now inextricably linked to beliefs in free trade, capitalism and the dangers of environmental regulation.Attacking one issue may therefore threaten to unravel someone’s whole worldview – a feeling that triggers emotionally charged motivated reasoning. It is for this reason that highly educated Republicans in the US deny the overwhelming evidence.You are not going to alter someone’s whole political ideology in one discussion, so a better strategy is to disentangle the issue at hand from their broader beliefs, or to explain how the facts can still be accommodated into their worldview. A free-market capitalist who denies global warming might be far more receptive to the evidence if you explain that the development of renewable energies could lead to technological breakthroughs and generate economic growth.If the attempt to reframe the issue fails, you might have more success by appealing to another part of the person’s identity entirely.Someone’s political affiliation will never completely define them, after all. Besides being a conservative or a socialist, a Brexiter or a remainer, we associate ourselves with other traits and values – things like our profession, or our role as a parent. We might see ourselves as a particularly honest person, or someone who is especially creative. “All people have multiple identities,” says Prof Jay Van Bavel at New York University, who studies the neuroscience of the “partisan brain”. “These identities can become active at any given time, depending on the circumstances.”You could try to use this to your advantage during a heated conversation, with subtle flattery that appeals to another identity and its set of values if you are talking to a science teacher, you might try to emphasise their capacity to appraise evidence even-handedly. The aim is to help them recognise that they can change their mind on certain issues while staying true to other important elements of their personality.Another simple strategy to encourage a more detached and rational mindset is to ask your conversation partner to imagine the argument from the viewpoint of someone from another country. How, for example, would someone in Australia or Iceland view Boris Johnson as our new prime minister?Prof Ethan Kross at the University of Michigan, and Prof Igor Grossmann at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada, have shown that this strategy increases “psychological distance” from the issue at hand and cools emotionally charged reasoning so that you can see things more objectively. During the US presidential elections, for instance, their participants were asked to consider how someone in Iceland would view the candidates. They were subsequently more willing to accept the limits of their knowledge and to listen to alternative viewpoints after the experiment, they were even more likely to join a bipartisan discussion group.This is only one way to increase someone’s psychological distance, and there are many others. If you are considering policies with potentially long-term consequences, you could ask them to imagine viewing the situation through the eyes of someone in the future. However you do it, encouraging this shift in perspective should make your friend or relative more receptive to the facts you are presenting, rather than simply reacting with knee-jerk dismissals.Here’s a lesson that certain polemicists in the media might do well to remember – people are generally much more rational in their arguments, and more willing to own up to the limits of their knowledge and understanding, if they are treated with respect and compassion. Aggression, by contrast, leads them to feel that their identity is threatened, which in turn can make them closed-minded.Assuming that the purpose of your argument is to change minds, rather than to signal your own superiority, you are much more likely to achieve your aims by arguing gently and kindly rather than belligerently, and affirming your respect for the person, even if you are telling them some hard truths. As a bonus, you will also come across better to onlookers. “There’s a lot of work showing that third-party observers always attribute high levels of competence when the person is conducting themselves with more civility,” says Dr Joe Vitriol, a psychologist at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. As Lady Mary Wortley Montagu put it in the 18th century: “Civility costs nothing and buys everything.”• David Robson is the author of The Intelligence Trap: Why Smart People Do Stupid Things and How to Make Wiser Decisions (Hodder \u0026amp Stoughton, £20).

In an ITV interview, he said: “We’ve spent a bit of time being lost as to what our modern identity is, and I think as a team we represent that modern identity and hopefully people can connect with us.”This was echoed by Sunder Katwala, director of British Future. “An inclusive England may be symbolised by Raheem Sterling and Nikita Parris scoring goals for England, or Moeen Ali taking wickets in the World Cup, but it also reflects the lived reality of who most of us now think of as English.”Similar polling carried out by YouGov in 2018 revealed that members of BAME communities are still significantly less likely to consider themselves English. However, the perception that being English is strongly related to being born in England could allow new generations of BAME citizens to be more readily acknowledged as English.John Denham, director of the Centre for English Identity and Politics, said: “The idea that English is an ethnic identity is widely repeated in the media and politics. That Englishness has become even more inclusive at a time in which our society has become more ided is to be welcomed.“Ethnicity is clearly much less important outside a small hardcore of residents. The further development of an inclusive Englishness would benefit from positive engagement by leaders across the political spectrum. This should aim to encourage BAME citizens to see English identity as open to them and that the strongest English identifiers continue to support the opening up of English identity.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7795aadb1939ebb3b2b06560c23d3f275ffa2671/464_0_3762_2257/master/3762.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97e41072c5266ecb4d6fdb49ac7817af","title":"england cricket world cup india plunkett woakes match report","story":"It is still in England’s hands to reach the semi-finals of this enthralling World Cup. In a captivating game at Edgbaston, which was transformed into a wondrous Colosseum of cricket on a sunny Sunday afternoon, England won by 31 runs in a match decorated by high drama, sumptuous centuries from Jonny Bairstow and Rohit Sharma and a gutsy England performance after a tricky week under the spotlight.This victory was crucial to England’s World Cup hopes. It meant that if Eoin Morgan’s side can defeat New Zealand in Chester-le-Street on Wednesday they are guaranteed a place in the semi-finals. They will need every second of the next two days to recover from a sapping contest, in which they held their nerve superbly against the only unbeaten side left in the tournament – until 6.30pm on Sunday night.Theirs was not a flawless performance – life might have been less stressful for England and their supporters if Joe Root had held on to a routine slip catch when Sharma was on four – but it was a characterful one in the field after a fearless opening partnership had set England on their way earlier in the day.The scorecard highlights the key runscorers easily enough with Bairstow, Jason Roy and Ben Stokes all delivering high-quality innings. Less obviously there were grand performances in the field: from Chris Woakes, who began with three maidens and a wicket as well as pulling off another brilliant boundary catch from Jofra Archer, who kept his cool again and from Liam Plunkett, preferred to Moeen Ali, a shrewd decision given the punishment to the Indian spinners earlier in the day.Plunkett somehow conjured vital wickets from the first ball of two of his spells crucially he dismissed Virat Kohli when England were under threat later he returned to dispatch Rishabh Pant and Hardik Pandya when the chase was on.Those wickets terminated India’s chance of a record run chase – they needed the small matter of 338 to win the game. Thereafter MS Dhoni seemed to decide the target was out of range. So England could at last heave a sigh of relief and look forward to Wednesday in a more tranquil frame of mind. They delivered under pressure in a manner that any old player would have to applaud. The likelihood is that the pressure will be just as intense against New Zealand up in Durham – and just as spellbinding for those able to watch. It is hard to see how Morgan can now do without Plunkett.There were moments during England’s innings when it seemed that the target would be completely out of range so well did Bairstow and Roy launch the innings after Morgan had chosen to bat at the toss. Roy resumed his England career batting in the same vein as in his last innings – against Bangladesh at Cardiff – with two crisp boundaries off Mohammed Shami.The openers negotiated the first 10 overs decorously enough, scoring 47 runs, several of which came off the inside edge of Bairstow’s bat. Then in the 11th over Roy had a great slice of luck. He swatted at an innocuous delivery from Pandya. There was an appeal for a catch behind rejected by umpire Aleem Dar, who promptly signalled a leg side wide. Pandya remained keen on a review Dhoni rejected this idea and Kohli followed his wicketkeeper’s advice. It transpired that the ball had brushed Roy’s gloves.This escape seemed to galvanise the batsmen. Roy smote the next two deliveries for six and four at the other end Bairstow changed gear, launching the wrist-spinners into a crowd predominantly clad in the blue shirts of India. Together they raced along, demystifying the Indian spinners in the process – Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal would yield 160 runs from their 20 overs.Roy was the solitary victim of a spinner when Ravi Jadeja, a ubiquitous substitute fielder, ed to his left at long on to complete a superb catch. But his 66 had set the tone wonderfully. Root now kept Bairstow company as he sped to his century, for which a couple of old England players might claim the credit – “he just needs a bit of prodding to get his hackles up and away he goes”. A marvellous innings of 111 ended when Bairstow carved Shami to deep cover – a terrible shot (don’t fret, I’m only winding him up for Wednesday).For a while the innings stalled – overs 28-37 produced just 25 runs. Morgan never ignited and was caught from the top edge hooking again, which will not have escaped the Kiwis. Meanwhile, Root was concerned not to blow the brilliant start to the innings. It was left to Stokes to regain the momentum with another timely knock of 79 and a bit of help from Jos Buttler (20 from eight balls). At the end Shami picked up wickets but once again it was Jasprit Bumrah who tormented the batsmen mostly with brilliant yorkers.India’s response began slowly thanks to Woakes, but Sharma, who had been dropped on four, eventually found his touch alongside an animated Kohli. Then he produced a stream of silky drives from the middle of the sweet spot of an increasingly broad bat. They accelerated ominously but England squeezed effectively after the departure of Kohli. Pandya hit some thunderous blows but once he had been caught on the boundary the idiosyncratic Dhoni seemed to decide that he should protect India’s net run rate, a source of relief to the England fielders and bewilderment to those looking on in the stands.

As the players tasked with dragging the eight-times Super League champions out of this relegation battle celebrated at full-time, the response from everyone associated with the club underlined how significant an afternoon this was.There are still plenty of twists and turns to come in the final nine weeks of the regular season but defeat here for Leeds would have been unthinkable. Instead, this victory over Catalans not only lifts them off the bottom but further constricts the relegation battle. Leeds, London, Huddersfield and Hull KR are now separated only by points difference, and while it is now a genuine four-way battle to avoid finishing bottom, this performance should reaffirm the belief many possess at Headingley that there is the quality to get out of that dogfight.“I think we’ve still got our best stuff to come,” the Rhinos coach, Richard Agar, said. “Don’t think we’re now blasé about our league position though. Far from it.”Perhaps the biggest indicator Leeds have the capabilities to survive came in the second half. Having raced into an 18-0 lead courtesy of tries from Adam Cuthbertson, Tom Briscoe and Brad Singleton, Leeds fans would have been forgiven for thinking it was Groundhog Day when the Dragons pulled it back to 18-12 midway through the second period. Leeds have fallen apart at that stage on several occasions this season, but the fact they had the character to hold off Catalans’ rally and actually finish comfortable victors suggests there are more positive times ahead for the Rhinos.For Catalans, though, this was another damaging and demoralising afternoon for their play-off hopes. This is now five defeats in a row, and while tries from Arthur Romano and Sam Tomkins did make it 18-12 at one stage, they were left to rue both a dismal start and finish to this contest.“It’s not a nice situation we’ve had a poor month and we’ve got to turn it around,” Steve McNamara, the Catalans coach, said.Catalans arguably scored the best tries of the game and, in McNamara’s view, were the better team for large periods. He may well be right but that quick-fire start from Leeds always left the Dragons playing catch-up on an afternoon when they dropped out of the play-off places.A month ago they were eyeing up second-placed Warrington but the hosts deserve credit for the way they finished the stronger of the sides here. Konrad Hurrell’s try on 67 minutes calmed any nerves, before Jack Walker’s inidual effort with four minutes remaining rounded off the scoring. By then, though, the celebrations among Leeds supporters had already started."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d243acf103e9f4aff9235af5eda5b787a8c0d1ae/0_104_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f5712052ade817eb92d8c748cb7cbce","title":"max verstappen austrian f1 gp charles leclerc","story":"There were pillars of orange smoke bellowing into the natural amphitheatre of the Red Bull Ring as the Styrian mountains echoed to the raucous celebrations of thousands of Dutch fans roaring home Max Verstappen’s victory at the Austrian Grand Prix. For the orange-clad hordes and for Verstappen it had been a glorious afternoon but one not conclusive even after the chequered flag had fallen.In fact his win stood unconfirmed, waiting for more than three hours on the colour of smoke that would emerge from the steward’s room as they considered whether to let the his last-ditch pass on Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc stand. Long after the grandstands had emptied and with an appropriately orange sunset approaching they emerged with their decision and the win was Verstappen’s.As fake steward’s documents were released on to social media, rumour and counter-rumour swept the paddock but the stewards were clearly poring over this with intense scrutiny before deciding that neither driver was predominantly responsible for their contact and that it was a racing incident.Verstappen’s win was in the balance after an unlikely victory that left Ferrari and Leclerc reeling and once again seeing victory plucked from their grasp. The Red Bull driver had come back from nowhere after a start in which he had dropped from second on the grid to seventh after the opening lap as a result of his anti-stall kicking in as the lights went out.The race had looked as if it belonged to Leclerc, who had started on pole and led with a commanding drive for the majority of laps. Verstappen and his team were having none of it, however, and with a strong strategy and some aggressive driving Verstappen threaded his way through the pack before delivering the coup de grâce on the frustrated Monegasque driver with only two laps to go.The two young guns of F1, both 21, had elevated what might have been another mundane win from the front into a thrill ride. F1 needed a shot in the arm and the youngsters provided just that. In their wake the older guard were firmly in supporting roles, with Valtteri Bottas in third for Mercedes and Leclerc’s teammate, Sebastian Vettel, in fourth. Lewis Hamilton, the championship leader, was in fifth after he had to take a new nose, incurred after taking damage on the kerbs. Behind them another of the new generation, the 19-year-old Lando Norris, was a superb sixth for McLaren.The first race Mercedes have been defeated in this season was not a major dent in Hamilton’s title hopes, however. He still leads the championship by 31 points from Bottas in second. The win puts Verstappen back into third place, 71 points behind, while Vettel is in fourth, 74 points back.This is Verstappen’s sixth career win and is a major result for the Dutchman after a strong start to the season he makes it two in a row here after he took the flag for Red Bull in Austria last year. He had started the race on the medium tyres, as did Mercedes, as opposed to the softs that Ferrari had opted for, and the decision worked. He went long and had the extra grip in the final laps. Red Bull had called it operationally to perfection and taken a deserved win against the head.It is their first win this year, their first since Verstappen won in Mexico last October. At Honda, who now supply Red Bull’s engines, the win will be welcomed as a huge success and with some relief. It is their first victory as an engine supplier after returning to the sport in 2014 and after they endured three terrible years with McLaren, struggling for pace and reliability. They last won as an engine supplier with McLaren in 1992, when Gerhard Berger was at the wheel in the Australian Grand Prix, and as a constructor with Jenson Button at Hungary in 2006.Leclerc had held his lead into the newly named turn one, now the Niki Lauda curve, but Verstappen was slow off the line. It required a comeback of calm maturity that might have been missing from the younger Verstappen, who made his F1 debut at 17 and is now in his fifth season.After his late stop on lap 31 he had begun mounting his attack on fresh rubber. Vettel fell through turn four on lap 50 and, as the Dutch fans sensed blood, so did their man. He promptly caught Bottas on lap 55 and, although complaining of a loss of power, it proved no impediment as second place was swept from the Finn’s grasp at turn three.What followed proved gripping. Verstappen trailed Leclerc by five seconds with 14 laps to go. He had it narrowed to mere tenths by lap 67 and was all over the Ferrari’s rear wing. By lap 68 the two went nervelessly wheel to wheel though turns three and four. Leclerc defended superbly as they gave each other just enough room. However, on the next lap Verstappen went up the inside through three again, the pair made brief contact and Leclerc was forced wide and ceded the place, prompting the investigation to begin.Leclerc was visibly disappointed and Verstappen elated but between them F1 had been treated to a reminder of just how it can move the soul and one ultimately left with no change to the finishing order long after the protagonists had left the circuit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81cae1bd86095249bdac54f90fdd420e168fdfea/0_264_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5942afa9f4d473cff54fba32e27d9246","title":"f1 formula one austrian grand prix live","story":"Max Verstappen had a long wait to find out he had won the Austrian Grand Prix following a stewards’ inquiryFerrari accept the decision ...Here’s the race report from Austria ...Thanks for joining me but mainly Niall McVeigh who put in some great work. Good night.Judging by all your comments, most of you will enjoy the evening now Verstappen has kept his victory and the maximum points from the race thanks to his stunning drive.Big celebrations for Red Bull in Austria. Everyone is high-fiving and hugging. Ferrari will be furious, one assumes, though.Verstappen will be relieved. Who knows why on earth it took so long but at least we finally have one!The stewards “did not consider that either driver was wholly or predominantly to blame for the incident. We consider that this is a racing incident.”Slow it down ...Jesse Clark says: “I love this kind of racing, it makes it fun. If the penalize Max it ruins the sport. But fair is fair, Vettel got penalized and didnt even touch Hamilton in Canada....so you need to be consistent.”Coming to a live blog near you ...Down the middle ...Logan Riley offers this: “To me it doesn’t matter whether people think it was fair or not, because first and foremost, Max knew he had the car to pass Charles in the approaching DRS zone with tires that were also ten laps fresher than Charles’s tires, and instead of making the pass where Max knew he was going to blow the doors off Charles anyway seeing that he was literally a beard hair behind him heading into that section of the track, he chose to make an aggressive move that he should have known was going to get investigated if he botched the aggressive overtake. “Second of all, the only group that the FIA needs to blame is the FIA, because they were the ones that opened Pandora’s Box with the penalty that they levied on Vettel for his racing incident with Hamilton back in Canada (Which might I add ended with no contact at all between either driver). There was nothing spectacular about Max’s attempt at a pass, especially when you consider that in the lap before, Max overtook Leclerc cleanly, but then got overtaken back by Leclerc with no contact made. Max made a reckless decision, and it was a deliberate one at that knowing he had the momentum with laps to spare anyway. There is no dispute, Max deserves a penalty without question!”One assumes they are waiting for everyone to leave ...Andy Berkemeijer has two points:“1) Comparing this incident to the one in Canada is incorrect. In Canada the issue was about how to rejoin the racing surface after an off-track excursion. The issue here is deciding what point a pass is complete and the other driver has to concede (or run the risk of going off track).“2) If this pass is not allowed to stand then it follows that the only real place to pass in F1 is BEFORE corner entry as any pass in a corner will have at least one of the drivers out of position as far as the normal line is concerned and if neither will give in one, or both, are headed for the weeds.“As I see it, if one driver is completely next to another before the apex then the pass is complete and the driver being passed has the option to either concede the corner or being silly and trying to defend an untenable position which normally results in an off track excursion.“In this case Verstappen was completely alongside Leclerc BEFORE either car reached the apex, hence it’s Max’s turn. end of story.If we keep going down this path of trying to regulate the racing of of racing then the sport as a whole will suffer.”Dominic Stevenson stands out from the crowd: “I feel like I’m the only person who doesn’t mind this - if you set up rules a certain way, you’ve got to follow them, even if they’re dumb rules. If it exists it’s on the participants to actually follow it and drive within the guidelines, everyone else seemed to race fine within them.”Paul Cheevers on Max: “I get he is young and hungry for wins. But I’ve been watching f1 since I’ve been a kid and I’m 51 now , he is a dangerous he don’t care how he wins . I’ve watched many times him pushing people off the track and getting away with it . Justice served if he gets pole taken of him. Christian Horner never takes responsibility for him he is just as bad . He was the same with Vettel.”Peter Harris is to the point: “Max ran him off the road. Not allowed. Simple.”Sara Berry offers her view: “Hi, I think it’s unfair and to be very honest Max is famously known for his historical passes. “The FIA has changed so much since the death of Charlie Whiting, where stewards have handed out a number of penalties for a number of different types of incidents. This is my opinion not sure what other people think.”Tom Thayer says: “This year is the worst yet for formula one. All these rules and regulations are making it a waste of my time to tune in. More to the point when the race is over there should be no more discussion. Penalise during the race if warranted and if you cant make a decision in time then its done. Get over it.”With that, and with two and a half hours having elapsed since the race finished, I’m going to hand over to Will Unwin, who will keep you updated. Thanks for joining me!What’s also becoming clear is that the 5pm (BST) meeting wasn’t to run through the verdict, but to start discussing the incident. As with VAR, the third umpire, etc and so on, the way these things are done can make a big difference between ensuring a fair result and draining all the fun out of things.The FIA have dug themselves a hole here – they might argue it’s such a borderline decision that they can’t reasonably overturn it, but they penalised Vettel for a similar, if not identical, incident in Canada. What I can say with some certainty is that Verstappen’s performance, which was absolutely electrifying, is starting to feel like a side note.My train home leaves at 6.25pm. Over to you, FIA...Rumours on Sky Sports News that Ferrari have been seen celebrating in their paddock. Which would suggest Verstappen has indeed been penalised, handing the win to Leclerc. But who knows at this point.At two hours, the wait to confirm Verstappen’s win is now longer than the entire race.Several reporters tweeted out a form issuing Verstappen with a five-second penalty. It turned out to be fake – despite apparently being delivered through an official channel. This is getting a bit silly.On the other hand, the stewards may want to let Verstappen have the win after such a thrilling race, but need a watertight case to appease Ferrari, given what happened in Canada. Who’d be a steward, eh? Long hours.“The stewards taking this long suggests they find Verstappen at fault, but they’re afraid to make the call because they know it would effectively mean the death of F1 racing,” reckons Emiel de Bont. “And I guess they’re waiting for the tens of thousands of fans, who would feel mightily robbed, to have dispersed.” Here’s something to read while you wait. I doubt Horner is feeling anything close to boredom at this precise moment.Sky now reporting that the decision could take another hour – and our man in Spielberg, Giles Richards, thinks it could be even longer than that.The meeting is taking place right about now – just as Sky switch off their live F1 coverage. Isn’t the whole point of a dedicated channel to allow space to cover live developments? That’s a rhetorical question.Here’s what you guys think – as with the pundits and the paddock, opinions are split.“Charles won the race because Max clearly pushed him off the track,” says Claire Bradley. “Max did this repeatedly last year. Fair is Fair. That is why you have rules.”“After last week, this is what F1 needed,” counters Cary Raesner. “Let it stand.”So, we will keep you updated as soon as we hear anything – but it won’t be for a little while yet. This stewards’ enquiry has basically taken as long as the entire race.PA are reporting that Verstappen and Leclerc will meet with race stewards at 6pm, local time – so in about 40 minutes.Let’s take a look at Verstappen’s standing start:This makes VAR look fast. Here are some words from Lewis Hamilton, sunglasses dangling from his neck. “Fifth place, take the points and move on. The tyres were a massive issue, we had the pace but we just couldn’t race.”A quick word with Leclerc, who seems a little despondent. “It felt like an unfair move to me, but I need to see all the replays.” Verstappen looks far more chipper, but still no official news.We’re still waiting. Martin Brundle is pointing out that the Vettel incident in Canada was a little different, and replays show that Verstappen made no attempt to force Leclerc off the road.Here’s our snap report:Christian Horner thinks it was absolutely fine – but then, of course he would. “This is what Formula One needs. Two young guys, going wheel-to-wheel, fighting each other.”On a side note, I wonder how the thousands of Dutch fans at trackside will feel if their man gets the W taken away...Damon Hill thinks Verstappen has no case to answer: “His nose was in front. Leclerc tried to defend from the outside, and you can’t do that.”This scenario is, of course, reminiscent of Canada when Sebastian Vettel received a penalty that cost him the race:Amid all the drama, it’s a fine day for Honda, whose partnership with Red Bull is beginning to bear fruit. It’s their first Grand Prix win since 2006.Interesting to note that every single driver finished the race, despite all of the excitement. The top three are up on the podium, anthems are being played and Verstappen has his trophy. He still doesn’t know if he’s won the race, though.As the thousands of orange-clad fans head down to the track to greet their hero, we wait for confirmation from the stewards over Verstappen’s winning pass on the way out of turn three.Verstappen certainly pushed it to the limit, but it feels like a borderline decision – and after a drive like that, having the win taken away after the chequered flag would feel like such an anti-climax.And here’s Charles Leclerc: “I’ll let the stewards decide. I know how it felt in the car. The lap before, he left a gap for the exit of that corner. This time he didn’t, and I had to go wide. It’s a shame.”Charles Leclerc comes in second – and within five seconds – as it’s announced that the stewards are looking at the moment he lost the lead. Valtteri Bottas is third, Vettel fourth, Hamilton in fifth.What a comeback. What a win. What a race. Formula One, boring? Do me a favour.Lap 70: Leclerc is furious over the team radio, having been shunted off the track in that exchange – but it looked a fair racing incident. He was defeated by Verstappen’s extraordinary force of will. Further down the field, Vettel has overtaken Hamilton to go fourth!Lap 69: VERSTAPPEN TAKES THE LEAD!!! Another DRS surge from Verstappen as he comes through on the inside of the Ferrari. There’s a bump of wheels, and Leclerc runs wide – and the Red Bull has the lead. Incredible scenes...Lap 68: They’re wheel to wheel! Verstappen tries to lunge down the outside, and sparks are flying as the two come together! They’re neck and neck, but Leclerc holds him off. Verstappen deploys DRS – surely this is it – but Leclerc holds him off again! What drama!Lap 67 of 71: Five laps to go, and the leaders pass Gasly. Verstappen is right on Leclerc’s tail now, with the Ferrari having to close the door twice in that tricky opening run of turns. Verstappen will get another chance...Lap 66 of 71: Leclerc needs to get past Gasly, with the gap close to a second! “Verstappen behind, one second” warns the Ferrari radio. “Leave me alone” is the terse reply."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc634ea899657836e4262e3d79932c7b2220c45c/0_252_5017_3010/master/5017.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=954776e59b914d039e09f076cb2aed3f","title":"the deep blue sea review rattigan nancy carroll minerva chichester","story":"Minerva, Chichester Nancy Carroll is magnificent as a woman shamed by a failed affair with a younger man, in a play that seethes with postwar English angerTwo critics, a Young Turk and an Old Hack, emerge from a performance of Terence Rattigan’s 1952 play. On the journey home, they fall into eager debate.Young Turk: What an amazing play! I never knew old man Rattigan had so much blood in him. But you’re probably fed up with seeing this piece by now? Old Hack: Not at all. I think it’s Rattigan’s profoundest exploration of one of his favourite themes: the inequality of passion. After all it shows a woman, Hester Collyer, driven to suicidal desperation by the inability of her lover, Freddie Page, to fulfil her emotional and sexual needs. It says a lot about postwar England while offering a timeless study of the human heart.YT: That’s what I loved about Paul Foster’s production. I’d expected something a bit tight-lipped and restrained like Brief Encounter. But Hester and Freddie really go at it hammer and tongs. Freddie, who has had a good war but can’t adjust to the postwar world, reminded me of the heroine of David Hare’s Plenty, and Hester even prefigures John Osborne’s Jimmy Porter in her need for a partner who can match her fire.OH: All true. But this is also a play about a very English kind of male inhibition which is perfectly exemplified by Hester’s High Court judge husband, Sir William, who pleads with her to return. His tragedy is that he is a victim of his class in the way he equates love with social convention, but Gerald Kyd is encouraged to play him with such table-thumping ferocity that you’re almost surprised Hester doesn’t go back to him.YT: You’re dead wrong. The production’s whole point is that all these characters have a hidden fury. That’s true of Hadley Fraser’s Freddie, who is not just some cheery ex-RAF chappie but a man whose sense of failure drives him to drink and who is the play’s real victim in that he goes off to almost certain death.OH: Fair enough. But did the actors have to shout so much? Perhaps we can agree about Nancy Carroll’s Hester. At times, she looked at Freddie with the tender gaze of the hopelessly smitten: at other times, as when she swept a bottle of whiskey off the table, she seemed to pulsate with rage. I liked her best, however, when she was at her quietest, as in the the scenes with the struck-off doctor – beautifully played by Matthew Cottle – where she perfectly caught Hester’s sense of shame and despair.YT: I thought she was magnificent all through. She conveyed Hester’s hysteria but there were also subtle touches such as the way she carefully packed in Freddie’s luggage the two things that mattered most to him: a mounted cricket-ball and a copy of Wisden! OH: That was good. But I still feel in Rattigan there is a tension between the power of the emotion and the means of expression which I only truly felt in the desolate final moments.YT: That’s a cliched vision of how Rattigan should be played. I loved this production because it was about two incompatible souls trapped in an impossible situation. I’d unhesitatingly give it five stars.OH: I’d give it three.YT: Shall we agree to split the difference? • At the Minerva, Chichester, until 27 July.

Her latest book, Race After Technology, looks at how the design of technology can be discriminatory.Where did the motivation to write this book come from? It seems like we’re looking to outsource decisions to technology, on the assumption that it’s going to make better decisions than us. We’re seeing this in almost every arena – healthcare, education, employment, finance – and it’s hard to find a context which it hasn’t penetrated.Something which really sparked my interest was a series of headlines and articles I saw which were all about a phenomenon dubbed “racist robots”. Then, as time went on, these articles and headlines became less surprised, and they started to say, of course, the robots are racist because they’re designed in a society with these biases.The idea that software can have prejudice embedded in it is known as algorithmic bias – how does it amplify prejudice? Many of these automated systems are trying to identify and predict risk. So we have to look at how risk was assessed historically – whether a bank would extend a loan to someone, or if a judge would give someone a certain sentence. The decisions of the past are the input for how we teach software to make those decisions in the future. If we live in a society where police profile black and Latinx people, that affects the police data on who is likely to be a criminal. So you’ll have these communities overrepresented in the data sets, which are then used to train algorithms to look for future crimes, or predict who’s seen to be higher risk and lower risk.Are there other areas of society – such as housing or finance – where the use of automated systems has resulted in biased outcomes? Policing and the courts are getting a lot of attention, as they should. But there are other areas too, such as Amazon’s own hiring algorithms, which discriminated against women applicants, even though gender wasn’t listed on those résumés. The training set used data about who already worked at Amazon. Sometimes, the more intelligent machine learning becomes, the more discriminatory it can be – so in that case, it was able to pick up gender cues based on other aspects of those résumés, like their previous education or their experience.In your book, you assert that the treatment of black communities is an indication of what’s to come for other communities more generally. How would you say this extends to technology? Thinking about how risk is racialised is one way into understanding how those systems can eventually be deployed against many more people, not just the initial target. This is one of the things we can see with these new digital scoring systems – these companies which don’t just look at your personal riskiness, but also your social media and the people you’re connected with. If someone you know has defaulted on a loan, that can affect you. So actually, incorporating and gathering more data can be even more harmful to people’s lives.What role can legislation or regulation play in changing this direction? I’m personally a little sceptical – the passing of a law can be a placeholder for much more significant progress because people prematurely celebrate, even if not much changes. But I do increasingly think that legislation has a role to play. Even if a particular law is just a regulation in a state, or one country in Europe, it can be very effective because if these companies want to roll out technologies universally, and then they find they have to change something up for a certain jurisdiction, it can then be an obstacle. Other elements, like state-level protections for whistleblowers are vital, because there has been retaliation against workers at these tech companies. Home DNA testing kits are increasingly popular, and genomics screening is more commonplace too. Are you concerned about how technologies are being used, and weaponised? We did an informal audit of three DNA testing companies when I was a postdoc at UCLA. The results we got back were completely different across the three companies, because of their own reference data. These companies have access to our data, which they can buy and sell to other companies, and there’s really very few regulatory safeguards on how this is going to be used. The similarity between those technologies – the DNA testing kits, artificial intelligence, machine learning – is that the reference data shapes so much of the prediction. We have to question how it’s put together, what iniduals are being used as reference points.How aware do you think people are of issues around algorithmic bias, or automated systems? Since I started working on this book, a little over two years ago, I have seen a dramatic shift in the tone of the conversation around technology. Part of that has been spurred on by Facebook and Cambridge Analytica and the US election. More and more people are realising that this idea of big tech coming to save us, it’s really been dismantled. Part of it is shifting from a kind of paranoia around technology to what my activist colleagues like to say: from paranoia to power.Could a more erse workforce in Silicon Valley potentially provide a solution to these problems? More ersity in Silicon Valley is important, but won’t automatically address algorithmic bias. Unless all those erse people are empowered to challenge discriminatory design processes, ersity is a ruse. We need a complete overhaul of the larger accountability structures that shape tech development, and we definitely can’t wait for Silicon Valley to become more erse before implementing much stronger regulation and accountability.• Race After Technology by Ruha Benjamin is published by Polity Press (£14.99).

Pachystruthio dmanisensis is believed to be from a family of prehistoric birds with powerful legs and large beaks, present across North America, Asia and Europe. The gigantic creature could grow to 3.5 metres in height and weigh about 450kg. By contrast, the ostrich is the largest living flightless bird and can reach 2.7 metres and weigh 150kg. The exact reason for Pachystruthio’s extinction is unknown, though it may have been due to some of the deadliest predators of the last ice age.Glyptodon was a genus of a supersize, distant relative of today’s armadillos. They lived in North and South America between 5.3m and 12,000 years ago and were encased from head to tail in a thick protective shell. Evidence suggests they were driven to extinction by a combination of climate change and hunting, as humans used their shells for shelters.This enormous bear lived in North America between 2m and 11,000 years ago. Despite its name, it did not have a particularly short face – it just seems small in comparison to its giant limbs. Its long legs enabled it to run at speeds of up to 40mph to hunt down its prey, which included wild horses. The bear would have been roughly 3.3 metres tall on its hind legs and weighed between 700 and 800kg. Competition from other species, including humans, is thought to have played a part in its disappearance.Remains of mammoths have been found on all continents except Australia and South America. The woolly mammoth is the best-known of the species, and evidence suggests that small populations survived in North America until approximately 10,500 to 7,600 years ago. They could grow up to 4 metres in height and weigh 6,000kg. Extensive hunting by humans and a lack of genetic ersity pushed this relative of the elephant to extinction.Thought to be the largest shark that ever lived, its remains have been found on every continent except Antarctica. Megalodon lived between 23m and 2.6m years ago. It grew up to 18 metres in length (the largest recorded great white shark is 6.1 metres). It was originally thought Megalodon died out because of falling sea temperatures linked to climate change. However, research conducted in 2016 has led scientists to conclude that the evolution of the food chain and increased competition may have been the primary factors in its extinction."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cca2aaefeaa32e528c3af25796d8d44fed1af64d/1741_1104_5480_3289/master/5480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63508fbf87c4f8b900c8257dc923fbed","title":"me and my dad inspiration indifference and pride","story":"Absurdist, dogged, overtly Scottish ... our fathers come in many flavours. Three creatives explain how their old man has inspired them throughout their livesThere are few experiences more bonding than sharing a drink with your dad. Over a glass, or two, of Tobermory 12 Year Old whisky, a writer, photographer and magazine journalist, give a frank glimpse into their relationships with the men who raised themWhen I first told my dad about the subject of this piece, how his creativity has inspired my writing, he responded with the traditional Druker facial expression (somewhere between a sneer and a shrug).“Pheh,” he said. “It doesn’t even inspire me.”It’s taken us a long while to get to this point, sat across a table from each other, talking like a pair of adults. Mostly over coffee. Occasionally something stronger.My dad has a huge personality, but he’s not a big drinker. Two wine gums and a glass of water and he’s pissed, he says. I used to drink a bit too much. Now we meet somewhere in the middle. We used to be too different, too much the same to do this. We had rows, we didn’t get on. But times change. Times change people. And now we have moments.My dad retired around the time I was stumbling into adulthood. After a life of work and activism, he took up creative pursuits, playing in bands and DJing world music, funk and jump blues, expanding on his lifelong passion for music. As funny as he is, he takes it all very seriously.I notice the ways I’m like him, now. And the ways I want to be like him. He’s probably the funniest person I know. Cutting, absurdist and lightning quick. He’s got a sharp reply before you’ve finished talking. And when chatter falls to quiet, he’ll point strangers out, invent stories about them, tell me who they’ve just had a row with.He’s also a walking encyclopedia for film, music and literature. Pick out an old soul single and he’ll tell you who played bass on the B-side.His morality is like a lodestone to me. My understanding of the world was forged by anti-apartheid fundraisers, picket lines and marches before I could walk, and it’s informed by him to this day.It’s only now, as I pick it all apart, I realise how much of him is in everything I write. Sometimes behind the words on the page or the mouths of characters. Sometimes just kibitzing in my ear, telling me to lighten up and try putting a joke in for once.So now we have fleeting moments of connection I treasure. Something he never got to do with his dad. Something that will always be with me.He can also be a bit of a putz, to be fair.My dad and I haven’t always gotten on, with my stubborn teenage behaviour and his old-fashioned views. But as my mum doesn’t really drink, my dad had someone to share a tipple with when I started drinking. Even now when I go home he jokingly asks when I’m moving back to be his drinking buddy. We found out about one another’s likes, pet peeves and favourite drinks (mine: tequila, his: whisky). I got to know about his fascinating life and him as a person, rather than just my dad. You think you would know these things about your parent, but over a drink, this authority figure fades and a friend emerges.Being someone who studied fashion and has always been obsessed with clothes, we often find ourselves chatting about the topic. You’d never know to look at him in his home-knitted vests, but my 76-year-old dad was quite the fashionista back in the day! He showed me his old Dior suits, bought with his first paychecks, and that ignited my interest in vintage fashion – which was a step outside of all my high-fashion magazines. I make my own clothes as much as possible, and when video-calling my seamstress of a mum for help, my dad is often in the background ready to pipe in with some advice – a longer hem, more fitted, a different button – and I hate to admit it, but a lot of the time he’s spot on.I know every child says this, but my dad is one of the best cooks on this earth (owning a successful takeaway for 20 years might have something to do with it). But one thing that’s certain to come up when we meet up is talk about food. I’m always bugging him about how he made a dish while I ply him with a drink, hoping for him to spill his secrets. As someone who could only boil pasta when I left home, I now make dishes from around the world. My love for cooking and fascination for flavours is down to him.I’m now an entertainment journalist at a leading women’s magazine. He may not know the people I write about in my job, but he’s always been supportive of me and keen to learn more about the industry I’m in. It wasn’t easy to get into, and I know that my perseverance in my career is the same as my dad’s “never quit” work ethic that got him from Hong Kong to the UK in his 20s, and got him his successful business after many less successful ones. And that’s certainly something to say cheers to.My dad, David, inspired my passion for both photography and Scotland – which I’ve had a lifelong love affair with.He’s Scottish, in fact he’s very Scottish – he’d play the bagpipes at my school and my two brothers and I would often wear kilts – but his work as a doctor meant I was born and raised in the East Midlands, which is billiard table flatness.When we would visit my granny in Forres as a kid my brain would be absolutely fried by the beauty of the place, I just always had an affinity and always felt Scottish – although when I moved there when I was 18 I was constantly and very much reminded that I wasn’t!My parents enrolled me at the Findhorn Foundation in Forres, which is a spiritual community, where I did something called the Youth Programme, which enabled me to develop my photography and led to my career, and had me moving back to Scotland as soon as I could.Dad loves my work and is so proud. He was an amateur photographer and had a dark room at our home, and I used his Rolleiflex as my first camera I’ve been lucky to have a dad who is so supportive.My two brothers are very academic, and obviously my dad is too, being a doctor – plus my grandparents were doctors, so I had a lot of pressure to “do something”. I’m dyslexic, and at school I just wasn’t academic, so photography really opened up so much.The Isle of Mull is both one of my and my dad’s favourite places in Scotland, and I love exploring every nook and cranny with my camera. It’s incredible and erse, a bit like a mini Scotland in one. It’s mountainous and moory and it has breathtaking beaches.It’s wild but it’s got towns like Tobermory where there’s theatre, and there’s a real sense of community about it, yet it still has this complete remoteness, which is what I love most about it.And of course, there’s the distillery in Tobermory. The whisky somehow manages to taste like Mull by encapsulating its myriad qualities. It’s beautiful, peaty and completely an island whisky.To learn more about the art of the Hebridean distillers visit tobermorydistillery"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/302c4a047d933c2c8af3aad518dc50c3a1252bf1/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b66a0c0d0e1b9e75d5157eb41682e6f8","title":"walking paddling river ticino italy lake maggiore tim parks","story":"South of Lake Maggiore, the Ticino offers picturesque towns, the odd secret bar and even an open-air pool. Perfect for exploring on foot and by canoeLet me take you down my home river, the Ticino. The Italian Ticino, that is, just 30 minutes from Milan by car or train (most of the towns mentioned here are on train lines from Milan).It’s a supremely protean creature, rising in the Swiss Alps, plunging and rushing its rocky way (much-loved by kayakers) down to Lake Maggiore, where it sneaks into Italy under cover of the lake to reappear in altogether more placid form at the picturesque town of Sesto Calende. That’s where we’re going to start our trip. Ahead of us are about 60 glorious miles south to Pavia, where the Ticino surrenders its glacial waters to the more majestic Po, Venice-bound.So why all the enthusiasm? For about 30 miles, despite its proximity to half a dozen ancient towns, this river has been left absolutely to its own meandering devices. Declared a parco naturale in 1974, it wanders here and there, shifting its course every season, over white shale banks through woods of elm and willow, tangles of honeysuckle and hawthorn, nettles and bulrushes, blackberries and wild strawberries. If you crave the utterly and amiably natural, this is paradise.Not at first. Walking south from Sesto Calende, the river is no more than ordinarily adorable, a wide expanse of transparent water between wooded slopes, neatly embanked to allow picturesque villas to prick your envy and waterside restaurants to offer generous fry-ups of pesciolini e rane, little fish and frogs.The water is being made to behave by a dam. It appears at Panperduto (lost bread), six miles south of Sesto Calende, a place where barges heading down from Lake Maggiore to Milan once risked tipping in rapids and losing their loads. Here an elegant 19th-century structure of 20 and more narrow arches stretches out across the river, its sluices channelling off water into the first of many canals for transportation and irrigation. Visitors can explore a museum to see how it all works, lounge on the deckchairs provided, or even spend a night in the attached B\u0026ampB (doubles from €80). Meanwhile, having surrendered some volume to human enterprise, the rest of the river is now free to wander where it will, eroding here, silting up there, forgetting itself in shady backwaters, tipping and murmuring this way and that round pebble banks or thick mounds of reeds and flowering robinia.When the water swells with the spring snowmelt it uproots whole trees and carries them off. Many end up trapped mid-river, forlorn branches swaying in the stream, perfect perching places for herons and cormorants. The air is alive with birds of every kind. Swans, ducks and moorhens brood on their nests. Kestrels circle above. Elegant egrets prod the shallows with their sharp beaks. Kingfishers flit and woodpeckers make themselves heard in the trees. Standing still in the dense undergrowth at the waterside, you’ll be hard put to distinguish all the different chirrups and trills, cooing and warbles. Not to mention the steady insect hum that pulses in the summer air.But how to savour all this, to really be there in the midst of it? The simplest solution is walking. The E1, the European long-distance path that starts at the icy tip of Norway and stretches all the way to Sicily, runs as near to the Ticino as it can and doubles up as a cycle path. Local websites (parcoticino.eguide.it and ente.parcoticino.it) suggest excursions and have maps. OK, they sometimes refer to tracks the river may have swallowed up a decade ago, but take it as a challenge! We’re talking ambling and curiosity here, not forced marches. Follow a quiet track to its end and often enough you’ll find some humble no-profit development where locals are enjoying a glass of wine under battered sunshades, perhaps bathing or fishing or simply soaking up the busy hush of it all.But my favourite stretch of the Ticino is the 14 miles between Vigevano and Ponte delle Chiatte near Bereguardo. And my favourite method of transport is the canoe. You don’t have to be an experienced paddler there are no rapids here. The river is broad and shallow, gliding gently over bright pebbles. Countless pools, islands and water-lillied backwaters offer themselves to your curiosity. There are no buildings visible, no roads, no bridges. From time to time you may come across a family barbecuing on the shore, children swimming, a nudist with a dog, a small motorboat chugging up from Pavia. Otherwise, nothing but water, woods and birds, until, at Ponte delle Chiatte (a tiny road rumbling across a dozen moored barges) there’s the surprise of an open-air swimming pool on the right bank and the friendly Bar del Ponte on the left.Despite a few moments when the insects become a bit annoying, it’s really hard to imagine a better day out. • For information about local canoeing (taking your own boat), check out ckfiumi.net.

Five miles away, off the coast of Fife, 42,000 expectant mothers each sit on a single, precious egg in underground burrows while their mates keep watch for prowling gulls. Puffin-nesting season is in full swing.On a calm day, it is possible to spot dolphins and even humpback and minke whales en route to the island. Not this particular morning, though. The sea is rough and sick bags are passed around with a jocular “No 5p charge today!” Even so, the feeling of anticipation is palpable – and not just among our motley crew. Approaching the island, the sound of squawking seabirds is reaching fever pitch. Visiting gannets (wing 6ft) from their home on Bass Rock waft overhead and bespectacled guillemots in their trademark dinner jackets stand cheek to cheek on the tiered, white guano-splattered cliffs, like a gathering of miniature grooms atop a wedding cake.As we land, thousands of Arctic terns, darting this way and that, exchange excited chatter. They arrived just a couple of days ago. Arctic terns fly to the southern oceans in late summer after breeding. Some will reach the edge of Antarctica before returning north to their breeding grounds. Birds from Greenland have been found to make journeys of up to 50,000 miles a year.My own journey had been somewhat less taxing, aboard one of the Caledonian Sleeper’s club carriages. With double beds and tiny en suite bathrooms complete with showers, it’s as close to a hotel on tracks as you can get – and now even introverts can enjoy a nightcap in the bar’s new single seating area. Eastern Scotland is enjoying a tourist boom at the moment, thanks partly to Dundee’s new V\u0026ampA, and while it manages to escape the coach tours that often clog up the roads on the west coast, there are many other reasons to visit.For fans of the puffin, the Isle of May is one of the best places in the UK to see them. Puffins mate for life and always return to the same nest, where they will raise just one charmingly named puffling a year. How they locate their nest year after year is mind-boggling – maybe that accounts for the anxious looks on their faces. They find a life partner at the age of five and can live well into their 30s, which means they are more successful at relationships than most human couples. Designated paths lead visitors all over the isle, a sort of mini Jurassic Park alive with rabbits, eider ducks and, on rocky outcrops around every corner, its rainbow beak pointing into the prevailing wind, the inimitable puffin – a bird unparalleled in its ability to cheer a weary soul.A few miles north-west from the East Neuk of Fife I take the road to Dunkeld, gateway to highland Perthshire and home to a large population of red squirrels. I had seen them in Dundee’s Camperdown Park as a child, but more recently I’d managed no more than a brief, tantalising glimpse of the last few centimetres of ginger fluff as they scampered behind the trees. I booked in at the Dunkeld House Hotel in 113 hectares (280 acres) of Perthshire countryside with the River Tay at its feet. Not far from here is Loch of the Lowes, a Scottish Wildlife Trust nature reserve that I’d been assured can pretty much guarantee a sighting. In fact, the guy at the visitor centre told me that (gasp) he’d never actually seen a grey.For the sake of future generations of reds, grey squirrels are sometimes culled. Like harlequin ladybirds, they are annihilating our native species. Anyone who remembers Squirrel Nutkin or streetwise Tufty won’t have much sympathy. But there are less sentimental reasons for defending the red squirrel: only 140,000 are left in the UK, from an original population of 3.5m.As if on cue, minutes after I arrive, Tufty alights on a bird-proof squirrel feeder, curls himself neatly into the small arbour on the front and reaches inside the Perspex box for a liberal helping of peanuts. A mandarin duck watches from the tray of a nearby bird table, which creaks under its weight. Woodpeckers come and go, yellowhammers and siskins pop by for a snack. I am sitting behind a large window as the woodland scene from Disney’s Sleeping Beauty comes to life before my eyes.The record of four red squirrels in one sitting is equalled on the day I visit, the plump rodents gamely climbing trees and scrambling across ropes, never too far from their appreciative audience. And as I leave the lochside I nearly run over another one. They really should learn how to cross the road.With two elusive native species ticked off the list, it’s tempting to seek out more. The nearest place to look is the Angus Glens, which reach into the Cairngorms like the outstretched fingers of a hand. I head for Glen Clova Hotel, its white lodge and surrounding cottages and chalets a welcoming sight at the end of a long, winding road 13 miles from Kirriemuir, the nearest town. It’s a stone’s throw from the Balmoral estate, and I’d heard that along with red deer, birds of prey, pine martens and wildcats, you can sometimes spot Her Majesty in the royal Land Rover. Undulating fluorescent green fields and valleys fashioned into wide U-shapes by the ice age stretch out as far as the eye can see, dotted with rusty bracken and bluebells, vast skies overhead. In other words, perfect raptor country. Could this part of north-east Scotland, less than an hour’s drive from Dundee, rustle up a golden eagle?It was a question I pondered for rather longer than intended – long enough, in fact, to miss a sighting of two golden eagles just down the road at Corrie Fee nature reserve. By then I’d stumbled across something far rarer in Scotland: an opportunity for an outdoor dip without the accompanying threat of hypothermia. Who could turn down the joy of an unexpected hot tub at Glen Clova with a panorama of mountains for a backdrop, a single malt and the promise of “Kentucky fried pheasant” for dinner? The golden eagles could wait till next time, and the wildcats, too. You can have too much of a good thing. The Caledonian Sleeper runs between Inverness, Aberdeen and London.

Booker performed strongly in the first debate this week and is at the rear of the leading pack. On Sunday he was answering a question about a contentious exchange between Biden and California senator Kamala Harris at the second debate in Miami.Harris interjected during a discussion of race and policing, noting that as the only black candidate on the stage, she should be able to respond. The former prosecutor then focused on Biden, slamming his record on race.Campaigning recently, Biden warmly recalled his working relationship with segregationist senators. Opponents pressed him to apologize, but he refused.“I do not believe you are a racist,” Harris said on the debate stage, as she looked directly at President Barack Obama’s second-in-command. “But … it is personal. And it was actually hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country.”Harris also accused Biden – who early in his long political career opposed the federally mandated bussing of students as a way to integrate schools – of propping up policies that would have kept minority students like herself out of majority white districts.“There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bussed to school every day,” Harris said. “And that little girl was me.”Visibly upset, Biden said “that is a mischaracterization of my position across the board. I did not praise racists.

In fact, and I’ve heard this from people across the country, he’s causing a lot of frustration and even pain with his words.”Another candidate, Julián Castro, also weighed in, when asked if he thought Harris’s criticism was “relevant”.“Oh, of course,” the former San Antonio mayor and US housing secretary told NBC. “I think it’s relevant. I think the record of all of the candidates that are running, including Vice-President Biden’s record, is relevant and his stance on busing is relevant as well.“What I took as his position being that he allowed local communities to make a decision, essentially relying on states’ rights, I think he’s going to have to continue to explain how that was a good position. Because we’ve had a very painful history in this country of trying to desegregate communities.“That pain is still there in this country, and he’s going to have to address that – not only in the debate, but I think going forward.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bd73bfb81c6e1b40681ffe41acfaa9079245e4a/0_142_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=068c11e3bcd0ef224947608647c47c02","title":"bangladeshi doctor rural clinic criticising cricketer mashrafe mortaza","story":"Paediatrician was moved after social media remarks about captain Mashrafe MortazaA top paediatric doctor in Bangladesh has said he was transferred to a remote rural clinic after criticising the country’s cricket captain on social media.Rezaul Karim, a child cancer specialist, was posted to the south-eastern district of Rangamati weeks after criticising Mashrafe Mortaza on Facebook.“I have been transferred to Rangamati medical college, which doesn’t have any cancer treatment facilities. This seems to me an unnatural process,” he said.Mohsin Uddin, a deputy secretary of the country’s health ministry, who signed the transfer order, said it was “only an administrative decision”, and rejected any suggestion it was a punishment.A social media row started after Mortaza, the country’s most popular sportsperson and a member of parliament for the ruling party, visited a state-run hospital in his rural constituency and became infuriated when he found several doctors absent. A video of Mortaza criticising one senior doctor by telephone went viral on social media.Karim said he was one of six doctors served notice by the country’s health ministry after writing a Facebook post criticising Mortaza for “taking pleasure in bowling Bangladeshi doctors”.Two months later he was ordered to Rangamati, where a low-intensity tribal insurgency has simmered for decades.The sudden transfer from a cancer facility in Chittagong, where he was treating more than 100 young patients, has also grabbed local media headlines.The Manabjamin newspaper said the transfer was a consequence of Karim’s “disrespectful” Facebook remark about Mortaza, who is in England taking part in the World Cup.ICC world ranking 7 (as of 6 May)Captain Mashrafe Mortaza, leftCoach Steve Rhodes World Cup best Quarter-final 2015 Fixtures (10.30am unless stated) 2 June v South Africa, The Oval 5 June v New Zealand, The Oval (1.30pm)8 June v England, Cardiff11 June v Sri Lanka, Bristol17 June v West Indies, Taunton20 June v Australia, Trent Bridge24 June v Afghanistan, Southampton2 July v India, Edgbaston5 July v Pakistan, Lord’sMortaza hails from the south-western Narail district, where his charity Narail Express – also the fast bowler’s nickname – has donated ambulances to hospitals and rice seed to farmers.Turning to politics after retirement is not unusual for south Asian cricketers, but Mortaza is still playing, captaining Bangladesh in the one-day format of the game, and intends to continue leading the team after the World Cup."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f82507bb08304fe99bdb21a845dc8a7aeaaf86b/0_93_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae9387be784bc443e36da079611d64e9","title":"eu signs landmark trade deal with vietnam","story":"The European Union has signed a landmark free-trade deal with Vietnam, the first of its kind with a developing country in Asia, paving the way for tariff cuts on almost all goods.The EU has described the deal as “the most ambitious free trade deal ever concluded with a developing country”.The agreement was signed in Hanoi, three-and-a-half years after trade negotiations ended in December 2015.The deal still needs the approval of the European parliament, which is by no means a certainty given some lawmakers’ concerns over Vietnam’s human rights record.Vietnam has one of the region’s fastest-growing economies, backed by robust exports and foreign investment, It has already signed about a dozen free trade pacts, including an 11-country deal to slash tariffs across much of the Asia-Pacific region, known as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific.The EU is Vietnam’s second-largest export market after the US, with main exports including garment and footwear products.

He doesn’t raise taxes and he doesn’t raise spending,” Estévez said. “He’s a left-wing populist on distributive issues, but he’s conservative on social issues.”Like Trump, López Obrador often lambasts the media for hostile criticism, and critical reporters often become the targets of social media pile-ons by the president’s supporters.The president communicates through gestures: he rides in a modest family car, takes commercial flights and drops in unexpectedly to eat at roadside restaurants.“I never met a president before,” said Gregorio Chablé, a Mayan man who snapped a photo of López Obrador lunching a seafood joint in his hometown south of Playa del Carmen. Later that day, he brought his friends and family to a López Obrador rally and slipped the president a thank you note.Chablé was thankful for López Obrador’s programs of stipends for young people, seniors – including his mother – and the disabled. His brother now receives £105 ($133) every two months to care for his daughter Down’s syndrome.But as López Obrador ramps up stipend payments, he has cut social spending and sent the savings to Pemex, the state oil company, according to analysts. He has also pushed a suite of mega-projects, including railways and a massive refinery – starting construction before finishing environmental impact studies and consultations with indigenous peoples.Meanwhile, in response to the violent crime which continues to convulse the country. López Obrador has formed a new militarized police force, but the critics saw peril in handing over public security duties to the military – an institution the Mexican left has long distrusted.“We never imagined the army would take on this role ... or the state would be slimmed so much,” said Emiliano Ruiz Parra, a journalist who covered López Obrador’s first unsuccessful presidential campaign in 2006. “I never imagined López Obrador would pursue these kinds of policies.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa34d23dab9f753e0528baf8a48e65b56e98a1d9/0_152_3427_2056/master/3427.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c3cf3a471c7dc38e3c42e8cd4d30313","title":"tension hong kong eve anniversary china handover","story":"Pro- and anti-government demonstrators rally, with mass protest planned on MondayThousands of pro-government protesters have rallied outside the government headquarters in Hong Kong as tensions rose on the eve of what is expected to be Hong Kong’s fourth mass protest in a month against a controversial extradition law.While top officials attend a ceremony on 1 July every year to mark the anniversary of Hong Kong’s handover of sovereignty from the UK to China, a large anti-government protest also takes place on the same day.A large turnout is expected on Monday, the 22nd anniversary of the handover, as the city is rocked by its biggest political crisis in decades. Millions have taken to the streets to protest against the proposed law allowing for the extradition of iniduals for trial in mainland China, where the opaque court system is controlled by the Communist party.The protests throughout June have been largely peaceful, but on 12 June, the scene turned violent when police used rubber bullets, teargas, pepper spray and batons to disperse crowds and some protesters threw objects back at the police. Protesters have also surrounded the police headquarters twice in past weeks in noisy and emotionally charged protests in which young people spray-painted obscenities on its front wall and barricaded its entrances.Police set up giant water-filled barricades in anticipation of overnight rallies by anti-extradition protesters to lock down the area where the handover anniversary ceremony is to take place.The pro-government protesters – mostly middle-aged and older people arriving on coaches – gathered at Tamar Park outside the Legislative Council and government headquarters from Sunday afternoon. Mostly dressed in blue and white, they waved Chinese national flags and placards with messages supporting the police, who have been under fire for their use of teargas and rubber bullets in anti-extradition protests.Angry exchanges took place on both sides when pro- and anti-government protesters met. “We were completely besieged by thousands of them at one point. They were very emotional – it felt really dangerous,” said an anti-extradition protester who gave his name as Jim.A number of journalists were spat at, had mud slung at them, and were kicked and insulted by protesters who accused them of being sympathetic to earlier anti-extradition protests.A pro-democracy lawmaker, Lam Cheuk-ting, was surrounded by dozens of protesters on a walkway near the legislature, some of whom used umbrellas or placards to assault him and tried to snatch his mobile phone.On early Sunday evening, groups of young anti-extradition protesters, mostly dressed in black, were stopped by police from going near the legislature. Police held their identity cards while ordering them to line up to wait to have their bags searched. Police officers questioned them loudly while taking videos of them and took their personal details before letting them go.Much of the artwork posted on walls near the legislature by anti-extradition protesters was torn down by government supporters as they passed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d47a4fa04efa14390c51140eb945805cff696cc/0_154_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=27492722717b81701c3803305f99cc96","title":"new york pride march stonewall lgbtq live","story":"And, before we close down for the evening, a quick look at festivities in Seattle, which also hosted a Pride parade today.New York’s WorldPride parade organizers say there were 150,000 marchers this year – a record – and that more than 2.5 million gathered to watch the occasion along Fifth Avenue. At least 1,000 joined the smaller Queer Liberation March, according to the New York Post.But the city’s events aren’t over yet: tonight brings a performance by Melissa Etheridge and others, hosted by Margaret Cho, in Times Square. And elsewhere in the city, at Hudson River Park, fans will be treated to a performance by Madonna.San Francisco police took two people into custody following the protest that temporarily halted the Pride parade, according to a police statement:The activists have posted their demands in a letter on Medium condemning police brutality and corporate exploitation:No longer can we sit on the sidelines as SF Pride pretends to celebrate ‘Generations of Resistance’ on the 50th anniversary of the fight against police violence at the Stonewall Inn. We call on the true generations of resistance including the Compton’s Cafeteria riots to stand here today and end this hypocrisy and demand true support and liberation for our communities.Well, the weather that has been threatening Chicago has finally taken its toll: the remainder of the parade has been canceled due to thunderstorms, the AP reported. Still, participants were able to get a few hours in to mark the occasion.Reuters has filed a report on a confrontation at the Stonewall Inn today which, taken as illustrative of tensions within LGBTQ ranks, excited much comment . Here’s a taste:A black transgender woman wanted to be heard, but the white men wanted to celebrate. The scene at New York City’s Stonewall Inn on Saturday, as reported by multiple witnesses on social media, showed how long-simmering tensions between transgender women of color and white gay men have boiled over during the celebration of World Pride and the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising.The unidentified woman wanted to address the crowd inside the Greenwich Village gay bar where patrons fought back against police harassment 50 years ago, birthing the LGBTQ movement. She arrived unannounced and disrupted a drag show, drawing an unfriendly response at first. The crowd eventually warmed and she was given the microphone and spoke for 12 minutes. “She read the names of the black trans women who died. Facts about them. Their obituaries. She called on everyone in the bar to help. I would like to say the audience was respectful, but there was quite a bit of chatter and a few jeers,” witness Aspen Eberhardt, finance manager of the gay rights group PFLAG, wrote on Twitter. For the , Tom Dart has reported extensively from Texas on such murders and the toll they take:Both New York parades have paid their respects at the Stonewall Inn:While New York’s governor takes action against the “gay and trans panic legal defense”, the governor of Illinois, JB Pritzker, has signed an executive order to create a taskforce on trans students’ rights. From the Associated Press: The order also directs the State Board of Education on related issues, including publishing resources on the legal rights of transgender and gender-nonconforming students.The taskforce will be made up of 25 people appointed by Pritzker. They’ll study what schools are doing to promote LGBTQ rights to make sure students have “welcoming” and “inclusive” environments. Their report is due in January 2020.The advocacy group Equality Illinois calls it a positive step, but says stronger statewide protections are needed.Decades before Stonewall, New York was home to a remarkable cultural exchange, as Michael Henry Adams writes for the  today. For black Harlemites visiting Britain, and for Brits visiting Harlem in return, “an LGBTQ identity could sometimes, just sometimes, act like a remarkable passport”. Harlem in the 1920s and 30s was a bohemian destination, drawing the likes of Douglas Byng, Lady Louis Mountbatten, and Cary Grant. But all was not well…Back in New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo marked the day by outlawing the “gay and trans panic legal defense”.Previously, Cuomo’s office said, those accused of violent crimes against LGBTQ people could seek a less severe sentence or even avoid conviction “by placing the blame on a victim’s sexual orientation or gender identity”.“The gay and trans panic defense is essentially a codification of homophobia and transphobia and it is repugnant to our values of equality and inclusion,” Cuomo said in the statement. “This defense strategy isn’t just offensive – it also sends a dangerous message that violence toward LGBTQ people is somehow OK.“It’s not, and today we’re sending this noxious legal tool to the dustbin of history where it belongs.”After a more than half-hour stoppage, the San Francisco parade has begun again.Demonstrators call for an end to policing of the parade (note: this video contains strong language).At least one demonstrator appears to have been arrested in San Francisco, according to the Chronicle, which notes that the parade is facing a backup while protesters join arms through rainbow-colored tubing.Those concerns over police are in the spotlight as demonstrators block parts of the parade route in San Francisco:“We will not rest until we have a pride free from police and toxic corporations that do not support our communities,” says a letter from the demonstrators, noting that policing “upholds white supremacy, hetero-patriarchy, gender binaries and capitalist rule”. They call for the release of trans people held in the SF jail the centering of marginalized black and brown trans women an end to harassment of homeless people and improved accessibility for disabled people, among other concerns.Kamala Harris, California senator and 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful, greeted another prominent California Democrat, Nancy Pelosi, before the parade this morning.“We remember those who marched at Stonewall,” Harris said, according to the San Francisco Examiner. “We remember those who marched on Polk street in the first Pride parade.”It was the Stonewall clash with police that fueled the modern gay rights movement, and the question of policing has loomed large over Pride marches this year.Indya Moore of TV’s Pose, one of the grand marshals of New York’s larger parade, highlighted concerns in a news conference: “I wonder if they’re here to protect us or if they’re here to police us. Maybe to make sure we don’t riot again? I’m not sure.”New York’s smaller Queer Liberation March has rejected NYPD policing, opting instead for its own private security. And yesterday’s Dyke March in San Francisco saw firm opposition to police:They’re just a few examples of a broader backlash, as my colleague Sam Levin writes, noting that some activists are skipping San Francisco Pride over concerns it has been co-opted by police and corporations. “The efforts to remove policing from Pride are really efforts to ensure safety for the communities that are there. It’s a protective act. It’s an act of resistance,” Malkia Devich Cyril told the .And the parade has begun in San Francisco, longtime cradle of LGBTQ activism. Kicking things off are the celebrated Dykes on Bikes, whose roaring motorcycles set the tone for a festive day.Chicago’s Pride celebration is under way despite concerns over weather, with crowds expected to reach one million. Leading the event is Lori Lightfoot, the city’s first openly LGBT mayor.

He told RTÉ there were at least 11 EU countries opposed to the beef aspect of the deal and the Government should be seeking to form alliances with these countries.“We in the IFA will fight tooth and nail against this – we don’t accept it is a done deal... the Minister needs to get to Brussels, meet his counterparts and with his fellow agriculture ministers across Europe, and push back against this deal.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3942026.1561903218!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"farmers have serious beef with eu s landmark mercosur deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWhile the accord makes the EU the first major economy to strike a comprehensive trade deal with Mercosur, it drew furious reaction from farmers  concerned about the potential for a surge in beef imports.

A report by the London School of Economics (LSE) into children’s attitudes towards the internet found they overwhelmingly wanted a ‘grand erasure’ of their online footprint to stop childhood mistakes affecting their future.The research, which was funded by the Information Commissioner\u0027s Office, also found that children were generally trusting of tech companies in the same way they are of their schools.LSE researchers reviewed more than a decade’s worth of studies into children’s understanding of their online data and also conducted focus groups with more than 160 secondary school-age children.Professor Sonia Livingstone, who led the research, said children were generally “outraged” when they learned how much of their personal information is being hoarded online and wanted “a fresh start” when they turned 18.She said: “They say ‘whatever I do before I am 18 should be wiped off’ as it shouldn’t have any effect on them as an adult. They want a kind of grand erasure because they talk about the importance of making mistakes and just being kids trying things out.”The Government is currently looking at a range of new measures to better protect children online including imposing a legal duty of care on tech giants and introducing an Age Appropriate Design Code, which will mean social media giants will have to assume users are children if they can\u0027t age verify them.Duty of Care white paperMost social media companies have a minimum age of 13, but due to the lack of proper age checks the study found children as young as nine said they had profiles.The study found that children generally took instructions they received online on “face value” and often didn’t understand how tech companies were commercially benefiting from the information they handed over. As a result, they found it “puzzling” that internet companies often asked them to give out details they did not see as relevant to the service.The children interviewed were also shocked to learn that material they thought they had deleted could still exist online and wanted “delete to mean delete” when it came to social media.Other features children wanted from tech companies were a way to see which other companies their details had been shared with and “child-friendly mechanisms” to edit their information.Prof Livingstone said the children were generally mystified as to why tech companies were interested in personal information they saw as quickly going out of date as they grew up.She added: “Creepy is a really common word that they use. It’s creepy and sinister that all that data is being kept.”Duty of Care CampaignBeecham House, episode 3, review: Daft, clichéd – and unmissableJeremy Hunt unveils £20bn no deal Brexit \u0026#39war chest\u0026#39 as he turns up heat on Boris Johnson in Tory leadership race Lord Porter says he is backing Boris Johnson for leader because he \u0026#39electrifies\u0026#39 any room he enters NHS opens first ever cannabis clinic as mind-altering \u0026#39skunk\u0026#39 fuels psychosis among usersWimbledon AI robot will examine players\u0026#39 facial expressions to instantly decide best bits of every tennis matchComment: We will prove Vladimir Putin wrong by leaving the EU by October 31Comment: Boris Johnson\u0026#39s Union plan is encouraging but he must keep reassuring Scottish ToriesPrimary school bans all parents from sports day after teachers complained of \u0026#39threatening\u0026#39 behaviourNigel Farage faces questions after unveiling 100 new prospective MPs but refusing to give names   Top Gear, episode 3, review: Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall play wacky races as the show comes back from the deadArchbishop of York ordains his wife in first ceremony of its kindRussian spy ship tracks British-led military exercises in the Baltic SeaHeatwave may force nuclear power shutdown in France as cooling water runs outIstanbul Pride marchers teargassed by police Theresa May could cast deciding vote in appointment of European Commission presidentComment: I fear I will be found wanting by the dictatorial gurus of good tasteWorld\u0026#39s biggest orce settlement will see Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, pay $38 billion to wife, MacKenzieComment: Jeremy Corbyn is very extreme and very dull, and poses no electoral threat to the ToriesEight months pregnant murder victim named as Kelly Mary Fauvrelle, as baby boy fights for his lifeJohn Humphrys drops out of BBC top ten earners in wake of gender pay rowNew Zealand stores face massive fines as draconian ban on plastic bags comes into forceWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/technology/2019/04/21/TELEMMGLPICT000032877532_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqwDgGh3pkom49KxtKngnUa36K9dyKixjq8GqZuuMTIBE.jpeg?imwid","title":"need first amendment internet counter troubling censorship social","story":"The repercussions of companies with an effective monopoly on our news using their position to impose ‘values’ should concern us allFor all its focus on ersity, Silicon Valley is about as ideologically erse as a vegan powwow The advent of modern technology has brought us extraordinary freedoms.

male bastion","story":" Sally-Anne Huang is currently headmistress at James Allen’s Girls’ School in DulwichSt Paul’s School for boys has appointed the first female head in its 500 year history, amid suggestions that it plans to go co-ed in the sixth form. Sally-Anne Huang, who is currently headmistress at James Allen’s Girls’ School in Dulwich, south London, said feels enormously privileged to take up the post of High Master next year.The school, which was founded in 1509 by the Dean of St Paul’s Cathedral to educate boys “from all nacions and countres indifferently”, counts the poet John Milton, the diarist Samuel Pepys and the former Chancellor George Osborne among its alumni.But the appointment of a female High Master will fuel speculation that the school is going to press ahead with plans to admit girls in the sixth form.The west London school, which charges £38,991-a-year in fees for boarders, sent out a survey earlier this year to staff, pupils and parents to gather views on a possible mixed sixth-form.The school wrote to alumni last month to explain that there is a “good deal of evidence” that both boys and girls benefit from mixed schooling in sixth form.It pointed out that “most schools in London are coeducational at that age” and that St Paul’s could offer girls an “unparalleled all-round academic education” which would bring benefits for boys too.The idea is to expand the Eighth Form, and therefore not to reduce the number of boys after 16+, and to target around one third of the Eighth Form as girls: this proportion at 16+ has worked successfully at other schools, the school told its former pupils. Ms Huang will replace Mark Bailey as High Master, who is returning to University of East Anglia as Professor of Later Medieval History. Johnny Robertson, chairman of governors, said: “The St Paul’s governing body takes very seriously its duty to preserve the unique qualities of St Paul’s and to ensure the school has strong leadership. “We are now pleased to have secured the services of an experienced and highly regarded Head and we look forward to welcoming Sally-Anne to the school as the 35th High Master”.Beecham House, episode 3, review:

may force nuclear power shutdown france cooling water","story":"Water shortages may pose problems for nuclear reactorsDrought and overheating of river water may force some of the nuclear power plants that supply two-thirds of France’s electricity to shut down temporarily in the wake of the European heatwave.The extreme temperatures are beginning to abate, but shortages and excessive temperatures of river water needed to cool reactors are worrying EDF, the largely state-owned electricity company.If the hot weather continues, households, offices and factories will require large quantities of electricity for air conditioning and ventilation.River levels have fallen in eastern, central and southern France, the Journal du Dimanche newspaper reported on Sunday. The Civaux nuclear plant is cooled by water from the River Vienne, now close to a historic low following the heatwave.EDF uses two dams to augment the river water, but the local authority has complained that the company uses the river almost exclusively for its power station, jeopardising farming, drinking water supplies, leisure activities and tourism.Residents of areas near the River Loire have made similar criticisms.UK weather and European heatwave brought on by the Sahara bubble, in picturesThe Loire has four nuclear plants on its banks, but the local authority has reported water levels close to the historic lows registered during France’s terrible 2003 heatwave, blamed for 15,000 deaths, mostly elderly people affected by dehydration.Last year, hot weather forced EDF to temporarily shut down three reactors in eastern France, at the Bugey power plant near the Swiss border, at its Saint-Alban plant on the Rhône, and at the Fessenheim plant near the German border.The heatwave has revealed that France is ill-prepared to face extreme temperatures, according to green party leaders. The government is to unveil new measures to manage water resources this week.A record high of 45.9 degrees Celsius was reached in the southern village of Gallargues-le-Montueux, near Montpellier, on Friday. Three swimmers died of “thermic shock” from plunging into cool water, and a cyclist died after collapsing in the heat in the southern Vaucluse département.In Spain, a British mountaineer was airlifted to hospital after suffering heatstroke.The unnamed 48-year-old collapsed in the Western Pyrenees\u0027 Baztan Valley and was taken to hospital in a serious condition.   Beecham House,

by my teacher","story":"However this wasnt an innocent childhood romance - perverted Graham was Rachels -year-old teacher, and he would go on to abuse the teen over three years.In an exclusive interview with Sun Online, Rachel says: You think youre grown up and as a teenager you know everything but you realise you dont and you are still a child.That makes what Graham did worse because its taking away somebodys innocence, and thats what he did to me.Sadly, shes not alone. In the last five years in the UK over  teachers have been struck off as a result of sexual misconduct with students.Groomed and sexually abused, married mum-of-one Rachel, now , kept her personal ordeal secret for  years.Ahead of a new Channel  documentary which airs on Monday called Teacher’s Pet, Rachel, from Wiltshire, has bravely spoken out about the abuse she suffered at the hands of her school’s deputy headteacher...The abuse began when -year-old Rachel was grieving the sudden loss of her -year-old father after an epileptic seizure.Graham Wilcock, then , invited year seven student Rachel into his office, offering her a shoulder to cry on.But rather than supporting her in her grief in a professional manner, Rachel says things quickly turned sexual.He kissed me and said ‘You don’t know how to kiss, do you ’, let me teach you and kissed me in a mouth open, adult way,” she says.Initially, Rachel was flattered by the attention, and began going to his classroom after school and spending hours in his company.“I felt special… but part of me knew it was wrong even then and I didn’t tell anyone. I wanted to almost show off to a friend but I kept it a secret,” she says.When Rachel was , Wilcock lured her to his home for sex while his we was out at work.“He totally took away my innocence,” Rachel says. “The notion of a male teacher inviting a pupil to his house sounds incredibly suspicious in today’s society, but during the Eighties no one gave much thought to predatory paedophiles.The abuse - which lasted for three years - was also emotional.Wilcock began to berate Rachel’s weight – and she developed an eating disorder.She says: “While privately he would tell me that he loved me, in public he’d bully me - calling me fat and ugly in front of other pupils.By the time she was , Rachel had been sleeping with Graham for three years.Rachel says: I really began to see what was happening between me and Graham was not normal. I just wanted to get away.Finally, when Rachel left school she was finally able to escape his clutches, and went on to lead a normal le, working as a broadcaster.However, a few years later, Rachel saw a post on Facebook that said Graham was now working in a Romanian orphanage.She says: “Someone posted something like: ‘It’s like putting a kid in a candy store’, and it’s only then I realised I wasn’t the only one hed abused.”Battling with the strong emotions that the shock news threw up, Rachel attempted to overdose and take her own le.However, she instantly regretted her decision and was rushed to hospital, spending four days in intensive care.She says: I just thought, Im not going to let him take me down. Hed already screwed up enough of my le, I wasnt going to let [him] ruin the rest of it.Shortly after, Rachel summoned up the courage and reported Wilcock to the police.He came back to the UK and was arrested, before being charged and pleading guilty to six counts of indecent assault.Seeing him in court for the first time in years, Rachel says: “I didn’t recognise the man standing in front of me in court.“I was actually looking at someone  and then my mum pointed at him. I saw he was biting his nails. I was shocked. I remember him having blonde hair, he was good looking, charismatic. It jolted me.He had aged and looked like just the saddest middle-aged man.”Wilcock was sentenced to four years in prison - the maximum allowed under the law at the time the abuse took place - and put on the sex offenders register for le.The judge called the case, deeply distressing.While Rachels case seemingly ended with justice being served, the same cannot be said for all victims of childhood abuse.Writer Graham Cavey, now , who also features on the show, was  when his priest took him under his wing, taking him on special school trips to the local cinema and theatres.Graham says the priest plied Graham with alcohol.He says: “He got me a job working behind a bar illegally when I was . I got drunk and the details become blurry – but he took me back to his home he shared with other priests and that was where he sexually abused me.Afterwards he said one word, ‘Sorry’ before throwing a towel, telling me to clean up before he drove me home.“I felt sick, confused, disembodied – strangely disassociated with what was going on, but I knew something fundamental had shted and things would never be the same again.”Graham feared telling his parents, especially knowing what high esteem they held the priest in.The abuse came to an end when Graham was  and taken on a school trip to Greece where he confronted his abuser.He says: “I repeatedly told him I hated him and that was the end of the sexual abuse. He told me I was evil.”However, the abuse had left its mark and for a period of time he suffered with alcohol addiction and ended up in rehab.He reported the abuse to the church but no legal action was taken.Graham says: He admitted it but responded with it takes two to tango. I was . There was never any acknowledgement from the church or the school. Justice was not served.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Shame on Labourit backs them, and on any Tories who join them.MPs have repeatedly promised to honour Brexit. Yet they reject the only deal on offer and the EU refuses to improve it. No Deal isn’t The Sun’s favoured option, but it IS the logical and inevitable consequence of their game-playing.Grieve hopes instead to stop Brexit . . . by blackmailing his own Government and, sickeningly, holding a gun to the heads of the poor both here and abroad.But No Deal would still be the default. And funding would have to be immediately restored. Grieve is madhe thinks anyone but him and his Remainer friends will be blamed for targeting benefit claimants, OAPs and schools.Their conceit is repugnant. Even Theresa May, normally one to mince her words, calls them “grossly irresponsible”.This Cabinet lacks resolve, but our new one must unite to face down the wreckers. Boris Johnson is right to say there would be no place in his for those unwilling to back No Deal as a last resort.If it means exile for Amber Rudd and her allies, so be it. Voters have had enough of MPs and ministers issuing threatsthey don’t get their way.WE are sick of Theresa May trying to inflict damaging policies on her successor to establish a “legacy” in her last days.Her new milkshake tax must be thrown out. There is no credible case for it.The Government says the fizzy drinks levy “succeeded” because makers cut sugar in their recipes. Rubbish. The sole point was to make people less fat, and it hasn’t. If it’s failed on that, it’s failed.Spreading this folly to milkshakes compounds the stupidity.Voters will flock to a new Tory PM who champions consumer choice and puts nanny state zealots back in their box.It’s a sweet prospect.ONLY leftie class warriors could fail to admire a graduate who sets up a viable company and creates jobs.Entrepreneurs are our economy’s leblood, providing work for millions and putting food on families’ tables.So we welcome Jeremy Hunt’s pledge to wipe out their student debtthey launch a start-up hiring more than ten people for five years.Too few graduates do so.

That’s why we are guaranteeing that under our leadership, Britain will never join a permanent customs union and instead seek to negotiate a comprehensive Canada-style free trade deal.This means Britain will enjoy a fully independent trade policy to compete with the world’s biggest players.It is simply not good enough for a country as productive as ours to hand over its trade policy to the European Union.We intend to leave the EU with optimism and confidence. Britain can walk tall in the world with the lowest corporation taxes to attract business, a £billion boost for our armed forces and a competitive free trade policy.We will have political leadership at the heart of our team from the start of the negotiation with the EU.This will include the best and brightest, like world class negotiator Crawford Falconer. And there will be no need for a Department for Exiting the European Union.So we will fold these resources into a beefed-up Department for International Trade and Digital Enterprise.We want to be a truly Global Britain and this cannot be done on the cheap. We need to be competitive so we will increase our trade footprint overseas by doubling the International Trade department budget.So we must wrap up Brexit as quickly as possible. It’s an urgent priority and that will be our unrelenting focus until it is done.We both voted three times to leave the EU andothers had done the same we would have left by now. We don’t see Brexit as a problem to be solved but as the most amazing opportunity for our country.It is a task which will require confidence, craft, vision and attention to detail. It will require the promotion of some relationships and the resetting of others.And let us make one other thing clear: that team will never include the Labour front bench, which is hell bent on blocking Brexit.There are a few other things about our Brexit plan that readers should know. If we leave without a deal – not an ideal outcome but one that must remain an option – the full £billion orce payment will not be handed over.We will not pay a penny more than is legally required. Anyone who thinks we are going to write a blank cheque to the EU is sorely mistaken. To leave we need an experienced deal maker.Perhaps one who delivered a smooth Olympic Games in . Perhaps a deal maker who delivered £million a week for the NHS after winning a battle with the Treasury. Perhaps a deal maker who is already around the table with European leaders as Foreign Secretary.So today our solemn promise is this: We must be able to demonstrate real progress with the EU by the middle of October. If no agreement is in sight by then we will press ahead with No Deal.No one sensible wants this outcome, butit’s a choice between no Brexit or No Deal then we will never betray the democratic mandate that Brexit won in .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Imagine that!Why the sudden interest in women’s football  I’ve heard more than one person ask.Well, it doesn’t take a genius to spot the cause and effect — put women’s football on to BBC TV and people will not only watch it, they will bloody love watching it, and realise the level of talent possessed by the likes of Ellen White, Lucy Bronze and the rest of the team.It strikes me that exposure and access is the only reason that we as a nation have cared so much less about women’s football than men’s in recent years. In fact, I know this to be true. You know how Maybe you already know this too but just to recap, this isn’t the first time that our nation has fallen in love with women’s football.Cast your minds back a hundred years or so to World War One when any man fit enough to play football had been sent to fight on the front line.Back at home, it turned out that women were completely able to do so much more than stay at home looking after children.In fact they were able to not only take on the men’s jobs — they also took their places on the football field. And people loved watching them.Women’s football was absolutely huge during World War One, drawing crowds of up to , even after the war had ended.These pioneering women managed to achieve phenomenal success and recognition, and they did it at a time when such a thing would have seemed nigh on impossible. They defied society, challenged convention, cocked a snook at tradition and expectation — and changed the mindset of a nation by taking women’s football to unprecedented  heights, all within a couple of years.And they did it because the men were away fighting — and so they were allowed to.And then women’s football here disappeared completely.Why The men came back from the frontline — and they wanted their jobs and their football back.And the women  They were expected to go back to the domestic realm. And, just like that, it turned out  women were no longer considered suitable to be footballers.Apparently, the sport was condemned as “inappropriate for their bodies”. And so began a campaign against women’s football, the sport that had been appreciated by the nation. That culminated on  December , when the FA called on clubs belonging to the association “to refuse the use of their grounds for [women’s] matches”.It would be easy to conclude that they were scared of the competition.With women safely out of the way men could take their rightful place back on the pitch. Incredibly, it was not until after England’s World Cup win in  that women’s football began to be revived.In  the Women’s Football Association was formed, and in  — a full half-century after the ban — the FA allowed its members to host women’s games again.Still, though, until now the attention paid to women’s football has been pretty desultory.But that’s changed, thanks to the Lionesses and to the exposure that women’s football has rightfully  been given. And now finally, after  years, football may be coming home.England’s Lionesses are two games away from winning the World Cup, having shown skill, determination and hard work in the tournament.The way they play out from the back, the way they keep possession, the way they handle themselves under pressure is a real credit to football. The men should take note.I couldn’t be more proud and how fabulous that more than .million tuned in to watch them.To say that I’m excited for the USA game on Tuesday is an understatement.When you’re at boarding school you wear what you’re told, eat what you’re told, go to bed when you’re told. In fact, you spend your le doing what you are told.Yes, sure there is an upside to that – the one thing I craved when I came out of boarding school was independence, and it gave me a survival instinct.But there are lots of downsides, too, which is why I didn’t send my kids to boarding school.Although, on reflection, maybe I should have . . .BREAKING news – the Miss England competition has launched a  make-up free round for the first time.The idea is to support body positivity and natural beauty.For ’s contest,  entrants – including  Bethany Cammack, trolled as a teenage beauty queen –  have been challenged to submit snaps of themselves with no make-up.It is a far cry from traditional Miss England competitions, where most wannabes have been plastered with more make-up than the average Love Island girl. So I suppose, in a way, it is progress.But here’s a more radical thing. Should we  have a Miss England competition at all It’s outdated, old-fashioned and sexist.We should not rate people on their looks but on their character, what they stand for and what they do.No matter how you dress it up, the prize for Miss England goes to the best-looking entrant. With competitions like this still going on, is it any wonder young women are tortured by self-esteem and confidence issues Make-up or no make-up, it is still judging women on how they look  – and pitting them against each other.I didn’t know until now there is  a Mr England competition too, but that is just as bad.Talk about a bitter-sweet level playing field – where men are as obsessed as women about their abs  and whether or not they should be hair-free.WHAT does it say about society when men who beat up women are not jailed  It says that violence against women is often tolerated.Attacks on woman are the most socially tolerated form of violent behaviour.This week a steroid-using, drug abusing body-builder beat up his girlfriend so badly she thought she would die.She was the FIFTH partner this man has assaulted.He was not jailed as the judge  thinks imprisoning a serial domestic abuser would do “no good”.  No good  It would send a signal that it is not OK to beat up women.As this was his fth victim on record, I am sure there will be more, as he has escaped suitable punishment.He should be in jail and the judge removed from office, at the VERY least.IT’S hard not to feel  sickened by the fact Faryal Makhdoom and her boxer husband Amir Khan spent  £, on their daughter’s first birthday party.Faryal, , and Amir, , held the Amazonian-inspired bash earlier this month at the University Of Bolton Stadium – the same place where the couple held their £, engagement party and eldest daughter’s £, second birthday celebration.I’m sorry, but £, for a first birthday party  Where has  their perspective gone Of course everyone wants to throw their child a great birthday party, but a one-year-old won’t even remember the event.Wouldn’t it have been better for Faryal and Amir to have held just a small celebration and put all that money they spent – on something that lasted for just  a day – into a bank account  so that their daughter could eventually put it toward her own flat, or setting up a business when older Sleeping under canvas, even   it is dressed up as a “bell tent”, “eco-pod” or a “VIP yurt”, is my idea of a nightmare.Add to that probably more than , people, a woeful lack of loos, nowhere to hide from the beating sun and nowhere to wash – and it becomes a vision of hell.Yuck.ANYONE  do a massive eye-roll watching footage of Aaliyah, the -year-old Londoner appearing on Channel ’s  Hours In AE Not only was she there because she had just a broken fingernail, she was complaining at having to wait to see a doctor – I guess because the doctors were busy attending to real emergencies.Aaliyah, broken nails were why plasters were invented.You – and your mother, who took you to AE in the first place – need to get real.So do we.

The claim came in a report containing anonymous quotes from civil servants questioning whether Mr Corbyn was physically or mentally ready for No, amid mounting expectation of a snap general election this autumn. Mr Corbyn said it “should be very concerning to all of us’ that civil servants ‘should be briefing a newspaper against an elected politician, against a prospective government”.

Jon Trickett, Labouraposs shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, has written to the Cabinet Secretary and head of the Civil Service, Mark Sedwill, to call for an independent inquiry. In the letter, Mr Trickett describes the report in the Times on Saturday as a totally unwarranted and indeed unconstitutional political intervention with disturbing implications for our democratic system and formally requests a meeting with the Cabinet Secretary to discuss the matter.It comes after one of Jeremy Corbynaposs top allies rubbished as “fake news” claims he had suffered a stroke amid renewed fears for the Labour leaderaposs health.The Unite the union boss hit out at reports the party chief is too frail and physically and mentally unfit to become PM. He told the BBC: “ Jeremy Corbyn is as fit as a fiddle, heaposs one of the strongest iniduals I have ever met.People  years younger canapost keep up with him.” Earlier, Mr Corbyn launched an angry fightback over slurs against his health. Labour has dismissed “categorically untrue” reports the party leader suffered a stroke earlier this year.  The claim came in a report containing anonymous quotes from civil servants questioning whether Mr Corbyn was physically or mentally ready for No, amid mounting expectation of a snap general election this autumn. Mr Corbyn said it “should be very concerning to all of us’ that civil servants ‘should be briefing a newspaper against an elected politician, against a prospective government”. He added: “The Civil Service has to be independent has to be nonpolitical and has to be non-judgmental of the politicians they have a duty to serve.

He was overweight, stuck in a rut and was sick of being a slob. So he and partner Louise decided to join a gym and ditch their unhealthy lestyle for good. Just  weeks later Paul had lost a staggering lb, dropping from st b to st lb. And the whole family have benefited from his health kick now that he insists that they all go out on healthy walks together before the kids are allowed to play on their Xbox.  Floor layer Paul, , from Astley near Wigan explains: “I was sick of being a slob. “I just used to live on fast food. I was always eating on the go -I was hungry I would pull in at a petrol station and grab a chocolate bar and a bag of crisps to keep me going till I got home. “I was just snacking all the time, drinking too much, going out a lot.If the football was on I would get six cans of lager, for no reason other than the football was on telly. I realised that I had to change.”    Paul and Louise, , joined the Ultimate Performance gym in Manchester, where they were given a nutrition plan as well as knuckling down to three tough training sessions each week. Soon they found that their mindset changed - as well as their diet. Out went the fast food, chocolate bars and beers, and instead they were filling up on lean meat, fish and loads of veg. Paul started to see results after just two weeks, which gave him the incentive to keep going.  Paul says: “Being at UP made me realise the type of things I was doing that were making me put on weight.Why get six cans of lager just because the football was on  It massively changed my mindset.” Instead of petrol station fast food and snacks, Paul’s new diet would be steak and veg for breakfast, lean red meat or chicken and veg for lunch, and a prawn stir fry for dinner. And instead of lounging about on the sofa in the evenings and at weekends, Paul, Louise and the kids have become the family fit, going on long walks whenever they can.  Dad of four Paul explains: “We do a lot of walking now as a family.At UP they really make a point of telling you to get your step count up each day - its not just about the exercise you do in the gym. “I try to aim for , steps a day. You don’t realise thatyou lounge round the house at the weekend it can get to pm and you will only have done , steps. “So now I make sure we get out on lots of walks. The kids always say they want to play on the Xbox but they aren’t allowed to go on it unless they’ve been on the walk. “We’ve also bought a dog as well, so that gets us out even more.  Paul says joining the gym has given the whole family a fresh outlook on le - and unless something benefits their health or is making a memory they don’t do it any more. “We’ve got a new house and before we might’ve gone into a furniture shop and bought a £ coffee table.Now we think about what we really need in our lives - we don’t need a £ coffee table, butwe saw a weekend away that cost £ we would go for it as it is making a memory. “The more you think about it that way, it becomes natural to you. We have spent money on doing our garden up so we don’t need to do out as much to socialise - instead we sit in the garden and have our friends round while the kids play.We don’t need to go to the pub any more to socialise and it has saved us money. “It has completely changed our lives.” "},{"url":null,"title":"baby boy delivered after pregnant","story":"NewsBaby born after pregnant mum kned to death is unlikely to survive, says auntThe child was delivered after his mum, Kelly Mary Fauvrelle, was stabbed to death at a home in Thornton Heath, Croydon, on SaturdayShareByAdela Whittingham:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video pregnant-woman-stabbed-death-croydon-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA baby boy delivered by paramedics after his pregnant mum was stabbed to death is unlikely to survive, her aunt has revealed.

Tragically her le was cut short in the early hours of Saturday morning, and now her premature son is desperately fighting for his le. Police have not revealed the child’s gender but Kelly’s aunt says it is a little boy. Speaking from her home in Crystal Palace, south east London, Rosa Fauvrelle said: “It’s my husband’s niece. He’s at the hospital because they are doing a little blessing because they think the baby might not survive. “Everyone’s on edge and everyone’s very short-fused.  “No one knows anything at the moment. We don’t know we really don’t know what happened. “Everybody’s confused. We know they have arrested a couple of people so we are hoping something is going to come out of this. “I personally don’t know who has been arrested but the family are meeting up today and talking and the police might have names. At the moment they say they can’t hand out information. “We just heard on the news today they had arrested two people. “Nobody is communicating with each other. So everybody at the moment is very hysterical. Very tired. “People want answers and we’re just not getting anywhere. I know today they have gone to the hospital as they saidyou want you can bring a priest in.  I think that’s what they are doing. I don’t think the baby is going to make it. I think a decision has to be made on that today. “All Kelly wanted was to be a mum. That’s all she wanted. When she found out she was pregnant I think that really lted her spirits. “She was a sweetheart an absolute sweetheart. The most gentle loving person and being a mum was all she dreamed about. “I don’t know very much about the father of the baby. I donapost know her that well. “We’re all so busy we don’t have time to sit down until something horrible happens. “It’s a little boy.

A -year-old man was arrested on Saturday, June  on suspicion of murder. He was taken to a south London police station where he remains at this time. A -year-old male arrested that same day has been released under investigation pending further enquiries. Forensics teams were still investigating the scene of the murder in Raymead Avenue on Sunday morning. Specialist investigators could be seen swabbing surfaces in an alleyway running along the side of the house while police officers guarded a cordon at the front of the property.

Laura, , was thrown behind bars after she was caught with  Tramadol painkillers at Hurghada Airport. But five months after she was released from the Egyptian jail, Laura has grounded herself. She has refused a luxury trip abroad with her dad and now only travels a few miles on the bus as far as Hull city centre for work. The jailed Brit has been given her job back, working at a clothes shop. But most nights the Brit has been living like a hermit, staying home and spending two hours chatting to her Egyptian lover, Omar Caboo, over the internet.    Laura, who is still madly in love with Omar, had claimed she had taken the banned painkillers to help her lover who had suffered a bad back since a car crash. But after arriving in Egypt the pills were discovered lying at the top of her suitcase and she was thrown behind bars. She was quizzed for days before being jailed on Boxing Day . She was released -months later after a presidential pardon. Retired haulage company boss Neville Plummer, , said: ”She now finds airports terrying places. I doubt she’ll ever set foot in one again.”    From his smart detached Hull home, just a mile from where Laura lives with his ex-we Roberta, Neville added: “I wanted to take her on holiday to Majorca to help her get over her terrible ordeal. “She would have liked to come but said she couldn’t because she couldn’t face setting foot in an airport ever again and would run awayshe ever found herself near one. “She is going to have her first holiday since her release in a few weeks’ time, but she’s only going a few miles up the road to Scarborough with her sister Rachel. “This airport phobia is going to be with her for le, so I can’t see her ever going too far away again. “Shame really, because she was such an independent, adventurous girl before all this happened.” Laura was arrested in October  after arriving for a two week holiday with prescription pills she said here supplied by a work colleague. She was jailed for three years on Boxing Day after a court rejected her claim that the opioid painkillers - illegal in Egypt - were for her Egyptian lover, Omar, . After her release, she told of suffering “horrendous prison conditions.”    She said she was locked up  hours a day in a tiny cockroach-infested cell with  other women prisoners and only a thin blanket to keep her warm. She described it as a “living nightmare” and claims she didn’t deserve to be behind bars because she was just “ignorant” about the law. Neville, who spent £, on legal fees and family travelling expenses to help secure Laura’s release, said his daughter had ed to her old clothes assistant job and was gradually getting her le back on track. He added she was still “very much in love” with Omar and spoke to him for two hours every night on her computer. But he doubted her relationship with resort entertainment manager Omar, who has a we and children in Egypt, would ever be anything more than a long-distance one. “How could it be  She’ll never get on an aeroplane again, and he can’t afford to come over here. I think in time it will just fizzle out.”    The devoted dad had campaigned for her release and taped  episodes of her favourite soap, Emmerdale, for her to watch on her . Laura, arriving back at her mum’s house after work last Friday, said: “I am trying very hard to get on with my le. I don’t want to say much more than that at the moment.” After her release Laura was grilled by Piers Morgan about insisting she was just “ignorant” and hadn’t checked the travel guidance. During the Good Morning Britain appearance she was asked how she got so many tablets from her work colleague. Laura said she “couldn’t wait to see the woman” who gave her the tablets. It is not knownthe pair are back at work together. Piers Morgan asked her: “Where did you get itfrom ” She replied: “I got it from someone I know. She’s just somebody I know from work.” Laura claimed: “I can’t talk about that too much for legal reasons. I can’t wait to see her and ask her where she got them all from. “I am so embarrassed. I didn’t think I had done anything wrong. Omar had a bad back for a while and had been to the doctors. “I wasn’t the most sympathetic person in the world and I thought he had pulled a muscle. I thought I was doing a good deed. “I never asked my friend for Tramadol. She told me she would get me some strong pain relief.” Describing the conditions she was held in, she said: “The prison was horrendous. “Everyone wore white and there were  women to  beds. “There were five toilets in Cairo, for  women. I had to get a shower with a jug over a hole in the floor. “I have witnessed the most horrendous things I’ve ever seen in my le. There were so many low moments. “On my second day I saw two girls get tortured with sticks and I couldn’t understand why I was in a room with these people.” She said that during her time in jail she was taken under the wing of a ft con called Mama Amy. Speaking about why she took the drugs, Laura said: “I knew I had more than one tablet with me, but I had no idea I had . I just didn’t think. “I was so happy walking into the airport, I go to Egypt three times a year. I saw the guy who checks your suitcase, put it on the conveyor and he askedI had medication. “I opened the suitcase and he pulled them out and he said ‘What’s this ’ I thought he was joking when he said I couldn’t have them.” Piers told Laura that some people were not “buying” her story, but she told him: “Don’t ever call me a drug dealer. I’m not a drug dealer.” She added: “People on social media need to speak with people who know me to get the truth.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dad paying 6000 month stop","story":"NewsDad paying £, a month to stop brain tumour from killing himMark Thompson, , from New Quay in Ceredigion, Wales, claims he was told numerous times his symptoms were nothing to worry aboutShareCommentsByThomas DeaconAmber Hicks:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video man-raise--each-month-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA dad repeatedly told his slurred speech and headaches were aposnothing to worry aboutapos is now paying £, a month to stay alive. Mark Thompson, , from New Quay in Ceredigion, Wales, is battling a deadly brain tumour and undergoing pioneering treatment hundreds of miles away in Germany. The treatment, not offered by the NHS, uses his own body to fight off the cancer and in total the  rounds cost £, - £, a month. The -year-old has been crowdfunding to raise the cash so he can travel the  hours by plane, train and bus to Duderstadt in a bid to prolong his le. But is now desperate for more donations as he and his family put their faith in the treatment. Mark told Wales Online: “I would say I have changed. Things I do with the kids, I try and do a lot more than before and I’d say try and treasure every moment but I don’t want to speak like that because I think, I hope, I can beat this and that’s how I have to think - think positively.His symptoms began at the start of , when he started to have a tingling sensation and weakness in his right arm.Over six months, he was having problems with his balance, his vision as well as headaches .At some points he couldnapost even speak. He knew what he wanted to say, but physically couldnapost. It took numerous visits to ious - at times dismissive - doctors and even trips to accident and emergency before he was finally, devastatingly diagnosed with an incurable stage three brain tumour. He was given between three and five years to live. Less than a year and a half after his diagnosis, Mark is still battling the cancer that doctors told him they couldnapost remove.    Speaking at the farm in Llandysul where he spent a large part of his childhood, he said: I was back and forward to the hospital and the doctors, I went to see six people in total. Three times to AE. And every time it was just ‘no it’s nothing’, and then the last one then, basically I told him about the speech and he said I needed another scan and he gave me a leaflet about brain tumours. That was a bit scary in itself. Unbeknown to Mark, his symptoms were being caused by a series of mini-seizures being caused by the tumour. At one point all he could say was the word yes. He continued: On the worst day I couldnapost speak whatsoever. It got to the point where I called  and she [the call handler] asked me where I was and I couldn’t reply. “I knew what I wanted to say but I just couldn’t get it out. It was a little bit terryfying. My only answer to her was ‘yes’ and that was it. On August  last year, Mark underwent the scan - and it became immediately clear what he was facing.    After the scan they basically closed the door behind me and the nurse just threw it straight at me, he said. “The kids and the we, that was what was going through my head.” Just weeks later Mark underwent an operation to remove the tumour. During the intensive operation lasting several hours, surgeons worked to remove the cm by cm growth from the side of his head. For a few hours during the operation, he was awake so doctors could test his speech and recognition to ensure they werenapost removing or damaging areas he needed to keep living a normal le. Tests were carried out on the mass and Mark was diagnosed with a rare anaplastic astrocytoma tumour. Doctors told Mark it was incurable but treatable. He said: I wasn’t very worried about the operation itself, because of how advanced things are now - I was more worried about the samples they had taken to see what we were dealing with. I didn’t imagine, not even close, that this was what I had. But I suppose since they did diagnose me I’ve just got to get on with it, I haven’t got much of a choice. It’s a case of fight it as well as you can.    Although optimistic now, Mark admits that at some points he has felt down. But it was a chance encounter with an elderly man at a treatment centre in Brighton that led to the dadaposs more positive outlook. Mark said: I sort of changed my whole perspective on it when I was in the chemo unit in Brighton and this gentleman came in and he was   and he came in to get his shot of chemo and he was telling his whole story to this woman next to him and I was just overhearing. “He was saying he’d had it in his stomach, hands, skin, everywhere, and he came in really happy, did his shot of chemo and got up and left. “I though wow. He’s not upset or whining about it. He came in, got it done and got up and carried on. “I thought that’s the way I’ve got to be about it - what will be will be. After the operation which removed the tumour, Mark went through  days of radiotherapy and chemotherapy and a four-month course of chemotherapy tablets. Now he is going through a pioneering treatment in Germany which uses his own immune system to treat cancer. Mark said: They sort of multiply the white blood cells to make your immune system a lot stonger.    He is hooked up to two machines, with blood taken out of one arm that has the white blood cells taken from it, with the blood ing through the other arm. It was £, a month to start with because I was going every month, he added. Thankfully because of the most recent scans the doctor felt it would be fine to go every three months. All of the money for the treatment has been raised through crowdfunding and holding events, raising so far around £,. In one event with six-a-side football and live music organised by friend Charles Harvey they raised a staggering £,. Later they raised around £, through a  mile sponsored walk over four days from Aberaeron to Snowdon. Mark said: “It’s been a very tough time, but knowing I’ve got all this support behind me is brilliant, it makes a massive dference and it gives me a lot more strength. “Not just family but friends, in England and in Wales. A week and a half ago he had his latest scan - the shadows once clearly visible in his brain are now seemingly gone. It doesnapost mean he is cured but it does suggest the treatment is working.    Although they always planned to get married, Mark said the diagnosis brought forward his marriage to we Sofia. The pair, who have been together for  years, married in April with several of their friends pitching in to provide the cake, make-up and photography. Mark, who has two children with Sofia, said: “We were planning on getting married at some point, but probably not that quick. The diagnosis did spur it on.“It was brilliant, we actually had good weather in Wales.”Now Mark wants more people to be aware of the symptoms, and encouraged anyone worried to be persistent with their doctors. He said: “The whole tingling on one side of your body is an important symptom to look out for. “Eventually I did have a headache, a but later on about a week before [the diagnosis]. “A lot of people think that’s the first thing but that was right at the end.” “To anyone with these symptoms, I’d say get it checked out as soon as you can. You’ve just got to keep going to the doctors, even every dayyou have to.” Donations to Markaposs crowdfunder can be made  here .

By the end of the third week Paige was told her condition was so serious her baby would need to be delivered early and she was taken from hospital in Cornwall to one in Devon.  She added: I was toldMarleigh was left for another  hours - and hadnapost been born via emergency C-section - both me and him would have died. I was told my body was shutting down and he needed to come out aposnowapos. Marleigh arrived at .pm on Motheraposs Day last year and was whisked straight to neo-natal care. Paige said: I didnapost get to see or hold him. I could only look at pictures that my mum had taken of him. Even when he arrived, the fight wasnapost over as he was so small and sick - you could almost see through his thin skin and he was as long as my hand. The next morning he was a funny dark red and purple colour and looked like he was struggling. It panicked me.  I got to touch him in the first  hours. They said his chance of survival was slim, so they encouraged me to touch him as much as possible. But I still had hope. He was in bubble wrap constantly but they put more layers on him to try and keep him at a good temperature. Fearing they might lose their son, the couple urged relatives to come and say their goodbyes. They were told Marleigh had Pierre Robin sequence, a set of abnormalities affecting the head and face. He spent nine months in Derrord Hospital, Plymouth, winning every battle along the way before being allowed home. During his time on the ward Marleigh underwent eight blood transfusions and suffered two small bleeds on the brain, two hernias, an open duct in his heart and also sepsis. Another complication was Marleighaposs collapsed lungs and unstable airway. The tot was given a tracheostomy tube to help him breathe.  He is now completely dependent on it for air pressure regulation and oxygen. But Paige, of Camborne, Cornwall, said: No matter whataposs been thrown at him, he has always bounced back. He is the happiest baby Iaposve met, he just wants lots of love. Heaposs very determined and because of that heaposs making massive progress with his development. I can honestly say I feel like the proudest mum. He has proved so many people wrong. I will forever tell him how proud I am of him. Heaposs my everything and turned me into a much better person.

Melanie Forrest, , was stunned when her Personal Independence Paymentwas suspended for two months, branding it appalling. DWP bosses have apologised for the mix-up, which happened because of confusion over dates. Melanie spent four days in hospital for a hip replacement. A stay of more than  days halts Pip payments, but DWP officials jumped the gun. Her Employment and Support Allowance was still paid throughout. They have admitted a mistake with the dates and that they owe me about £ or £, which is probably £ now, she said. Itaposs just appalling.    Melanie went into hospital for a hip replacement at the end of April and was discharged after four days. She claims there was a mix-up about the amount of time she spent in hospital. Because the payment had not gone into her account, she said she was not able to pay bills on time. Apparently they thought I was in for  days, said Melanie. The payment just suddenly stopped. They donapost realise that people rely on that money. She added: I used to work for the NHS before I got osteoarthritis. I would love to go back to work in the hospital but I physically canapost do it. The money should have been through on Monday andI hadnapost rung the bank I wouldnapost have known. Now, Iaposm going to have to pay bank charges.    She also claims she spent many hours on the phone trying to sort out her payment. There was a lack of communication, she said. You canapost speak to the same person, they wonapost transfer you to a supervisor or a manager and theyaposre not noting things down. A DWP spokesman said: Ms Forrest has continued to receive her ESA benefit, which is designed to offer a regular income, without interruption. Unfortunately there has been an error with her Pip claim covering additional costs, and we apologise to her for that and will be making a full payment of all arrears due to her. In April , the UK Government introduced Pip as a replacement for disability living allowance.

Convent-educated accountant Blerina Dobla, , pretended to be a male model to dupe the  year-old into sending her a naked shower video and other semi-nude pics. She then posted the images on Instagram and tagged her friends and family. In one post it contained a screen shot the victim had unwittingly sent university graduate Dobla, revealing she had been raped at . The victim says her weight plunged two-and-a-half stone and she contemplated suicide while under the grip of the aposmale modelapos, who tormented her with descriptions including: frigid, boring and pathetic. District Judge Karim Ezzat told her: These images were displayed twice and long enough for others to know. The victim lives with the knowledge these images are out there for all to see. They will be somewhere and have had a signicant impact on the victim.  Dobla, from Richmond, pleaded guilty to sending a communication of an indecent or offensive nature on January , , namely an Instagram video of the victim naked in the shower. She also admitted a similar charge of sending the same shower video to the victimsapos friends and family via Instagram on November , , plus additional images of the young woman in ious states of undress. Dobla received four months imprisonment at Camberwell Green Magistrates Court. Prosecutor Mr Chidi Ikwuakolam told the court: The defendant befriended the complainant who was the new girlfriend of the defendantaposs ex under an alias. A relationship formed during which the complainant sent a number of personal videos of a sexual nature and pictures to the defendant. She says she was persuaded to send them via Snapchat, believing the material would be only visible for a few seconds and could not be saved by the recipient.  The defendant then threatened to disclose these videos and images to the complainantaposs employer and they were posted on Instagram on two separate dates. Dobla, who lives in a £.million house, was traced by police and arrested at work in February, last year and her phone was seized by officers who were also able to investigate her online history. When quizzed by officers Dobla said it was nothing to do with her. She denied the allegations, saying she knew the complainant was someone her on-off boyfriend had seen. In a y victim impact statement she said: Being the survivor of sexual assault, aged sixteen, I thought I was strong, but the person I used to be was taken. I am a shell of the person I once was. This has taken a toll on my physical and mental health with attacks of anxiety and depression. All of my hard work was knocked down for someoneaposs entertainment, publicly displaying images without my consent has been like torture to humiliate me.  At first the control began with having to reply instantly and sending photos of what I was wearing to who I thought was Will Gregor who would decidemy outfit met with his approval. I had to say where I was going and prove where I was by sending pictures and send aposbefore and afterapos pictures of my food because in his words he was aposdisgustedapos with me because of my weight. He would tell me my parents did not care for me like he did and I did my best to avoid what made aposWillapos angry. I stayed in my room at weekends and became a social recluse and I gave up on ever getting out of the vicious circle my le was in. The messages were horrible, tearing apart my looks and personality. I had mentally and physically given up. I began to think it might be my fault and deserved it and was so weak that suicidal thoughts began. Sending the pictures and videos were the result of cruel and manipulative bullying and aposWillapos only seemed satisfied when I sent him a photo. I felt completely ashamed and embarrassed and with no choice as the malicious communication continued andI dissatisfied aposWillapos he threatened to send photos to my friends. Dobla threatened to send the embarrassing images to the womanaposs employers, prompting the victim to reveal all to her bosses. I left my job due to the strain. This whole torment was now effecting my family and career and that evening was the first time I tried to take my own le. I couldnapost see a way out, my le and body were no longer mine and I wanted to let go. There was no way out, I felt trapped andit wasnapost for my love for my family I would have done it. She was at work when the shower video was first published. It came out of the blue and I felt victimised and abused all over again. The fact someone, anywhere in the world could see me in this vulnerable position made me feel physically sick. Iaposll never know how many people will see that video as it was public. I was also shamed and mocked for having been sexually assaulted. The victim moved out of London for six months to recover. I still feel the impact on me and will never be the same girl I was before. Doblaaposs lawyer Emma Goodall said: She deleted the images because she regretted her behaviour and the entire Instagram account was moved from the system. I would ask the court to have a degree of humanity and mercy. District Judge Ezzat said: Her behaviour was well-planned and manipulative over a period of months during which she bullied and coerced these images and published them. The impact on the victim has been devastating and says this has ruined her le. The most telling thing was your client saying she was suffering depression and anxiety once she got caught and was worrying about what would happen to her. One wonders why she did not engage before andthis is part of a manipulative pattern and she still has the images and has the power to exert power and control. Even in the pre-sentence report she puts at armsher responsibility , saying she didnapostapos ask for or solicit the images. Dobla, who attended the Catholic Gumley House Convent School - moto aposVive Ut Vivasapos- founded in  was also made subject to a five-year restraining order prohibiting contact with the victim.

Frazer Spiers, , is concerned his age is preventing him from finding work. He began applying for jobs when he ed from a -year stint living and teaching English in Europe last July. He says he has completed and submitted more than  job applications since November, but has only been invited for four or five interviews. He told Leicestershire Live : As a -year-old man it seems I am not as employable as others but I am determined. I could sit for the rest of my working days on Universal Credit but that is not what I want to do. I want to work but it has been very dficult for me to find employment. The odds are stacked against me. When Iaposm applying for jobs with big national companies there are pictures of staff smiling on their websites, they are never people my age. They are youngsters and people no older than . A lot of the big firms also have rules which meanyou apply and donapost get the job you canapost then apply again for at least  months. Even my work coach said I am flogging a dead horse, so to speak.  Frazer currently works part time for a charity in Melton, Leicestershire. As a result of the hours he works, the amount of Universal Credit he receives alters. He said: Once I started working the amount I received reduced, so while I am better off by a few pounds per month, I am working for that. If you work out what I received without work to what I receive working, it would be pushing to say work pays. Each £ I earn means by Universal Credit reduces by p. While it might add up and be worth it when you work full time, working the hours I do means it reduces my hourly rate signficantly. If Frazer earned the national living wage of £ per hour, he would only receive £. per hour. He added: For a benefit that is meant to encourage work it doesnapost do an awful lot to do that.If it werenapost for my desire to work I could cruise the rest of my working days on Universal Credit but that is not what I am going to nor what I want to do. I might be better off as they put it but with working so few hours it doesnapost amount to a lot. It is a flaw in the system, because I am trying to find work but canapost. A lesser motivated person might be tempted not to work so few hours. I love the work I do at the moment but I really need more hours. Iaposm doing extra whenever Iaposm offered and I can. “I just want to contribute to others and society. I’m not ready to stop working yet. In my mind, I’d be happy to work until I’m . It helps keep me motivated, challenged and stimulated and gives my days structure.”  Frazer spent the last  years teaching English in Europe, including Turkey, Ukraine and most recently Poland. When I came back, I was homeless, jobless and was very fortunate that a friend of mine offered to put me up, he said. I left Poland financially crippled. Education has improved there and there isnapost much need for private English tuition now. I was struggling so made the decision to come home. I wanted to get back to Leicestershire and particularly Melton Mowbray as thataposs where my last UK address was and I have family links to the area. “The crazy thing is that in theory a Polish family who arrived on the exact same flight as me could have walked into a job centre or local council office and been offered help and assistance there and then. “And I’m not saying that that’s wrong, I’m just saying that the same opportunity and support should have been afforded to me too. “Instead I had to live on scraps for three months and rely on the support of a friend who let me stay and literally wait until I could access the system after three months when I was then classed as a habitual resident.” Frazer was supported by the Exaireo Trust in Loughborough to find a flat.  I’ve had some furniture donated from me and support from friends. I have my flat now but it is dficult surviving from month to month he said. “I hoped to be better supported here and find more stable employment.” He also complained about the charges he incurred when enquiring with the HMRC about his tax code, after a mix up when he started work. He said: “It is wicked that a government department can operate a premium rate phone line. “There was no warning when the call was answered and I ended up with a £ phone bill. “Receiving so little in the first place it was a shock to learn I owed so much.” Frazer has since been made aware of an  number.  A DWP spokesman said: “There is no issue at all with Mr Speirs’ benefit claim. Since starting work, he has been better off each month because on top of his wages, he continues to receive Universal Credit, amounting to more money than he would havehe was not working.” She added: “Earnings from work will affect the amount of support people receive, for every pound earned above the threshold payments reduce by only p ensuring it always pays to be in work.” What is Universal Credit  Universal credit is a benefits system that will eventually replace six separate benefits: income support, income-based jobseekeraposs allowance, income-related employment and support allowance, housing benefit, child tax credit, working tax credit. Claimants will get one single payment to cover any and all of these benefits they are entitled to. From this payment they will have to cover their own costs directly, like rent, rather than it being a deducted payment. The system is intended to make claiming benefits easier but has experienced many problems, and been blamed for pushing many people into hardship and poverty.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are said to be planning private baptism for their baby son - unlike William and Kateaposs children who were photographed on the days of their christenings. But one royal biographer says Meghan and Harry canapost have it both ways. The reports come just days after the £.million bill for renovating the coupleaposs Windsor home, Frogmore Cottage , was made public. And that cost could further rise to £million by the time the building work is finished. Penny Junor, who has penned a biography of Prince Harry , branded making the christening private a mistake.    She told the Sunday Times that the couple canapost have it both ways, stating: Either they are totally private, pay for their own house and disappear out of view or play the game the way it is played. And the author added: Many people donapost understand why they are paying nearly £million for Harry and Meghanaposs house, so in terms of public relations it would be a good quid pro quo for the pair to briefly show Archie off. Action group Republic, which calls for the monarchy to be abolished, posted on Twitter after the news broke: They want to raise Archie as a private citizen  Good, that should also mean no taxpayer subsidies. Archie was pictured in a photocall two days after his birth, but has since only been seen in a sepia-tinged picture posted on Instagram on Fatheraposs Day.    A source told the Sunday Times that privacy is more precious to Harry than most other royals, and added: As Archie is not an HRH he feels he has every right to strictly police his sonaposs privacy. In contrast cameras and select members of the public were invited to the christenings of Prince William and Kate Middletonaposs children, George, Charlotte and Louis. Archie will be christened next Saturday at St Georgeaposs Chapel in Windsor - where his parents married last year.

By law all Americans have to pay tax whether they live in the US or not.

She told the Sunday Times : Either they are totally private, pay for their own house and disappear out of view or play the game the way it is played.   Seeing Archie and his godparents arriving at the christening is what people are interested in it isnapost baring your babyaposs soul, just giving the public who love and support them a crumb to enjoy.She added: Many people donapost understand why they are paying nearly £million for Harry and Meghanaposs house, so in terms of public relations it would be a good quid pro quo for the pair to briefly show Archie off. It is a huge blow for fans of the couple who rejoice at every update and picture the couple share of their son.Action group Republic, which calls for the monarchy to be abolished, posted on Twitter after the news broke: They want to raise Archie as a private citizen  Good, that should also mean no taxpayer subsidies. Archie was pictured in a photocall two days after his birth, but has since only been seen in a sepia-tinged picture posted on Instagram on Fatheraposs Day. A source told the Sunday Times that privacy is more precious to Harry than most other royals, and added: As Archie is not an HRH he feels he has every right to strictly police his sonaposs privacy.

Archie will be christened next Saturday at St Georgeaposs Chapel in Windsor - where his parents married last year.

A source claimed some pass­engers complained to crew that they could see Harriet’s nipples, but she said she was wearing nipple covers and tape. She said she covered up with a mate’s jumper but was not allowed back on. Easyjet say she behaved disruptively towards a member of our crew. Harriet told The Sun : “The crew were horrible and made me feel cheap. This air hostess confronted me in front of the whole plane and said I wasn’t allowed on in that top.    “She said to me, ‘Oh no, move to the side,’ and tried to cover me up with my hands. “She said, ‘You’re not coming on my plane like that — you need to put a top on’. “Then she ordered me off the plane, so of course I put a top on. When I tried to get back on she turned to the ground crew and said, ‘She’s not coming on my plane’. Harriet said she was then escorted off the aircraft which left her shocked.

Harriet had to sleep on the floor at Malaga airport with her friend before they flew home the next day after she forked out an extra £ for another flight. Harriet, of Southwold, Suffolk, said she never shows her body off at home but as she was on holiday she felt spontaneous.      EasyJet said: “We can confirm that a passenger travelling from Malaga to Stansted on  June was unable to travel due to behaving disruptively. Following concerns about her clothing crew politely requested that the customer wear an additional top for the flight which the customer agreed to.    However she then proceeded to act disruptively towards a member of our crew. “Our cabin and ground crew are trained to assess all situations and to act quickly and appropriately.

The pair approached the teen and rled through her pockets, Hull Crown Court heard. As the victim resisted she was punched in the head by her attackers. The court was told that the pair thought they could do what they wantedBut their behaviour was labelled thuggish by a judge, HullLive reported.Recorder Ian Harris, QC, told the pair at the crown court on Friday: What you did was bullying, thuggish and insulting. This is an increase in violence and which could have resulted in serious injury.  You have reason to believe you can do what you want and swagger around the streets. But that is not the case.    Prosecutor Neil Coxon said Sargeson had emptied the pockets of the teenage victim and then became aggressive as a -year-old friend of the victim tried to intervene. He said: The best evidence comes from the -year-old friend who saw the event and said that the defendant Sargeson had called the other girls names, like aposs**gapos. She emptied the pockets of the -year-old female victim while saying she had an issue with tobacco. She had been encouraged, according to this witness, by Brittany [Hayward] to do what she did. Recorder Harris said he did not need to hear defence barristers Nigel Clive and Richard Thompson give any mitigation due to the facts being detailed in a pre-sentence report. Hayward, of east Hull, and Sargeson, also of east Hull, both pleaded guilty to using threatening words or behaviour to cause fear or violence. The pair were sentenced to a community order to complete  hours of unpaid work over the next  months and also partake in a ten-day rehabilitation requirement. They were also slapped with a five-year restraining order banning them from contacting the victim.

Were these noises coming from the main road  Were they coming from a park  We put microphones at the front of the house, at the back of the house, inside and out, and in the basement. The device we left in the basement picked up the screaming and other noises. The other devices, which were recording simultaneously at the front and back of the property, picked up nothing at all. The couple sent Wales Online a key to the house, but warned reporters would be entering the property at their own risk. Despite being in a busy town centre, the property is hidden down a narrow and lonely alleway. The street is filled with shops and other commercial properties, bar one empty building next door that is up for sale. The kitchen sits directly above the now sealed-off basement. There is no direct access to the underground space, other than down a small hole with nine feet of darkness below it. Although the journalists left a recording device at the edge of the hole for several hours, the only sound picked up was them leaving the property. However, the Taits  - who recorded inside the walls of the basement, rather than above a hole in its ceiling - are adamant something is going on and have set up a petition to demand authorities investigate further.    They claim police are ignoring their concerns and that this matter needs an urgent, full investigation. Dyfed-Powys Police has confirmed that they have received correspondence from Alan and officers attended the area in November last year. They did not find evidence of wrongdoing. But the Taits believe there are men, women and children living, sleeping and working underneath the house. Alan believes there are quite a lot of people down there and is concerned it could be connected to people trafficking as well as drug manufacturing. The couple refuse toto Ammanford and say they are fearful for their own safety. They would not say where in the UK they currently live and did not want photographs of themselves in the press. Weaposre travelling around the country handing out posters and fliers about what we think is going on, said Alan. We want as many people as possible to know about this so that the police are urged to carry out a more thorough investigation. We donapost want to go back until the matter has been resolved. I think weaposre dealing with a serious criminal gang here, and I think our lives could be in dangerthey knew where we were.

Roman Fedortsov, , spends a lot of his time on fishing trawlers, coming into contact with a wide iety of seale. Mr Fedortsic, from Murmansk, Russia, works as commercial fisherman catching cod, haddock and mackerel - but the bizarre critters pictured below make an appearance too. These aquatic curiosities were mainly found in the Norwegian and Barents seas while some of them came ashore from the Atlantic Ocean. In one image of a mushroom-like orange creature, he wrote: Oh my God! They killed Kenny! in reference to the phrase from South Park about character Kenny that dies in every episode. Breathtaking aerial photographs capture key moments of  from space   In another post he explained that it was a sea anemone. He added: Sea anemonesare predatory invertebrates. They have no skeleton. The supportingof them takes the intestinal cavity.  At the pole of the body is a slit-shaped mouth, surrounded by a nimbus of tentacles. Their tentacles have gills that are poisonous. Although sea anemones are mainly poisonous only for their prey, some species are toxic to humans. There are more than  ieties. They feed on zooplankton, mussels, fish and shrimps. Sea anemones feed on food and excrete waste products through the same hole. aposYouaposre going to need a bigger boatapos: Huge real-le Jaws revealed up close in all its terrying glory   In another post featuring a picture of an angler fish, he wrote: I am very sorry I did not take more pictures of this sea creature to which someone replied: Who needs aliens when you have an entire f****** ocean of them. Roman said he set up his social media accounts to share the pictures with people who otherwise might not get to see them. And while people are fascinated by the images, they have certainly put a lot of people off going near the sea.  One user wrote: Iaposm never swimming in the sea again and another wrote: This is why I do not swim in anything without chlorine.

Especially here, where they have an extensive menu dedicated to them categorised by flavour and even offer “cocktail experiences” for those looking to learn from their mixologists. Our waiter recommended a real fruit mocktail with lots of real crushed fruit and berries and juices to provide a thirst quenching mix without the alcohol .We relaxed into the quiet and sipped our drinks in the sun as we pondered over the vast menu options.The venue’s interior is a mix of classic wooden floors with soft leathers and muted tartans in greys and brown, combining traditional charm with modern comfort. vw, px\"  The menus are bound in heavy leather books, and there was plenty of choice.My other half ordered bruschetta to startwhich, of course, we ended up sharing. Well, I am eating for two!Who knew that three simple slices of toasted bread with oils and tomato could be so delicious  Also, both of us were pretty in awe of the little yellow tomatoes – spot the uncultured pair.I toyed with the idea of my usual steak pie-pick and even deliberated a fish dish, but in the end we both went for the same main course of chicken tikka curryand it was presented beautully.The plate held rice and naan with a small dish of mango chutney and a large dish of gorgeously bright-coloured chicken tikka.The chicken was wonderfully soft and the tikka sauce was full of flavour, not too salty with just a bit of zing. vw, px\"  I’m notoriously soft when it comes to anything spicy, but this was just enough for me and I only needed water for my tingly lips towards the end of finishing the plateful.We were both equally surprised at the portion size from the Caird. Although it felt upmarket, there was no scrimping on the food.I chose the brownie for dessert and my partner the sticky toffee pudding . Again, both platefuls looked almost too good to eat.My dark chocolate brownie was topped with drizzled caramel sauce next to a scoop of vanilla ice cream with sprinkles of crushed chocolate and chocolate sauce. Strawberries and homemade fudge was presented to the side in a design with shards of wafer and small dollops of salted caramel and strawberry mousse. It sounds like a lot of flavours and it was, but in a good way.My partner’s slab of sticky toffee pudding was also teamed with a large scoop of ice cream, crushed chocolate, a large wafer and a couple of raspberries, sprinkled with icing sugar.We both finished the lot.The whole evening was lovely and relaxing. We could hear the live musicians in the bar from where we were seating which provided great listening. The staff were also fantastic, extremely helpful, attentive and polite."},{"url":null,"title":"ayr form led to dundee united making moves for new boy liam smith","story":"New boy Liam Smith is delighted to be one of Dundee United’s summer recruits and suspects previous employers Ayr United were partly responsible for the arrival of some of the men who beat him through the doors at Tannadice by a few months.It was Tangerines gaffer Robbie Neilson’s knowledge of Smith from their time together at Hearts, plus his form for the Honest Men last term that earned the -year-old right-back his move.In fact, such was his form during the first half of last campaign, United made a bid for him in January before having to settle for fixing him up on a pre-contract and getting his services now.And Smith believes Ayr’s surge to the top of the Championship before Christmas prompted increased transfer activity where in the ision.“I think because we had done so well in the first half of the season and Ayr were considered a smaller club, the bigger sides in the ision got a bit of a fright,” he said.“United, Partick and other teams like them saw we were doing well and thought we have to do something about this, so they signed a few players in January.“There was nothing Ayr could do about the players these clubs were signing, they don’t have the budget to compete at that level and I think they can be delighted with where we finished last year and the season we had.”News Smith would be heading for Tannadice once his Ayr contract was up, leaked out just a day or so before the teams were due to meet towards the end of the season.While he would have preferredhis proposed move had been kept under wraps for a little longer, the way things have panned out, he insists it was not a major problem.“It came out the day before we were playing United, that wasn’t ideal but Ian McCall trusted me and knew that I would give my all for Ayr until the end of the season and that’s what I did.“We didn’t meet United in the play-offs, probably thankfully. It would have been a little, maybe slightly, awkward. When the news came out it was near to the end of the season, so all I could do was give my all for Ayr to win.“And it’s not something you even remotely think about it when you’re playing on a Saturday. It’s not in your head, you are just doing your job in the day.”While he’s known for months he was Tannadice-bound, it was only with the start of pre-season training at the beginning of the week that he was able to get down to working with his new team-mates.And already, he admits, he’s been impressed with what he’s seen.With most of the squad that will be used next season already in place, he is confident the quality required to live up to expectations and secure automatic promotion is there.“Just from the first couple of days of training you can see the quality in the squad and the players the manager has to choose from. To be added to that is, obviously, good for myself and, hopefully, I can stay in the team and do well.“I have experience of winning the Championship with St Mirren so I think I’m ready for that challenge of the expectation of winning games and playing in front of a big crowd at Tannadice. I’m confident that I can handle it and I’m sure we’ll be doing all we can to make it happen.”And he’s made it clear that, for all the Championship is a ision he rates highly, he plans to be spending most of his United career operating a step up from it.“I’m ready to challenge myself at a higher level. It would have been greatUnited had gone up last season but % the aim is to win this league.”"},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-the-old-firm-menzies-and-easterhouse-gangs-feature-in-our-look-back","story":"Another selection of photographs from the Herald and Times archive, today spanning the  years between  and ."},{"url":null,"title":"memories-pictures-from-across-glasgow-throughout-the-years","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-old-photographs-of-glasgow-through-the-years","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-do-you-recognise-any-of-these-old-photographs-of-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-do-you-recognise-any-of-these-old-photographs-of-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-how-many-of-these-old-photos-of-glasgow-do-you-remember","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"watch-moment-angus-woman-zoe-archibald-gets-stuck-in-toy-car","story":"THIS is the hilarious moment a Scotswoman got stuck in a childrens toy car - and had to be cut out using a bread kne."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-memories-of-happy-days-gone-by-in-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"the-rocket-man-elton-john-tribute-night-heading-to-kilmarnock","story":"A TRIBUTE night to Sir Elton John is set to hit Kilmarnock."},{"url":null,"title":"jess-glynne-pulls-out-of-trnsmt-festival","story":"Jess Glynne has pulledout of TRNSMT Festival following advice from her vocal surgeon."},{"url":null,"title":"over-4m-of-funding-approved-to-make-glasgow-homes-more-energy-efficient","story":"MORE than pound million of funding has been approved in a bid to make city homes more energy efficient."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-stroll-down-memory-lane-with-old-glasgow-pictures","story":"Weve been busy digging through our picture archives to bring you some gems.

This new parliament will be pivotal in determining the nature of our future regulatory environment and we are keen and ready to meet with them.Our industry faces a number of challenges over the coming years, not just in relation to Brexit but on issues such as climate change, environmental policy, plant protection and animal health and welfare. There will also be opportunities for farming and we must ensure that we make the most of these opportunities to build a forward-looking, progressive and resilient sector that benefits farmers and consumers throughout the UK.We would like to invite all UK MEPs on to farms in their local areas to discuss a range of priority issues and to answer any questions that they might have.

This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"monsters and magic come to lochgilphead booksigning","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead#s Argyll Book Centre is holding a book signing with Lari Don.The Secret of the Kelpie author will be in the indie book shop on Saturday June  to read her new book to eager ears and talk to readers about their favourite folk tales and inventing monsters.After a quick break, Lari willto read excerpts from her spellbinding Spellchasers trilogy to inspire you to imagine magical adventures of your own and tell one of your favourite myths.Born in Chile, Lari Don was brought up in Scotland where she has worked in politics and for the BBC.

very loving parents and I was brought up in a community that offered so much and gave me many opportunities.\"Melrose is a place which similarly offers opportunities to its young people.\"This place you call home is truly special.\"While memory lane is a fond destination during Festival week, it was the Principals of this year who took centre stage.Liva McGillivray was led along the Abbeys North

Leaderdale and Melrose at the local authority, told us: \"I am pleased that Newland Assets have listened carefully to the representations they have received concerning the Borders Gateway proposals.\"A Class  food retail store was very much against local and national planning policy for the site in Tweedbank as it introduced out of town shopping but the developer has listened carefully to ious concerns on this issue and removed it.ldquoThe new proposals have taken on board many observations made so far during the planning process and the revised plans are better in terms of design, road layout and visual impact.\"I am very excited about the economic impact this development could have on the wider Borders economy.ldquoSecuring a Premier Inn for the Scottish Borders will help put our region firmly on the tourism map and the economic impact of Premier Inn and the potential for other investors to follow them, is something which must be grasped.ldquoThe revised Borders Gateway proposals will complement the work taking place to develop the Tweedbank Innovation Park and will sit comfortably alongside the public and private sector projects which are underway at Tweedbank at present.\"The pound million Borders Gateway development also includes a BP filling station, a Costa drive-thru coffee shop, and a MS kiosk.And it is expected that the new outlets will create up to  jobs.Although the wider vision of the development had been welcomed, the supermarket part of the plans had come in for criticism.And Newland Assets revised their plans to omit the supermarket earlier this year.Councillor Parker added: ldquoBorders Gateway has the overwhelming support of the public and many businesses in the area and now that the food retail plans have been dropped there is no reason why these proposals should not be fully endorsed by the planners and backed by Scottish Borders Council.\"The economic advantages of this proposal signicantly outweigh the very small number of policy considerations which are left.ldquoAlthough it was right for the planners to raise concerns about the previous proposal, now that the developer has listened carefully to all the objections and amended the plans accordingly to deal with them, the Borders public simply wonrsquot understand why the council isnrsquot backing this ambitious inward investment opportunity.\"It will help bring new jobs and secure existing jobs and undoubtedly lead to a tourism boost in the Scottish Borders.ldquoI look forward to this development receiving approval and work commencing on

including  around the Eildon area.Among the identied playparks to be decommissioned are  in Galashiels - Balnakiel Terrace, Broom Drive, Croft Street, Kingsknowe, Lee Brae, Netherbank, Roger Quin Gardens, Rosebank Place, Sykes Acre, Waverley Place and Woodlea - four in Earlston - Acorn Drive, Everest Road, Gun Road and Summerfield - four in Selkirk - Bannerfield small park, Fairfield Crescent, Heatherlie Park and Rosebank Quarry - and three in Melrose at Eildon View, Fairways and Priors Walk.Playparks in Darnick, Fountainhall, Gattonside, Lauder, Newstead and Newtown St Boswells are also facing the chop.Opposition councillor Stuart Bell, who represents Tweeddale East, said: ldquoParents tell us that ndash particularly for small children ndash they value small local facilities where the kids donrsquot have to cross busy roads, and parents can keep an eye on them.ldquoThese parents have a right to be consulted on any changes.Council leader Shona Haslam has been driving the plans forward.And she believes that the sacrice of smaller playparks will be worth it.Councillor Haslam said: ldquoOur investment means we will have better and bigger facilities but some smaller sites will have to close.ldquoWe have lots of old equipment in unsuitable locations, for example on concrete standings or in areas that flood easily, are often vandalised, or in a poor state of repair ndash and we are discussing with communities what should happen to these.\"We want our playparks to be the best, but that may mean that some of the single swings or roundabouts may have to go."},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-bids-for-online-stampede-following-website-launch","story":"SELKIRK is hoping to attract a few surfers to explore the Royal Burgh with the launch of a new tourism website.The online site went live recently -

we need to keep the momentum going.\"Our website has given us a good base to highlight the amazing iety we have in Selkirk from its many cultural and historical connections right through to the breath-taking landscapes we have bordering the town, providing an embarrassment of riches for cycling, walking and riding routes.As well as showcasing many of Selkirks shops, hotels and restaurants, the Explore Selkirk website also provides a comprehensive whats on guide.The pages also chart the towns history and provide details of the many scenic trails in the surrounding hills and valleys.Local councillor Caroline Penman added: ldquoWe are really grateful for the additional funding from Scottish Borders Council to support the website development.\"The website is the first opportunity for many shops and businesses to have an online presence and we know the high-quality products and services the town can offer.\"Selkirk is unusual compared with many high streets, being able to claim many independent shops and cafes.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area.

It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game.

There are several factors influencing this, but the major factor which has tipped the balance is the extended funding hours and the negative impact this is having both financially on small businesses, like Mary Poppins, and to the quality of early learning and childcare.New Scottish Government policy instructs councils to increase their funded childcare hours from  to , by . This move also includes longer opening hours and a move from term time to year-round opening hours to attempt to make childcare more nationally accessible.Ms Dewar said: ldquoThe money received for funded places does not cover the costs of providing the quality of early learning and childcare which we want and are required to provide, especially with regards to staff costs.ldquoThe timescales and measures that the Scottish Government has put in place to educate a workforce to meet the increased requirements are insufficient, and there is a serious shortfall to meet the requirements of the extended funding.ldquoEast Lothian Council indicated it estimated it would require approximately  staff to facilitate the increase in funded hours in East Lothian. The majority of these posts are early learning and childcare practitioners.ldquoThe local authority advertises early learning practitioner posts at between pound. and pound. per hour. Private nurseries are unable to compete with these rates of pay due to the funding rates we are allocated.A group of parents and staff, including Ms Dewar, are visiting county MSP Iain Gray to discuss the problems, but Ms Dewar added that unless he can ldquowork a miracle and change the policy, then it is unlikely the decision to close the nursery will be reversed.When asked about the nursery, Mr Gray said: ldquoThe loss of any nursery provision is disappointing, particularly with the Governmentrsquos , funded hours policy set to be implemented next year.ldquoIn the case of the Mary Poppins Nursery, the owner has highlighted a number of factors that have contributed to their decision to close.ldquoI have written to East Lothian Council about some of these issues.ldquoHowever, there are also wider issues at play here. The nursery sector has been warning the Scottish Government that private nurseries are struggling in the run-up to the roll-out of its flagship , policy from August .ldquoMinisters must act quickly to address the sectorrsquos concerns and ensure that the capacity exists to deliver the funded hours next year.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoIt is, of course, concerning to hear of any nursery considering closure, and the obvious effects this might have on staff, parents and children.ldquoEast Lothian Council has provided assurance that they will support families to find alternative early learning and childcare places for children who had been expecting to use the Mary Poppins Nursery from this August.Ms Dewar added: ldquoI am distraught that circumstances have forced me to this decision and that such a wonderful place for children to experience their early years is to close.The decision was met with an outpouring of grief on social media.The nurseryrsquos recent th birthday was marked with a garden party.The nursery was founded by Sue Armstrong, affectionately still called lsquoMiss Suersquo, after she had written to Mary Poppins author P L Travers to askshe could use the name.Miss Sue said: ldquoI received many letters from P L Travers about the nursery.ldquoAt the beginning, she wanted to know what the nursery was going to be like. She had no objection to me using the name, she just wanted to find out more. I ended up meeting her as well.ldquoWe were hoping to get her to come and open the nursery  years ago, but her arthritis was bad. We stayed in touch, however. I would send her letters about how the nursery was getting on along with photos, and she would write back saying how she liked it, and ideas of what to do.ldquoShe said that the children should be encouraged to make up their own stories. lsquoChildren like doing that,rsquo she said.Miss Sue sold the nursery to Ms Dewar in  as she was ldquosick of all the paperwork.She said. ldquoWhen I heard it was to close down, well, itrsquos just all so sad really. Itrsquos such a terrible shame.ldquoIt is such a nice and happy place for the children, homely and warm. Itrsquos just awful that it canrsquot stay open.Miss Sue still attends events at the nursery, dressed as the iconic nanny Mary Poppins.She added: ldquoIn the film, Mary Poppins says that shersquoll stay until the winds change. Well, maybe this is the wind changing for Mary Poppins Nursery.Ward councillor Craig Hoy said: ldquoThe closure of the Mary Poppins Nursery is deeply regrettable but reflects the real pressures the independent sector is experiencing as a result of the SNPrsquos , hours policy.\"The Government faces huge problems to provide the free childcare it has promised.

Five minutes in a car can cover a distance which would represent a fairly long walk.Itrsquos kind of a simple principle, I know, but one I sometimes forget, as I did a couple of weekends ago. We set off from an event at Amisfield Walled Garden for a walk. My idea was to walk along the River Tyne to Hailes Castle and thenndash by car a -minute round trip.We had some supplies in the form of fruit in my bag and a little water. It was a sunny and warm day and so we set off on our adventure.We began the walk at the old Abbey Bridge which spans the Tyne close to Amisfield. As you walk under its ancient ribbed arches of this late medieval bridge, you get a real sense of its age and the beauty of its construction.The path beyond follows the river and it is almost impossible now to imagine that a great abbey once stood here, with connections to the infant Mary Queen of Scots. A ruined old mill of later centuries still stands here. I reflected on the stories of this location: a courageous nun who defied a flood in the th century and a gruesome murder in the th century and just visible in the near distance the old graveyard, now ringed with trees and almost unrecognisable as a resting place for the dead.A labourer once thought he saw a ghost at the graveyard, but it proved to be something , and I had a wry smile at that tale of a drunken evening over  years ago. These are all tales I have already told here, but they entered my head as we wandered to the gate that led along the northern bank of the river.Hailes Castle is on the southern bank of the river and I knew that there was a bridge that would takes us over. So we set off to find the bridge.But it took us over four hours.It was a stunning walk, with wild flowers and trees decorating the riverbank almost all the way. A grey heron seemed to follow us perhaps he was warning us that the walk was longer than Irsquod anticipated.It is a walk decorated with history too, of course. A stone in the corner of the field by the first gate caught my eye. Deeply ingrained groove marks on it intrigued me. I was later told that it could be the marks of a plough, as the tips of the plough have scraped over the stone a ploughman unwittingly leaving evidence of his unrecorded toil.Halfway along the walk we arrived at the small hamlet of Sandyrsquos Mill. The cottages and mill itself have been beautully restored. The th-century mill still has its waterwheel, although itrsquos now embedded in silt. The mill ceased working  years ago and was transformed into a residential property, but with much of the old machinery inside still intact. It appears to be a very sympathetic and sensitive restoration.It was beyond Sandyrsquos Mill that the distance began to take its toll. The young kids were tired and desperately looking for the bridge. I spotted Traprain Law some distance away and realised that I had badly misjudged the distance and time it would take with wee ones. We had to sit and have a rest and story, with that grey heron listening, to gather the energy to continue.The kids didnrsquot complain much as we wandered along the still-beautul path, now desperately looking for the bridge. As we had rested wersquod phoned for friends to come and lsquorescuersquo us at Hailes Castle with chocolate and water, and we knew they were there waiting for us.Irsquove never been quite so pleased to see Hailes Castle. It loomed suddenly from across the river. I had never approached it from this direction and it certainly did its best to impress. The bridge was just a wee way further and we finally crossed it with a sense of relief.When we arrived at the castle, the kids devoured the chocolate and water, in a way that reminded me of a scene in the movie Ice Cold in Alex. Thank goodness for good friends.Wersquod made it and what a sense of adventure ndash and an achievement!I sat with the kids and told stories as my we went with the friends to retrieve our car. Hailes Castle drips with history but they wanted tales about giants.The day was a lesson for me: to think more carefully about distance when setting on a walk! I thoroughly recommend the path, especially on a lovely summerrsquos day. But itrsquos going to take half a dayyou have kids. So prepare for that!Unbelievably, the kids later wanted to go to a playpark. ldquoWhere do they get the energy  my we asked.ldquoFrom us! I replied!"},{"url":null,"title":"hopes-of-seeing-railway-station-return-to-haddington","story":"RAGESmet with Peter Brett Associates ndash a leading consultancy of engineers and planners ndash to outline the case for improved transports links to and from East Lothian.One of the more ambitious plans was to see theof a railway station to Haddington.Residents of the town have not been served by a railway station since , with the station closing to freight nearly  years later.However, RAGES feels there could still be a possibility of a station ing to the town ndash though the group acknowledged that work needed to be done.A spokesman for the group said: ldquoRAGES expressed its preference for re-opening of the Haddington branch, ideally to the previous terminus on Station Road.ldquoMinimal compulsory purchase relocation of existing industrial units would be required the biggest physical obstacle would be the reconstruction of the A overbridge which was unwisely built without preserving the railway alignment and loading gauge.ldquoA level crossing would be required at Gateside, failing which an alternative road access could be provided for the new houses on the north side of the line onto the A.There was also a suggestion of creating car parking and even a park and ride facility in the town to serve the new service, which would link the town with Edinburgh.The spokesman added: ldquoAs insufficient parking exists at Station Road , a park and ride station at Oak Tree would be essential, which could also serve the substantial Letham Mains and Gateside developments.ldquoJust east of where the A crosses the railway formation, there is a large rectangular piece of ground, occupied only by scrub, which would be suitable as a car park.ldquoAs only single track would suffice between Longniddry and Haddington, it would be possible to retain a footpath cycleway as the line was originally provided with double track throughout.ldquoAn electric train service from Haddington to Edinburgh would provide the speed and capacity which road transport ndash car or bus ndash cannot match. Frequency should be half-hourly.Councillor Tom Trotter, who represents Haddington, backed the station bid.He said: ldquoIt is a good idea, especially with the town expanding as it is.ldquoIt would be a tremendous asset to have.However, the councillor felt it was more likely the station would have to find a new site, such as Alderston, to the north of the town.He added: ldquoIn the short-term it is unrealistic, but hopefully in the longer term things can be put in place to make it a realistic possibility.ldquoIt is a great idea and Irsquom sure it would get support from all the local ward councillors, but where it would go and how much it would cost are questions."},{"url":null,"title":"preview-prestonpans-gala-2019","story":"This year is the th anniversary of Prestonpans Childrenrsquos Gala.On gala day itself, the festivities kick off with the crowning ceremony at am at Prestonpans Community Centre.There is then a fancy-dress competition at Middleshot Square at noon before the parade heads off through the town.From Middleshot Square, it heads along Hawthorn Road and down West Loan to the war memorial, then along High Street before turning up Redburn Road, then along North Grange Avenue, where it ends at Mary Murray Park, behind the community centre.The park hosts the gala dayrsquos family fun, which includes a funfair with a host of rides, as well as old favourites such as hook the duck.There is also a vintage fire engine on display, as well as an American police car, motorbike displays, ponies, birds of prey, beat the goalie, Zorbs, safe archery, NERF guns, crazy golf, a tombola and a gala raffle, not to mention ice cream vans, tea and coffee, Mr Donut Man, crepes, waffles, hot dogs, nachos, a burger van, La Favorita pizzas, stalls selling gts, sweets and cake.Gala day marks the beginning, not the end of Prestonpansrsquo week of fun and activities.Events are as follows:Saturday, June Monday, June Tuesday, June Wednesday, June Thursday, June Friday, June "},{"url":null,"title":"bid-to-turn-former-rbs-in-north-berwick-into-a-house","story":"The townrsquos Royal Bank of Scotlandclosed in June last year.

It is better than some human beings are treated ndash that is the sad truth.Mr Farnsworth was presenting an annual report on the racecoursersquos performance over the last financial year.The Beast from the East snow storm, an outbreak of equine influenza, and a long spell of dry weather all contributed to what he described as one of the worst years the course had been through in his memory.A number of key fixtures were cancelled and profits fell.In December, four horses died during one day of racing at the course but a subsequent review by the British Horseracing Authority ruled that the course and race organisers were not at fault.Councillor Gordon Mackett asked Mr Farnsworththe racecourse had been affected by animal welfare concerns.The course manager said: ldquoWe did have a horrible day when there were four fatalities however, these were all completely separate incidents.ldquoIn a sport like this you will get injuries and fatalities from time to time. It is horric for the people involved.Mr Farnsworth said that the public were becoming more aware of incidents like these through social media which, he said, ldquofuelled the debate around animal welfare.However, he said there had been no indication that it had had an impact on events at Musselburgh, which saw record crowds at its Easter Day racing this year and another sell-out Ladies Day.His report to the committee revealed that the racecourse had reported a loss over the last financial year after it paid over pound, of legal costs relating to the ongoing process by East Lothian Council to find new third-party operators to run the course.Councillor Kenny McLeod questioned why the costs were being met by the course and not the council itself.However, depute chief executive of the council Alex McCrorie told the councillor that the costs were charged to the racecourse because when the new operator was procured it would be the racecourse that benefitted.He conceded to Mr McLeod that, without the legal costs being taken from the coursersquos funds, it would have been in profit last year.East Lothian Council replaced the previous governance committee which oversaw the running of the course with a new committee last year after relations between members of the old committee badly deteriorated and the British Horseracing Authoritythreatening to suspend its racing licence.The new Musselburgh Racing Associated Committeendash which is made up of four elected councillors and two representatives of the racing industry, currently members of Lothians Racing Syndicate ndash has been overseeing the hunt for a new operator.However, the BHA has only granted temporary licences and extensions under the new committee as it continues to monitor its performance.Mr Farnsworth said that the introduction of the new interim committee had caused some problems too.

I have heard many dferent versions of this tale, and most recently come across one version in a book by Taffy Thomas, who is a renowned storyteller. Here is my version of the story, which I have titled lsquoThe Riddle Rulersquo:IT WAS to be the final race of the tournament. The two knights had been equally matched, and now they would race each other for the prize of a gold cup filled with gold coins.There was an air of excitement as the crowds gathered for this race. Sir John and Sir Harry arrived together, each mounted on their stallions. Sir Johnrsquos horse was called Lightning, while Sir Harryrsquos horse was named Spear.They were equally matched, both knights had won an equal amount of races, and both had won against each other. There was no favourite, everyone knew this race would be very close.The atmosphere was electric with anticipation.Then the kingrsquos storyteller leaned over to whisper in the kingrsquos ear: ldquoYour majesty, this race is the last of the tournament. I feel it should be a race with an extra challenge, so that the crowd are better pleased.The king agreed, but asked the storyteller what he thought the extra challenge should be.ldquoThe race should be a test of the knightsrsquo wits as well as their riding ability, replied the storyteller. ldquoSet them a riddle rule and see how they solve it.ldquoAnd what is the riddle rule to be  asked the king.The storyteller smiled: ldquoDeclare the rules of this race to be thus: the horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and coins for its owner.And so the king declared the riddle rule just before the beginning of the race: ldquoThe horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and gold for its owner.There was a murmuring amongst the spectators. The knights looked at each other, thinking.When the starter flag was lowered and the king cried ldquogo, both knights stayed at the starting line. ldquoYou go first, said Sir John to Sir Harry. ldquoNo, after you, said Sir Harry to Sir John. But neither knight was willing to leave the start line lest they be deemed to be first.Soon there were boos and clapping from the crowd, but the prize was too great for either knight to risk going first.ldquoThis race is no fun, said the king to the storyteller, annoyed now that hersquod agreed to the change in rules.ldquoGive them until this afternoon to find a way to race, replied the storyteller, ldquothere is a way but they must discover it. It will challenge their wits and also their riding skills.And so the king stood: ldquoThe race is postponed until pm this afternoon. The knights must find a way to race to the riddle rule, otherwise the prize will be forfeited.For the rest of the day there was an excited buzz as people began to discuss possible solutions to the riddle rule with the knights.ldquoWhy donrsquot you agree to cross the finish line together  was one suggestionldquoBut then they would be equal first and the prize would be lost, commented another.ldquoBesides, said Sir John, ldquoI do not trust Sir Harry not to pull his horse back at the last moment. ldquoI do not trust you either, said Sir Harry.The deadline was fast approaching and no solution to the riddle rule had been found.ldquoPerhaps being first is more important than winning the gold, said an old woman.The knights looked at each other, thinking about this. Then they both said ldquonaw and shook their heads.It was  minutes before the race and a child came up to the knights and said: ldquoI have an idea. Everyone looked down at the child and laughed. How could a poor child know the answer when the knights themselves and all the spectators were scunnered But the storyteller was walking by and overheard the laughter. ldquoChildrenrsquos wisdom is not to be laughed at, he scolded them.And so the knights asked the child for the solution.The child said two words to the knights.In a flash, the knights got mounted and prepared to race. When the starter flag was lowered and the king shouted ldquogo, both Sir John and Sir Harry raced as fast as they could, each being desperate to be first across the finish line. Their riding skills were well challenged by this race.Who won does not matter in this story. What matters are the two words that were said by the child. They were the answer to the riddle rule, and so made the race possible.What were those two words If you havenrsquot already worked it out then re-read the story carefully. If you still donrsquot know, and want to know the answer, then I will give it next week.Or perhaps you could ask a child.

The number of entrants reflect the unmistakable popularity of equestrian pursuits within East Lothian.And for those who prefer more craft-based endeavours, there are numerous prizes for the craft schedules, including floristry, baking, stick dressing, photography and jam-making. Itrsquos certainly an inclusive event.Therersquos even a hugely popular vintage farm machinery section, a huge draw for farming and non-farming visitors alike and which makes an impressive vista across the showground.Butyou think itrsquos all about prize turnips and tractors, yoursquod be wrong. Such is the reputation of the Haddington Show it attracts some prestigious performers.One of the most sought-after tickets is for the remarkable pop-up opera shows: a touring version of Scottish Opera who perform in a mobile lorry, complete with seating and stage. Theyrsquoll be singing highlights from three operas during the show and tickets are on a first-come first-served basis on the day.Other notable entertainment is from the Broke FMX stunt motorbike team. Theyrsquoll be performing acrobatic stunts that will have the audience holding their breath as the UKrsquos top ranked freestyle motocross riders reach heights of  feet and jump gaps of almost  feet.For something a little less heart-stopping but no less thrilling, donrsquot miss The Drakes of Hazard. Marvel at the skill of Mark Wylie with his sheepdog and Indian runner duck display team as they navigate around obstacles, working in harmony ndash a lsquomust seersquo for the kids.And no Scottish agricultural show would be complete without a pipe band.The Haddington Show is pleased to welcome East Lothianrsquos own Haddington Pipe Band, a befitting soundtrack to this traditional event.Asall that entertainment isnrsquot enough, visitors can also sample and buy a range of locally produced goods in the East Lothian Producers Marquee. The very best produce from our area includes locally made oils, dairy goods, bread, spices and, of course, whisky!Another area not to be missed is the equally local Craft and Lestyle Marquee, where you can buy items made in East Lothian. Again, the choice is ied, definitely a lsquosomething for everyonersquo scenario and some unusual offerings like hand-knitted kidsrsquo clothing, candles, accessories madefrom feathers, tweed items and furniture ndash and thatrsquos just the edit! Allow plenty of time between the performances to browse the local marquees.The Haddington Show is a fabulous and educational day out for all ages but it doesnrsquot happen without the continued support of sponsors and traders, who also exhibit at the show.The two main sponsors for  are Greaves, West  Ayre, who have been generous sponsors since , and Lothian Broadband, who this year are also supporting the show, and both businesses will be in the sponsorsrsquo marquee by the main ring, along with many other local companies visitors are encouraged to meet the traders.No less recognition should be given to the committee who make the show possible. Throughout the year, they work tirelessly, and largely voluntary, to make the show a success. Co-ordinating the events, booking the entertainment and physically preparing the ground for the big day takes a huge effort.

Water to splash in, expanses of sand to run rings round and lots of sticks to be discovered. Balnakeil Beach, in Scotlandrsquos far north, is one of the best dog-friendly beaches in the country: with turquoise waters, dramatic headlands and unspoilt views across the horizon. It is relatively quiet, even in good weather, so your dog should have plenty of space to run wild and explore the beach and nearby sand dunes. A word of warning though-you want to go on further to the northern part of the beach then the path cuts across grazing land, so your dog will need to be on a short lead.. Cairndow, Loch Fyne, Argyll and ButeThe village of Cairndow is located in an enviable position at the head of Loch Fyne, offering a great starting point for walks around the loch. But as well as the idyllic lochside, Cairndow is also home to Ardkinglas Woodland Gardens, a beautul, but suitably ied, private garden that welcomes dogs on a lead. Andall that wasnrsquot enough, you can finish your visit with a trip to the nearby Fyne Ales brewery, which has a cosy beer bar that welcomes dogs with open arms. They are even allowed to sit up on the seats.. Tyninghame Bay, East Linton, East LothianSome dogs love the beach, some dogs love the woods. But why make them choose: the delightful Tyninghame Bay has both. Start at the Tyninghame Links car park and follow the path through the woodland until you reach the sand dunesof Ravensheugh Sands. You can then take in the splendid views of Tyninghame beach -which is mercully quiet compared to its neighbour at North Berwick- before turning onto a track that leads you back to the car park.. The Old Course at St Andrews, FeIconic, revered, and host of the revered Open Championships, the Old Course at St Andrews might not seem like a place for dogs. But they are in fact allowed on the course -provided they are kept on leads- and the Old Coursersquos y fairways can actually offer a great place for a dog walk with a dference. It is best to visit on a Sunday, when the course turns into a pseudo-park for local people. No golf is allowed, children play in the bunkers and dogs are able to wander round without the distraction of balls flying overhead.. Linn Park, southside of GlasgowIf you have a sociable dog that likes making friends, then Linn Park is the place for you. You will be certain to meet plenty of furry friends on your way round the  acres of woodland, waterfalls and grasslands- with even several hours of walking not enough to see the whole thing. The White Cart river even runs through the heart of the park, offering plenty of opportunities to throw sticks into the water for your dog. Andyou exit the park at its Northern gate, you can stop off at the dog-friendly Old Smiddy pub to reward yourself with a well-earned drink.. Burn Anne Trail, Galston, East AyrshireA popular walk among locals, the Burn Anne Trail leads through country roads and woodlands up to a great vantage point above the village of Galston. Although the path features some climbs it isnrsquot too taxing, with most dogsable to manage it with relative ease. Start in the car park across from Barr Castle, before heading towards Burn Anne and into the woodland beyond. From there, the path meanders through the trees and meadows before reaching fields that offer a clear outlook over the countryside- even seeing as far as Ben Lomond on a good day. There are fences that separate the wildle in the fields from the marked path, but it pays to keep your dog close just in case.. Westport Beach, Campbeltown, Mull of KintyreThis ruggedly beautul beach has plenty to keep dogs busy. It stretches for over six miles, with the biggest sand dune area in Argyll, and its position on the windy west coast of creates an abundance of waves to splash in. And when the tide is right, rock pools will form at the far end of the sands: perfect for inquisitive four-legged explorers.. Callander Crags, Callander, StirlingThis walk might involve a bit of a steep climb, but it is well worth it for the views at the top. Provided that you and your dog are fit enough, start at the Callander Crags car park and follow the signposted path through the woods, climbing up steep stone steps to the top of the crags. From there, take a short detour to visit the Jubilee Cairn -a stone monument erected for Queen Victoria ndash where you will enjoy glorious views of the rolling hills beyond.. Pitlochry Dam and Salmon Ladder, Pitlochry, PerthshireSpring is the best time to visit the lsquoSalmon Ladderrsquo at Pitlochryrsquos Dam, as the fish are most likely to be swimming upstream. But, with your dog likely to be uninterested in watching fish, the dam also provides a starting point for a picturesque Perthshire walk. From the Port-na-Craig bridge head to the top of the dam and then on to Loch Faskally, where they should enjoy paddling in the water.. Templeton Woods, Birkhill, DundeeThe  acres of Templeton Woods has several dferent marked trails to follow. Butyour dog wants to run free, there is plenty of space for them to do so- and plenty of sticks to pick up along the way. If the sun is shining, then there is also a large picnic area with barbeques near to the main entrance.. Loch Leven Heritage Trail, KinrossThis -mile trail goes right around the circumference of Loch Leven, butyou donrsquot feel up to the whole thing then it is equally pleasant to do in stages. There are spectacular views of the Lomond Hills and Lochleven Castle on offer, but your dog is likely to enjoy the iety of farmland, woodland and sandy lochside on the way round..Kirkhill Forest, Dyce, AberdeenThere are sticks galore in Kirkhill Forest, with the extensive woodland proving popular with dog walkers, mountain bikers and families. A word of warning though: the forest gets boggy pretty quickly when it rains, so keep your dog at armrsquoswhen they shake off.. Kingsbarns village circular, East Neuk of FeThe East Neuk is one of the loveliest corners of the Scottish coastline, with each small fishing village as lovely as the last. Kingsbarns might be best known for its immaculate links golf course, but also has a great circular walk on offer for those in the know. Start in the village then head down to the Cambo Sands beach -where your dog is sure to love getting into the sea- before making your way back to the village via the Cambo Estate.. Milngavie Reservoirs, East DumbartonshireTwo adjoining reservoirs ndash Mugdock and Craigmadddie ndash provide a flat, pleasant dog walk circuit that proves particularly popular with local residents in the summer evenings. You can walk three miles round one reservoir, or sixyou want to do both, with woodlands at the edge of the Mugdock Reservoiryou want to extend your walk further. And when you finish, you can head to the dog-friendly Bullandrsquos Coffee House on Milngaviersquos Mugdock Road afterwards.. Knockman Wood Circular, Newton Stewart, Dumfries and GallowayThis circular loop is only three miles round, so is a great way to ease yourself into more challenging walks. It follows a quiet singletrack path into some ancient oak woodland, where you might spot some rare birds and butterflies among the many trees.Read more articles in our dog-friendly Scotland series:#Dog-friendly cafesDog-friendly pubsDog-friendly hotels"},{"url":null,"title":"in-pictures-forth-bridge-visitor-experience-unveiled","story":"The proposals centre on a ft high viewing .The hair-raising plans are expected to lead to , visitors a year coming to climb the structure which will reach its th anniversary in .:-year plan to boost tourism around Forth bridgesNetwork Rail is wants to take visitors onto the bridge on a regular basis for the first time, focussing on the \"bridge climb\" experience in South Queensferry.Access is envisaged to be provided via an existing walkway under the south approach span and a new steel walkway positioned discreetly within the top member of the southern suspended span.Visitors will move in groups of up to  from a new hub building near Hawes Brae and will be hooked on to the bridge using a harness and continuous safety line.A Network Rail spokesman said: \"Our plans for the Forth Bridge Experience are progressing well and we look forward to being able to open up this iconic structure to the public.\"The initial plans for consultation with the community were approved by planners at Edinburgh City Council.It has been suggested a detailed application will be submitted this summer."},{"url":null,"title":"birth-trauma-association-boss-says-mothers-not-being-listened-to","story":"The Birth Trauma Association was set up in  and now has around  members on it private Facebook page.Kim Thomas, its CEO, said they receives around - emails a week from women in distress.Thomas said: \"The majority of women - probably around three quarters - tell us that they felt the way they were treated during labour was a big contributor to them developing PTSD.\"Things like not being told what was going on when there was an emergency, being treated very coldly or shouted at even.\"Sometimes theyve had procedures performed without consent.\"And not being listened to as well.

They say thats what the science tells us. And they are right.\"So today, as First Minister of Scotland, I am declaring that there is a climate emergency. And Scotland will live up to our responsibility to tackle it.\"Her call came weeks after SNP MSPs voted against a Holyrood motion tabled by the Greens calling for an emergency to be proclaimed. The initial disagreement centred on the oil and gas industry,The Government has climate change targets, but some campaigners believe the Nationalist administration is not taking firm enough action, particularly on transport. One of the key challenges is persuading motorists to stop using their cars and instead travel by public transport.However, official Government records show that Ministers have a distance to travel before their actions match their words.Scottish Government HQ is based at St Andrews House in Edinburgh near Calton Hill, less than a mile from the Scottish Parliament.Holyrood can be reached from the Art Deco masterpiece in not much more than  minutes, a journey that is also downhill.Sturgeonrsquos ministerial colleagues used their vehicles more than  times between November  and January to travel between the two landmarks, knocking a couple of minutes off the journey time.In January, Education Secretary John Swinney made use of a Government car for this purpose nine times, Health Secretary Jeane Freeman made the journey on eight occasions, Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop and Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing did it four times each, while Cunningham and Social Security Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville did it once.The same records show that Swinney, Hyslop, Cunningham, Brexit Secretary Michael Russell, Freeman, Somerville, and junior ministers Clare Haughey and Christina McKelvie used the chauffeur service for the short trip in December.In the previous month, Swinney, Cunningham, Finance Secretary Derek Mackay, Freeman, Ewing, Somerville and Public Minister Minister Kate Forbes opted for the back seat rather than a short walk.

Any candidate must either commit to it, or set out a very detailed plan for an upgrade.The Barnett Formula, named after the late Labour peer Joel Barnett, was introduced in the s and allocates public spending increases to the Scottish Parliament.Based on population size, rather than need, the system has resulted in Scots receiving a far higher level of spending per head in areas such as health and education.Supporters believe scrapping it could lead to swingeing cuts north of the border and undermine a key plank of the argument for Scotland staying in the UK.Holyroodrsquos funding system has now become a iding line in the battle between Hunt and Johnson to become the next Conservative leader and Prime Minister.Johnson, a former mayor of London, has a track record of hostility to the Barnett formula which goes back to  when he said: \"It is becoming clearer and clearer to people that they are being short-changed. The Barnett formula is producing deeply inequitable outcomes.Three years later, Johnson stepped up his attacks by describing Barnett as a ldquosystem of amazing political antiquity by which the English taxpayer sends about pound billion every year to Scotland as a kind of present.In , he called for funding to be erted from Scotland to London:\"If London isnt moving, the UK is nowhere. A pound spent in Croydon or Tottenham, the areas hit by the riots last year, will generate far more for the rest of the economy than a pound spent in Strathclyde.\"He also said: \"In the end youll create more jobs in Strathclyde or Derby by investing in London than you will by investing in Derby. This is the place that drives the rest of the UK. If it causes Celtic wailing, then Im willing to go there and make the case that its right for them too.His most recent criticism came in the days after the  independence referendum when the then Prime Minister David Cameron said the system would be protected. Johnson responded:\"Im very keen on a Barnett formula which does justice to Barnet with one T [Barnet in north London]. We cant just go on with a system that even Joel Barnett himself thinks is outdated.\"I think there is quite a good way of honouring this slightly odd promise and that is to ask him to redesign it. Id like to see him or someone  have a go. Thats my solution for honouring what I see as a slightly reckless promise.\"Hunt, who has stressed his Unionist credentials in the contest, has intervened to say he will keep the system as Prime Minister.His spokesperson said: ldquoThe Barnett formula is essential to protect Scotlandrsquos public services. Thatrsquos why a government run by Jeremy would maintain it, to help ensure Scotlandrsquos schools and hospitals get the funding they need.John Lamont MP, one of Jeremy Hunts original backers in his bid to become Prime Minister, went further: ldquoThere is no case for scrapping the Barnett formula. Boris said it was reckless of David Cameron to commit to keeping the Barnett formula. The only thing reckless would be scrapping it.ldquoThis is yet another reason that Jeremy is the Prime Minister that Nicola Sturgeon doesnrsquot want. Boris should u-turn immediately and follow Jeremy in pledging to keep the Barnett formula. That is whatrsquos best for Scotland and the Union.Senior Scottish Tories are worried that Johnson could end up backing a no-deal Brexit as Prime Minister, an outcome they fear would provide an electoral boost to the SNP. A majority of Tory MSPs, including Scottish leader Ruth Davidson, are backing Hunt.In a challenge to Johnson, Davidson told the BBC last week: ldquoI want to see him make assurances that itrsquos not Brexit do or die, itrsquos the Union do or die.

I have no doubt that for most of these last twenty years this striking chamber has provided exactly that, a place to talk.ldquoBut of course it must also be a place to listen --- a place to hear views that inevitably may dfer quite considerably, one from another --- and a place to honour those views.She continued: ldquoAs we look to the future, it is my sincere hope that this Parliament, and all those who come to serve in it, will use the power of this chamber to celebrate those invisible pillars of our communities, and follow their example by working tirelessly to improve peoplersquos lives, and strengthen the bonds of friendship and partnership both at home and abroad.\"Sturgeon, speaking after the Queen, told how legislation passed at Holyrood had \"made Scotland a better place\".The SNP leader said: \"Although this parliament is only  years young, it has long come of age.\"She added: \"This parliament is firmly established as the centre of this nations public le. We have become the democratic institution which people look to, to reflect their priorities, values, hopes and dreams.\"She also said: \"The  Acts this parliament has passed have ied in their impact. But from land reform in the first parliament to equal marriage in the last, to the Social Security Act in this, they have all made Scotland a better place.\"Macintosh, an MSP since , said over the last  years Holyrood had \"grown into a self confident institution\".He added: \"I am proud of that legislative record, but just as important is that the parliament itself has evolved to reflect the needs of the people we serve.\"Scottish Secretary David Mundell, who was one of the MSPs elected  years ago, watched proceedings from Holyroods gallery.The MP said afterwards: \"This is a really important day.

But she couldnrsquot find a guide online that was helpful ndash so she decided to get out there and start compiling her own list, and then to put that on a blog, which went on to become the site Dugs nrsquo Pubs.ldquoIt started off, she says, ldquoas a really small blog and it just grew from there. Now,  years later, it is a popular app as well as website and, in Edinburgh alone, there are more than , of the ldquodugs welcome stickers she sends out to businesses that want to advertise the fact that dogs may come in. Dugs nrsquo Pubs is a phenomenon that has spread so the site now covers not just Scotland, but parts of the rest of the UK.What she has noticed over those  years is a sht in perception among businesses. ldquoWhen I started, I worked really hard, locally, to get the word out to businesses that they could allow dogs in. Because a lot of businesses believed that they werenrsquot allowed to let dogs in everybody just used to say, lsquoOh itrsquos hygiene lawrsquo. I actually investigated that. The law was there to say you can allow dogs in ndash just not in a food preparation area. So I spent a lot of time letting businesses know that this is the law.Courting the pooch pound also seems to work for business. In Scotland, % of us own a dog, and all together, in the UK, we spend around pound. billion on dogs yearly. ldquoWhat the businesses told me, says Matthews, ldquowas that when they let people in with dogs those people tend to stay, they tend to have lunch, they tend to come back. I think they have realised therersquos a huge market there of people who will be regulars and will spend money. It came at a time when businesses really needed it.Matthews has been part of changing that culture.ldquoWhat a lot of dog owners have said is that itrsquos the stickers that have really helped them, because in the past they would have been hovering around outside going ndash will we  But a sticker lets them know we can go in and wersquore welcome.For her, having dogs in pubs seems normal. ldquoI grew up in one, she says. ldquoPeople in my family have always run pubs and dogs were always in the pubs and we always had dogs. So for me that was what a pub was. A pub had dogs in.Whenever she sends out the stickers she puts in a covering note saying: ldquoThis sticker yoursquore putting up is not about dog tolerance. Itrsquos dogs welcomed ndash so dogs really do have to be welcomed in the pub, not just tolerated.She doesnrsquot like to reveal her favourites but says: ldquoBecause we lived in Stockbridge when we set it up, I do feel thatI was going to start out and I lived in Edinburgh and I wanted to go for a day out with my dog Irsquod probably start in Stockbridge. That was the heart of Dugs nrsquo Pubs. That was where it started.ldquoThe other one that is really close to my heart is Leith Walk. There are just so many great places there. I feel a real kinship with Leith and especially whatrsquos going on at the moment with Leith Walk, with the threat to it from developers. You want to support those areas.The bloggerTHE holidays are upon us and staycations are all the rage. Yoursquove got your new Herald On Sunday dog-friendly guide in your pocket, but just how easy is it to take your dog with you as you travel around Scotland Someone who knows very well the answer to this question is Samantha Grant, the woman behind the popular blog about a West Highland Terrierrsquos travels around the country, The Wee White Dug. She and her dug, Casper, have travelled theand breadth in a bid to tell a story of Scottish history.Theyrsquove taken the Jacobite steam train, stayed in a yurt, relaxed in five-star hotels, summited Munros, slept on the roof of a Land Rover in a tent on Skye, overnighted in a fishermenrsquos mission and visited the Neolithic tombs on Orkney. Theyrsquore even planning on staying on a fishing trawler. ldquoAll of it, she says, ldquoproperly dog-friendly. I wonrsquot take any special privileges. Casper has been a great front for me to share Scotland with the world but also show how dog-friendly it is. I try to show that travelling with a dog doesnrsquot hamper you in any way or form.Grant, an HR project manager, started out as an Instagrammer, taking photos of her travels around Scotland in which Casper would sometimes feature. She noticed that when he did, her followers rocketed up, and that ldquopeople seemed more interest in him than me. When a friend suggested she blog, she tried it.ldquoIt snowballed, she recalls. ldquoAfter a few months I was invited to run a competition for a whisky festival then a hotel got in touch askingI would come and stay.\"At first these emails were dropping in my mailbox and I thought they think Irsquom somebody  ndash it was a bit of imposter syndrome. Then he just became a known character. Itrsquos a wee bit surreal because hersquos got a huge fanbase.Recently, he was recognised by a couple from South Carolina while they were coming back from Mull on a ferry. ldquoPeople tend to recognise him from his natty Tweed bow ties.One of the most searched categories on the VisitScotland site is ldquopet friendly, and the tourist organisation even has its own Ambassadog, George. But Grant thinks Scotland has always been dog-friendly. ldquoIt is just that people probably have more disposable income these days for going out and eating out and that kind of stuff, so it has become more of a thing for businesses.Many unexpected places, she notes, are very dog-friendly. For instance, she describes a visit to the Camera Obscura in Edinburgh, in which Casper got ldquoreally excited in the mirror maze, although his wee wet nose was smearing their mirrors. The Westie also took a trip into the Tomb Of The Eagle on Orkney, riding on ldquoa wee skateboard. Hersquos been to Fingalrsquos Cave on Staffa, the Bass Rock and the steam ship Sir Walter Scott.One of the most ldquoamazing dog-friendly attractions, she says, is the Jacobite steam train. ldquoI have a picture of him standing in frontit which just went mad on social media. Therersquos never any time when I think it would be a lot easierI didnrsquot travel with him.These days, she says, she makes money out of the blog ndash but itrsquos not about that. ldquoItrsquos about the love of Scotland ndash thatrsquos why I studied Scottish history and Scots literature. Itrsquos great becauseno-one really wants to listen to me banging on about Scottish history I can put this wee terrier in front of them and theyrsquoll listen.She also loves the way the blog can inspire other people to get out and about with their dogs. ldquoOne woman who wrote to me, living on her own with a dog, said that she was really inspired by the blog and would have loved to do what I was doing but she was too frightened.

The nearest I got to Doon the Watter was to tag in behind a portly woman, affecting to be her child, for a trip on the sludge boat, which left from Shieldhall to dump the cityrsquos untreated sewage off Arran, so that it washed up, hopefully, on the richer folk bathing at Brodick and Lamlash. You got your lunch then for free too, before the rules-crazed EU decided, probably on the same day they decreed straight bananas, that this was environmental anathema. On a good day I can conjure up the smell of the thousands of tons of excrement as it went overboard and the cawing of the seagull looking for discards.On other days my mother, bless her, would knot a handkerchief and tie it round my head to ward off the constant sun and send me out with a couple of eggs in my pockets which, at the height of the day, Irsquod fry on a baking metal tram track, the Number  to Auchenshuggle I recall, although I had to time it carefully or Irsquod end up with scrambled rather than fried.I donrsquot remember the summer of  where the temperature remained over Cfor three months.

A Minister of Drought, Denis Howell, was appointed by Prime Minister Jim Callaghan and he was ordered to do a raindance. Howell took his job so seriously that he invited reporters to his home to set an example to the country on how he was saving water by bathing with his we. Her name was Brenda, I believe. Dear reader, I averted my eyes.But the appointment was a deft stroke because within days, possibly as a result of the raindance, the heavens opened and there were flash floods everywhere. Not missing a beat, Callaghan appointed Howell the Minister of Floods. Even now, Irsquom told, Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell are practising their steps together for one they hope will banish Boris, although theyrsquove ruled out sharing the water.A year later, in , Paisley set the record for the hottest place in the country ndash no, not in housebreaking or chibbery ndash for a temperature of C , which today might have you reaching for your fleece, or in Paisleya stab-proof gilet.The highest temperature recorded was .Cin Faversham in , where Bob Geldof had a home, and that summer probably reminded him of all the weans in Africa he had saved and encouraged him to do it all again.Thatrsquos the evidence then and, as they say in these courtroom dramas and Hollywood disaster epics starring Tom Cruise or Nicholas Cage and CGI, itrsquos incontrovertible.

The appointments must take into account political affiliation, geography - balancing east and west, north and south - population size and gender.The leaders of EU institutions are supposed to impartially represent the interests of all member nations on the global stage and in Brussels.There was hope at the previous summit on June - that more time would bring clarity on who should replace Mr Juncker as commission president.German Chancellor Angela Merkel backs conservative compatriot Manfred Weber, whose centre-right European Peoples Party is the largest political group in the European Parliament but lost seats in the EU elections in May.Mr Macron has suggested Mr Weber lacks the political and Government experience for such a high-profile role.But Mr Weber could still be considered for the head of the European Parliament, which is the EUs only elected institution.:DonaldTusk: Brexit may be even more exciting with new Prime MinisterMs Merkel said there was still a good possibility for Mr Weber and the centre-left top candidate, Dutch politician Frans Timmermans, of the European Socialist and Democrats group, to be among the winners of the top positions, but other leaders from the same political family disagreed.The European Peoples Party, which is made up of Christian Democrats, and the SD are the two biggest political groups in the EU but both lost seats in Mays polls, where far-right and populist parties, pro-business liberals and the Greens made gains.EU leaders want to fill the positions soon because the European Parliament is set to pick a new president next Wednesday.Under EU rules, member countries choose who will run the commission, replacing Mr Juncker.The Parliament must endorse that choice but the assembly has insisted that only the lead candidates from parties that ran in last months elections should be eligible for the post.The commission proposes and enforces EU laws on policies ranging from ranging from the massive single market to agriculture spending, from competition issues to immigration.The outgoing group of EU officials was lopsidedly Italian, with Antonio Tajani holding the Parliament top post, Mario Draghi head of the ECB and Federica Mogherini the EU foreign policy chief.Top candidates include current prime ministers Stefan Lofven of Sweden and Andrej Plenkovic of Croatia.Others mentioned include Brexit

Edinburgh was full of colour and noise, and there was a real sense of hope and expectation. Donald Dewar’s speech in the parliament’s first chamber was one of those moments where the hair stood up on the back of your neck. In my view – as someone in a dferent party to Donald, with very dferent views on the ultimate destination for Scotland – that speech was one of the finest speeches in modern Scottish history.How much of a privilege is it to run the country and how dficult is the top job There’s no doubt that being First Minister of Scotland has been the privilege of my le.

And like many people in senior positions, particularly women, I have had moments of self-doubt but I believe it’s important to be open about that and to be a role model to young people. But more than anything, I am grateful to have the opportunity to help make Scotland a better place to live.What is the Parliament’s biggest achievement in the last  years  Twenty years on there are so many achievements that we can be proud of, and that have made Scotland a better place to live, work, study and grow up in. From free personal care to the abolition of tuition fees, the ban on smoking in public places, a minimum pricing for alcohol and the introduction of equal marriage. There’s a long, long list of these inidual policies that wouldn’t have happenedwe hadn’t had a Scottish Parliament.Across the world there are other countries now looking to Scotland to learn from the globally ground-breaking things we’ve done on public health, on tackling climate change, and on the work we’re doing around renewable energy.But above any inidual policy, there is a much more fundamental achievement, and that is that,  years on, the parliament has reinvigorated Scottish democracy and become an accepted, established part of Scottish le. We should all take great pride in that.What has been the most dficult challenge the Parliament has faced and you personally The sad and unexpected death in  of Donald Dewar – the man who had driven through the Scotland Act and then become the first First Minister – was no doubt a moment of great uncertainty for all MSPs in the early days of the Parliament.On a personal level, I’d have to say assuming the office of First Minister was my biggest challenge. Despite having spent  years in frontline politics, and seven as Deputy First Minister, nothing can prepare you for the moment where suddenly you are the last word, where there is no longer anyone above you to seek a second opinion on somethingyou want it – everyone is looking to you.What is your most memorable moment There have been many memorable moments. The passage of the Equal Marriage Act and the Minimum Pricing legislation are two key ones for me. I also think the referendum campaign has to be one of them. It not only saw Parliament at its best – with robust debates and intense scrutiny – but also sparked an enormous outpouring of democratic engagement across the country. Although the result didn’t go the way I wanted, the legacy of a more politically involved country is one we should all cherish.I have a lot of memorable moments. It’s not the famous names or the big events, but the stories I hear from iniduals around the country that inspire me. I’ve spent a lot of time lately listening to the le experiences of Scotland’s care experienced young people. Their stories will stay with me forever and drive me to improve their lives and opportunities.In  years’ time, how do you hope the Parliament will have evolved It should evolve in line with the way people in Scotland want it to. The Parliament was established in large part because of the democratic deficit that opened up during  years of a Tory government which became more and more unpopular in Scotland. Despite devolution, Brexit in particular has demonstrated that Westminster is willing to ignore the views of people in Scotland and disregard votes of the Parliament. I have absolutely no doubt that by  we will have completed the powers of the Parliament and become an independent country. That means we will have established a genuine partnership of equals with the rest of the UK and will have ensured that people in Scotland always get the governments they vote for.Are there any people you would like to thank We should never ever forget those who campaigned for decades to see a Scottish Parliament – many of whom never lived to see it become a reality.Then there are those who have worked tirelessly behind the scenes. We couldn’t do our job without the work of the parliament staff, led by the Parliament’s chief executive, Sir Paul Grice, who recently announced he was moving on to a new job after  years. He might not be well-known by the wider public but, as someone who was there from the very beginning, all MSPs and staff owe him an enormous debt of gratitude.For me personally, I certainly would not be where I am today without the support of my mum and dad and my husband Peter.Everyone is invited to join the partySaturday, June ,  is gearing up to be a great day.From am to noon, the Queen will address Parliament and each of the party leaders will speak in response. The audience will include those young people who were born in  as well as finalists from a competition for student film-makers who produced a short film on the impact the Scottish Parliament has had in their area. There will also be a number of performances celebrating the best of Scotland’s culture and music and the Makar will perform a new piece of work.In the afternoon, the Parliament will open its doors for a day of celebration – a party everyone is invited to join from pm to pm.There will be a chance to sit in the Presiding Officer’s seat and see how it feels to take charge, as well as retro games like giant Jenga, Kerplunk and space hoppers. There will also be live music, dancers, face painting and caricaturists.And of course, there will be birthday cake and food too. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “It will be a great day, full of colour and energy. Parliament always does these events well and brings in so many people from across Scotland. “I hope we spend the day not just looking back on what has been achieved, but focused on the work the parliament still has to do.“The public are often sceptical of politicians, but I hope people across the country will reflect on how far we’ve come with the parliament and the dference it has already made to so many people’s lives.”"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon the scottish parliament s greatest achievements","story":"The Scottish Parliament will celebrate its th anniversary today .Her Majesty the Queen will take part in the th anniversary celebrations today, with the iconic Parliament building in Edinburgh being open from pm to pm for visitors to join in the birthday celebrations.And in an exclusive QA, Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told us what she believes the Parliament’s top  greatest achievements are.The country’s top politician also shared her thoughts on Brexit and the future, sounding a note of caution for the UK’s next Prime Minister.Here, in her own words, Nicola walks us through the Parliament’s success story...Right from its earliest years, the Scottish Parliament showed that it was ready to take policy decisions substantially dferent to those at Westminster to help build a better country.A clear early example of this was the introduction of free personal care for the elderly. This was a substantial commitment but was vital for Scotland’s long term interests, preparing ourselves for the challenges of an ageing population. We’ve recently extended free personal care to cover all those who are assessed as needing it, no matter their age.MSPs also charted a dferent course when, following a change of administration in , parliament voted to scrap tuition fees in Scotland, restoring Scotland’s long and proud tradition of free education.Similarly, the decision to abolish prescription charges brought to an end what was little more than a tax on ill health. The NHS of course is the greatest, and most valued, example of a universal service where care is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay. Our health service, like others across the world, faces challenges. But it is a real achievement of the Scottish Parliament that we have resisted the marketization moves south of the border while ensuring that under the current government Scotland’s AE departments are the best performing in theUK.On other occasions, the Parliament has led the UK in making bold policy choices, such as the ban on smoking in public places. Our Climate Change Act includedthe most ambitious emissions reduction targets of any legislature in the world and, as Health Secretary, I was heavily involved in the campaign to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol, which we knew would play a key role in tackling Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with drink – another world leading measure.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.glasgowsouthandeastwoodextra webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"As the Scottish Parliament prepares to celebrate its th anniversary, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on both its journey and her own.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on  years of the Scottish Parliament viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"It took a decade of hard work to make this policy a reality and I am personally very proud of the campaign, working with stakeholders, to persuade MSPs to back minimum pricing, as well as overcoming a legal challenge that went all the way to the Supreme Court.I am personally committed to making sure every child and young person in Scotland gets the best possible start in le. We have already delivered an increase in free, high quality childcare for all three and four year olds and extending entitlement to eligible two year olds and will increase it further before the end of this parliament.Scotland has also become a much safer society under devolution. Recorded crime has fallen to some of the lowest levels seen since the s. In particular, non-sexual violent crime has fallen substantially, thanks in no small part to the excellent work of the Violence Reduction Unit, which was established over a decade ago with cross-party support and is now being copied across the UK.In recent years, new powers have come to the Scottish Parliament and with those powers come increased responsibilities for MSPs to deliver for the people ofScotland.Income tax policy is now a key feature of the annual Scottish budget. We’ve used these new powers to introduce a fairer income tax policy, with most people paying less tax than they would south of the border – while continuing to raise revenue to support investment in the economy and public services.Last year Parliament passed the wide-ranging Social Security Act, paving the way for devolution of a number of benefits, as well as creating a number of newbenefits such as increased carers’ support allowance and best start grants for families with young children – and a new social security agency to deliver them. This new agency has a culture of dignity and respect at its heart and early feedback from service users has been overwhelmingly positive.I also appointed the first gender balanced Scottish cabinet and we are encouraging more women to stand for parliament, and bring a better balance to ourpublic le.Over the course of the Scottish Parliament consistent action has been taken to ensure communities have the opportunity to own the land they live and work on.Many communities have benefited from the right to buy that now covers rural and urban communities.Of course, the foundation of our country is a strong and resilient economy. That’s why we have slashed or abolished business rates for , premises –saving almost £. billion for our small businesses.We have invested in our infrastructure with all governments building new schools and hospitals and, of course, the iconic Queensferry Crossing.And, to help make sure we have the workforce we need for years to come, we have delivered just over a quarter of a million Modern Apprenticeships in the lastdecade.In April this year, new legislation to tackle controlling and coercive behaviour came into effect, giving Scotland some of the most robust domesticabuse legislation in the world.I’m also proud of the many steps we’ve taken to make Scotland a fairer society, including the introduction of equal marriage rights – attending one of the first same-sex weddings in Scotland is a memory that will stay with me for a long time.And we all worked together over many years to help Glasgow successfully host the  Commonwealth Games. This helped to inspire Scots to get more active,delivered new facilities and put Scotland on the world stage. It was a sight to behold.My final achievement is perhaps harder to quanty. There is no doubt that the re-establishment of Scotland’s parliament has profoundly changed our political culture for the better, with our nation’s lawmakers much more accessible to those they represent. It has also enabled us to have conversations we wouldn’t have had and to debate our own future, with the  independence referendum generating an increase in democratic engagement.Looking ahead, we now face the signicant challenges posed by Brexit which, of course, Scotland’s people and parliament overwhelmingly oppose. Given the long-term damage that Brexit will cause to Scotland, and the material change in circumstances this represents, I believe it is only fair that people are given the choice of whether to become an independent country. Indeed, the current SNP Government was elected on a clear manesto commitment that people should be offered that choice should Scotland be taken out of the EU against its will. Polls consistently show that people living here believe the decision on whether to hold a referendum should be a matter for Holyrood and not Westminster. Twenty years after it came into being, that is an important measure of the way people in Scotland view the Parliament and one that the new UK Prime Minister would do well to heed."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"June ,  at : amCompetition: John Deere Rolly kids’ tractor, loader and trailer — suitable for age .+ For details on how to enter see this week#s edition of The Orcadian.

They want to hear from the owners of all kinds of properties, from urban studio flats to historic country piles. From Shetland to Stranraer and Orkney to Oban, prime properties from all over Scotland will be in the frame.Jo Street, commissioner for BBC Scotland, said: “We’re delighted to announce a second series of Scotland’s Home of the Year. It isn’t just about showing off million-pound properties – it’s about truly celebrating what people have done to turn their house into a home, expressing their iniduality through their design, flair and imagination. We saw some cracking houses over the course of series one and there are far more gems to uncover for series two.”The first series of Scotland’s Home of the Year was broadcast on the new BBC Scotland channel in April and May this year.The series has since seen its audience continue to grow on iPlayer with requests to view so far hitting more than a quarter of a million – ,.The format saw three judges – architect Michael Angus, interior designer Anna Campbell-Jones and lestyle blogger Kate Spiers – travel theand breadth of Scotland to discover architectural gems and unearth some stunning interiors. Both traditional and contemporary properties were put under the microscope and judges considered everything from a one-bedroom apartment to a centuries-old country castle … and everything in between.Each home was scored on ality, distinctiveness and clever design and from seven finalists, one clear winner of series one was chosen – the White House in Kirkcudbright, Dumfries and Galloway, created by proud owner Lesley Smith and her late husband Mike.Series two will have a slightly longer run than series one with nine -minute heats, each featuring three properties from a specic part of the country. The  houses featured will then be whittled down to a final nine which will go under the spotlight in an hour-long final episode.Gerard Costello, executive producer, IWC Media said: “We are thrilled that Scotland’s Home of the Year is ing to the BBC Scotland channel. The first series was a joy to make and we have only scratched the surface of the beautul and distinctive homes Scotland has to offer. We can’t wait to get started.”If you’d like to be considered for the next series of Scotland’s Home of the Year, you can get in touch at scotlandshomes@IWCMedia copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There has to be a commitment to reducing the numbers of geese and not just keeping the population at its current level.“This means we need to see funding that lasts long enough to ensure that the measures take effect and that farmers have confidence that their concerns are being seriously addressed.“I will be closely monitoring the new measures being taken forward by SNH in the coming months and at the outcomes of SNH’s study on goose management in the islands.“I also look forward to hearing how the Minister intends to ensure that efforts going forward are sustained so that farmers in Orkney can have confidence that the Scottish Government are serious on dealing with the problem of excessive geese numbers”.Mr McArthur said that, while the announcement of measures was welcome, progress on the issue will take time and government must remain committed to finding a resolution.He said: “It is clear that the minister recognises the importance of tackling this issue and the scale of the challenge involved. While the package of measures announced by SNH today is welcome, it is also clear that it is going to take time to achieve the objective of bringing greylag goose numbers down to a sustainable level.“That is why it is so important that the Scottish Government now stays the course. Ongoing funding will be needed to support the work of the local management group and allow coordination to take place.#The minister agreed to look at ways in which this might be achieved and to come back with more detailed thoughts in due course.“I am encouraged by the developments today but also determined to make sure that this now translates into effective action to address what has been a long-running issue affecting Orkney’s farming community”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

One of the new measures is a study looking at how the birds# numbers could be brought down to .SNH have committed to supporting egg oiling and corralling activities, with an expert in corralling geese to visit the county to advise farmers on how this could be used and training for egg oiling being made available.Contractors will also be funded to carry out egg oiling at specic areas next season.As mentioned, a study will also be carried out to create an Orkney-wide plan to reduce geese numbers. According to SNH, this study will consider the practicalities, cost and location for a number of possible measures bring the birds# population down.SNH also elaborated on a previous announcement of an expansion to the licence to shoot the birds, with a new Orkney-specic licence to cover the period from February  to June  — outside the open shooting season and the time covered by the General Licence, which allows Greylag geese to be shot from July  to August  and during the open season from September  to January .This means farmers will no longer be required to apply to the SNH Licensing team for an out-of-season licence but can make a quick call to the Kirkwall office for permission.The new measures include volunteer shooters being available again this year in August and September to undertake goose control on farms which are experiencing issues with geese.SNH is considering further changes to licences, in particular, a mechanism to increase bag limits, and a possible extension to the General Licence, currently available in July and August, to include May and June.Finally, volunteer shooters will be available again this year in August and September to undertake goose control on farms which are experiencing issues with geese.Graham Neville, SNH’s Northern Isles and North Highland area manager, said: “We understand increases in greylag goose numbers have seriously impacted on farmers and crofters on Orkney. Working closely with the local goose management group, we have committed to measures that will help protect crops, while still maintaining the balance between conservation, farming and hunting.”News of support for these measures also followed an announcement earlier in the week that the sale of goose meat and funding have been extended in Orkney and the Western Isles, until the end of .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The concern is that, although resurfacing and general maintenance continues to be done, this may not fix the issue in the long-term.OIC has now engaged a specialist team to look at the issue, who#ll be deploying state of the art equipment to take radar readings through the causeway down to sea level, providing valuable information on its deep make-up.This data will then be used to come up with options for short and long-term maintenance of the road, with general inspections and periodic minor repairs continuing until the results of the survey are fully considered.Due to the nature of the work, there will unfortunately be road closures and a convoy system in place on the evening of Monday  July. The work has been scheduled for between .pm and .pm to minimise disruption, by ensuring that traffic from the last Pentland Ferries arrival has passed through. Delays of up to  minutes are possible.The work will begin with coring taking place, which sees four small cylindrical sections of the road removed, analysed and then replaced. This allows the contractors to identy the make-up of the top layers of the road and calibrate their equipment accordingly.The second stage of the work sees a specialist vehicle driven at usual traffic speed across the barrier a number of times, taking video and radar footage as it moves.The third and final stage sees a piece of hand-pushed equipment moved across the barrier at walking speed taking Ground Penetrating Radardata of the full depth of the structure as it goes. The GPR system emits short duration pulses of electromagnetic energy. These pulses or scans are transmitted into the road and reflections from material boundaries or embedded featuresare detected by a receiver. Through analysis of the reflected signals a continuous D model of the Barrier can then be provided, determining material thickness and construction changes.  This should therefore determine what,any, underlying defects there are within the matrix of the causeway. The survey allows data to be taken down to depths of five metres.The video survey will provide a high resolution and spatially referenced video to enable the visual condition of the surface to be assessed to sub-metre accuracy. This will be matched with the GPR survey to produce a visual model to pinpoint anomalies in the surfacing.John Wrigley, OIC roads and environmental services manager said: #As a key element of Orkney#s travel network, we keep a keen eye on the state of this road.#Our ongoing monitoring has shown that the surface continues to deteriorate despite previous interventions — which would suggest that resurfacing is not going to fix the problem in the long-term.#We now need to carry out this important piece of work to seethere could be a more deep-rooted reason for the issues — which should lead us to an appropriate and cost-effective solution.##Previous survey work has given us detailed information on the top layers of the road, but this new survey will look deep into the construction for voids or other potential failures.  We apologise for the delays that this survey will cause on the night of  July # but we#re sure that local road users will understand that this is necessary as part of finding a long term solution to improving the structure of the road.  We#d ask that road users take their time in the vicinity on the night and would also take the opportunity to remind people of the mph advisory speed limit that already exists on the first Barrier.#East Mainland, South Ronaldsay and Burray councillor, Andrew Drever added: “I accept the concerns that have been raised over a period of time, particularly by motorcyclists, and I am pleased to see this piece of work getting underway.#Once we have the survey results, we’ll be able to look at options and hopefully find a way forward in a short a timescale as possible.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The aim of the pilots was to reduce goose impacts by managing their numbers and by selling goose meat locally.SNH has said the studies confirmed that resident greylag goose populations can absorb substantial losses without any effect on their conservation status.The sale of the meat and funding have also been extended for the Western Isles.Sally Thomas, SNH’s Director of People  Nature, said: “Wild geese are an important part of Scotland’s nature, but their rapid rise in numbers has been challenging for farmers and crofters. We understand it’s still an issue in some areas, with a dficult balance between conservation, farming and hunting.“Our goal is to give farmers and crofters the tools they need to safeguard their crops, by giving them the control to manage goose numbers sustainably through sport shooting, other control, or selling goose meat for profit.”The pilots are now being extended until the end of . The  transitional Challenge Fund will help local goose groups develop business models to generate income from the sale of resident greylag goose meat in the long term.SNH has also said that they and local goose management groups are also exploring other options together, such as more flexible licences when necessary, a review of bag limits in some areas, and egg-oiling.The pilot studies cost about £, over five years to March  and an additional £, to March .

If he becomes Prime Minister, Boris Johnson must not join the growing club of illiberal world leaders.Liberalism is “obsolete”, Donald Trump is a “talented person”, “traitors must be punished” and one of the benefits of the war in Syria is Russia now has battle-hardened soldiers.For those in any doubt about the true nature of Vladimir Putin and the growing threat to liberal democracy posed by the despotic Russian president and his fellow travellers around the world, then his interview with the Financial Times must surely be a wake-up call.As world leaders gathered for the G meeting in Japan, Putin had good reason to feel confident in making the claim that liberalism is dying out.Russia’s annexation of Crimea, its military support for rebels in eastern Ukraine, including the missile that shot down a Malaysia Airlines passenger plane, the use of nerve agents in Salisbury, resulting in the death of local woman Dawn Sturgess but not the intended target, former Russian spy Sergei Skripal, and other affronts to democracy, human rights and the rule of law have been met with little more than a few sanctions and meek acquiescence by the world’s democratic states. Appeasement is another word, heavy with history, that could be used.And so, in the manner of a naughty schoolboy who thinks he’s being clever, Putin, speaking about about Skripal’s attempted murder, told the FT that “traitors must be punished. I am not saying that the Salisbury incident is the way to do it ... but traitors must be punished”.: Russia is creating a new Cold War – leader comment: A denunciation of Donald Trump – leader comment: The UK needs Brexit rebels with a cause – leader commentTreating the situation as a joke is a sign Putin knows he will not face any real consequences, despite Theresa May’s weak call yesterday for Russia to end its “irresponsible and destabilising activity”. Fat chance.As expected, the meeting of Putin and Trump sparked an outbreak of bonhomie. “Don’t meddle in the election, please,” the US President said as he wagged a comedy finger at the grinning Putin. Perhaps still inwardly glowing from the praise for him in the FT interview, Trump said it was a “great honour” to be with Putin, adding that they had a “very, very good relationship”.Other people Trump has a good relationship with include Conservative leadership candidate Boris Johnson and Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage. Given the latter’s regular attacks on the “liberal elite”, it’s pretty clear he’s a member of the “illiberal elite”.Johnson’s position, however, is less certain. He was a liberal internationalist when it was prudent to be one as London mayor, now he plays the hardcore Brexiteer.When casting their vote for party leader and therefore Prime Minister, Conservative members will need to guess what Johnson’s values actually are. Are they willing to take the chance that the leader of this country might soon, like Trump, be striking up the friendliest of relations with Putin If Brexit Britain joins the growing illiberal alliance around the world, it will only increase the isolation of the European Union as one of the last globally powerful bastions of liberal democracy, weakened from within as it is by far-right leaders like Hungary’s Viktor Orban.And it was the EU’s President, Donald Tusk, who gave one of the strongest responses to Putin’s declaration of ideological victory.“Whoever claims that liberal democracy is obsolete also claims that freedoms are obsolete, that the rule of law is obsolete and that human rights are obsolete,” he said. “What I find really obsolete are authoritarianism, personality cults, the rule of oligarchs ...” But sadly, Tusk still felt the need to add, “... evensometimes they may seem effective”.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"why teachers really do deserve their long summer holiday kevan christie","story":"Teachers often work beyond their stated hours in a job many of us would not want to do, so we shouldn#t begrudge them time off during the summer break, writes Kevan Christie.“What’s the best thing about teaching ”“July and August!” – so the old joke goes.But as the schools split up and many teachers prepare to spend time with their own kids, busman’s holiday style, while catching up on their drinking, the time has come to ask: do they really deserve such a long break I’ll put you out your misery – a resounding yes is the answer. Andyou don’t agree, try standing up in front of  children, all wearing circulation restricitng black Superdry clothes, chewing gum and clutching their phones like a Catholic nun holding her rosary beads.Five days a week. Not many of us could handle it – having to perform to that level day in, day out. No scanning social media, no nipping out for a quick coffee and you can’t even go to the loo when you want. At this point, I must confess to knowing next to nothing about education as regular readers will attest, although I have a we and sister who are teachers and a dad who was a headmaster. I think you call them “Principals” now.: Cameron Wyllie: Face the facts, some kids are just smarter than others: Cameron Wyllie: Teachers now are better than the past’s ‘real characters’This was of mixed benefit to me growing up. On the plus side, it was great when faither brought home the school video recorder for six weeks or more in the summer holidays allowing my -year-old self and nine-year-old brother to catch up on classic slasher horror movies like The Hills of Eyes and Last House on the Left.And his school belt, the Lochgelly Tawse, was a handy weapon to threaten my brother with during our daily battles, while acting as a deterent against setting fire to the garden hut as I went through my childhood arsonist phase. As you do, boys will be boys.But he disappeared each Saturday morning to take his school football team and the regional Lothian Schools select team on a Sunday, all in the name of extracurricular activities.Then there were the endless hours he spent ‘timetabling’ classes for the whole school, before computers a seemingly impossible Krypton Factor-style pursuit that definitely helped him gain promotion.This week alone my we has spent two nights in a tent taking pupils on a camping trip and when I phoned my sister to ask her about teaching she was in France on a school excursion to the killing fields of World War One. This led to me phoning social services to complain about neglect but all I got was the engaged tone.Other teachers I have spoken to say that the working time agreement – setting aside  hours for collegiate activities like parents meetings and preparing course work over the  weeks of the school term – is nowhere near enough and they never get everything done. The reality is that hard-working teachers do a lot more than these hours and need time to have a le.Teachers often have to assume the role of social worker, police officer, doctor and de facto parents for children with troubled home lives. But who is looking after the growing number of teachers experiencing severe stress that impacts on their mental health and wellbeing All of this while under extreme scrutiny from the Scottish Government who have made education their number one focus, although their report card to date is certainly of the ‘must try harder’ iety.They certainly haven’t made the lives of teachers any easier with their Curriculum for Excellence and the ongoing recruitment crisis, reduction in subject choice and increase in multi-level classes in senior secondary schools.All of this against the backdrop of a poverty-related attainment gap that makes Nicola Sturgeon’s claims about making education a priority ring hollow.The recent hard-fought pay rise that works out at  per cent over three years – but needs a teacher to explain it to you properly – was a decent result.But too many Bright Young Things are choosing well-paid jobs in the private sector and someone with a much-valued maths degree will quickly go on to make a six-figure salary in the financial industry rather than -odd grand as a teacher in their first few years.“Aye, but they get loads of holidays” doesn’t really cut it and no-one goes into teaching for the money.The job seems like more of a vocation, an increasingly old-fashioned concept that harks back to gentler times when teachers were genuinely held in high-esteem.They were pillars of society, valued in the community and listened to by parents who accepted the teachers word over that of their kids. Not so now where the prevailing culture is to blame the teacherthe pupil doesn’t get straight As. We’ve come a long way from the ‘help the jannie class’ I remember from my school days at Leith Academy, where a single file of kids deemed to have ‘learning dficulties’ helped the janitor pick up litter from the playground.Either that or they got sent to something called ‘Theatre Arts’ that sounded way better than conventional lessons. Yip, that’s how we dealt with complex mental health issues back in the s.Outdoor pursuits for us was caneoing in Leith Docks – not the Water of Leith may I add – the actual docks, where we were up to our necks in sh***.Teachers are now called upon to cater for a wide-iety of pupils, many of whom require additional support in overcrowded classrooms all in the name of inclusion. There’s no punting them onto the janitor these days.Looking in from the outside, teaching unfortunately seems like one of those vital jobs like nursing and caring where the people who chose to do them because they want to help others are often treated shabbily.“They do it, so you don’t have to” is a mantra that could be applied to teaching.And, with this in mind, we shouldn’t begrudge them a single day of their holidays.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"dani garavelli marshae jones case shows us is close to dystopian nightmare","story":"That the victim of a shooting has been charged for the manslaughter of her baby is a reminder of how close the US is to a dystopian nightmare, writes Dani Garavelli.Marshae Jones could not have known she was about to lose her unborn daughter when she confronted Ebony Jemison in the parking lot of a Dollar General Store in Pleasant Grove, Alabama, on  December last year. She harboured no ill-will to her baby nor did she fire the bullet that killed her. \u2028With four months to go, Jones had already picked a name: Marlaysia. She must have been distraught when she miscarried shortly after being shot in the stomach. Yet she is the one indicted by a grand jury on manslaughter charges. Jemison, who pulled the trigger during their brawl, has been absolved of all responsibility. This is what it means to be pregnant, black and or poor in the dystopia that passes for the US today. Reduced to a vessel for procreation, you cede your rights to the bundle of cells inside you. Your onlyis to protect your foetus. Andyou err, you can expect, not sympathy, but the wrath of Gilead. : Dani Garavelli: Time to call a ceasefire as gender debate gets nastyJones is not the first expectant mother to face charges in connection with the accidental death of her foetus in the US. In the past  years, prosecutors have brought a succession of cases against women whose have suffered miscarriages as a result of drug use or car accidents.: Dani Garavelli: Natalie McGarry leaves a trail of betrayalA four-year-old can shoot his six-year-old sister with a gun he finds in the dashboard of a car without charges being filed against the parents. But woe betide a pregnant woman who fails to fasten her seat-belt.Your unborn baby doesn’t even have to die for you to be persecuted. When Christine Taylor arrived in ER after falling down the stairs at her home in Iowa, she made the mistake of telling nurses her marriage was on the brink of collapse and she was worried about the prospect of bringing up her children alone. That night, she was arrested in connection with attempted foeticide she spent two nights in jail before the charges were dropped.If that sounds like something from a TV drama, wait until you hear about Elizabeth Mort. In , her newborn was seized after poppy seeds on a bagel caused her to fail a drugs test Seinfeld  years earlier. Mort later won , in damages, but not until her baby daughter had spent five days in foster care.A pregnant woman in the UK can feel asshe is being hectored about what she should and shouldn’t eat – no paté, no blue cheese, no alcohol – but in the US, scrutiny is all-pervasive and mercy non-existent. Under His Eye, indeed.As the first expectant mother to be charged in relation to an act carried out by someone , Jones marks a new phase in the dehumanisation of the pregnant. “Let’s not lose sight that the unborn baby is the victim here,” said Lt Danny Reid of Pleasant Grove police, ignoring the plight of the human incubator. “She had no choice in being brought unnecessarily into a fight where she was relying on her mother for protection.”Butbeing shot while in possession of an occupied womb can see you charged, where might this lead  Could walking through a notoriously dodgy neighbourhood after dark constitute reckless endangerment  Whatyou work the night-sht  Whatthat dodgy neighbourhood is your home That this scandal should have unfolded in Alabama is no coincidence. The state has been chipping away at hard-earned reproductive rights for years. In , it passed a law outlawing dilation and evacuation – the procedure most commonly used to carry out terminations in the second trimester, thus effectively reducing the time limit from  to  weeks. Then, in May, emboldened by the president’s Pro Choice pronouncements ,  of the  male Republicans who sit on the -member state senate voted for an almost total ban on abortions, even in cases of rape and incest.This onslaught is not confined to Alabama. Other laws, including bans on abortions where a foetal heartbeat can be heard , have been passed in Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota and Ohio.As always, such laws have a disproportionate impact on poor, black women, who are the least able to afford to go out of state for a termination.At present, these restrictive laws are not being enforced . The stated aim of the politicians is to trigger challenges which might eventually end up in the Supreme Court. Their hope is that the appointment of conservatives Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh might lead to a reversal of Roe v Wade, the  ruling that established the right of a woman to choose whether or not to have an abortion.So far, this seems unlikely. Some circuit courts have already dismissed the most restrictive laws as unconstitutional. And the Supreme Court seems to be in little hurry to enter the fray. Last week, the justices declined to hear Alabama’s attempt to re-institute the ban on dilation and evacuation procedures.Even so, there are no grounds for complacency. Experts warn one circuit court upholding a foetal heartbeat ban might be all it takes for the Supreme Court to decide it ought to wade in.And then, who knows  Giving his opinion on the DE case last week, Justice Clarence Thomas, of Anita Hill fame, implied,the case was heard, he would support a ban. “The notion that anything in the Constitution prevents states from passing laws prohibiting the dismembering of a living child is implausible,” he wrote. The choice of that emotive phrase – “dismembering a living child” – is telling it connects with a central plank of the anti-abortion campaign strategy – the promotion of the concept of foetal “personhood”.This is something Thomas himself touched on earlier this year when he insisted laws allowing abortion on the grounds of race, sex, or disability were a form of eugenics revivalism. As Jeannie Suk Gersen wrote in the New Yorker: “If the right to be free of discrimination on the basis of race, sex, or disability can be made relevant to a foetus, then foetuses are figured as entities with anti-discrimination rights – like people.” The indictment of Jones for the manslaughter of her unborn baby is not directly linked to abortion laws. Indeed, had Jones chosen to have a termination, she could have done so without repercussions. It is losing the baby she had chosen to keep that has caused her problems.However, her indictment serves an important purpose in furthering the aims of the anti-abortion movement. It reinforces the Pro Choice orthodoxy: that foetuses are fully-fledged human beings whose needs must be prioritised.The irony is that Jones appears already to have regarded her unborn daughter as an inidual, deserving of a memorial. As she waits to find outthe charges against her will be pursued, Marlaysia’s ashes sit on her grandmother’s mantelpiece. The plaque beside them reads: “Love one another.” There is precious little of that compassion on display in the US today.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"patrick harvie says scots people are sovereign in address to queen","story":"The Glasgow MSP, a committed republican, also declined to formally address the Monarch as \"Your majesty\" as he spoke in Parliament during a ceremony to mark  years of devolution.Interview: Patrick Harvie, leader of the Scottish Green Party\"As we look ahead, we must again grow into the role thats needed of a modern Parliament in exploring new participative forms of debate like the planned Citizens Assembly, bringing the voices of the sovereign people of Scotland into their Parliament - actively part of the decision making progress.\"Read more: MSPs vote to keep Queen as head of stateScotland splits from UKIn the UK constitution, the Queen is the Sovereign and Head of State, although it isWestminster and the devolved parliaments which make and pass legislation.The Greens co-leader has made his republican beliefs clear in the past and took his affirmation when being sworn in as an MSP in  by stating that his party \"supports the principle of an elected head of state.\"©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"poorest scots left behind as progress stalls on all un development goals","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The Scottish Government is at risk of failing to meet its pledge to deliver United Nations# goals on sustainable development because of deepening economic inequality, according to a new report drawn up by  charities and public sector organisations.The report, spearheaded by Oxfam Scotland, the University of the West of Scotland and the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations, claims the government is set to miss targets across the board.And the authors say that despite last week’s announcement to introduce a new income supplement to tackle child poverty a year ahead of schedule, the “signicant powers” of the Scottish Parliament are not being used to their full extent.The sustainable development goals are the UN’s blueprint to ensure “a world free from poverty, injustice and discrimination”. By , the UN says, countries should have addressed  global challenges including eliminating poverty and hunger, tackling climate change and environmental degradation, and ensuring gender equality and peace and justice, with the aim of “leaving no-one behind”.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon made Scotland one of the first countries in  to pledge to deliver those goals and embedded them in the government’s National Performance Framework. But the report “On Target for  ” states that reality does not match rhetoric, and the slow progress of delivery is hitting Scotland’s poor the hardest.Rhiannon Sims, of Oxfam\u2028Scotland, said: “These goals will only succeedevery country signed up to them puts in place the measures needed to drive change. Whilst there is clear policy commitment in Scotland, more needs to be done to achieve the  vision.“The snapshot assessments provided by organisations working on each UN goal show a cross-cutting theme of inequality – geographical inequalities health inequalities inequality between dferent groups based on gender, race, ability and, in particular, wealth inequalities. Taken together, it is clear that the negative effects of slow progress on the goals are felt more acutely by low-income households.” She added: “Despite welcome policy attention on poverty and inequality in Scotland, we’ve yet to deliver meaningful reductions in the gap between rich and poor. In fact, the incomes of the top  per cent of the population are over a quarter more than the bottom  per cent put together. Far from narrowing, income inequality in Scotland is deepening.“That’s true for the distribution of wealth too, including financial, property, pensions and physical wealth. And those at the sharp end often have no wealth at all.”Sims said although “many important levers remain reserved to Westminster, the Scottish Parliament does have signicant powers which should be used to their full extent”.In the report, Nourish Scotland says there has been little progress in reducing the numbers of infants who are overweight and there are “substantial inequalities in child unhealthy weight” across the country, while there is “no strategic plan” to phase out foodbanks. Citizens Advice Scotland calls for more “targeted financial support” for those households struggling to pay water and sewerage charges.Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said it was “extremely disappointing” the government could miss the goals. He said: “From a failure to tackle educational inequalities to the real challenges facing staff in our health service, there is a clear picture of a government who would rather put off until tomorrow what it could be doing today.”Scottish Greens climate spokesperson Mark Ruskell said the report must be taken seriously. He said: “Twenty years after devolution I would question how much progress successive Scottish governments have made on tackling these goals in a joined up way. The top goal of government remains economic growth, which has failed to trickle down and lt people out of poverty.”A Scottish Government spokesperson said: “We are committed to reducing poverty and inequality, which is why we were one of the first nations to sign up to the sustainable development goals and provide international leadership on reducing inequality.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"queen calls on scottish parliament to honour opponents views","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The Queen has called for tolerance among Scotland#s politicians with an appeal to #honour# the views of those they disagree with.The monarch spoke out as she addressed MSPs at Holyrood yesterday to mark the th anniversary of devolution, at a time of constitutional upheaval over Brexit and plans for a fresh referendum on Scottish independence.As the SNP Government seeks to hold a vote on leaving the UK next year, the Queen called for the Scottish Parliament to “strengthen the bonds of partnership” at home and abroad.: Patrick Harvie says Scots people are sovereign in address to Queen\u2028The ceremony in the Scottish Parliament’s main Holyrood debating chamber was also addressed by Nicola Sturgeon, who suggested further constitutional change is on the way, while Labour’s Richard Leonard pledged to “defend devolution”.The Queen told MSPs that Holyrood is at the “centre of public le” as a home for “passionate debate and discussion”.: Queen says MSPs at Holyrood must honour \"dfering views\"\u2028She said: “It is perhaps worth reflecting that at the heart of the word ‘Parliament’ lies its original meaning – a place to talk.

But of course it must also be a place to listen – a place to hear views that inevitably may dfer quite considerably, one from another – and a place to honour those views.”The Queen, accompanied by her son the Prince of Wales, who is known in Scotland as the Duke of Rothesay, said she had “watched Scotland grow and prosper” over the past two decades.She added: “As we look to the future, it is my sincere hope that this parliament, and all those who come to serve in it, will use the power of this chamber to celebrate those invisible pillars of our communities, and follow their example by working tirelessly to improve people’s lives, and strengthen the bonds of friendship and partnership both at home and abroad.”Almost a quarter of Scotland’s  MSPs stayed away from the event. The  absentees included Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie, who was on a family holiday. Tavish Scott was forced to stand in, which saw the Shetland MP instead give the traditional “leader’s address” to the Parliament. However, it was a better turnout than the tenth anniversary celebration, when  MSPs snubbed the event.Sturgeon insisted the Scottish Parliament was now the “centre of our nation’s public le”.“We have become the democratic institution that people look to reflect their priorities, their values, hopes and dreams,” she said.“And now we look forward to a new decade in which this parliament will build new institutions and I’m sure seek further change and development.”She added “As we do that, in times of course when politics has been more isive and confrontational than ever, I hope we will maintain our commitment to working together in the common good.”The event yesterday saw musical performances from musician Phil Cunningham and singer Karen Matheson, while Scots Makar Jackie Kay recited a new poem written for the occasion entitled The Long View.The royal party was met at Holyrood by presiding officer Ken Macintosh, with the Queen then going on to greet the First Minister and other party leaders.Current and former MSPs were present, including ex-presiding officers George Reid and Tricia Marwick, as well as Scottish Secretary David Mundell. Some of the Scots who were born on  July  – the day the Scottish Parliament was officially opened – also attended.Macintosh said that over the past  years Holyrood had “grown into a self-confident institution”. And he noted some of the parliament’s achievements, including “the smoking ban and the minimum pricing of alcohol, free personal care and the abolition of tuition fees, the removal of Section  and the introduction of equal marriage”.Macintosh added: “I am proud of that legislative record, but just as important is that the parliament itself has evolved to reflect the needs of the people we serve.”Tory leader Ruth Davidson said Holyrood has become a fixture of Scotland’s “civic and political le”.“This chamber has proved itself adept at both reactive legislation and with leading the national debate,” she said.“There is consensus that, as a process, devolution has made our country stronger.”Leonard said it was his party that delivered devolution for Scotland.

Then they would have an informed and considered opinion, not just the usual Greenwash so popular with the ignorant. If gted they may even go on to contribute with useful research and technological ideas so unlike are present green, ignorant and wholly ill-informed flock in thecouncil chamberAn area of industry which has not been looked into with any proper statistical information is thisof Agriculture. This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form.

The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed.

Lavishly staged by a professional creative team, this stirring Grand Opera House Summer Youth Production is the most ambitious to date, bringing together  of Northern Ireland’s creatives. Supported by a -piece orchestra, the impressive score will feature all the big numbers including I Still Believe, The Movie in my Mind and the iconic The American Dream.-year-old Aquinas pupil Lára Mulgrew will perform the role of Ellen in the stage show. No stranger to the Grand Opera House stage, Lára performed aged nine the role of Molly in their production of Annie. Lára described the audition process “as very straight forward” and how it will be “wonderful” to portray the role of Ellen come July.“I hadn’t seen the production before but was able to watch it on Youtube. It’s going to be a total of six performances and it’s a very mature role,” she said. “It’s definitely the most challenging role I’ve ever had to perform and it will be a great challenge to take on her maturity.”Methody College’s Louis Fitzpatrick will take on the role of American GI John Thomas, part of the battalion deployed in Saigon during the Vietnam War.“I heard about the auditions for Miss Saigon through a friend, I went for one audition and did well enough to get a call back. I was really ecstatic to learn I had got the part as I was performing Footloose at the time as part of the Belfast Youth and Drama Society, I joined in April  and the first production I did was Les Misérables.“I hadn’t watched the stage version before but was able to watch it on Amazon Prime.”The -year-old has just completed his A’levels in Moving Image, Politics and Drama and told the South Belfast News how he hopes to go on to study film at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland in Glasgow.Grand Opera House Chief Executive Ian Wilson added: “This is the ninth year that the Grand Opera House has staged its Summer Youth Production, and Miss Saigon® School Edition will be the biggest so far. It’s very rare for a theatre the size of the Grand Opera House to be granted the rights to the youth version, so it really is a brilliant opportunity to see the best up-and-coming musical theatre stars in one of the most popular musicals of all time.”For ticket information visit: www.goh"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"how divine mercy is local turning lives around","story":"FOUNDED in , the Divine Mercy group continues to go from strength to strength.Four years on, the group attracts weekly attendances of up to  people every Friday afternoon at Sacred Heart church in Glenview Street.The worship group helps those suffering with suicidalthoughts and addictions, using faith as a form of help.Thomas Stewart, who helped set up the group, explained more about the work the group does.“I set up the group with a friend, who  years ago lost his brother who took his own le through suicide,” he said.“It was a total shock to his family and he felt he needed to do something to help others with similar problems.“We started the Divine Mercy group up in  and it was just three of us. It is a time to reflect on le, listen to beautul songs, and a prayer session is also available afterwards for those who wish to get involved in that.“I think with the issues of addictions with drugs and alcohol becoming more of an issue in North Belfast, the Divine Mercy group offers something dferent to anyone who is seeking help.“Whatever is going on in your own le or your family’s le,your son or daughter is suicidal or has addiction problems, I would encourage you to come along to the Divine Mercy group.“There is help available, which is why people come back. It’s an outlet for people also and a comfort zone for them. The Divine Mercy gives these people hope.“There are young lads coming here who are broken in their lives. The reason we can draw them in is because we are all from dferent backgrounds and we are able to reach out to them.”One of the great successes of the Divine Mercy group has been the regular Cursillo residential weekends in Benburb.The Cursillo runs from a Thursday evening to a Sunday afternoon with participants able to meet people and explore their faith further in a serene and spiritual environment.Hugh Byrne, another key figure in the Divine Mercy group, said the Cursillo is a le-changing experience for those involved.“After three days, they are dferent people. It is truly a le-changing experience and I have seen that with people over the years.”Hugh is also responsible for talking to anyone who comes to the Divine Mercy group in order to offer help and advice.“I sit and have a chat with the lads every week,” he added.“If I get them to listen, that is the start. If we help turn one person’s le around, that is better than none.“I ask them how far they are in their addiction whether it would be alcohol or drugs.“Some people have fallen away but there have been a lot of successes. Relationships and marriages have been fixed and people have turned their lives around.“We also have good links with rehabilitation services and other helplines to point people towards further help.”At last Friday’s meeting, the group were joined by some American visitors who ed to Belfast a year on from experiencing the Divine Mercy group for the first time.Thomas says the success of the group has been extremely encouraging and a sign that they are on the right path.“It was great to see the visitors from the USA who were here last year and wanted to come back over again,” continued.“They are going back to spread the word about the work the group does.“The group can only get better. We started with just three people so we have come a long away in quite a short time.“People are coming back so we must be doing something right.“We have the prayers and so on and then we come out and sit and have tea, coffee and biscuits. It is great to see everyone bonding and talking to each other.“People don’t realise how powerful the Divine Mercy is. It doesn’t matter what is going on in your le. Ask for help and reach out to the Divine Mercy.”The Divine Mercy group meets every Friday at pm at Sacred Heart church in Glenview Street and all are welcome to come along."},{"url":null,"title":"brexits impact on many crossborder initiatives finally revealed in report","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, the -page mapping exercise gives an insight into the extent we could be impacted.The scope of areas highlighted is broad and includes everything from health, travel, waterways, animal movement and organised crime and drugs to benefit fraud, schooling, library provision and teacher and doctor qualications.For each of the  sectors, the document species the extent to which it is underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement as well as by existing EU legal and policy frameworks.In the case of the North West Cancer Centre, the report points out that the initiative was based on an intergovernmental agreement between Health Ministers from both jurisdictions.It says the centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, which opened in November , \"offers radiotherapy services closer to home for many patients from the north west, reducing their travel time signicantly\".Similarly, the All-Island Congenital Heart Disease Network is identied as ensuring that \"vulnerable children\" receive treatment on the island of Ireland. The network has a single surgical centre in Dublin and a specialist childrens cardiology centre in Belfast, supported by cardiology expertise in local hospitals. There is also cross-border cooperation on organ and tissues transplants. Nineteen areas are linked to the avoiding a hard border objective and include everything from customs and physical checks on live animals crossing the border to rules on movement of national treasures.Current EU rules \"stop national treasures from leaving the country and prevent illicit trafficking and looting\". Other less obvious areas mentioned in the report include the operation of cross-border taxis repatriation of waste and cross-border movement of waste, and even the management of Lough Erne eel stocks.It also species areas such as invasive alien species, chemicals regulation and wildfire initiatives.DUP MEP Diane Dodds said that in the majority of areas ongoing cross-border cooperation would be addressed by retaining the common travel area and pursuing an agreement on free trade and customs. \"In many cases, where frameworks are highly integrated, the circumstances are not unique to our province,\" she said.\"For instance the conditions required to operate both the Enterprise service between Dublin and Belfast and the Channel Tunnel will require a very similar technical agreement with Brussels. Genuine concerns in areas like agri-food and healthcare must be taken seriously.\"Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard said an expert  is not needed to show how disastrous a no-deal Brexit will be.

No formal or transparent selection process was used in her selection for appointment nor was she given a written contract of employment, statement of main terms and conditions or job description.During , following several years of signicant growth, the firm decided to consider promotions from associate solicitor grade to salaried partner. Mrs Mercer and two other colleagues were promoted to salaried partner later that year.However, the following year, when she applied for promotion to the role of an equity partner, she was told she did not meet the eligibility criteria. Mrs Mercer did not find out about the promotions of her comparators at the time they took effect on June , , because they had not been announced internally. Instead she learned about them around  through what she described as the \"office rumour mill\". When she enquired about applying for promotion to the next stage, she was informed that there would be no more movement in the firm for the foreseeable future.Mrs Mercer flagged ious issues about her pay during  and  and the fact that promotions were taking place without any formal or transparent selection process.In June  she informed one of firms partners that she wanted to be paid the same salary as her male comparators and to have her bonus calculated on the same terms as theirs. Mrs Mercer was later told that the firm had decided to defer the issue of her salary and bonus until the end of the financial year as part of a wider review of business and salaries. Following this she lodged an internal grievance, seeking equal pay with her comparators on the ground that she was performing like work with them. Her grievance was rejected as the firm was of the view that her work as a salaried partner was \"not as demanding as that of a salaried partner benefiting from a profit share arrangement\". The legal practice accepted that Mrs Mercer was receiving less remuneration than her male colleagues but did not accept that she was undertaking like work with them. It contended that, although she and her male counterparts were all qualied solicitors, there were signicant dferences in the work they and Mrs Mercer were undertaking both in respect of legal work and other responsibilities.In addition, the respondent contended that,Mrs Mercer proved that she was undertaking like work with her comparators, there were genuine material factors which were not the dference of sex and which explained and justied any dferences in pay.The tribunal found that Mrs Mercer was employed on like work with all her comparators going back six years to June .The firm was ordered to pay her £, in respect of the dference between her gross annual salary of £, and the modied amount of £, going forward. She will also receive £, arrears of annual salary falling six years before the date of her claim in June  along with interest of £, on arrears."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland man norman surplus completes first roundtheworld autogyro flight","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

It is for democratic politicians in the democratic world to do so,” he said.The chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee Damian Collins said Sir Nick was wrong to say there was no evidence that Russia used Facebook to interfere in the referendum.“He is technically wrong on that point which he should know,” he told BBC Radio ’s Today programme.“We asked Facebook whether there was any evidence of Russians buying ads during the referendum. There was – which they shared with us – on a very small scale, but nevertheless it was there.”He added: “There has been no proper audit done during the referendum. There is certainly evidence of suspicious Russian activity during the referendum and where.”"},{"url":null,"title":"spall says he could be an artist in parallel universe at lowry film premiere","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mr Cooper himself believed that the events of that day  years ago irretrievably changed the course of history in Northern Ireland.Another stalwart of the Civil Rights era in Derry, Dermie McClenaghan said: “Ivan was one of the most courageous people I have ever known. In the context of the Civil Rights struggle in the north, to say that he went out on a limb is hardly enough.”A Book of Condolence in honour of Ivan Cooper was also opened at the Guildhall yesterday by Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council Michaela Boyle.Ivan Cooper’s funeral service will take place at St Peter’s Church of Ireland tomorrow at noon and his remains will be interred at Altnagelvin Cemetery afterwards.Mr Cooper is survived by his we Frances, daughters Sinead and Bronagh, son-in-law Conor and grandchildren Cashel and Luca.Ivan Cooper hailed from Kilaloo near to village of Claudy in County Derry just a few miles from the city. Born into a working-class Protestant family in January , Mr Cooper’s family moved to Derry’s Bogside when he was around -years-old.He was briefly a member of the Claudy Young Unionist Association, but in April of  he joined the Northern Ireland Labour Party .His first foray into electoral politics also came in  when he stood as a NILP candidate at the Stormont general election. Although he attracted a good degree of cross community support, he wasn’t elected.Ivan Cooper’s lelong commitment to non-violence as a political methodology made him a natural character to fit within the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association .

One of his first major public pronouncements came in the summer of that year and characterised the fundamental principles of the entire movement.At a protest meeting in the foyer of the Guildhall he said that Protestants and Catholics should stand up for their rights together “as the blacks in America were fighting.”The unication of people away from their religious denominations would remain the dominant feature of Ivan Cooper’s political activism throughout his  years. He was convinced that both communities in Northern Ireland could work together for common goals. However, some within the Protestant and unionist community viewed this stance as nationalist in outlook and tainted him as a traitor.Nevertheless, Ivan Cooper continued his agitation based on the Civil Rights  and after the RUC attack on the October  march in , he ignored a month-long Stormont government ban on parades in Derry.However, following violence after a number of marches in the city, Cooper called for an end to spontaneous demonstrations. As confrontations between demonstrators and the RUC continued to escalate in early  after a People’s Democracy march was attacked at Burntollet, residents of the Bogside cordoned the area off with barricades.Whilst Ivan Cooper managed to persuade locals to dismantle the barriers, the chances of redeeming an already tense political situation had probably already gone. As the sectarianism he had fought so hard to keep at bay crept steadily back into the issues at hand, most Protestant people who had supported NICRA backed away from the movement.At the Northern Ireland general election of , Cooper was elected as an Independent MP for Mid-Derry and in doing so unseated the sitting Nationalist Party representative Paddy Gormley.The Battle of the Bogside began on August ,  after violence erupted following the annual Relief of Derry parade by the Apprentice Boys.As the first of three days of fighting grew increasingly heavy, Cooper attempted to restrain rioters by linking arms with Eddie McAteer and John Hume. As the trio were swept aside by the advancing crowd, Cooper was knocked unconscious by a brick.In August , Ivan Cooper became one of the founding members of the SDLP with John Hume, Paddy Devlin and Gerry Fitt. After Stormont was prorogued in , he was again elected as one of the representatives from Mid Ulster to the Northern Ireland Assembly in . After the power sharing administration tumbled in the face of the Ulster Workers Council Strike in , Cooper was again elected to the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention in .He was also the SDLP candidate for the constituency at both Westminster elections in . In the first one in February that year, he succeeded in splitting the nationalist vote and as a result caused the defeat of Independent MP Bernadette McAliskey.After boundary changes created the Foyle constituency in , Cooper stood aside to let John Hume have a clear run at claiming the seat.

The centrersquos vision is about empowering young people and the wider community to achieve their full potential spiritually, mentally and physically. Itrsquos a vision that resonates with the ethos of The David Cross Foundation for Peace and Reconciliation.The Edge chairwoman, Trisha Brown, explained that staff and volunteers had seen an increase in mental health issues affecting all ages.ldquoPeople are feeling lonely and lost. There has also been a growth in the number of young people self-harming as they feel they donrsquot have a future. So, we still have a lot to do and we run a wide range of initiatives to build community capacity and to support those who are feeling isolated, she continued.ldquoThe Edge is firmly positioned as a space for people to come and feel safe and to share whatrsquos happening in their lives. We bring people together in a cross-community setting and we welcome people of all ages.

OrsquoHare and Diarmuid OrsquoConnor exchanged points before Keegan and Ciaran Treacy finished the job in added time.Mayorsquos five-point winning margin was a bit flattering and the final result would have been so much more dferent had Down taken all their chances.Downrsquos season is now over, but Tally has laid the foundations for better things to come.Saturdayrsquos defeat may well have been the last game in a Down shirt for a few of the sidersquos older players as there is a plethora of young players just waiting to get their chance and Tally seems to be the man to give them that opportunity.Down: R Burns, D OrsquoHagan, B McArdle, G Collins, R McAleenan, K Kernan, D Guinness, J Flynn, C Poland, C Francis, C Mooney , P Laverty, P Havern , D OrsquoHare , C Harrison .

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

I had hoped to work constructively with them and take their concerns on board.ldquoThose who were elected as Conservatives but have chosen to betray the faith that was shown in them by their constituents should have the courage to resign and face by-elections. They should defend their decisions at the ballot box.ldquoAn establishment stitch up between these councillors and Labour is not in the interest of residents of the Vale of Glamorgan. They have explicitly argued that they know best and that the public should be ignored.ldquoI will be proposing a minority Conservative administration at the Vale Councilrsquos AGM with a plan that delivers on the priorities of local people. I will challenge other councillors to back it.Earlier on Wednesday, Cllr Gray made a statement to Vale of Glamorgan Councilrsquos Conservative group to say he was resigning.In his statement, he said he had ldquoabsolutely no issue with the manner in which Cllr Bailey was elected as the new leader of the Conservative Group,But he said he is ldquoat least partially at odds with Cllr Bailey on three issues ndash the proposed lsquoclosurersquo of Llancarfan Primary School, the Dinas Powys Bypass and the incinerator in Barry.On the Llancarfan School proposal, which would see the primary moved to a new building in Rhoose, he said: ldquoI seconded a motion to have the executive reopen the issue consultation and this was ignored by the then cabinet but now that this dficult decision has been made I fear that any attempt to articially prop up Llancarfan School will take funding away from the budgets of Penarth schools which is something I will not tolerate.Cllr Gray said heremained ldquounconvinced that the proposed bypass around Dinas Powys, linking Cardf to Barry, ldquois an issue with a large base of support in my ward, and the efforts to give it even more prominence and funding would I believe be to the detriment of the residents of my ward.Vale council has been waiting for more than a year for Welsh Government to decide whether the Barry incinerator needs to carry out an environmental impact assessment before it can operate.Cllr Gray said any efforts to ramp up the councilrsquos rhetoric on the incinerator ldquowould do a disservice to those residents who are passionate about the subject.ldquoRaising  hope for headlines is not the reason I stood for local government and I donrsquot want to mark my success by how many column inches we are able to achieve on a wedge issue, he said.       ,params: .pushHe added:ldquoThe structures around the group that Vince is proposing seemed to be geared up to act as an opposition party and not to focus on the work of delivering core services for the benefit of the most vulnerable members of our society.ldquoI donrsquot expect everyone to agree with my decision and I donrsquot take this decision lightly ndash I am sure that there will be a great number of people who have an opinion on whether I have done the right thing or not.ldquoI need to remain true to myself and my belief in acting as a positive advocate for the residents in my ward ndash the issues that get me out of bed every morning to work hard for the residents in my ward are not the way the press views me but how I can make a positive dference to peoplersquos lives. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people.

The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/bbobb.jpg","title":"coffee chain bob and berts creating  new jobs","story":"Posted on Monday  June  by John Mulgrew A Northern Ireland coffee shop chain is creating  new jobs as its expands it reach across the UK with eight new stores, it has emerged.

North Street Arcade was destroyed in a fire in , which caused severe damage to the floor and glass roof. It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/droad_1.jpg","title":"major new apartment building planned for dublin road","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew The Dublin Road in Belfast A new serviced apartment building could be developed along Belfast’s so-called ‘Golden Mile’ on the Dublin Road, it can be revealed.
