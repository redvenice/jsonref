It makes me smile every time I think about it.\u0027The outgoing presenters of the Virgin Radio Breakfast Show, Amy Voce and Sam Pinkham, are set to be offered a new slot on the station.Sir Richard Branson said he was \u0027absolutely delighted\u0027 to have Evans back at Virgin Radio.He said in a statement: \u0027Chris continues to be one of the most entertaining people on the airwaves today and we\u0027re very excited to have one of the world\u0027s greatest radio presenters hosting our flagship breakfast show on Virgin Radio.\u0027Of course, Chris and I have a long history with Virgin Radio. \u0027When I originally tried to convince him to join us back in 1997, I had to fly on BA\u0027s flagship Concorde plane – at the height of their Dirty Tricks campaign against Virgin Atlantic – to get Chris to sign (more on that adventure soon).\u0027It was a partnership we both knew would work wonders, and eventually Chris joined us and created one of the most infamous shows in radio history. He was so successful that he ended up buying Virgin Radio himself, and going on the long, laugh-a-minute journey that has eventually led us back together after all these years. \u0027Like radio listeners across the UK, I can\u0027t wait to see what Chris comes up with for his new breakfast show. One thing I\u0027m certain of is it is going to be a lot of fun.\u0027He added: \u0027All of the Virgin family wish Chris and the team the very best and look forward to seeing the number one breakfast show and its presenter back where they belong.\u0027            Fans took to Twitter after the announcement saying they are devastated by his departure \u0027Whoever that turns out to be, I wish them all the very best, they are in for an absolute blast.\u0027 Fans took to Twitter after his shock announcement, saying they were \u0027close to tears.\u0027One said: \u0027So close to tears co @achrisevans is leaving the breakfast!! I\u0027ve no idea what I\u0027m going to do in the mornings now. Gutted!!!\u0027Another said: \u0027I cried when Sir Terry left, actual real tears. \u0027I will cry when you leave. You have been the constant in my life. Managing all of your children has to be your priority but I will miss the happiness you and the team give me every weekday morning.\u0027After his announcement today many listeners were calling for Sara Cox to take over the show. Also a DJ on Radio , she has stepped in for him in the past when he has been absent.One said: \u0027So sad to hear that Chris Evans is leaving Radio 2, always enjoyable on the drive into work. Sara Cox hopefully will step in.\u0027Another added: \u0027If Sara Cox doesn\u0027t permanently take over from Chris Evans when he leaves then you\u0027re missing a huge trick! She definitely needs a prime time show, not stuck at 10pm - she\u0027s great!.\u0027Evans previously hosted the Radio 1 Breakfast show, Virgin Radio and presented TV shows TFI Friday and Don\u0027t Forget Your Toothbrush.He has suffered a few tough years after the failure of his Top Gear reboot and the death of his mother four months ago.The broadcaster, who earned £1.66million last year, is the BBC\u0027s second highest earner after Gary Lineker.

Then and only then will black lives matter.\u0027The reverend was responding to Wonder\u0027s mention of \u0027black lives matter\u0027 on stage after he had spoken to the audience in Detroit, Michigan.   Aretha Franklin\u0027s (pictured December 2015) family say Reverend Jasper Williams, Jr did not properly eulogize her on Friday. She died August 16 aged 78Referencing an Aretha song, Williams tried to soften the blow he received via social media after the comments about the African-American community.It also came from people who opposed his views about single parenthood for black mothers raising their male children without the help of a father figure.  \u0027What we need to do is create respect among ourselves. Aretha is the person with that song R-E-S-P-E-C-T that is laid out for us and what we need to be as a race within ourselves. We need to show each other that. We need to show each other respect. That was the reason why I did it,\u0027 he explained.\u0027Here\u0027s the root of what I\u0027ve been talking about: In order to change America, we must change black America\u0027s culture.

We\u0027re not all right. It\u0027s a lot of change that needs to occur. This change must come from within us. Nobody can give us things to eliminate where we are. We have to change from within ourselves. \u0027It is ludicrous for the church not to be involved. The church is the only viable institution we have in the African-American community. We must step up and turn our race around.\u0027Williams maintains that a turnaround of black-on-black crime would be the ultimate tribute to the Queen of Soul who sang about black female empowerment way ahead of the time it became trendy in mainstream music.\u0027I think if she\u0027s immortalized, she should be immortalized,\u0027 he said. \u0027If we can turn black America around, it would be the greatest and best immortalization we could properly give to her for what she did for black America and the world when she lived.\u0027  Williams hasn\u0027t backtracked at all, he seemed to feel more sorry for how people chose to react rather than the content of his words.He responded: \u0027I understand it. I regret it.

It will continue to be brilliant.\u0027He revealed that he has been speaking to his \u0027nearest and dearest\u0027 about his decision.He said: \u0027It\u0027s been quite big news in our house over the last few weeks and months. I\u0027m going to leave.  Experts say a woman is likely to replace Chris Evans (left today) on Radio 2 with Sara Cox set to take over\u0027I first discussed it professionally last year and discussed it with my colleagues and bosses here a few months ago.\u0027A few weeks ago I made my mind up for sure.\u0027Since that conversation it\u0027s been pointed out to me that I have been for 13 years – which is a long time, it\u0027s a long time.\u0027In a statement then released by the BBC he said: \u0027I have absolutely loved every single moment of my time at Radio 2.          From left to right, Zoe Ball, Sara Cox and Jo Wiley, are among the favorites to step into Chris Evans\u0027 shoes as the new host of the Radio 2 breakfast showBy Emily Kent SmithSara Cox has been tipped as the favourite to replace Evans on the Breakfast Show.Odds for Cox, 43, were slashed to 2-to-1 yesterday.The former \u0027ladette\u0027, who has reinvented herself in recent years and is regarded as a top talent at the BBC, received widespread backing on social media.Fuelling rumours further, she posted on Twitter: \u0027Shucks. You lot, honestly. Whatever happens, today on Twitter has felt like one massive hug. Thank you.\u0027Cox joined the BBC in 1999 and currently has her own 10pm to midnight programme during the week.If picked, she would be the first woman to host the flagship morning programme full-time since the station launched in 1967.Contrary to the posh Oxbridge image that some associate with the Corporation, Bolton-born Cox left school with four A-levels for a career in modelling and moved into TV aged 19 after being spotted by scouts.But her career has not been without its controversies.On Radio 1\u0027s Breakfast Show, she told of how she had lost her virginity in a field at the age of 15, and was once sent home from a modelling shoot drunk. Cox has since admitted she\u0027s come a long way since the wild days of her youth, telling the Mail: \u0027Ladette is a word that makes my toes curl now.\u0027A married mother-of-three, she has already covered for Evans on occasion.And following the gender pay crisis that has engulfed the BBC, many believe the coveted position should go to a woman.Several other female stars are in the mix with odds of 6-to-1 on Jo Whiley and Zoe Ball. Claudia Winkleman is the outsider at 12-to-1. Drivetime presenter Simon Mayo is the top man tipped for the job with odds of 4-to-1.

but she is battling a rare and aggressive form of breast cancer that has spread.Last month the newsreader revealed on her blog that a liver enzyme called ALT was rising, ruling her out of further clinical trials.A high level of ALT in the blood is often a sign of liver damage and a warning that a person\u0027s kidneys are also failing.Decreasing appetite, increasing sleep, an irregular heartbeat, dropping blood pressure and  body temperature are also signs that will tell doctors a person\u0027s life is coming to an end.In an Instagram post last month Rachael also said she had stage 4 cancer - meaning the killer disease  has spread to other organs or parts of the body.It also means survival is highly unlikely.Last week, before she was told she had days to live, she said: \u0027At the moment, hope is pinned on things like spending days off supplementary oxygen and getting my increasing liver enzyme numbers down with blood thinners in the hope they’re just caused by a blood clot on my liver\u0027.Rachael has triple negative breast cancer -  a rare and aggressive type of breast cancer often found in younger women.Sufferers will often need chemotherapy, breast surgery and radiotherapy in an attempt to halt its growth and spread.Most breast cancers have receptors on the surface of the cancer cells for the hormones oestrogen and progesterone, and less commonly for a protein called HER2. These receptors can stimulate the cancer to grow - but also mean that they can be treated with hormonal treatments that can slow or stop growth.Triple negative breast cancer don\u0027t have these receptors so this cancer is harder to stop because hormone therapy will not work.Triple negative breast cancer is found in about 1 in 5 women with breast cancer.It occurs more commonly in women under the age of 40 and in black women.A recent study of 50,000 women with all stages of breast cancer found that 77 per cent of women with triple-negative breast cancer survived at least 5 years, versus 93 per cent of women with other types of breast cancer.                                                      Her brave tweet yesterday announcing she has \u0027only got days\u0027 has sparked thousands of responses praising her inspirational dignity and bravery in the face of terminal illness. Yesterday the BBC broadcaster tweeted the news, sparking an outpouring of grief among friends and fans, and today she agreed to publish the plans she has made in the event of her death.She wrote on HuffPost: \u0027I have a Whatsapp group with Steve’s sister where I send her things I want for Freddie and his future. The things that might overwhelm and upset Steve now but she will make sure happens.\u0027Like not cutting his hair too short until he really insists, or my wish for him to go to the very best school and university possible, so long as that’s what he wants.\u0027I’m also planning and wrapping birthday presents which he can open between the ages of four and twenty one.\u0027Personal effects like my notepads – so he can see what my writing was like. Or the perfume he helped pick out for me earlier this year so he’ll remember my smell.

This day is thought to be when Nuh, or Noah, left the Ark and Musa (Moses) was saved from the Pharaoh of Egypt by God, according to Al Jazeera.          Afghan Shiite Muslim flagellate themselves with knives during the Muharram processionMuharram also marks the anniversary of the historic Battle of Karbala on October 10, 680 AD where the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad, Imam Hussein ibn Ali, was killed during the siege of the Iraqi city and is now commemorated by Shia Muslims.The start of the new year also honours Muhammad’s emigration from Mecca to Medina, known as the Hijrah and is what gives the first day of the year its name.Muharram 2018Muharram will fall on the date of Tuesday, September 11 on the Gregorian calendar this year, because the last day of Dhu al-Hijjah falls on September 10. Express also writes that Muharram will end on October 9.The Islamic New Year falls on a different day each year because the Gregorian calendar does not properly synchronise with the one of the faith, which means that each year, Muharram is pushed back by around 10 or 11 days.How do Muslims celebrate Muharram?Like with every new year celebration, for Muslims it represents new beginnings and an opportunity for self-reflection. As well as fasting on Ashura, the tenth day of Muharram, mourning congregations will gather to express grief.At these events, Shia Muslim sects often practice chest beating, which is referred to as Latyma and some also self-flagellate and cut their foreheads. Sunni Muslims consider Ashura as a day of respect for the Prophet Moses, but do not take part in the ritual.Dancing With the Stars 2018: Start date, cast rumors and moreNational Lottery EuroMillions results: Lotto numbers for Tuesday, September 4The Witcher: Henry Cavill cast in new Netflix showDid Kevin Wendt reveal he took Ashley I.\u0027s virginity on Bachelor in Paradise?Who is Bob Woodward?

More British adults fail to hit these targets than people in Africa, South America and most of Asia. But they are also less active than in comparable Western nations such as France, Spain, Australia and Canada.Experts believe women around the world tend to be more inactive than men because they participate in fewer sports and leisure activities – and when they do exercise they do it at a lower intensity.The US is even more inactive than the UK, with 40 per cent of adults not doing enough exercise, while the figure for Italy is 41 per cent. Globally, 32 per cent of women and 23 per cent of men fail to hit the activity target.Experts are worried that a growing crisis in inactive lifestyles is putting millions of Britons at risk of cancer, diabetes and heart disease. Steven Ward, of the UK Active organisation, said: ‘These figures are a damning indictment of our nation’s health, with the UK lagging behind much of the rest of the world for activity levels. Physical inactivity is the cause of 37,000 premature deaths in the UK each year and costs our economy an estimated £20billion. This should be seen as a national disgrace.          Steven Ward of UK Active said the figures were a damning indictment of the nation\u0027s health ‘The Government must make physical activity a top-tier health priority...or risk facing an unsustainable burden on both the NHS and social care.’The figures come after a Public Health England report, published yesterday, found 78 per cent of over-30s have hearts that are more damaged than they should be for their age, putting them at greater risk of early death.Experts are particularly worried about inactive middle-aged people in their 40s, 50s and 60s who continuously put their busy lives ahead of the needs of their health. Some 67 per cent of men and 57 per cent of women in Britain are overweight – well above the global average. Scientists wrote in the WHO report: ‘Our analysis, including data from nearly 2million participants, shows that globally in 2016 more than a quarter of all adults were not getting enough physical activity.‘This puts more than 1.4billion adults at risk of developing or exacerbating diseases linked to inactivity, and needs to be urgently addressed.’ In Uganda, the most active country, just 5 per cent of adults failed to hit activity targets. In Kuwait, the least active, 67 per cent did too little exercise.The report, published in the Lancet medical journal, called for ‘more opportunities for safe and accessible leisure-time activity to women in order to increase their overall levels of activity’. Regular trips to the gym do not trigger an early menopause, a study has found.There is no link between physical activity levels and infertility, according to the University of Massachusetts study of 107,000 women in the US. Previous research had claimed women who exercise a lot are more likely to go through the change of life in their 40s or earlier. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/04/21/4FB482D300000578-0-image-m-16_1536094784875.jpg","title":"How sickening British Jew Im told home","story":"    Journalist Natasha Pearlman, pictured with her two children, Thea, four weeks and Rose, four, right, said as a British Jew she has experienced anti-Semitism three times in her life I explained how offensive it was and my friend was mortified. It was often used at his boarding school (at which there were no Jews) and through genuine ignorance had entered his common parlance.The other incidents happened at work. I was a young journalist in London over a decade ago. One day a colleague came in, holding a leaflet on Judaism. ‘I’m going for lunch with ‘so and so’ today (a Jewish celebrity),’ they announced, waving the pamphlet at me. ‘I’m going to read this beforehand so I can understand people like you.’ Shocked, I said nothing.\u0027Why I believe we need to tax wealth more\u0027: In a bid to help...Share this articleLater, the same colleague began referring to where I sat (opposite the only other Jewish person in our office) as ‘Jew corner’. To my shame, I said nothing, despite knowing my workplace would have been outraged by it. It was early in my career. I feared that by challenging it I’d be labelled a troublemaker and never work in the industry again.          Ms Pearlman, said the first time she encountered anti-Semitism was in collegePerhaps it was the Britishness in me — but I believed the comments were not symptomatic of anti-Semitism in our society, just ignorance.Now, for the first time in my 36-year lifetime, I have genuine concerns about the spread of vitriol and abuse against the Jewish community.Because the ‘hatred’ of us has become entwined with Israel — the Jewish homeland. And somehow the Britishness of Jews, our loyalty to the country we call home, the culture in which we exist and are part of, is being called into question.Not by a bunch of ignorant idiots, but by the Labour Party and seemingly the Labour leader himself, Jeremy Corbyn.Only yesterday, Labour’s National Executive Committee finally accepted the full International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of anti-Semitism — accepted around the world by organisations such as the United Nations — in my opinion, far too damagingly late.Even then Corbyn wanted to add a statement permitting criticism of Israel, specifically that the circumstances around its foundation are racist. Yet again, provoking outcry. Why? Because Israel was only necessary due to the Nazis’ mass extermination of the Jews.I am devastated that the party I’ve supported my whole life bears so much responsibility for this.Having been horribly slow to deal with party members accused of anti-Semitism, they had refused to accept the full IHRA definition of anti-Semitism — wanting to omit four clauses, including one of accusing Jewish people of being more loyal to Israel than the country they live in.          She said she is devastated by the Labour Party\u0027s handling of the anti-Semitism issue     Jeremy Corbyn, pictured at the Labour Party headquarters yesterday, as the party agrees to adopt the international definition of anti-Semitism into the party\u0027s code of conductIt’s compelling, heart-warming and yet heartbreaking. And brilliantly done. Participants include articulate, nervous university graduate Lilly, who has reservations about the Israeli government’s actions towards the Palestinians.Then there’s deeply religious, pro-Israel activist Joseph, who is surprisingly open to what Lilly has to say. And Damon, a 58-year-old atheist Jew — but fervent Zionist — who’s never been to Israel.It is significant that none of them wanted their surnames made public, for fear of reprisals.          Corbyn, pictured leaving the meeting, has been heavily criticised for his failure to address the problem of anti-Semitism within the Labour Party which has led to major rows I understand that. I’m writing this knowing it will open the floodgates to abuse of my family. Whenever I express concerns about anti-Semitism on social media I’m hit with abuse about being part of the Zionist mafia or told to ‘go home’.As the mother of Rose, four, and Thea, four weeks, I’m speaking up because it is exactly this rhetoric — the questioning of Jews’ loyalty to the country in which they reside, the characterisation of them as ‘other’, as money-grabbing, as not part of general society — that mirrors how Nazis portrayed Jews in the run-up to World War II.I don’t write any of this lightly. I never believed I would write any of this at all. I’m the granddaughter of two Holocaust survivors.What happened to my granny and grandfather was so horrific I find it hard to believe anything so revolting could happen again.          Corbyn, pictured, wanted to allow criticism of the foundation of Israel claiming the circumstances of its foundation were racist - which caused outrage because the foundation of Israel was only necessary because of the Nazi mass extermination of JewsMy grandfather was arrested and interrogated by the Gestapo on Kristallnacht and was one of the few men to escape. My granny lost her entire family, including her mother and two sisters who were exterminated at Maly-Trostenets concentration camp in Belarus.In July it was revealed there are now 100 anti-Semitic incidents reported a month (with a 34 per cent rise in anti-Semitic assaults from 2016 to 2017). I’ve often told my worried parents it wasn’t possible it could get worse — with the Holocaust such a recent memory.Now, I’m certain that if we stay silent, there’s a danger the poison seeping into our society will become unstoppable. I hope tonight’s programme will counteract this tide of anti-Semitism. Viewers will be able to see the breadth of the Jewish community, captured intelligently and sensitively. Still, do we really have to showcase the banality of our normal lives, just to prove we are British and normal, like you?You may well warm to a number of the participants, no matter your own politics. Even though I am politically opposed to Right-wing Joseph, I agreed when he noted that Jews, wherever they live in the world, are expected to explain their stance on Israel’s government, when ‘we wouldn’t expect any Muslim to say ISIS has nothing to do with me’.Equally, I supported Lilly questioning the legitimacy of the Israeli government-backed settlements in the Palestinian West Bank — that they’re still building despite being declared illegal by the UN —and the actions of the army against some of the Palestinian citizens.The programme also highlighted the inflammatory way the non-Jewish community speak about Israel, Corbyn in particular.          The BBC will broadcast a documentary \u0027We Are British Jews\u0027 featuring eight people from various walks of life and different views about their experiences with anti-SemitismWhen Corbyn opposes the Israeli government, he almost never uses those words. He takes on Israel —and by extension its people, the Jews. He calls terrorist leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah his friends, yet doesn’t engage with Israelis. He attacks Zionists, not the government. And given that the accepted definition of Zionism is simply the right of Jews’ to self-determination — i.e. the right to a Jewish homeland, just as there exist Islamic states and Christian states — it’s easy to see how easily ‘Zionists’ and ‘Zionism’ can be substituted for Jews and Judaism.In a difficult and upsetting part of the programme, the group visit Manchester University during ‘Israel Apartheid Week’. They encounter streets plastered with posters from the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Group (BDS) that specifically target Israel.One of the cast, Alan, 77, observes: ‘There’s never a Syrian Apartheid Week, there’s never any demonstrations against the terrible deaths in Syria. Nothing about the horrible happenings in Yemen. It’s always about Israel.’          Eight Jews from Manchester, pictured,  travel to Israel and the West Bank to confront their deeply held views as part of the documentary which is broadcast this evening on BBC 2And as one Manchester Jewish Society member notes: ‘When there’s a pro-Palestinian or BDS event, we don’t start a fuss. When there’s an Israel event there’s always protests and security issues. When we raise our opinion we’re shouted down. We’re scared to do things in public.’That last sentence would break my late grandparents’ heart. Because the final few months of their lives in Austria were lived in enforced secrecy — even their Jewish wedding, on July 31, 1938, was conducted under cover of darkness in a friend’s house. By the end of their time in Vienna, they were banned from living publicly as Jews.Having been rejected and expelled from their home country, they clung intensely — like many other Jewish refugees — to Britain, the land that welcomed them, and their newfound Britishness. Austria could never be home again.This is why I’m so disturbed at anti-Semitism in Britain today, where the hatred of us is so entwined with criticism of Israel and a questioning of loyalties.While some comes from the Right, the Left has turned anti-Zionism into a trend. It has become de rigueur to typify us as a homogenous group. The Jews, make no mistake, have become a symbol of hatred.This is why I can no longer stay silent. I am many things in my life — Jewish, a writer, a daughter, a sister, a mother, a wife. I’m also British. All my life I presumed that was a given.The fact we, as British Jews, need a programme to show our fellow Brits that we are one of them? Well, in a way, we’ve already lost. The weight of history is on all of us to rectify this."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/04/22/4FB4353C00000578-0-image-m-20_1536096383453.jpg","title":"Shes TVs toughest weight loss guru spend 1k week lose stone","story":"    Galia Granger at her health retreat Slimmeria in Crowhurst, Sussex, where customers go to lose weightGalia, 60, calls herself a \u0027diet dominatrix\u0027, drives a scarlet sportscar with the numberplate AM I 2 FAT (\u0027It\u0027s a question I ask myself every day,\u0027 she says, sternly) and when she isn\u0027t berating her clients over their sugar intake (\u0027it\u0027s like cocaine\u0027), she\u0027s whipping them with birch leaves — which apparently aids the weight-falling-off process.There\u0027s a moment in the first episode of her new TV show, where guests check in to her Sussex detox retreat and surrender to her brutal regime, where you wonder if it\u0027s all a spoof. Is Dawn French going to make an appearance and actually eat Galia?One of the hapless guests — a woman called Kirsty who bought her wedding dress two sizes too small and is now panic-dieting as the big day approaches — has had a violent reaction to Galia\u0027s all-vegetable, no-sugar, detox \u0027shock\u0027 regime. Kirsty, who comes from Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, is shaking and has been throwing up.Kirsty objects to eating more lettuce, and (weakly) says she will be sick. \u0027Be sick!\u0027 demands Galia. \u0027Then eat your lettuce.\u0027 She stands over the poor soul with a bell. \u0027Chew! NOW!\u0027          Britain\u0027s latest TV diet guru Galia Grainger is star of a new Channel 4 programme called The Extreme Diet Hotel (pictured with Lisa Riley)           The \u0027diet dominatrix\u0027 feeds her customers cabbage. In her Slimmeria \u0027hotel\u0027, alcohol, caffeine and carbohydrates are forbiddenThe reason Kirsty needs to eat her lettuce is because Galia has decided she should complete a 5k run by the end of the week, despite not having exercised for years. Isn\u0027t this a tad dangerous? \u0027What doesn\u0027t kill you makes you thin,\u0027 says Galia.Today, she admits that having her overweight guests — who pay between £800 and £1,200 a week for the pleasure of being subjected to her brutal regime — dissolve in tears is not only acceptable, but desirable.\u0027We want them to cry,\u0027 she says briskly. Galia does everything briskly. \u0027It is part of the process, breaking them down. The detox is an emotional detox, too. Mostly they cry by Wednesday.\u0027To help them cry, Galia likes to say things like, \u0027I will break you\u0027, \u0027Resistance is futile\u0027 and, \u0027It\u0027s my way or no way\u0027. What do her guests say in return? Most of it is unprintable, but halfway through her stay Kirsty suggests: \u0027I\u0027ll maybe punch her.\u0027 Alas, she doesn\u0027t have the energy.An audience with the Slim Reaper (as Galia also likes to be known) is certainly an experience. She comes across as more prison jailer than hotelier — although if she were running an actual prison she\u0027d have been hauled before the European Court of Human Rights by now, given the measly 450 calorie-a-day diet she serves up.\u0027My guests hate me,\u0027 she laughs, in the manner of Cruella de Vil, \u0027but I tell them that I don\u0027t care if they hate me. When they get on the scales at the end of the week, they will love me.\u0027She has an equally strident approach to international diplomacy. Britain might be her adopted country (she moved here in 1989) but she openly despairs of how we Brits eat. And eat. And eat.           Galia likes to be known as the \u0027Slim Reaper\u0027 as she admits she likes to make her guests cry because it means they are being \u0027broken\u0027\u0027Britain has such a proud tradition. This is the country that brought the world Shakespeare and Chaucer. Now, it is famous for being the obesity capital of Europe,\u0027 she sighs. British people have no backbone, it seems, and no will power.\u0027They come to me with excuses. Excuses, excuses. I have heard thousands. \u0027Oh it\u0027s my metabolism. Oh I can\u0027t eat this. Oh I can\u0027t walk because. . .\u0027 Yes, I accept there are people with genuine medical conditions, but there are also people who go on about their metabolism problems — then I find food wrappers in their rooms. What has happened to us?\u0027When did we become so weak and so lacking in self-discipline?\u0027Of course Galia, who has a grown-up son, has built up a business helping flabby frumps to find their inner steel. The way she sells it, she is also helping them become fitter, more confident, even more marriage-able.She has to be \u0027part psychologist\u0027 she points out, telling me of one client who came to her crying because none of the clothes in her wardrobe fitted. \u0027She was unhappy. She was single, and all her friends were married. I said, \u0027Are they slim?\u0027 She said: \u0027Yes.\u0027 I said: \u0027I rest my case.\u0027\u0027I talked to her about all the other beautiful women out there. I said: \u0027These b*****s are skinny. Are you going to let them steal your future husband?\u0027 \u0027Blimey. Safe to say, Galia has no truck with the \u0027feel-good\u0027 approach to body confidence.The dog ate ALL our homework! Pupils at Taiwanese school are...Cyclist who was left with a battered face and torn lip after...Finding the ‘dog-headed man’ with a deafening call like a...Share this article\u0027Pah!\u0027 she says. \u0027I won\u0027t patronise people by saying: \u0027Oh, but you are beautiful inside.\u0027 If they are truly happy when they are overweight, fine, but the people who come to me are not happy. And I have to be honest with them, brutally honest, because often their health is at stake.\u0027Who on earth is this woman, and are we nuts by letting her loose on our TV screens?Well, Galia was born in the former USSR and lived in Latvia, before moving to Britain where she worked in administration for a while, then moved into property development doing up neglected crumbling wrecks.\u0027It\u0027s not unlike what I do now!\u0027 she says breezily, and given that her clients are mostly middle-aged souls who have, as she puts it \u0027let themselves go\u0027, maybe she has a point.          Glamour Model Bianca Gascoigne works-out at \u0027Slimmeria\u0027 under the watchful eye of Galia Graing in 2013. The residential retreat uses gentle domination to encourage guests As unlikely as it seems, given her own slimline frame, she once had a weight problem herself — one she blames firmly on Western eating habits.\u0027I do understand how tempting it is,\u0027 she says, of our junk-food culture.\u0027I fell into the trap of snacking, of failing to think about portion control. I let myself go. When I was 50, I was a size 18, and miserable with it. But I decided to do something about it.\u0027She came up with her own regime, based on her grandmother\u0027s fasting one. \u0027She fasted for religious reasons, but she lived well into her hundreds,\u0027 she says.\u0027I found myself thinking about that generation, and the way they ate — lots of vegetables, no processed food. It was clean-eating, but before the phrase was thought of. I experimented myself — and the weight fell off. I lost four stones, went down to a size 8 and I\u0027ve been that size ever since.\u0027Overnight, Galia became evangelical about her new discovery, and ten years ago — spying a lucrative gap in the market — she opened up one of her restored houses, which she was already running as a B\u0026ampB with her late husband, to wannabe skinnies.The \u0027tough love\u0027 approach might be a winning gimmick for the TV career (she\u0027s already had a taste of that as a consultant on Channel 4\u0027s The Fat Fighters), but she also deems it necessary.The diet industry, she claims, is way too gently, gently. \u0027You aren\u0027t allowed to say people are \u0027fat\u0027 any more, but why not? I call a broom a broom,\u0027 she says. \u0027People need me to be honest.\u0027Her actual regime does sound like it could come straight from the gulag. It\u0027s not just cabbage on the menu — not that there is a menu. \u0027There isn\u0027t a menu. They eat what we tell them,\u0027 she says. All manner of vegetables are either presented raw or slightly cooked.\u0027It\u0027s not a diet that should be followed long-term,\u0027 she insists. \u0027It\u0027s a short, sharp shock, a kick-start. The intention is to shock the metabolism. It\u0027s not just to do with weight loss but also to do with cleansing.\u0027Hence in her Slimmeria \u0027hotel\u0027, alcohol, caffeine and carbohydrates are forbidden. Treats include a few slices of apple (in the programme she is filmed telling kitchen staff to cut the slices thinner), although if your energy levels are really depleted she will allow a \u0027magic raisin\u0027. Yes, a single raisin.          \u0027AM I  2 FAT\u0027: Even Galia\u0027s car promotes slimming and self awareness She also advocates something she calls \u0027window eating\u0027 which, she explains, is about leaving a gap between meals. But when she says \u0027gap\u0027 she means \u0027chasm\u0027, given that guests stop eating at 6.30pm, and don\u0027t have their next meal until 1pm the following day. Bedtime is a stringent 9pm and the wake-up call comes at 7.15. Exercise is a must. All guests are expected to do a two-hour walk every day.To help them along, Galia strides along beside them, berating them for talking when their energy should be going into walking faster.\u0027Where is your sweat?\u0027 she shrieks. \u0027I don\u0027t see sweat. You should be sweating lots.\u0027Does it work? Well, of course it works. Her fans (who include the actress Lisa Riley, who used Galia\u0027s retreat to kick start her 12st weight loss) say that it works at miracle-level. Galia claims that most clients who check in leave after a week having lost something in the region of a stone.We have agreed not to reveal what the three guests who feature in the first episode of her new show lose, but suffice to say, it is astonishing.\u0027Our record is 26lb in one week,\u0027 she says. \u0027That was a man who was quite overweight to start with.\u0027She shudders. \u0027It does make you ask: \u0027What sort of diet did he have before?\u0027Is it healthy, though? Here\u0027s where it gets trickier to assess. There are proven benefits to a diet that incorporates short periods of fasting — in that, Galia is correct. And there are trained staff on site at her retreat to make sure clients are safe.What of Galia\u0027s own qualifications? Galia is happy to admit she is qualification-free — and insists the regime is right for starting fatties down the road the slimness.For the masochistic, maybe. And the monied. After all, who knew cabbages could cost so much?Galia is unrepentant. \u0027It\u0027s a system that works.\u0027The Extreme Diet Hotel is on Channel 4 tonight at 8pm."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/05/01/4FB5D53100000578-6132411-With_only_20_per_cent_of_all_riders_holding_a_coveted_five_star_-a-13_1536106649597.jpg","title":"Looking elusive five star passenger rating Uber tips tricks help you","story":"    Uber released a new set of community guidelines to offer insider tips and tricks in response to the most common complaints that lead to lower ratings and account deactivation          With only 20 per cent of all riders holding a coveted five-star rating, the ride-sharing service released a five-step manual to follow to join the convoy1. Location, location, locationThe number one error riders make that leads to a less-than-perfect rating is the pick-up destination.Riders requesting a ride before they are at the location, dropping their pin in the wrong spot or trying to get picked up in bus zones or other difficult areas are almost certain to not receive a five-star rating from their driver.Uber recommends taking an extra moment to confirm the perfect pick-up location, and to use the in-app messaging tool to let drivers know should a rider be running late. 2. Say helloWhile most people would assume a friendly greeting is common courtesy, according to driver feedback, too many riders are forgetting simple pleasantries. Using manners, like \u0027please\u0027 and \u0027thank you\u0027 is also likely to boost that rating. Start the trip with a positive first impression - it will be remembered.           While most people would assume a friendly greeting is common courtesy, according to driver feedback, too many riders are forgetting simple pleasantries3. Don\u0027t be \u0027that\u0027 backseat driverThere is nothing worse than driving, and having a passenger make corrections, last-minute alterations to the set route, or downright insulting the person behind the wheel.The same goes for ride-sharing services.If a rider feels in danger, use the in-app features to report an incident, or call 000. However, advice such as telling a driver to speed up, run the orange light, or change directions will ruin any hope of a five-star rating.4. Take your rubbishSometimes drivers offer to take care of rubbish for all their riders, but if they don\u0027t, riders need to do so themselves.Be considerate of the driver, and of the next rider to use the vehicle, and don\u0027t make a mess in somebody else\u0027s car. 5. Don\u0027t slam doorsEven in a rush, nobody wants to be responsible for damaging another person\u0027s property.When getting out of the car, follow step two by saying goodbye, then close the door firmly without slamming it shut.The driver will appreciate the consideration, and this is the most obvious point for a driver to rate the trip.\u0027I hoped I\u0027d missed\u0027: Uber driver in \u0027stand your ground\u0027...Fancy taking a HELICOPTER to work?

Uber has a strict no-sex policy between any parties.Nobody should be made to feel uncomfortable during the journey. This can be done through derogatory language, discrimination, flirting, or asking overly personal questions.Do not make contact with the driver after the trip is over, unless absolutely necessary.Using the ride-sharing service to commit a crime, such as human or drug trafficking, breaking local laws in the car or asking the driver to do so is an absolute no-no.           Nobody should be made to feel uncomfortable during the journey.

For this reason, Uber is transparent when it comes to the steps that are taken to determine a fair outcome for everybody involved.Drivers who are found to be below quality in their overall star ratings and cancellation rate can have their account suspended.Discrimination, fraudulent activities or being unsafe are all matters that can result in termination as well. In a statement, Uber said they would investigate any allegations made and contact the driver or rider directly.   \u0027Depending on the nature of the concern, we may put a hold on your account during our investigation.

Instead, as Pester’s pay-off shows, nothing much has changed. Indeed, there is still the utterly farcical possibility that Pester could even pass ‘Go’ on the Monopoly board yet again. The way in which incentive rules are drawn means he might be entitled to another hatful of bonuses for his role in ‘guiding’ TSB out of the crater of his own making.Responsibility for the technology meltdown at TSB is still to be fully established and there are two high-level investigations in progress. One is being conducted by the legal firm Slaughter \u0026amp May and TSB chairman Richard Meddings – who temporarily has taken on Pester’s responsibilities – and promises publication of an interim report by the end of the year.          Lloyds customers were at serious risk of fraud during a major IT failure for the bank in January The official investigation is being conducted jointly by the FCA and the Bank of England, neither of which are known to reach speedy conclusions.And yet, in a shameful act, the bank has authorised a full year’s salary for Pester before the outcome is known.At the core of TSB’s problems was the bank’s decision to switch to a new digitalonline banking platform borrowed from its owners, the Barcelona-based bank Sabadell, without adequate testing or any systems back-up.It simply switched off its old computer system, which was run for it by Lloyds Banking Group, and replaced it with the Sabadell platform.Some customers found that when they logged in, they’d gained access to other people’s accounts. Others were locked out of their own accounts for weeks.Some 370 were deemed to have ‘died’ and their regular direct debits and standing orders cancelled.Instead of offering instant apologies and compensation, TSB went into defence mode, pretending that the debilitating chaos wasn’t serious and dissembling to customers, politicians and regulators.Yet, it has been guilty of greed, carelessness and absymal customer service.Just how out of touch and careless the bank remains was illustrated again yesterday when Meddings sent a letter to the chairman of the Treasury select committee, Nicky Morgan. It was dated incorrectly and began with the words: ‘Dear Morgan...’Who can trust a bank that can’t get even the smallest things right."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/05/00/06D702BB000003E8-0-image-m-3_1536105305605.jpg","title":"Majority voters want freedom movement end EU nationals","story":"    Theresa May, pictured, has made ending freedom of movement a red line in her negotiations with Brussels over Brexit, however, Chancellor Philip Hammond prefers a softer position          Election guru Sir John Curtice said 59 per cent of voters want restrictions on EU nationals compare with only 20 per cent who are happy to allow them free access to BritainThe NatCen study of more than 2,000 voters revealed only 14 per cent believe Mrs May will secure a good deal, while 58 per cent think it will be a bad deal.

Lidington warned that failing to press ahead could leave Britain with \u0027the most out-of-date boundaries in modern political history\u0027 ‘Without such reforms, there will be a significant bias at the next election that will unfairly discriminate against voters in Conservative constituencies,’ they wrote. ‘The absence of fair and equal boundaries risks gerrymandering the election in favour of Jeremy Corbyn.’But Conservative MP Peter Bone said at least ten Tories were opposed to slashing the size of the Commons ‘in principle’, with several more poised to vote against the plans due to fears about their own futures.Mark Carney CONFIRMS he is in talks with Chancellor Philip...\u0027We\u0027re ready deal or no deal\u0027: Brexit Secretary tells MPs...Share this articleMr Bone urged Mrs May to ‘think again’ and order a boundary review based on keeping the existing 650 MPs. ‘There are a number of us opposed to this in principle,’ he said. ‘We do not agree with the idea of reducing parliamentary scrutiny. Why should the number of MPs be cut by 50 while the size of government remains the same? All it means is there will be 50 fewer MPs to hold the Government to account. I don’t think there is any chance of getting it through and the whips know that. Instead of going down this route, the Prime Minister should think again. The idea of cutting the number of MPs was a PR stunt dreamed up by David Cameron.‘Circumstances have changed – we are now going to have to do the work of Members of the European Parliament as well.’ The letter also promises jittery MPs that no colleague will be ‘left behind’ by the review – a reference to a pledge to find a seat for all existing MPs who want to stay on.            Theresa May, who has been touring Africa this month, has been fighting on all fronts this month as she responds to criticism from Boris Johnson, pictured with May at a NATO summit this summer,  over her Brexit plans.David Davis, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn are among the MPs whose seats face being carved up by the changes.The Boundary Commission is due to deliver its final proposals to ministers today ahead of their publication on Monday. Tory MPs have been invited to a briefing on the details next week, ahead of a vote, which is likely to take place this autumn. The existing boundaries are based on data from the turn of the century. Demographic changes mean some constituencies have twice as many voters as others.An assessment of the proposals by the Electoral Calculus website in July suggested the changes could be worth an extra 20 seats to the Tories at the next election. The Tory pledge to equalise the size of constituencies and cut the number of MPs from 650 to 600 has been in place since 2010. It was blocked by Nick Clegg during the Coalition government and is now under threat from the Tory rebels.Labour will also oppose the changes. Shadow cabinet minister Cat Smith said: ‘With no plans to reduce the number of Ministers it will weaken the role of Parliament, to the advantage of the Executive.’ "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/05/08/4FB32DC900000578-0-image-m-5_1536133439192.jpg","title":"Ex Bank Governor Mervyn King dismisses incompetent preparations no deal","story":"    Former Bank of England Governor Mervyn King (file image) today derided the Government\u0027s \u0027incompetent\u0027 preparations for no dealHe made the comments after ministers confirmed efforts were under way to stockpile medicines and ensure an \u0027adequate\u0027 food supply if talks fail.Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab insisted to MPs yesterday that Britain was ready \u0027deal or no deal\u0027. Lord King told the BBC: \u0027Frankly, if a government cannot take action to prevent some of these catastrophic outcomes, whatever position you take on the EU, it illustrates a whole lack of preparation.\u0027It doesn\u0027t tell us anything about whether the policy of staying in the EU is good or bad, it tells us everything about the incompetence of the preparation for it.\u0027Will anyone else quit?

Instead, as Pester’s pay-off shows, nothing much has changed. Indeed, there is still the utterly farcical possibility that Pester could even pass ‘Go’ on the Monopoly board yet again. The way in which incentive rules are drawn means he might be entitled to another hatful of bonuses for his role in ‘guiding’ TSB out of the crater of his own making.Responsibility for the technology meltdown at TSB is still to be fully established and there are two high-level investigations in progress. One is being conducted by the legal firm Slaughter \u0026amp May and TSB chairman Richard Meddings – who temporarily has taken on Pester’s responsibilities – and promises publication of an interim report by the end of the year.          Lloyds customers were at serious risk of fraud during a major IT failure for the bank in January The official investigation is being conducted jointly by the FCA and the Bank of England, neither of which are known to reach speedy conclusions.And yet, in a shameful act, the bank has authorised a full year’s salary for Pester before the outcome is known.At the core of TSB’s problems was the bank’s decision to switch to a new digitalonline banking platform borrowed from its owners, the Barcelona-based bank Sabadell, without adequate testing or any systems back-up.It simply switched off its old computer system, which was run for it by Lloyds Banking Group, and replaced it with the Sabadell platform.Some customers found that when they logged in, they’d gained access to other people’s accounts. Others were locked out of their own accounts for weeks.Some 370 were deemed to have ‘died’ and their regular direct debits and standing orders cancelled.Instead of offering instant apologies and compensation, TSB went into defence mode, pretending that the debilitating chaos wasn’t serious and dissembling to customers, politicians and regulators.Yet, it has been guilty of greed, carelessness and absymal customer service.Just how out of touch and careless the bank remains was illustrated again yesterday when Meddings sent a letter to the chairman of the Treasury select committee, Nicky Morgan. It was dated incorrectly and began with the words: ‘Dear Morgan...’Who can trust a bank that can’t get even the smallest things right."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/04/13/4FAFF4E300000578-0-image-m-4_1536064420132.jpg","title":"MPs tell Theresa scrap planned shake constituency borders","story":"Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis and the Prime Minister\u0027s deputy David Lidington have written to MPs.

Tory MPs have been invited to a briefing on the details next week, ahead of a vote, which is likely to take place this autumn. The existing boundaries are based on data from the turn of the century. Demographic changes mean some constituencies have twice as many voters as others.An assessment of the proposals by the Electoral Calculus website in July suggested the changes could be worth an extra 20 seats to the Tories at the next election. The Tory pledge to equalise the size of constituencies and cut the number of MPs from 650 to 600 has been in place since 2010. It was blocked by Nick Clegg during the Coalition government and is now under threat from the Tory rebels.Labour will also oppose the changes.

A\u0026nbspsense of idedness, of\u0026nbsphaving come – however distantly – from elsewhere. It manifests itself in various ways: a particular itch to travel, a lively curiosity about family trees, childhoods spent in the expectation that you will probably leave at some point, at\u0026nbspleast for a\u0026nbspwhile.For postwar generations, before air travel closed the vast distances between continents, leaving Australia was a far more difficult business – as Louisa Deasey’s father, Denison, found to his cost in 1947. His £100 ticket to London involved six weeks at sea, in cramped, windowless quarters – plus a bout of tuberculosis for his troubles.There was a social cost, too. In the course of living a rich and joyful life of writing and artistic friendships in France, Denison was rumoured to have squandered “three fortunes”. When he returned to Australia, full of ideas for books and magazine articles, he was often met with indifference from editors and publishers. At\u0026nbspthe time, a certain insularity and conservatism prevailed, a heady suspicion of artists, Europeanness and anyone who didn’t quite conform.This attitude, Deasey suggests, played a large part\u0026nbspin what happened next. Denison died when she was six, leaving her with nothing but a few scant memories of an ailing, ageing man. With a mother tightly wound in a\u0026nbsp“pain and guilt so taut she might snap”, and Denison’s personal papers sold off to the State Library of Victoria, Deasey’s internalised understanding of her father was drawn largely from family mythology and a couple of eulogies: dark hints about a man who was “remarkable” but also “wild” and “inexplicable” a writer who never finished what he started a restless wanderer who “made bad choices and lost out in life”. Someone to be regarded with “disapproval and shame”.Similarly restless, similarly determined to write, Deasey strove to prove – to herself, and to her mother – that she was not in other ways her father’s daughter. However, as quickly becomes apparent in A\u0026nbspLetter From Paris, the question of who Denison Deasey turned out to be far more complex than family whisperings ever allowed.The titular letter arrived in the form of a Facebook message in 2016. Siblings in France had found letters about Denison written by their grandmother, Michelle Chomé, when she was 20. Chomé and Denison had apparently fallen in love, and the family were hoping Deasey might have some photos or letters from their\u0026nbspgrandmother.The hunt for Chomé prompted Deasey to confront the pain of her family’s past and delve into her father’s papers. She becomes captivated by his life story, his lively, engaging literary style, the eerie parallels between his interests and her own. She discovers a\u0026nbspman with “intense” powers of observation, with an “instinctive, impulsive boldness”. A man who spent time with artists Sidney Nolan, Arthur Boyd and Albert Tucker, writers Dylan Thomas, Richard Aldington and Alister Kershaw. The shame she’d carried around for decades gradually melts away, to be replaced by a sense of identification, of pride.Meanwhile, the family in France take a lively interest in Deasey’s search, assisting her wherever possible. She flies over to meet them, and becomes acquainted with the places her father loved. She is instantly smitten with the language, the culture, the buildings and the history: “Perhaps I’d been searching for Paris my entire life.”Deasey’s raptures can grow slightly wearying. The\u0026nbspbook practically vibrates with the unbridled enthusiasm of Europhilia (“I. Am. In. Paris … I  Am  In  Paris”) and the deep pleasures of finding a home in a country you’ve never lived in. Unfortunately, her delight in her own personal journey (“I was finally coming back to being me,”) often comes at the cost of maintaining the reader’s interest. Vague adjectives (“perfect” “beautiful”) litter the text, describing everything from scenery to\u0026nbsphotel rooms to – mystifyingly – a folding tray table on a train, with no indication of what such perfection or\u0026nbspbeauty might look like.Yet her journey of self-discovery is not, in the end, the beating heart of this book. Neither is the love story of Denison and Chomé, or even Deasey’s blossoming relationship with her deceased father. The most affecting story here is that of\u0026nbspthe story itself: the tensions between what is written and what is spoken, and who controls the narrative. “Verba volant  Scripta manent” runs the Latin proverb chosen for the epigraph: “Spoken words fly away  Only what is written remains.” A Letter from Paris is a sobering reminder of the ease with which our stories can be warped by the prevailing attitudes of the time – and the crucial importance of archives in the preservation of lives and literature.• A Letter from Paris: A True Story of Hidden Art Lost Romance and Family Reclaimed is published by Scribe.

But the 19th-century icon was a poet in her own right, and her haunting writing is set to be published for the first time in accord with her original manuscripts, more than 150 years after her death.Siddall was “discovered” in 1849 while working in a milliners’ shop, aged around 20, by the artist Walter Deverell. Deverell introduced her to the pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and she sat as a model for various members of the group, including Rossetti, whom she would later marry. She became an artist herself, with John Ruskin as her patron, but suffered from continuous ill health, enduring a still birth and a later miscarriage before taking an overdose of laudanum and dying at home in 1862. The grieving Rossetti buried many of his own unpublished poems along with her body, later exhuming her so he could recover them.Memorialised by her husband in his painting Beata Beatrix, and in countless other works, she is, according to Dr Serena Trowbridge, a woman who “has come to be represented purely by her face”. But Trowbridge, a senior lecturer in English literature at Birmingham City University, hopes her forthcoming book, My Ladys Soul: The Poetry of Elizabeth Siddall, which features some of Siddall’s best-known work along with fragments of previously unseen poems, will prompt a reassessment of Siddall as a poet.Low sit I down at my Ladys feetGazing through her wild eyes,Smiling to think how my love will fleetWhen their starlike beauty diesI care not if my Lady prayTo our Father which art in Heaven:Though for joy in my heart wild pulses playFor to me her love is givenThen who shall close my Lady’s eyes,And who shall fold her hands?Will any hearken if she criesUp to the unknown lands?Siddall’s writing was not published during her lifetime. Previous editions of her work were edited by her brother-in-law, William Rossetti, who changed her grammar and “removed elements which he deemed to be too personal or too sad”, according to Trowbridge, who believes the work now deserves to stand as it was originally written.“For too long, Siddall has been seen as the face of the pre-Raphaelite painters, the muse and wife of Dante Rossetti, and the model for Millais’ Ophelia. I’m really happy to be able to show her as a creative woman in her own right,” said Trowbridge.Raised in a poor family, Siddall’s education in poetry came from reading Tennyson, Blake, Shakespeare and Walter Scott, said Trowbridge. “Her own authentic voice is clear in her poems, and I really hope that this book will encourage others to read her poetry and to research it further.”Trowbridge scoured Siddall’s manuscripts at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford to put her book together. “Her face is much more famous than her creative work, and I wanted to give her a chance to speak … When I saw the manuscripts in the Ashmolean I was in tears – it was amazing to be able to see her own words in her own writing, and I felt that this was a great opportunity to produce a full edition of the poems exactly as she wrote them,” she said.Trowbridge said there were many versions of Siddall’s poems in the Ashmolean, showing her thought processes as she substituted words and changed lines around.“What she writes shows she understands how words work, how form and scansion affect a poem,” she said. “What the manuscripts contain is unpolished, though, and as the multiple versions indicate, some of these are probably unfinished.”My Ladys Soul will be published by independent publisher Victorian Secrets later this month. It draws its title from the poem “I care not for my Ladys soul”, retaining Siddall’s missed apostrophe. That poem depicts a man who loves a woman only for her beauty. When it is gone, he will move on: “Low sit I down at my Ladys feet Gazing through her wild eyes,  Smiling to think how my love will fleet  When their starlike beauty dies”. Biographers consider it a representation of the relationship between Siddall and her husband Trowbridge points out that in the last two lines, the beautiful, passive woman becomes active: “Will any hearken if she cries  Up to the unknown lands?” Siddall’s poetry shares “themes and images” with the work of her sister-in-law, the better-known poet Christina Rossetti, said Trowbridge: “voicing the silenced woman, greenness as a contrast for sadness, the regenerative power of nature, hope for a better life to come”.The academic hopes the new collection, the first since 1978, will “encourage readers to view Siddall as a creative woman in her own right”. “I think her own work has always been overshadowed by paintings of her, and of course the work of women pre-Raphaelites in all areas has always been seen as second to the men,” she said. “I wonder if her poetry has not been taken seriously by scholars because it’s always been read as autobiographical, so it’s often seen as ‘evidence’ rather than art.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/529a91950027e8d17d037a7f43a34dd4b2c5524c/0_202_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35eccb28372a5af5fb5409c3604ffa9e","title":"canadian cities where minorities are the majority markham brampton","story":"In ‘majority-minority’ cities such as Markham and Brampton, ersity isn’t aspirational it’s a fact. But how does integration work?The Foody Mart in Markham, a sprawling city near Toronto, is found in a typical North American suburban plaza, sprinkled with fast-food chains, nail salons and a small legal firm. But look closely and you will notice the mall’s parking signs are in Chinese and the bank serves customers in Cantonese and Mandarin.Inside the Foody Mart, there are shelves of salted duck eggs, air-shipped mangosteen and durian. Staff hand out samples of fish balls and regulars drink bubble tea alongside young families enjoying hot meals from the takeaway counter, as Shanghai pop plays over the speakers.Stores such as the Foody Mart did not exist when Jennifer Chin first moved to Markham in 1991. Born in Jamaica, Chin, 53, is ethnically Chinese, as is her husband. They raised three children while running a business manufacturing Jamaican patties, often described as a quintessentially Torontonian snack.One of the most notable characteristics of Markham’s rise has been thriving pockets of businesses – groceries, clothing stores, spas, tea shops – to serve those groups, particularly in Chinese and south Asian malls.“It’s good and bad,” Chin says. “I love the ersity. I love that we have different kinds of foods: Sri Lankan, Indian-Chinese, even different types of Chinese food. However, sometimes you feel people aren’t encouraged as much to adapt.”Ethnic ties have long attracted newcomers to the suburbs of Toronto, transforming what were once bedroom – or commuter – communities into thriving cities in their own right. Markham’s biggest mall now features high-end shops that rival the shopping centres in Toronto. The city has its own Whole Foods store, as well as chic mid-rise condos to complement the earlier sprawling developments of large single-family homes. As cities get bigger, it’s only natural to be attracted to those who are similar to you, says Mohammad Qadeer, a professor of urban planning at Queen’s University, Ontario. “You usually hang out and interact with people you share interests with,” he says. “Ethnicity and religion are strong ties that bring people together.”But majority-minority cities also serve as a reminder that erse populations do not necessarily generate utopian post-racial societies. White flight and hate crimes still occur, as do coded fights over issues that disproportionately affect immigrants – for instance, blowback against multi-generational housing, where several generations live under one roof.There remains ongoing debate, however, on how much cultural change can be adopted into mainstream society, and how quickly. For instance, statutory holidays, which are mostly aligned with Christian holidays, are days off for workers in Canada. But in 2011, some Chinese grocers in Markham (including the Foody Mart) stayed open in defiance of the law.City councillor Joe Li heard both sides of the debate: that grocers were being discriminated against for not being able to stay open, and that Chinese businesses were trying to impose their culture on the city. Ultimately, Li decided in favour of the grocers, arguing that consumers should have the option to shop on holidays. The move proved so popular that York Region, in which Markham sits, voted that from 2018 any business could stay open 364 days a year.Li asked for something in return: to hire more ersely. “Now you’re starting to see it,” he says. “You walk in and see south Asian people in the store, you see halal meat in the store.”Easy access to halal meat, south Asian groceries and a mosque are all things Rameeka Khan appreciates about living in Markham. The 33-year-old pharmacist of Pakistani descent was born in Canada and has lived in the city nearly her whole life, choosing to settle here with her husband. She is glad they bought a house in 2010 – her family would be priced out today. “In general, people know who you are talking about – it must be the Chinese,” Li told a recent council meeting. “I don’t want that kind of impression.”But with its rapidly increasing ersity has come another development: not just a decreasing proportion of white residents, but also a shrinking number. According to numbers cited by the Toronto Star, the white population fell from 192,400 in 2001 to 169,230 in 2011, and now hovers around 151,000.Bromley attended the same Catholic high school where she now teaches and says the city’s demographic makeup has changed hugely. She sees troubling trends, such as African-Caribbean students being streamed into less-academic courses while Indian students face high expectations to excel. Bromley also sees students trying to bridge the linguistic and cultural gap between schools and their parents, and others who struggle with language themselves.“You might get a kid who presents like they are struggling with the language, but actually they have a learning disability, or you might have a kid who has no conversational ability but they can write just fine.” Bromley feels ill-equipped to help students with such different needs because they have to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, she says, and the English language learners programme doesn’t help her navigate these inidual problems.Gurpreet Malhotra is familiar with such institutional gaps. He is the CEO of Indus Community Services, an organisation that serves newcomers in Brampton. In his experience, businesses have caught on that integration is a two-way street – whether they are clothing shops hiring staff who speak Punjabi or grocers stocking Indian cooking staples – but government-funded institutions have not. Political power, he says, does not reflect Brampton’s population. “We have to dislodge the well-entrenched powers,” Malhotra says of the city council.On the federal and provincial level, the Punjabi community is well represented in Brampton. The first non-white federal party leader, Jagmeet Singh, has a strong political base in the city, where he held a seat as a provincial politician. But Brampton has only one non-white city councillor, Gurpreet Dhillon, who is Punjabi.In the last municipal election, Bromley recalls watching a Punjabi candidate on television arguing that the mayoral office should reflect Brampton’s ethnic makeup. “I had a moment where I felt, ‘Now I’m really going to be a minority,’” she says. “To be brutally honest, it felt like I was being pushed out.”The moment passed. She remembered she had a stable job, in an ideal neighbourhood to raise her five-year-old twins. But she struggles with how to integrate into what Brampton is becoming. She feels lucky to teach students with whom she can have “honest, unfiltered conversations”, but does not feel she can approach, for example, the group of older Indian men hanging out at the park, or busy mums at her skating rink. “Intercultural interaction is a matter of common ground and increased opportunity for encountering each other,” says Qadeer. In cities such as Markham and Brampton, where suburban sprawl reigns and most people travel by car, those opportunities outside school and work can be hard to come by. Brampton is trying to address this as part of its long-term vision for 2040. “The expression of the incredible ersity of the community doesn’t really manifest itself on the ground,” says Larry Beasley, a Vancouver-based planner who spearheaded the project.To ensure people across cultures can better interact, Beasley says the city needs to create places for them to meet. After taking more than 11,000 residents’ comments into account, the plan proposes five city centres – walkable communities that mimic Brampton’s downtown area – to facilitate those interactions. Creating a place for communities to converge was also Jael Richardson’s intent when she founded the Festival for Literary Diversity, which brings together writers from a variety of backgrounds. “I wanted to start a festival that gave erse writers – anyone who’s not typically represented – a space to be the expert,” says Richardson. “We consider having the event in Brampton part of the ersity mandate in and of itself.”The festival was initially met with scepticism – Richardson says Toronto writers frequently told her the event would do better in Toronto – but her tenacity appears to be paying off. This year it secured a multi-year sponsorship from Audible – the digital audiobook producer – and publisher Penguin Random House sent a sizeable contingent of staff.Richardson is creating space for writers in a city where ersity isn’t aspirational – it’s a fact. While it is true that changing demographics here have disturbed the mainstream sensibility, Canada’s majority-minority cities also appear to be changing what mainstream means. For some residents of Markham, such as Chin, the question isn’t whether newcomers can assimilate into the city, but whether both can adapt together.“I don’t think you need to fit in,” Chin says of her majority-minority city. “Everybody fits in.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbb0fd79ebc8ccb407984b74171a056459ecd274/0_14_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=934fa4184e5414486502133845a2771b","title":"rebalance economy rent wages britain","story":"From rising rents to stagnating wages, millions struggle in Britain’s skewed system. My thinktank has some answersThat’s why the message of the Institute for Public Policy Research commission on economic justice, which I chair, is that the economy needs fundamental change.Fundamental reform has happened twice before in the last century after periods of crisis – with the Attlee government’s Keynesian reforms in the 1940s and the Thatcher government’s free market reforms in the 1980s. Ten years after the financial crash, change of a similar magnitude is once again necessary.But simply arguing for change isn’t enough. If people are to have meaningful hope, they need to see how it can be achieved. That is precisely what the commission intends to offer, with a detailed plan to reforge Britain’s economy. We demonstrate how building a fairer economy also means creating a stronger economy, one able to achieve better and more sustainable growth. Our 10-part plan contains 73 recommendations. Collectively, these propose the most significant changes for a generation.Running throughout our recommendations is an emphasis on how the economy must be “hardwired” for justice, with fairer outcomes built into the way it works. It is not enough to remedy injustice and inequality solely by redistribution, through the tax and benefits system. They need to be tackled at source, in the structures of the economy in which they arise. These include the labour market and wage bargaining, the ownership of capital and wealth, the governance of firms, the operation of the financial system and the rules that govern markets. Economic justice must be the organising principle of policy, not an afterthought.In the three decades that followed the second world war, the share of national income that went to pay rather than profits rose steadily. Over the past 30 years, however, those gains have been steadily eroded. This hasn’t happened by accident but rather as the result of deliberate decisions. The commission doesn’t shy away from stating the obvious: some people have too much power, while others have too little.So we argue for a rebalancing of power across the economy: from corporate management towards workers and trade unions from dominant companies towards entrepreneurs and new market entrants from short-term financial interests towards long-term investors from Westminster towards the nations and regions and from iniduals and households who own great wealth to those who do not.But hope also comes from a newly engaged young generation radicalised by the prospect of being poorer than their parents, unable to find secure and fulfilling jobs, spending eye-watering amounts on rent, and without the chance of ever owning a home of their own. It is a deep sign of distress within a society when people delay starting a family because they lack economic security. Our society can do better than this.Many other countries have economies that are both fairer and more successful than ours. We must own our challenges and choices: our economic problems aren’t the fault of others – not the EU, not “globalisation” and certainly not hardworking migrants. We have many more available choices than is commonly stated. The power to transform the economy is in our hands, and if we fail to act, it will be our failure. It’s time to take back control.• Tom Kibasi is founder and chair of the IPPR Commission on Economic Justice whose final report, Prosperity \u0026amp Justice: A Plan for the New Economy, is published today and available in bookshops or free to read online"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22578d85c1c90f75549ce1f7918edeb45b645477/0_223_4467_2681/master/4467.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6397947050fed420f7e5c6965a37ea0d","title":"the consequences of steve bannons ideas need to be interrogated not just his words","story":"The ABC was wrong to believe that through an interview alone Bannon could be held to accountIn his interview with Sarah Ferguson on the ABC, Steve Bannon sought to distance himself from the openly neo-Nazi far right, blaming their surge on the dreaded mainstream media. With extraordinary chutzpah, he said, “they’ve given a bunch of marginal, dangerous people a platform”.By this point Bannon, who has himself become more marginal (having lost his perches in the White House and at Breitbart) but is still dangerous (given his record in those positions), had already been given a significant pass by his interviewer.Ferguson had said that while she had heard other interviewers call Bannon racist, on the basis of interviews and speeches she had watched, “there’s no evidence that that’s what you are”. Ferguson should have looked harder. The archive of Breitbart – the website where Bannon had leadership positions for a decade – groans under the weight of the receipts. In March 2016, the Southern Poverty Law Center published just one of many extensive accounts of the website’s promotion of Islamophobia, myths about black crime, and anti-immigrant sentiment under Bannon’s stewardship. Under Bannon, the site also trafficked in strident homophobia, transphobia and anti-feminism. Apart from attacking any minority you’d care to name, Bannon-era Breitbart serially promoted conspiracy theories about their perceived enemies in movements like Black Lives Matter, and celebrated Confederate iconography. Bannon himself proudly described the website as a “platform for the alt right”, extending the welcome mat to readers from the racist, far-right movement, and promoting materials from white nationalist groups like Generation Identity. Steve Bannon is a former White House strategist and chairman of Breitbart News who had a messy break with Trump – and with influential Republican donors – in early 2018.\u0026nbspThe immediate cause of the split was incendiary observations Bannon made to journalist Michael Wolff about Donald Trump Jr’s Trump Tower meeting with Russian operatives. Bannon called the meeting “treasonous” and “unpatriotic”, Wolff reported, and Bannon concluded: “They’re going to crack Don Junior like an egg on national TV.”Bannon’s comments resulted in a subpoena from the special counsel and a date with congressional investigators. As a primary mover in the Trump campaign and White House insider, Bannon could have valuable information to share about the nature and intent of Trump’s Russia contacts.\u0026nbspBut in his first meeting with the House intelligence committee in January 2018, Bannon declined to answer questions, in an extraordinary scene in which his lawyer consulted with the White House in real time and asserted executive privilege to escape replying.\u0026nbspThe move angered congressional investigators, who vowed to obtain Bannon’s cooperation one way or another. By Tom McCarthyTo better promote far-right ideas, and challenge the Republican establishment, Bannon mentored writers like Milo Yiannopoulos. Back then that now-diminished far-right celebrity, as Buzzfeed’s Joseph Bernstein put it, “led the site in a coy dance around the movement’s nastier edges, writing stories that minimised the role of neo-Nazis and white nationalists while giving its politer voices ‘a fair hearing.’”Bernstein argues that, under Bannon’s active guidance, Yiannopoulos courted and communicated with outright white nationalists about Breitbart articles, while the final results were “laundered for racism”, or at least its most overt expressions, by Bannon and the Breitbart brains trust. Theirs was a professionalised and systematic disingenuousness that offered a protective flank for a movement that reached its apotheosis on a murderous afternoon in Charlottesville last August.Bannon doesn’t conceal his political sympathies. In Bernstein’s reporting and elsewhere, he is seen expressing admiration for fascist thinkers like Julius Evola, and the lurid anti-immigrant fantasies of writers like Jean Raspail. He has repeatedly characterised the current moment as an apocalyptic civilisational war between the “Judeo-Christian” west and the rest. As he mentioned in his chat with Ferguson, Bannon is currently seeking to collaborate with anti-immigrant far-right parties in Europe, like Marine Le Pen’s Front National. Whatever Bannon might say, this is what he has done. By assessing him on the basis of his public performances, rather than his public record, Ferguson effectively allowed Bannon to skate. She pressed him hardest on the consequences of Trump’s trade war, which is underpinned by a Bannonesque economic nationalism. But in so doing she accepted his customary alibi – that “this is about economic nationalism, it’s about populism”.Reactions to the interview – mostly negative – cascaded through social media all day Tuesday. The discussion was made more intense by the New Yorker’s announcement that Bannon had been invited to their ideas festival – an invitation since rescinded. Many social media users railed at Four Corners for giving Bannon a platform. For some journalists, the very idea of no-platforming rubs them the wrong way. Perhaps this is because they misunderstand what it might mean in the context of journalism. It’s true that in reporting on far-right movements, it is sometimes necessary to talk to their members and leaders. I myself have spoken to many people – like Richard Spencer or Jared Taylor – whose racist views are more explicit, open, and perhaps more extreme than those nurtured by Bannon. (However, despite offers, I have so far refused to pose for post-interview selfies with them.)We cannot and should not ignore these people, and the movements they lead. If we ignore them, they will not go away. But their words are a mere adjunct to the real story, which is found in the effects of their (often rudimentary) ideas and actions on segments of the population whom they despise. For Bannon, who helped elect Trump and fostered the alt right, the consequences of his ideas, and his influence, are many. At the level of policy they include a far harsher regime of immigration enforcement, including the separation of families the so-called “Muslim ban” and the destruction of the liberal international order. The emboldening of the far right has led to a surge in hate crimes (including murders), a proliferation of violent far-right street protests, and a generalised atmosphere of fear in marginalised communities. Given his diminished relevance, and the already voluminous public record of his beliefs, it’s debatable whether it’s useful interviewing Bannon at all. If it is, then it’s worth making all of this context clear. That context should include – and ideally centre – the voices of the people most affected by restrictionist immigration policies and far-right violence. Such voices have been heard far less frequently than Bannon’s in the course of the Trump era, and even less so by Australian audiences.Ferguson’s mistake lay not in talking to him per se, but in believing that through an interview alone, bound by the normal conventions of civil debate, he could be successfully held to account.But in a standalone interview, without additional context, he was able to make his case in a format that he performs well in, and regularly seeks out. Bannon was able to publicise his activities, have his ideas be presented as worthy of discussion, and allowed to further dissemble about the nature of his political project. When Ferguson finally questioned him about the president’s response to the far right’s rally in Charlottesville, and the murder that resulted, Bannon was allowed to speak as if it had no relationship with Trump, his supporters, and the political climate they have fostered. The idea that a searching one-on-one conversation may not be adequate to uncovering the truth of a particular subject, and their impact on the world, offends the training, and perhaps the vanity, of many journalists, especially broadcasters. Others, looking back over the way that Trump, and the alt right, benefited from even the most critical coverage, have begun to think about better ways of treating movements that present an existential threat to some of their readers. When  US senior reporter Lois Beckett talked to beat reporters about how best to cover the alt right, they had “more of an expectation than usual that subjects may lie and deceive a deeper sense of the history and context of extremist organizing more acknowledgement of the connections between fringe extremist groups and mainstream racism and an awareness of how much even critical coverage of these groups can amplify their messages and increase their reach”. It’s hard to pull that off in a broadcast interview with minimal contextual material. It may be easier in a documentary format.On the issue of amplification, some academic research offers the same warning. A survey of journalists reflecting on the Trump phenomenon and the alt-right surge by Data and Society Institute researcher Whitney Phillips showed how “just by showing up for work and doing their jobs as assigned, journalists covering the far-right fringe … played directly into these groups’ public relations interests”. Australian journalists, who have seen xenophobic ideas about refugees become the meat of bipartisan immigration policy, should be more attuned than most of their colleagues to the dangers of normalising far-right ideas. Some ideas, like the falsehoods promoted in Breitbart, are not worth extended debate. Journalists need instead to show the harm caused by their dissemination, and sound a warning. With News Corp providing an increasingly receptive platform for touring alt-right grifters, it’s important for the ABC to get it right. • Jason Wilson is a  writer and columnist"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ca40d81cd0a9c0987401ead4b22af173bd9fe12/184_160_5327_3196/master/5327.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8f2261f0dba65a79253fa8122413dc5","title":"saadat hasan manto bombay mumbai nandita das india","story":"Saadat Hasan Manto chronicled Bombay life in all its ugly beauty – until sectarian horrors were unleashed on the streets he loved. A new biopic by director Nandita Das retells his storiesIt took just a moment to cleave India in two. At midnight between 14 and 15 August 1947, the country of Pakistan was born and India was liberated from British rule. In the months leading to the end of the British Raj, one of the world’s largest migrations occurred. Fourteen million people were displaced, leading to acts of mass violence, turning Hindu, Muslim and Sikh against one another.On the morning of the 15th, Saadat Hasan Manto looked on with horror as communal violence erupted on the streets of his adopted home city, then known as Bombay. A journalist and short story author, he had just been fired from his job as a screenwriter at the Bombay Talkies film studio for being a Muslim. Fearing for his family’s safety, he had little choice but to flee the city, finding refuge in Lahore, Pakistan. By 1955 he was dead, aged 42, due to alcoholism. He had never returned to the city he loved.Born in Punjab in 1912, Manto was one of most controversial writers of the age, eloquently crafting empathetic and shocking short stories about those living on the edges of society. Many of his best tales were inspired by his time in what is now Mumbai between 1936 and 1948. He would recall these years as the happiest of his short life, with stories that portrayed a very different side to India, embracing both beauty and ugliness. While best known for his tales of partition such as Toba Tek Singh, he also masterfully captured the underbelly of the city, telling stories of pimps, gangsters, salon madams and prostitutes living in cramped chawls. His stories were frank, forthright and imbued with a sense of moral outrage that aimed to give a voice to the voiceless. Notoriety inevitably followed him, and Manto faced trial six times on charges of obscenity for his short stories.The author’s life and work are now the subject of Firaaq director Nandita Das’s second feature film, Manto. Starring Sacred Games star Nawazuddin Siddiqui as Manto, the biopic charts the writer’s last years in Bombay before moving to Pakistan. “He’s so relevant to today, and it is my way of responding to what is happening now,” explains Das, speaking from Mumbai. “His empathy was very deep for those that exist on the margins of society – especially for women and sex workers – and no one in India was writing about that at the time.”Throughout the film, Das weaves in tableaux of five of the author’s better-known works, blurring the line between fact and fiction – as was the case with Manto’s own work. His stories spring to life as he strolls crowded streets, talking with intellectuals in Irani cafes, drinking Deer brand whiskey with actors and singers, and making ends meet by working as a screenwriter – often haggling for more money from penny-pinching producers. Salman Rushdie, the author of Midnight’s Children and one of Manto’s biggest advocates, describes him as “unparalleled in his generation”. “There are few writers,” says Rushdie, “who straddle both India and Pakistan as he does, and who engage with the deepest problems of both countries.” According to Rushdie, Bombay was always Manto’s “greatest inspiration”. It is an affection that shines throughout Das’s film.Manto was the voice of the city in the 1940s. As a writer he peeled back the tourist-guide sentimentality of the city, portraying a warts-and-all place where you could “live on the footpath or in a magnificent palace” and be happy “on two pennies a day or on 10,000 rupees”.Like Manto, Das doesn’t wince at showing the city’s complexity pre- and post-partition in the 40s. The director says: “I didn’t want to do a series of cliched shots of places like the Gateway of India, or the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus. It’s the Bombay that common people see at eye level that I wanted to show.”Das was fascinated by the fact that Manto wrestled with the theme of identity all his life. It was this that inspired her to make the film. He was a Muslim living in a cosmopolitan city also populated by Sikhs, Christians and Jews. It was a place where textile workers huddled in cramped tenements while film producers puffed on fat cigars in luxurious surroundings. Manto lived and breathed a city of contrast and contradiction, much of which is still reflected in its modern incarnation, Mumbai.Back then it was an environment that provided enough anonymity to allow him to sculpt his own identity and escape moralising busybodies. That is, until world events intervened, forcing him to be defined by his religious identity – the shock must have been immense. “We are still grappling with issues of identity, nationalism and religion. Not just in India, but around the world,” says Das. “His words lend themselves to the times, then and now, in their identity politics.” Manto’s work was born from his experience. In his stories we see an author who never shrank from telling the truth about what he saw, even if it was ugly. “His sense of morality, his sense of humanity and truth is just as important in today’s world where we are discussing concepts like ‘post-truth’ and fake news. The space for expressing truth is shrinking,” says Das. Das wanted to do more than simply tell Manto’s story. Just as Manto saw the world in Bombay – a place of boundless (and for a time borderless) opportunities where issues of race, religion and nationality blurred – she also wanted to explore the theme. “It’s not about showcasing an Indian writer it is about looking at the idea of boundaries,” she says. “It’s about how we have created these boundaries of ‘us and them’, whether its person to person, or country to country, because we are losing our grip on the importance of truth. Have we stopped valuing honesty?” In Manto, Das sees a kindred spirit. Above all she sees a maverick, a free thinker, who sought to open up India in all its wild and contradictory glory. So does she think, as many believe, that Manto was a prophet of things to come for both Pakistan and India? “No one film can say, ‘This is India’,” says Das. “It is part of that jigsaw puzzle, and it is for you to put those pieces together and create your view of India, because it’s many things to many people.” She concludes: “This period of Indian history is very significant. It defined India and Pakistan as it is today. Manto was the conscience of society. And if he were writing what he wrote back then, it would probably be banned.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/329388ffddec6f8782e0f68e7c7e07529e8a8544/0_232_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b45a2a724997bde08361f9ff8006a7f","title":"scotland first womens world cup finals england france","story":"• Jane Ross hits winner in Scotland’s 2-1 victory in Albania • Phil Neville’s England ring changes but still thrash KazakhstanOn a day when Scotland’s women reached a first World Cup finals and Welsh hearts were broken, England showed off some impressive strength in depth.As Wales saw all hope of qualifying for France 2019 extinguished and Jane Ross scored a potentially life-changing winner for Scotland in Albania, the most experimental side of Phil Neville’s short international managerial tenure concluded the Lionesses’ World Cup qualifying campaign with a resounding 6-0 Group One win away to Kazakhstan.England’s 3-0 victory against Wales in Newport last Friday had already guaranteed they would finish top of the group and booked their ticket to next summer’s showpiece across the Channel.Inspired by the gifted Kim Little, Scotland will now join them. Shelley Kerr’s side celebrated automatic qualification as winners of Group Two courtesy of Ross’s goal in a 2-1 triumph after Little’s early opener had been cancelled out by an Albanian equaliser.“It’s not often I’m lost for words but I’m really emotional,” said head coach Shelley Kerr. “We’ve done it the hard way during the campaign but we’ve shown great maturity and determination to succeed. These moments don’t come along too often so I’m absolutely ecstatic and it’ll take a while for it to sink in that we’re off to our first World Cup.”Captain Rachel Corsie added: “At the final whistle it was hard to know what to do. It was just an incredibly surreal feeling. We need to enjoy that and we will because we deserve to. We always felt comfortable in the game and we created more than enough chances to win it. We knew that second goal was coming and we believed that it would. We persevered and once we got it we controlled the game well. The World Cup is the pinnacle of football and to have the opportunity to go over there and be on that stage with the best teams in the world is going to be incredibly special.”While the visiting celebrations in Shkoder were ecstatic, things were a little lower key in Pavlodar where England ended their qualifying campaign unbeaten with seven wins and one draw. Between now and next June Neville wants intense, and increased, competition for places in his squad and England’s manager used the opportunity of an ostensibly dead rubber against the group’s bottom side by making 11 changes from the side who started at Rodney Parade. The England team who ran out against Kazakhstan duly contained seven players making their full debuts.Considering their hosts had scored only twice during a dismal qualifying campaign – and one of those was an own goal – such inexperience did not hamper Neville’s players. By half-time a Beth Mead penalty and another goal from Rachel Daly had put them two up.Neville describes the latter, Houston Dash utility player as “seven footballers all rolled into one” and, deployed as a forward on this occasion, Daly – who has also excelled at left-back recently – once again emphasised her versatility.Alongside her and Mead, Reading’s Lauren Bruton also shone as she won her first cap but it was Izzy Christiansen – the midfielder who swapped Manchester City for Lyon this summer – who put Neville’s side three up in the 54th minute following Bruton’s cross.Another debutant, Birmingham’s Lucy Staniforth, - who has overcome two ruptured cruciate ligaments - claimed a 66th-minute fourth before England won another penalty. This time, though, Arsenal’s Mead missed, hitting a post.Undeterred, Mead soon atoned by shooting the fifth and Bruton created the sixth for the substitute Lucy Bronze as Welsh play-off hopes evaporated.Although Ludlow’s side, who for a time were above England in their group table and held Neville’s players to a 0-0 draw at Southampton last April, finished second, they were not one of the four best qualifiers across seven groups. Having completed their fixtures, Ludlow’s players were left on tenterhooks waiting to see if other results went their way.Agonisingly they did not. Germany, Norway and Sweden joined Scotland in clinching automatic qualification Belgium, Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands found themselves consigned to the lottery of two play-off games to determine the final European place at France 2019.Considering the Netherlands are European Champions – they beat England in the semi-finals of Euro 2017 before defeating Denmark in the final – their failure to qualify automatically will be seen as a setback."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b1b2549803670d0668bbb311a6ad9d627991980/180_734_3630_2178/master/3630.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c0dbcd82642c21e09b3ac4a46f968e6","title":"steve sidwell interview retirement premier league brighton","story":"Much-travelled midfielder reflects on career as a Premier League player and on the tough decision to call it a day earlier this year“I’ve been with my wife since we were kids at school and she had never seen me cry, ever,” Steve Sidwell says as he remembers the spring evening this year when he sat next to her on their bathroom floor. Sidwell cried for a long time, his tears leaving little marks wherever he looked, as he finally accepted that his career as a professional footballer was over.He had joined the Arsenal academy 26 years before, aged nine, and played in the Premier League for Reading, Chelsea, Aston Villa, Fulham and Stoke before joining Brighton in 2016. Sidwell helped Brighton gain promotion to the Premier League last year but he had been injured for the whole of their first season back in the top flight. A varied career, which saw him work under managers as different as Arsène Wenger and José Mourinho, had ended and Sidwell felt overwhelmed.A small smile drifts across his previously serious face. “In a way I wanted the tears to happen. It was good, it was a real relief. Once it happened I accepted it. That was it. I was done as a player.”On an autumn morning at Brighton’s training ground, where Sidwell will coach the under-16 squad an hour from now, the 35-year-old reflects on the pain of letting go and the anticipation of a new life. He may fulfil his ambition of becoming a high-level coach or carve out a different path as a pundit as Sidwell is bright and perceptive. The former midfielder is also honest when he considers the ide that separates most footballers from mainstream society – while capturing the insecurities inside the Premier League bubble.Did he avoid showing emotion as a footballer? “Yeah. You grow up not wanting to show weakness in a dressing room because the other players will have a different opinion of you. You don’t want to show the gaffer that either because you might not be selected. So you build up a front.”That front disappeared once he decided to retire. “There was a honeymoon period where you’re telling people and it’s all new. But then you reach the stage of ‘I’m crossing the line’. So I was nervous, excited, scared. It’s every emotion you can imagine – an out-of-body experience. It’s similar to scoring a goal. You can’t really describe it. Football is something I’ve always done so I’ve had that structure and been given instructions day in, day out.“I’m really close to my wife but others aren’t so lucky. You see how the orce rate goes up for former footballers. You’ve been doing something you love for so long and then it’s gone. It can be a bereavement and you take it out on the ones nearest to you.”Sidwell describes the jolt footballers feel when cut free from their high-pressured but numbingly cosseted world. “Football is about instant results. Yes, footballers live a luxurious life and we get given everything. If you split a pair of boots you get a new pair that same afternoon. If you’ve got a cough you see the club doctor. And you get a prescription that’s filled straightaway. Everything’s given to you instantly.“You’re a commodity to the club, and they want you to have no stress. So you lose a little touch with reality. I’ve never had a GP because I’ve never needed to go outside my club but in the big world you need to pay accounts, sort out your MOT. People outside football won’t always grasp this but not doing these little things can mean you lose touch with society.”It also means that some footballers don’t develop many social skills. “One hundred per cent,” Sidwell says. “It’s even more so for the top players. They get criticised if they go out or if they stay in. They can’t win so in the end they build up a barrier. Now when your career finishes you’re not really used to talking to people. And you obviously need that skill in the real world.”Sidwell is different because, as he explains, “throughout my career I’ve been very grounded and that’s come from mum and dad. My dad had a scaffolding company in south London and he had me working as a kid – even on my days off when I was a pro at Arsenal. He’d come into my room at half-six and get me up for work.“My kids are very fortunate, they can get most things but I’m having the same thing with my 12-year-old son. He smashed his iPhone and said: ‘Dad, can I have another one?’ I said: ‘Well, give me £600.’ He only had £150 in his savings. I said: ‘OK, earn it.’ My brother’s now taken on my dad’s company so my eldest son has been working there in the holidays.”His three sons play football and, as Sidwell says, “sometimes they think: ‘Dad’s a footballer, I can be one too.’ But they’re slowly grasping it’s a brutal and relentless road.”Sidwell expresses concern that, despite admiring the way in which Gareth Southgate helped his England World Cup squad reconnect with the public, the gap between Premier League footballers and ordinary people is deepening. “More so than ever now. The Premier League, PFA and clubs do a lot in terms of trying to interact with fans and local communities. That’s great but there’s a big gap now. How many times do you see teams get off the coach and they can’t go near the barriers? They can’t sign autographs, so that connection is lost. We need to get it back quickly. Football should be about enjoyment but the business side is taking over.”Mourinho signed him for Chelsea, in 2007, and he struggled to break into the first team, making 15 appearances in his one season at the club. Sidwell’s personal experience with Mourinho, however, stands in stark contrast to his impressions of the manager’s troubles at Manchester United. “He was brilliant with me even though I came in the year he left. It was that third-season syndrome for him. But his player management was unreal then. He told me two weeks before my starting debut: ‘You’re training really well. You’re not playing this Saturday but you’re starting at the Bridge, against Blackburn, the following Saturday. Get mentally prepared.’ He had brilliant little touches then.Steve Coppell is Sidwell’s favourite manager, after they forged such a close bond at Reading, but his respect for Brighton’s Chris Hughton runs deep and he believes “the gaffer is right up there and I’ve worked with some of the best in the game”.As well as being an assistant coach of Brighton’s under-16s Sidwell is a club ambassador. “Brighton have been fantastic and allowed me to adjust. I had a summer holiday in August which was my first in 20 years. I’m now loving the coaching. I’ve got my B coaching badges and I’m in the final stages of getting my A licence. You need to earn your stripes, learn the trade, and your coaching career could swiftly take off – or come crashing down. But I’d rather do it, and fail, than not try.“In six months I might say: ‘This is not for me’ and the media side might take off. I would’ve liked to have done TV and media to start but look at Stevie Gerrard and Frank Lampard. They could’ve done media work permanently but they’re competitive. The competitive edge draws us back in. I’m spinning plates and we’ll see what takes off.“But I’m happy with my decision to retire. The toughest thing was admitting it – because of injuries I didn’t go on my terms. But there’s nothing I would change. I did everything with purpose and intent. If it worked out, or didn’t, I knew I’d tried my best.”Sidwell looks up, nods and smiles with the certainty that, after the pain of retirement, he will apply the same principles in his new life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f581aecff41be3bf7ad4bb499223b41e693eba74/0_197_2923_1754/master/2923.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82c1de67956b68c6da5ae9e4312b2a7c","title":"the secret to self improvement time washing dishes and other drudgery","story":"Even the most tedious task can become an enriching experience when you’re listening to great podcasts, audio books and moreWe have more time on our hands than we think. According to a 2017 study, the average driver in the UK will spend 32 hours a year in traffic jams. In 2016, the Trade Union Congress found that around 3.7 million workers spent more than two hours commuting each work day.Furthermore, research for cleaning experts Jeyes claims that the average Brit spends nearly 21 hours a week on household chores. That’s 45 days a year on everything from doing the washing up to tidying up, ironing and walking the dog.On the whole, these activities represent sheer drudgery. Yet there’s little reason why these monotonous, repetitive undertakings should send us spiralling into an intellectual netherworld. This goes for other less-humdrum tasks – be they running, working out in the gym, cooking or taking a bath. Instead, we should see them as fresh windows of opportunity to enrich our daily lives. A good audiobook, documentary or podcast can be just right for transforming the banal into something genuinely entertaining or instructive. Indeed, as a recent study by University College London – in collaboration with Audible – demonstrated, listening to an audiobook can be even more emotionally engaging than watching films or TV.Testing scenes from stories across a range of genres on more than 100 people aged between 18 and 67, the research conclusively showed that audio produced a stronger physiological response in participants compared with video adaptations. This was indicated by a greater fluctuation in both heart rate and electrodermal activity. Given this power to engage the emotions of listeners, audio content offers a great opportunity for escapism during dull chores or a punishing commute. Ever listened to Audible Original’s Treasure Island on the underground? Try it. Creaking claustrophobia, stale air and rattling carriages give way to high seas, gold and mutiny. You are no longer a dour-faced commuter but young adventurer Jim Hawkins the guy next to you, Long John Silver. Comedy and Monday morning might seem odd companions, but I defy anyone to listen to Alan Partridge’s 2011 memoirs par excellence, I, Partridge, and not raise a chortle. Read by creator Steve Coogan, Norwich’s most famous son is brought to life in all his horrendous, score-settling glory. Although containing significantly less hubris, Parks and Recreation star Amy Poehler’s autobiography, Yes Please, is no less entertaining, and offers up a genuinely charming insight into friendship, parenthood and love. Guest vocal appearances from the likes of Seth Meyers, Patrick Stewart and Kathleen Turner all add to the fun. Of the chores mentioned above, washing up is perhaps most conducive to a strange mood of contemplation – being elbow-deep in suds is an immersive experience, in both a literal and figurative sense. An absorbing podcast or piece of audio journalism can be just the ticket in this instance. One of the picks of last year, Jon Ronson’s The Butterfly Effect, delves into the world of free porn as part of his latest sprawling investigation. Far from being salacious or judgmental – despite traditional perceptions of the subject matter – this podcast is both eye-opening and, in places, deeply moving, and was nominated for the Audie award for nonfiction 2018.In addition to being an extraordinary storyteller, Ronson possesses a voice that is homely and soothing in tone – a sibilant mesh of south Wales and north-west England. In some instances, one might be forgiven for selecting listening material based almost exclusively on the reader’s brogue – especially when going to sleep at the end of the day.Stephen Fry is surely the nation’s favourite reader, lending his voice to numerous audiobooks, which range from the Harry Potter series to Paddington Bear and Sherlock Holmes: The Definitive Collection. Another reader who’s well worth setting your Audible sleep timer to is Sean Barrett. In possession of resonant, rich and honeyed tones, Barrett is best-known to English-speaking listeners as the voice of Jo Nesbo. He is also the reader of Michael Robotham’s latest psychological thriller The Other Wife. Scarlett Johansson also does a decent job of tackling Lewis Carroll’s dizzying assortment of characters in Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland. More solitary pursuits – think an overnight road trip or a long-distance run – can afford a kind of intimacy to heart-on-sleeve audiobooks. Actor and comedian Robert “Peep Show” Webb’s autobiography How Not to be a Boy proved something of a revelation last year, with its poignant depiction of childhood and losing a mother young.Similarly, to hear the late, great Maya Angelou read I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings from beyond the grave is at once compelling, moving and vital. Of course, what you choose to listen to, and where, boils down to subjective mixing and matching. There is no rule of thumb here. For some, listening to no-holds-barred drag queen Bianca Del Rio dispense self-help advice in Blame it on Bianca Del Rio might be the perfect accompaniment to watering your herbaceous borders this summer others might plump for Don’t Throw In the Trowel!: Vegetable Gardening Month by Month.And we are spoiled for choice too – Audible has the world’s largest selection of audiobooks available to download.

Indeed, award-winning Nigerian novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie once wrote that in “nonfiction, and in particular the literary memoir, the stylised recollection of personal experience, is often as much about character and story and emotion as fiction is”.For that reason, memoirs lend themselves brilliantly to being read aloud, offering personal yet universal tales of hardship or happiness, or maybe both. They can be captivatingly recounted by their well-known authors, who get another chance to put their own spin on a story they’ve lived and chronicled. Alternatively, they can draw you into an extraordinary but less-publicised life.Either way, there’s something about the warmth and human connection of hearing these stories read aloud as audiobooks that makes them a cut above a bingeable boxset.

This is the birthplace of Voltaire, Proust and Simone de Beauvoir. During the late-19th and early-20th centuries the city had one of the most exciting and glamorous art scenes of any capital, with hangouts such as Les Deux Magots and Cafe de Flore boasting customer lists that read like the dream dinner-party lineup – or perhaps the dinner party from hell, depending on your point of view – with the names Verlaine, Rimbaud, Hemingway, Camus, Picasso and, later, Sartre all on the on the list.You don’t have to make much of an effort to bump up against literary characters in Paris: the evidence is everywhere, as is a host of independent bookshops, including a great selection offering English-translated literature (of which Shakespeare and Company, another legendary writers’ hangout, is the best known). It would be possible to devote an entire trip to Paris’s literary museums. The Maison de Balzac in Rue Raynouard is a favourite the garden has a fabulous view of the Eiffel Tower. The Maison de Victor Hugo is an essential stop on Place des Vosges. And the Musée de la Vie Romantique, on Rue Chaptal and closely linked to George Sand, is breathtakingly beautiful. I’m not sure how cheering it would be to visit Marcel Proust’s actual bedroom, where he spent the last few years of his life tending to his sensitive lungs, but it has been lovingly recreated in the Musée Carnavalet. If you’re on a short trip, the one must-see is the Père Lachaise cemetery, the resting place of Proust, the poet Apollinaire, the great playwright Molière and American author Gertrude Stein. It’s also a site of pilgrimage for those visiting the graves of Oscar Wilde, Édith Piaf, Frédéric Chopin, Maria Callas and Jim Morrison of the Doors (his followers gather with hip flasks and bottles of red wine to toast his memory). Make sure you use the entrance near Gambetta Métro, as then you can walk downhill rather than uphill as you explore.For a wander around Paris that really gives a flavour of its literary heritage, the Latin Quarter has got to be the place to start. It’s worth visiting (or staying at) L’Hotel in Saint-Germain-des-Prés, Oscar Wilde’s last home in Paris. He never paid his final bill, and it is still displayed in room 16, in which he lamented: “My wallpaper and I are fighting a duel to the death. One of us has got to go.” L’Hotel is one of the most beautifully preserved properties in the city, and has an amazingly atmospheric cocktail bar that opens on to a stunning courtyard. Close by is Cluny-La Sorbonne Métro station, and it’s around this area that lots of literary landmarks are clustered, including the Pantheon, which houses the tombs of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Victor Hugo, Émile Zola and Alexandre Dumas. Not far from the Pantheon is 74 Rue du Cardinal Lemoine, Hemingway’s address in Paris in 1922 and 1923. He used to drink at Café des Amateurs, now called Café Delmas. From here it’s a short walk to the Jardin du Luxembourg, the famous site of the meeting between Marius and Cosette in Hugo’s Les Misérables. The best shortcut to soaking up the literary flavour of Paris? A meal at Polidor, the restaurant in the sixth arrondissement favoured by André Gide, Jack Kerouac and Henry Miller. Diners sit at long, communal tables next to Polidor’s trademark mustard pots and salt cellars. If you’re alone, it’s the best place to be, with a pleasing audiobook to keep you company.The Hunchback of Notre-Dame by Victor Hugo, NaxosAlthough outshone in recent years by Les Misérables, largely thanks to a lavish Hollywood remake with Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway, The Hunchback of Notre-Dame is Hugo’s real masterpiece and his ode to Paris and its architecture. (He wrote the novel to showcase the cathedral of Notre-Dame.) Set in 1482 during the reign of Louis XI, the novel follows Quasimodo, a hunchback tasked with kidnapping the gypsy Esmeralda for his master, Archdeacon Claude Frollo. When the plan goes wrong, Esmeralda nonetheless shows Quasimodo a moment of human kindness that he will never forget.The Red and the Black by Stendhal, NaxosThis classic, narrated by audiobook legend Bill Homewood (a Shakespearean actor with a ridiculously mellifluous voice), is often overlooked. Published in 1830, it tells the story of Julien Sorel, a provincial young man determined to rise above his humble beginnings. He realises that unless he behaves in a ruthless and calculating way, there is no place for him in French society, especially not one ruled over by the Church. Known as one of the earliest psychological novels, Stendhal’s tour de force shows the deterioration of a man’s character as he grapples with hypocrisy. Madame Bovary by Gustave Flaubert, NaxosFlaubert insisted that the flighty young woman bored in her marriage and desperate to escape provincial life at the heart of what is commonly regarded as the great 19th-century French novel represented something bigger than herself. “Madame Bovary, c’est moi,” he said of his most famous character. Emma Bovary marries a rather tragic country doctor, Charles, and finds her life unbearably dull. She embarks on a series of romantic and consumerist escapades to attempt to alleviate her misery. Juliet Stevenson’s narration is Oscar-worthy and the pacing is superb: vivid, dramatic and occasionally spine-tingling.Les Liaisons Dangereuses by Choderlos de Laclos, AudibleWho doesn’t want to hear Dominic West as the lascivious and corrupting Vicomte de Valmont (the character played by John Malkovich in the film)? Choderlos de Laclos’s addictive epistolary novel was published in 1782 and caused a scandal at the time. It is a sharp critique of the morals and behaviour of the aristocracy. Two older former lovers, Vicomte de Valmont and the Marquise de Merteuil use two naive young women as pawns in their metaphorical emotional chess match. This two-hour audio version is taken from the Donmar production starring Elaine Cassidy and Janet McTeer. It’s unmissable.100 Greatest Poems: Paul Verlaine, Victor Hugo, Baudelaire, AstorgA fantastic three-and-a-half hour introduction to French poetry, featuring extracts from Victor Hugo’s Contemplations and Autumn Leaves, the lyrical work of Paul Verlaine and Flowers of Evil by Charles Baudelaire. Hugo was to become better known for his fiction, but the poetry he wrote in his late teens earned him a pension from Louis XVIII. Verlaine, a close friend of Rimbaud, had a messy life, but was loved by the French public and crowned “Prince of Poets” in 1894, while Baudelaire’s reputation for romantic gothic poetry is unparalleled a great selection of his classics are featured here.Moderato Cantabile by Marguerite Duras, Éditions ThélèmeNarrated beautifully (in French) by Pauline Huruguen, who specialises in reading modern French authors, this is a treat. Marguerite Duras’s best-known works are her novel, The Lover (which won the Prix Goncourt in 1984), and her screenplay for Hiroshima Mon Amour (nominated for an Oscar in 1961). Moderato Cantabile was her entry into French literary society, and sold more than half a million copies. An unusual and evocative novel, and one of the first examples of the sparing, suggestive style of the “nouveau roman”, it builds up a picture of the life of Anne Desbaresdes, whose cosy, middle-class existence falls apart when she witnesses a murder.Paris After the Liberation: 1944-1949 by Antony Beevor and Artemis Cooper, PenguinFor some historical background on Paris before the heady days of the Left Bank and the 1960s, turn to this fantastic study of French life, which details the chaos that followed the war up to 1949. This masterful history is brought to life by narrator Sean Barrett. It conjures up images of Paris from within living memory that are extraordinarily vivid. With liberation come joy and relief, but also a raft of recrimination and blame. The city is hungry and there are constant fuel shortages. Sobering and entertaining.Bonjour Tristesse by Françoise Sagan, des femmesIf you want to practise your French or just hear something extraordinarily beautiful while you are walking around Paris, listen to this incredible abridged audio version of Françoise Sagan’s 1954 novel. Bonjour Tristesse caused an overnight sensation when it was published, its author being only 18. Seventeen-year-old Cécile is spending the summer in the south of France and trying to figure out how to navigate life with her philandering father. When one of his friends arrives, the family’s fragile equilibrium is destroyed. Catherine Deneuve’s voice is sublime.Down and Out in Paris and London by George Orwell, CSA WordThis autobiographical work traces Orwell’s steps as he tramps around the two capitals. While working as a drudge in Paris kitchens, Orwell drifts into an underworld, where he documents how society regards the poor and miserable. Although he is a tourist in this situation (and doing it to prove a political point), this is a poignant and important work that has stood the test of time. You would hope the sanitary conditions of hotel life and restaurant food have moved on since the book’s publication in 1933, however. Me Talk Pretty One Day by David Sedaris, HachetteSedaris is one of US’s best satirists and a fantastic public speaker. This, then, is a double pleasure: his work, narrated by him. Some of the recordings here are live, others were done in the studio. The book contains a mix of stories about Sedaris’s life, but it mostly centres on his attempts to learn French and the ridicule he faces at the hands of the French, especially on the Paris Métro. A (sometimes reluctant) Francophile, he’s the ultimate snarky insider guide to Paris. He is also utterly brutal – and hilarious – on the behaviour of Americans in France.Viv Groskop is the author of the forthcoming Au Revoir, Tristesse: Lessons in Happiness from French Literature Your first audiobook is free with a 30-day trial from Audible – £7.99 a month after 30 days.

Simon Sebag Montefiore’s look at the history of the Romanovs – the dynasty of tsars and tsarinas who ruled Russia and its empire from the 17th century up until the revolutions of 1917 and the death of Tsar Nicholas II in 1918 – was well reviewed, but is a heavy book to carry around and get through. Simon Russell Beale, the Bafta-winning actor who starred in films The Death of Stalin and Into the Woods, reads it all for you, which makes it much easier to sort your tsarinas from your Tatianas and your Alexanders from your, er, other Alexanders.Ulysses by James Joyce, read by Jim Norton and Marcella Riordan27 hrs 16 mins, equivalent to flying from London to WellingtonThis is probably one of those books you always thought you ought to manage if only you could summon the wherewithal.

But too often this fandom lapses into misogyny and body shamingAhead of Britney Spears’ record-breaking show at Brighton Pride this year, Aaron Hussey noticed a fellow fan wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with a picture of Spears’ nervous breakdown: the 2007 incident when, head shaved, she attacked a photographer’s car with an umbrella. “I think he thought he was being funny,” Hussey says. “He wasn’t.”“Brightney Pride”, as it has affectionately been nicknamed, was one of the biggest events of the gay calendar – so big that 4,000 revellers were left stranded once the city’s heaving public transport system failed under the pressure. Surely only dedicated Spears “stans” – the most dedicated kind of fan, a portmanteau of “fan” and “stalker” taken from Eminem’s hit about a crazed follower – would have braved these conditions to glimpse their idol. So why the cruel taunt?Gay male culture has always coalesced around female pop stars, from Judy Garland to Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande. Academics and critics have puzzled over the source of this connection, their often misplaced theories ranging from the outlandish to the oedipal. But gay men and the women they worship are usually happy to bask in the mutual affection. This year, Spears was honoured with an award by the US’s Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (Glaad) for promoting equality. She responded by saying the gay community had shown her “unconditional love”.But “unconditional” is often precisely what this love is not. Scratch lightly at the surface and what flakes off is, yes, reciprocity and genuine affection, but also callous misogyny. One theory of the gay fan-a link is that of shared oppression – gay men and women are both ground under the wheel of hetero-patriarchy. Perhaps in that model, the Spears T-shirt could be read as a show of solidarity, a knowing acknowledgment of her pain and our understanding? But there was nothing knowing in the way another gay fan photoshopped an umbrella into his meet and greet photo with the unwitting star and later circulated it online. These actions have a distinct edge of mockery, the air of a joke that their subject is not in on.Dr Michael Bronski, a Harvard University professor and the author of books on queer history and gay culture says “There is a long history of gay male fan culture latching onto famous women and then turning on them. Queens would come to a Judy Garland concert and then scream at her when she was too drunk to finish it. The women have changed – it’s no longer Marlene Dietrich and Judy Garland. But the dynamic remains in western culture.”The love-hate dynamic of gay stan culture that Bronski describes is now largely mediated through social media. Heckling in smoky nightclubs has been replaced by “hate memes”, when stans circulate unflattering edited pictures or examples of a star’s least-becoming behaviour, while the cheering has morphed into a lexicon of superlatives and put-downs that may seem impenetrable to the uninitiated: “we stan” favoured female pop stars, they’re “iconic”, a “kween”, an “unproblematic fave”. “She outsold” describes both someone’s commercial successes and a general sense of their superiority. Anyone who fails to meet those standards? “Fat”, “flop”, “failure”.This online community relies on a dense matrix of references and neologisms informed by everything from drag culture to reality TV. Sami Baker is 21 and a self-professed gay stan – his favourites are Grande, Beyoncé and Charli XCX. He explains that the culture reaches further than many beyond the community might realise, citing the example of the recent avalanche of memes of reality star Gemma Collins. “They originated from gay stan Twitter. The language used within this culture is taken from the same place that Drag Race gets its lexicon, namely the underground subculture where LGBT people compete in various drag and performance categories, documented in the film Paris is Burning, and an inspiration for Madonna and Beyoncé.For many gay men, Baker and myself included, gay pop stan culture is the distillation of everything meaningful in life. That statement reeks of camp melodrama, but it’s true. To my teenage self, women like Lady Gaga were the only light in a world where my queerness left me feeling like an outsider. As I grew up, the process of connecting my love for them with a wider culture of fandom enhanced my realisation that I was not alone as a queer person. “As I learned more about pop culture and references, that’s when I found people with the same interest,” says Baker. “These same people became my friends, my support network.”It is hard to overestimate how meaningful the fan-a relationship is for gay men. What is so perplexing is why this pseudo-religious devotion has always been laced with spite. Earlier this year, pop singer Hayley Kiyoko criticised Rita Ora, Cardi B, Bebe Rexha, and Charli XCX for their single Girls, a song about bisexuality that she, as a lesbian, thought was appropriative. Within hours, stan Twitter had unearthed and circulated incriminating tweets by Kiyoko from nine years ago (when she was 18) in an attempt to “cancel” her – excluding a person entirely from online discourse, except as the target of hate memes – for daring to critique a song they liked.For Adam Byrne, a 23-year-old gay stan, this was a prime example of gay misogyny: “They didn’t care what she had to say. They just wanted to silence her.”Baker says: “I’ve seen stan Twitter make jokes about the Manchester attacks, Demi Lovato’s recent overdose, Beyoncé’s skin tone, Noah Cyrus’s appearance.”Much has been written about the “queer art of failure” – how queer people are always viewed as failures by heteronormative society, and thus must make a success of their own non-conformity. Perhaps, in this context, it’s unsurprising that gay men seem to revel in the perceived setbacks and shortcomings of their stanned subjects. But the sympathy one might expect to accompany this identification seems absent. The behaviour is less like a playful poke in the ribs, and more like a slap in the face.Just last week, singer Marina Diamandis – an idol of the gay community – tweeted back to a fan who is part of the gay stan community after he sent her an abusive tweet. “There is a fan culture of degrading people online that I’m really not into. I haven’t been on social media a lot the past 3 months because I suffer from depression and the negative comments really affect me,” Diamandis posted. “Marina omg please don’t take it the wrong way I’m a stan and this was just intended as a harmless joke,” the fan protested. As Diamandis herself pointed out, stan culture can fail to grant humanity to the subjects of their worship.Even when gay men aren’t raining outright abuse on these women, their praise can sometimes reveal different forms of misogyny. One recent trend is to laud women by hailing them as “skinny” or a “skinny legend” – a trope that took off with a meme about Mariah Carey. Though it is used figuratively to imply flawlessness, it is revealing that a word historically used to police female physicality has naturally evolved in the gay male vernacular. Can it be anything other than chauvinist body-shaming?Indeed, “skinniness” is just one of many hyper-feminine traits that gay men seem to prize in our stanned women. Helen Moynihan, 23, is a self-identifying queer woman who says the stanning of Ariana Grande exemplifies precisely what is problematic about gay male idolatry. “Often I think gay men only see beauty in hyper-feminine, not butch, women,” she says. “It made me laugh when Grande was called a queer icon because she is the least queer person to me: someone who’s always trying to escape hyper-femininity.”Grande’s blinding highlighter, swinging ponytail and heels are ubiquitous hallmarks of the gay stan hall of fame. Buzzcuts and Doc Martens are few and far between. It’s conditional love again – do we only stan the “right” type of women? Other forms of gay culture are similarly plagued by this insidious heteronormativity – men on dating apps like Grindr use refrains like “masc4masc” to praise masculinity and shun femininity in other men.It’s important to remember that gay male culture exists at the confluence of many social currents, including wider male misogyny and societal homophobia. It is easy to apportion blame to gay men who are merely trying to find escapism and belonging, and to scapegoat behaviour that is universal. “In our culture of binary, heterosexual dysfunction, men hate women,” says Bronski. “It just so happens that some of them are gay.”This is an important qualifier. Stanning itself is not exclusively homosexual territory – Eminem, the originator of “stan”, is hardly a queer icon. Dr Lynn Zubernis is a professor at West Chester University in Pennsylvania and an expert in fandom. She says the bullying behaviours found in gay stan culture are common to all fandoms.“Because the object of a fan’s adoration becomes very important to the fan’s happiness, when there is some sort of disappointment, that brings a strong – and sometimes problematic – response. That is the dynamic behind the ‘mood swings’ you see in fandom, where fans love something one day and turn on it the next. It’s not about misogyny. It cuts across gender, sexuality, type of fandom, even time. Sports fans sometimes turn on star players in the same way. I don’t think it’s a male-female thing or a gay-straight thing. I think it’s a human thing.”However, not all fandoms operate with the same power dynamics. In football, the vitriol Dr Zubernis uses for comparison takes on a new dimension when it intersects with racism. In gay stan culture, gender does not just occasionally intersect with online hatred – it defines the landscape. The abuse and objectification of these women is distinctly gendered – any man, gay or straight, tweeting “fat!” at a woman is unarguably misogynistic.Gay men and pop’s women alike benefit from the mutuality of their “special relationship”. Spears is unlikely to have noticed one nasty T-shirt through the love heaped on her that day. But with gay male misogyny being discussed more widely than ever, in terms of our nightlife, queer spaces, and social movements, what does it say when this relationship is often so heartless? What kind of permissiveness are we helping to cultivate around misogyny? Deep down, do we really know what it means to love these women?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/670db1c3987cb84006189b3d887395236528c721/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=190cdb0281e1fc20fcc8e57600f08561","title":"brexit mervyn king blasts incompetence of preparations","story":"Former Bank of England governor says it ‘beggars belief’ the government is having to talk about stockpiling medicines and foodThe former Bank of England governor Mervyn King has blasted the government over Brexit, saying it has been left without a credible bargaining position. In damning comments to the BBC, Lord King said it “beggars belief” that Britain, one of the world’s leading economies, had found itself in a situation where the country was being told to take a course of action or face catastrophe.King suggested blame should be shared by the government, parliament as whole and those on Whitehall who were tasked with making key decisions.The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has warned he is “strongly opposed” to UK proposals, which he claimed would undermine the European project and the single market. Chancellor Angela Merkel has told German business leaders that she could not fully rule out no deal “because we still have no result” from the talks.King, who has spoken favourably of Brexit in the past, tore into the last-minute preparations for a no-deal Brexit, warning they had left Britain without a credible bargaining position.He made the comments after ministers confirmed efforts were under way to stockpile medicines and ensure an “adequate” food supply if talks fail.“Frankly, if a government cannot take action to prevent some of these catastrophic outcomes, whatever position you take on the EU, it illustrates a whole lack of preparation,” King said.“It doesn’t tell us anything about whether the policy of staying in the EU is good or bad, it tells us everything about the incompetence of the preparation for it.”Asked if that meant the government had been incompetent, he said: “The group of people tasked with trying to make decisions on all of this is parliament as a whole not just the government, and the civil service, who have brought us to a position where we are now being told that we have to accept a certain course of action otherwise it would be catastrophic.“Now it beggars belief that the sixth biggest economy in the world should get itself into that position.”King, who was in charge of the Bank from 2003 until 2013, said credible plans should have been put in place to leave without a deal because Britain could not impose one on the EU. Such plans could not be drawn up in six months and would take several years.King said he feared the biggest risk to the UK was that the referendum had failed to resolve the issue of Brexit and it “isn’t going to go away”.Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, will appear before the european scrutiny committee of the Commons alongside the PM’s Europe adviser, Olly Robbins, on Wednesday afternoon.With the Press Association"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/846a4665cf00001113b09f1392237ddf6b2bd520/310_832_2195_1316/master/2195.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11aa46a5f2b776a0666f0d11cea6e14e","title":"tony blair has friendly positive meeting with italys matteo salvini","story":"Far-right minister believed to have discussed Azerbaijani gas pipeline project with ex-PMTony Blair has held a meeting with the Italian far-right interior minister, Matteo Salvini, during which the pair are believed to have discussed controversial plans to extend a gas pipeline from Azerbaijan to southern Italy.The Italian minister had previously said he was willing to hear the former British prime minister’s views on the Trans Adriatic Pipeline, an Azerbaijan-backed project on which Blair has worked as a consultant since 2014.Ministers of the Five Star Movement, the other half of the coalition governing Italy with Salvini’s League party, have expressed strong opposition to the pipeline, mainly due to environmental concerns.Salvini posted a picture of himself with the former Labour leader on Twitter on Tuesday evening, adding: “It was a long and positive talk with former British prime minister Tony Blair. We talked about immigration, Brexit and energy policies. I’ve proposed him to organise a conference on development and investment in Africa. It was a friendly and positive meeting.’’Salvini is a controversial figure because of his far-right views. He has pledged to deport 500,000 “illegal immigrants” and one of his first moves as interior minister in June was to turn away a boat with more than 600 African refugees who had been rescued at sea while trying to reach Europe.By contrast, Blair recently set up the Institute for Social Change, a movement dedicated to combating populism and its causes.A spokeswoman for Blair said on Tuesday that he was giving geo-political advice through acting as chairman to an “advisory panel to the Southern Gas Corridor pipeline”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c09eac7583183a28cf1e6a00ec18345b72758c91/0_189_4450_2671/master/4450.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=695cd87c271a928a96ab3cddebd087b4","title":"pmqs theresa may corbyn brexit due to make surprise statement to mps after first pmqs of autumn politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen, including Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn at PMQsThe chief executive of Britain’s third biggest food company has thrown its weight behind Theresa May’s Chequers proposal saying it is a “pretty satisfactory” way to solve the Brexit challenges.Patrick Coveney, who is also brother of Ireland’s deputy prime minister Simon Coveney, said it would be tough to get through because it was under attack from all sides, but said there were no other plans on the table . He said:I think Britain is at a pretty fragile place on the topic right now, and probably the sort of best working compromise which the Chequers proposal is probably a pretty satisfactory way through this in some form or another if it can be delivered.But he said that would be “hard” for May as Chequers was “under siege, predictably enough from hard core Brexiters, with Jacob Rees Mogg calling it absolutely rubbish, but also under siege for hard core remainers, with Justine Greening saying it somewhat more unpopular than the poll tax”.Coveney told British Irish Chambers of Commerce seminar on agrifood in Dublin on Wednesday that the “worrying thing” for business was that there was no alternative on the table and the country was staring at an unimaginable political “abyss” if Chequers was chucked.“It is very difficult to see the prime minister survive a roll back from Chequers,” said Coveney whose firm supplies 23rds of Britain’s sandwiches every day. Coveney also said British supermarkets were “pushing hard” on the government to see the dark consequences of food shortages after Brexit. “The one thing for sure would create dramatic and immediate political instability in March would be 1234 weeks or months of real food shortages in the UK which is not inconceivable with the direction of travel with no deal,” he said. Here is the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg on the May statement coming later.The decision by Labour’s national executive committee yesterday to adopt all the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s examples of antisemitism, as well as the precise definition (which it already accepted), has not quelled the row about the party’s stance on this issue. On the Today programme this morning Dame Margaret Hodge, one of the MPs most critical of Jeremy Corbyn over this, said he had to rebuild trust with the Jewish community. She told the programme:I would love it if he proved me wrong, but we have to see both in his actions and in the way he consults and engages with the Jewish community over the coming period whether or not we are on the right road back to rebuilding trust.She also said that the decision to accept all the IHRA examples was “sullied” by the fact that Corbyn tried to get the party to agree to a lengthy addendum to the IHRA text.I campaigned for the full IHRA definition to be adopted. I’m delighted by that. I’m saddened it was sullied by this argument over an additional statement. I’m saddened that the leader of the Labour party chose to try to amend it. But Shami Chakrabarti, the shadow attorney general, told the programme that the short proviso that was agreed alongside the IHRA wording did not amount to “sullying”. She said:There was no sullying. The words were not a caveat, were not a dilution the words are true, which is that accepting these examples, in my view, in no way negates reasonable free speech around these difficult issues around Israel and Palestine.Good morning.

We have got the first PMQs of the autumn, a potentially interesting committee hearing with the Brexit secretary Dominic Raab (following important Brexit interventions from Mervyn King and Andy Burnham), and this morning we have learned Theresa May will be making a surprise statement to MPs. My colleague Dan Sabbagh has filed this.Theresa May is expected to make a statement to the Commons after Prime Minister’s Questions today, according to Whitehall and Westminster sources.Downing Street would not confirm the subject matter, although the secrecy at this stage is likely to suggest a security related matter.The statement could be an update relating to the Novichok poisoning incidents in Salsibury and Amesbury, although again this could not be confirmed.Here is the agenda for the day.9am: Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, speaks at the launch of the IPPR thinktank’s report on economic justice.9.30am: George Eustice, the agriculture minister, gives evidence to the Commons agriculture committee on fishing.10am: Andy Burnham, the Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, gives a speech on Brexit. As Matthew Weaver reports, Burnham is now giving qualified backing to a second referendum on Brexit while warning it risks sparking unrest on the streets of the city.10am: The Association of Jewish Women’s Organisations and other organisations give evidence to the Commons women and equalities commission on antisemitism.12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs.After 12.30pm: May is expected to make a statement to MPs on a subject not disclosed.2.30pm: Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, and Olly Robbins, May’s chief Brexit adviser, give evidence to the Commons Europeaan scrutiny committee.There were reports saying the parliamentary Labour party (PLP) would meet tonight to discuss antisemitism, but Labour say the next PLP meeting will not take place until Monday.

That influence was given mainstream corporate backing on Monday when Nike confirmed that Kaepernick would be the face of a new ad campaign for the 30th anniversary of their ‘Just Do It’ slogan.The big reveal ahead of the NFL’s regular-season opener on Thursday night came as more of a surprise than it should have, given the lengthy track record of the sports apparel company, which has been out in front of social trends for decades. Nike put money behind prominent African American coaches like Georgetown’s John Thompson before doing so was popular. They made a black teenager the face of their company when Tiger Woods turned professional with the provocative Hello World campaign that sparked controversy (and, lest we forget, even boycotts) by leaning into America’s thorny racist past.They made Spike Lee’s Mars Blackmon character the face of an Air Jordan campaign, throwing their support behind a 30-year-old black filmmaker who challenged America to wake up with desperate urgency, showing us the right thing isn’t always the easy thing. Now three decades on, they’ve aligned themselves with a 30-year-old black quarterback who’s done the same thing with his silent protest against police violence, one that’s ushered in an era of athlete activism unprecedented since the 1960s.The NFL won’t die because of Colin Kaepernick – the concussion epidemic, maybe, but that’s a different issue – yet it has bungled its handling of the issues he has raised. The league may have the smartest marketing people in the business, but the cabal of billionaire owners continue to demonstrate they’re so out of touch it’s embarrassing. How quickly could they have avoided their ongoing headache if they’d pulled Kaepernick aside from the beginning, made a good-faith effort to understand the issues of police brutality and pledged, say, to match every donation made by a player to social justice causes? He succeeded by starting a conversation, but now the free-agent quarterback is more powerful than ever. Last week Kaepernick won a legal victory in his grievance against the NFL, in which he alleges the owners have conspired to keep him off the field because of his protests, when an arbitrator denied the league’s request to throw out the case. Proving collusion by the league’s 32 owners will not be easy due to the high legal standard of the claim, but the decision by one of the NFL’s top partners to make Kaepernick the face of a prominent campaign won’t do much to back up the argument that he is radioactive for business. Two years after Kaepernick, following a dialogue with a military veteran, first knelt during the Star-Spangled Banner, American news organizations continue to a mischaracterize the movement he launched as “anthem protests”. But that’s an intellectually dishonest sleight of hand intended to ert the conversation from state violence, a misdirection seized on time and again by America’s president. They have actively framed Kaepernick’s actions as inconsistent with patriotism when in fact patriotism is at the movement’s very essence. It’s also codified in the document comprising America’s DNA: the belief in a more perfect union. That we can always do better. That without struggle there is no progress. That the job is never done. Which makes Monday’s announcement a triumph for clarity over obfuscation, for advancement over regression. For many, what it means to be an American is less and less some dude riding a tractor and more Kaepernick and Serena and LeBron. That’s what the people burning their shoes on Tuesday are upset about. For all the bluster about respecting the flag, they have never been more nakedly exposed: it’s quite obviously not about respecting anything at all.

He might have been stripping the willow rather than swinging it. There have been 13 of them – dashers, biffers and blockers, old hands, young guns and journeyman pros. Add all their runs together and you find that between them they made only around two thirds as many as Cook in that time, that he scored 12 centuries compared with their six and averaged 42 to everyone else’s combined 27. Which is why they come and go like Spinal Tap’s drummers.First there was Nick Compton but his runs dried up. Then it was Joe Root, before he switched back down to No\u0026nbsp6. Michael Carberry kept getting starts, but he went after the disaster in Australia. John ‘Stumpy’ Pepys died in a bizarre gardening accident. Sam Robson could not stop getting out bowled or caught behind. Jonathan Trott did it in the West Indies. Then there was Adam Lyth he was always being caught in the slips. Moeen Ali had a go against Pakistan. Alex Hales had a long run one summer. Eric ‘Stumpy Joe’ Childs. That was ugly. The official explanation was he choked on vomit. Someone else’s vomit, actually.Ben Duckett did it in Bangladesh but got bumped down the order and bounced out of the side because he was so baffled by Ravi Ashwin. Haseeb Hameed broke a finger. Keaton Jennings just could not seem to figure out how to bat against Vernon Philander. Mark Stoneman, even when he was playing well, never seemed to make it anywhere past 50. Somewhere in the middle of all this Jos Buttler did it once, too, during a run chase. Oh, and Peter ‘James’ Bond. He exploded on stage. A flash of green light and that was it. And then Jennings again but he has hardly made a run all summer.Some of these stories started well. Compton scored back-to-back centuries against New Zealand, Lyth and Robson both made hundreds in the second Test they played, Jennings got one in his first. After a year in which Stoneman and Jennings can boast a top score of 60 between them it seems odd now that England felt able to be so picky as to drop people so quickly. It seems likely Rory Burns will take a turn, too. He has earned it, since he has scored 1,000 first-class runs in each of the past five seasons. There was talk earlier this summer that Middlesex’s Nick Gubbins, too, might get a shot.Hameed was the one, of course, or he was supposed to be. He came into the team when he was 19, on the tour of India in 2016, and scored 31 and 82 in the first Test at Rajkot, 13 and 25 in the second at Visakhapatnam, where he was cut short by an unplayable shooter in the second innings, and nine and 59 not out in the third at Mohali. He played that last innings even though the little finger on his left hand was broken in two places. He swallowed a couple of paracetamol, learned a new grip and got on with it. Hameed might have the technique and the temperament England need. The trouble is he certainly does not have the runs.Hameed has made only three fifties in the 51 first-class innings he has played since, the best of them an 88 against Essex this time last year. This season he is averaging a shade over nine in the championship. England were persisting with him, he was playing for the Lions at the start of this season but it has become impossible to pick him. There are a few theories floating around about exactly what has gone wrong with his game. The most interesting is that he was so determined to prove he could succeed in limited-overs cricket, too, that he compromised the method that got him into the Test team to begin with.Hameed spoke about it to the Manchester Evening News. “I have always said I want to play in all three formats,” he told them. “It is me being who I am, not just being content with being a Baby Boycott as such. I want people in, hopefully, 15 or 20 years to say, ‘He could play the way he did in Test cricket but could also adapt to 50-over and T20 cricket. too’” Whether it is true in Hameed’s case, it certainly speaks to a truth about the modern game, which is that the skills needed to open the batting in first-class cricket in England – the skills that served Cook so well in his Test career – are at odds with the ones needed to succeed in T20.Which is one reason why, for the first time in a generation, England cannot be sure who is going to be opening their batting after this next Test. For now Cook looks like the last in a line of openers that stretches back through Strauss, Michael Vaughan and Michael Atherton. All four of them were great Test match batsmen, of course, but not one will be remembered for the way he played a white ball."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cea1e36d1913cafc5941a0f067df9c5452dbcf9/0_265_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6813a3d7f2f4d0aed246e4f40ecb6bb","title":"leicester sacking matt oconnor grossly unfair","story":"• O’Connor fired after one game of Premiership season• Coaches’ union calls dismissal part of ‘disturbing trend’Leicester’s decision to fire Matt O’Connor one match into the Premiership season has been described as “grossly unfair” and part of “a disturbing trend” by the coaches’ union.After firing O’Connor on Monday Leicester have appointed Geordan Murphy on an interim basis and it is believed the Irishman, who spent 16 years at the club as a player, will be given the opportunity to press his claims for the job permanently.On Tuesday the club captain, Tom Youngs, also endorsed Murphy, who joined the coaching staff in 2013, as the man to “patch up the old ship and get it going again”. But whoever lands the role will be Leicester’s fourth permanent director of rugby or coach in less than two years, with O’Connor following Aaron Mauger and Richard Cockerill through the door.Last season Nick Kennedy, Jim Mallinder and John Kingston were relieved of their roles with London Irish, Northampton and Harlequins respectively, while Todd Blackadder will come under increased pressure should Bath lose to Gloucester on Saturday.O’Connor is the first coach in Premiership history to be sacked after one match. “It is a concern,” the Rugby Coaches’ Association director, Richard Moon, said. “I looked at Leicester’s statement and they said the timing is right to make this change. After one game. Whatever has been going on up to that point it seems to me extremely unfair to judge a coach after one game. That’s a disturbing trend. It seems grossly unfair on the coach.“It is extremely concerning because the difficulty for the departing coach to try to obtain another role when the season has started makes it a double whammy. I fear it’s becoming a trend. It’s an inevitability about professional sport. There’s a football analogy because it seems to be coming into rugby union and I fear a trickle may become a torrent.“Coaches are under immense pressure to deliver. It’s almost a 247 existence and it’s not only their livelihood they lose but it’s the impact on self-esteem. They are very much in the public eye. Support is absolutely vital for their wellbeing because they have to pick up the pieces.”Murphy and Youngs acknowledged last season’s failure to guide Leicester to the play-offs for the first time in 14 campaigns was a key reason for O’Connor’s departure and, though the board opted against letting him go in May, last Saturday’s heavy defeat by Exeter proved his undoing.Murphy will, in the short-term at least, be a popular appointment after his outstanding career with Leicester but he faces the immediate task of overcoming Newcastle, led by the former Leicester director of rugby, Dean Richards, on Saturday.“I’ve known Matty for a long time. I consider him a friend. It is a situation that is not pleasurable,” Murphy said. “It’s a double-edged sword. Obviously a dream of mine would have been to be in this seat. It is a dream in that it is a club I love.”With Leicester in steady decline – the last of their 10 Premiership titles came in 2013 – there will be some clamour for a high-profile appointment such as Sir Clive Woodward or Martin Johnson. Mike Ford, father of the England and Leicester fly-half George, is also an obvious candidate to provide temporary assistance to what is now a threadbare coaching staff.Youngs, though, is convinced Murphy is the man for the job. “If they were going to bring in just some random person, I’d feel a lot different about it,” he said. “Giving the role to Geordie, and supporting him, I think it’s the right choice.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7f3e221bbc610ef4ef491b81bd91201d4d0a8a0/0_304_4711_2827/master/4711.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb09c432475f0aadb59c2c2e62404d37","title":"thomas bjorn choose sergio garcia ryder cup wild card","story":"• García’s 2018 form has been poor but he has experience• Bjørn to announce his four wild cards on WednesdayThomas Bjørn is set to side with experience when naming his captain’s picks for the European Ryder Cup team on Wednesday. Henrik Stenson, Paul Casey, Ian Poulter and Sergio García have emerged as the favoured quartet to join Bjørn’s eight automatic qualifiers as Europe look to reclaim the trophy in France at the end of September.While the selection of Stenson, Casey and Poulter will raise few eyebrows, García’s inclusion, if confirmed, will trigger debate. The Spaniard found himself embroiled in a late battle with his compatriot, Rafael Cabrera Bello, and the in-form Englishman Matt Wallace to reach the European team. Both will have cause to be upset if, as expected, García gets the nod.Poulter, who has emerged as something of a Ryder Cup icon for Europe, was always part of the equation amid a terrific career renaissance. Stenson has struggled with an elbow injury this summer but, at 42 and as a former Open champion, is a valuable part of the team dynamic. Casey’s return to the European Tour fold after making himself unavailable for the last Ryder Cup meant Bjørn would struggle to omit the matchplay specialist.García has been woefully out of sorts, in essence since ending his wait for a major championship at the Masters last year. The 38-year-old, who has missed the cut in his last five major appearances, has slipped to 30th in the world rankings. He was not one of the 125 players exempt for the PGA Tour’s end of series FedEx Cup play-offs.Yet influential in Bjørn’s thought process has been the appearance of five rookies in those who earned their spots automatically. García has played in eight Ryder Cups – first as a teenager – amassing 22.5 points, making him one of the most successful European players in history. He also finished in the top 10 at this year’s France Open, played on the Ryder Cup course on the outskirts of Versailles. In addition he is viewed as a player compatible with multiple partners.Cabrera Bello, a spot ahead of García in the world rankings and part of the Europe team who lost to the United States at Hazeltine two years ago, finished in a share of seventh at the PGA Tour’s Dell Technologies Championship on Monday. The 34-year-old posted four rounds of under 70.It is thought Bjørn may have taken a dim view of Cabrera Bello’s desire to compete in the United States rather than at the last counting event for the European team, the Made in Denmark event. That being the case, it is notable García, who was not eligible for the PGA Tour competition, did not travel to Europe either. Suspicion will automatically emerge García was sure of a pick, regardless of the form of others.Wallace won a four-man play-off in Denmark for his second European Tour success in three months. Working against Wallace, though, was always the qualification of so many debutants: Tommy Fleetwood, Jon Rahm, Alex Norén, Thorbjørn Olesen and Tyrrell Hatton. Bjørn will lead Europe against a United States side whose strong reputation firmly goes before them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/670130fa83c79f0641bb1355940a47b160f23238/0_71_4140_2484/master/4140.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d4d330523a64d34e4ec8399f3a029df","title":"rafael nadal survives late night marathon against dominic thiem","story":"Rafael Nadal recovered from a first-set bagel to defeat Dominic Thiem and reach the US Open semi-finals following another late-night classic in New York.Twenty-four hours after Roger Federer fell to John Millman, his old rival avoided following him out of the tournament, but only just, completing a 0-6, 6-4, 7-5, 6-7 (4-7), 7-6 (7-5) victory at 2.03am. Ninth seed Thiem became the first player since Andy Roddick in 2004 to win a love set against Nadal in New York but the defending champion once again dug deep to come out on top of a gruelling battle played in more punishing humidity. Nadal will now face third seed Juan Martín del Potro, who defeated John Isner, in a repeat of last year’s semi-final.Remarkably, Thiem was the first top-20 player Nadal has faced at Flushing Meadows since his final win over Novak Djokovic in 2013, with last year’s title seeing him take on a succession of unexpected opponents. And Thiem, the only man to beat Nadal on clay for the last two seasons, set about showing his opponent he meant serious business in his first grand slam quarter-final outside of the French Open. The Austrian blasted 13 winners, made only two unforced errors and allowed Nadal just seven points in winning an extraordinary opening set. It was only the fourth time in his long grand slam history that Nadal had lost a set 6-0 and just the third time at any level in nearly seven years. But the last time, against Philipp Kohlschreiber in Miami last spring, he fought back to win the match. Nadal’s ability to look only forward and forget what went before is one of his most important strengths and he set about turning around the match, closing in on the baseline, forcing Thiem to play one more ball and, eventually, to go for too much. The Spaniard secured the break he wanted for 5-3 only to give it back but a sloppy game from Thiem, who turned 25 on Monday, handed him the set anyway. The momentum was with Nadal but Thiem regrouped in the third set and began to again blast winners into the corners. But, as in the second set, when the time came to keep his foot on Nadal’s throat, he instead loosened the pressure and lived to regret it. Thiem was broken serving for the set and then could not hold on for the tie-break, saving two set points but not a third after planting a volley wide with the whole of the court available. The fourth set was a wild 81-minute ride that began with Thiem facing break points, saw the Austrian threaten a double break before being pegged back and then a weary Nadal miss a chance to win the match. With Thiem serving at 5-6 and 30-30, a desperate lunging forehand looked to be easy pickings for Nadal at the net only for the 32-year-old to net it. Thiem held on for the tie-break, where another unexpected Nadal error, this time a short forehand into the net, sent the match into a deciding set. With the clock ticking towards 1am and transport options dwindling, many fans headed for the exits while the two adversaries battled on. Having looked the more weary of the two, it was Nadal who was applying the greater pressure and at 5-5, 0-40 it seemed this was his chance. But Thiem saved all three break points before denying Nadal a fourth opportunity with a stunning volley at the end of a remarkable point. That they were still able to produce tennis of such quality was astonishing. There was no let-up in the tie-break and, after four hours and 49 minutes, it was Nadal who claimed victory when Thiem sent a smash long. The Austrian hung his head before being consoled by Nadal who then held his arms aloft in celebration and relief."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29978a802465e997a4e607491fafc51dbdb47e07/0_1183_3524_2114/master/3524.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1cd571a865b7e0df52cd8c3fcd443a5b","title":"shakespeare by angus mcbean in pictures rsc","story":"Featuring Christopher Plummer as Richard III, Vivien Leigh as Viola and Charles Laughton as Bottom, Shakespeare by McBean is a volume of the photographer’s shots at the RSC between 1945 and 1962 "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76b40ba1613698a9cbec7acdcfc0a417a22a4909/0_304_4540_2724/master/4540.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d47d9cec566b15b6ac5c54ab90986b45","title":"10 best new posh luxury hostels india peru us","story":"From India to Peru, all these places offer boutique-hotel touches at budget prices.

Preview pages show the new Doctor alongside the three companions who will appear as her friends in her debut season: Yasmin, Ryan and Graham, played on-screen respectively by Mandip Gill, Tosin Cole and Bradley Walsh. The story centres around what the Doctor, Ryan and Graham are going to get for Yasmin’s birthday, which turns into an explosive surprise.There will be a limited edition hardback cover version of the book, but the regular paperback will sit happily alongside the Mr Men and Little Miss books that have been a bedtime story staple for decades. The Doctor Who Mr Men books launched in 2017, and have since included special Christmas adventures. Collectable figurines from the series have also been produced.The BBC is yet to confirm when the new series of Doctor Who will air – although there was speculation this week that the date will be Sunday 7 October, after reports that the iTunes store in Germany briefly displayed the launch date.

Ah yes, I’ve heard about that, the sex. “Is BBC’s Wanderlust the steamiest TV ever?” asked the Mail on Sunday, not entirely approvingly.Actually there is not a lot of steam coming off either Joy (Toni Collette) or Alan (Steven Mackintosh). More like cold sweat. They undress awkwardly, Joy hands Alan her crutch and undoes her wrist brace. Then he is on top of her. “Ready?” he asks. “As I’ll ever be,” she replies.It doesn’t go well. Joy’s face says a little bit boreda little bit pained. “What?” Alan asks.“No, it’s good,” she lies. Oh, and this is all intercut with footage of Joy getting knocked off her bicycle, the reason for the crutch and the wrist brace. It – the accident – certainly isn’t helping. It is the opposite of the erotic fixation with tragedy as seen in JG Ballard’s Crash, this is more like anti-symphorophilia, if you will.She brings up his technique, and that doesn’t help, either. “I’m not the one with the problem, Joy, so don’t try and needle away at my craft,” he says.“Your craft?” she laughs. “I’m sorry, skilled woodsman.”Skilled woodsman, that is funny. These two are good together. Apart from the rubbish sex. And that is the point. Wanderlust, adapted by Nick Payne from his own play, is an exploration of the connections and differences between intimacy and sex. And questions whether monogamy is even desirable. No wonder the Mail on Sunday is getting all hot under the collar.So Joy and Alan give up. I mean, on this particular attempt, for now (although I think we know where this is all heading). Alan goes to work, and this time sex becomes a solitary activity, not concluded because of an interruption by his teenage son, Tom (Joe Hurst), who is setting out, wobbly, on his own sexual journey. Over at the school where Alan teaches, his colleague Claire (Zawe Ashton) has walked in on a male colleague masturbating over an underwear catalogue. This brings Alan and Claire closer together, oddly. Nothing like a potential tribunal to move things along. One thing leads to another a drink, Claire’s car breaks down (is that like a very mild form of symphorophilia?), a failed jump-start in the rain, a tow back to her place, then inside for a warm-up spliff and an introduction, for Alan, to Warren G’s Regulate, every teacher’s favourite G-funk track, the Ofcom anthem. It also contains a car crash, but that’s probably by the by. More importantly, it leads to sex, as Warren G often does.Joy, meanwhile, is getting flirty with a guy in her hydrotherapy class. “Wet,” she replies when he – Marvin – asks how she is. Marvin’s a copper, Hertfordshire constabulary CID, and that certainly doesn’t harm his appeal. She says she will see him next week. “You will,” he says.In fact, they see each other before next week. She is at the bus stop, in the rain, with a broken bike (cycling isn’t Joy’s forte). Marvin’s passing, gives her a lift home where she tosses him off in her office. Joy’s a therapist, she understands relationships.Finally, at the end of the first episode (of six), after fessing up to each other, Joy and Alan realise what has been clear to everyone else for a while: that their marriage is opening up, to others. It has been a bit of an effort getting to this point that might have something to do with turning a 90-minute play into six hours of television. Also … perhaps ... all the pausing … in the delivery ... of the dialogue. Is that about sounding authentic, like actual, real dialogue? Maybe, but I also find it a teeny bit annoying – affected and theatrical.Stellar performances otherwise, from Collette and Mackintosh. And it is not just about Joy, Alan and their new sex partners. Tom is promising, as is his best friend, who is clearly in love with him. Also some of Joy’s clients, trying to patch up their relationships. Hey, maybe they should be looking outside, as well as in?Everything’s opening up, exciting new possibilities. Maybe consensual infidelity is the answer. A breakdown seems to help things along – vehicular, rather than mental. Also water – rain, hydrotherapy, whatever, come on in, it is lovely. These are some takeaway messages. Oh, and screw the Mail on Sunday, too, while you’re at it.

Works 20 hours a week“Working a second job, and the lack of rest that comes with that, makes it really hard to do the most important thing that a teacher does: remain engaged and enthusiastic, and really be the driving force in a classroom. The second challenge is that every year, students come to me with ideas for organizations they would like to start, clubs they would like to be involved in, and some of those things match up really well with some of my own passions.“But when I weigh the additional amount of money that I need for my second job against my inclination, it doesn’t make sense.“When you consider a teacher with zero experience versus a teacher like me with now 11 years behind me, there’s only a $3,619 difference in our salary. That signals to me that our district does not value experienced teachers. If I didn’t work a second job, I would be a risk for not having funds to deal with major financial problems that could occur in anyone’s life, whether that’s a major medical expense, a major car expense, or a family emergency.”Full-time job Middle school social studies teacher.

Then you have to go to your second job and you’re tired.

It’s really hard to think about my own livelihood in the midst of trying to teach 115 teenagers. I should only have to care about their development, but I also have in my head, ‘I don’t know how I’m going to pay this month’s rent.’ I absolutely love what I do and I want to continue doing this and I don’t want to do anything else, but I can’t keep living with my parents to save money.“I see November as a pivotal moment for my future. The last increase we really saw in raises and school funding has been 20-odd years, and if it’s going to be that rate again, at the current rate of inflation, I will be living in poverty.

Teaches ballet and hip-hop. Works 12 hours a week. Earns $38 an hour plus performances“The most stressful thing is that I go home and worry about those kids, whether I like it or not, so it kind of wears me down. I use my lunch breaks often times to make choreography or to make lessons for that evening. Sometimes that’s what my weekends are devoted to also. Social life? What’s that? And sometimes even my personal health is at risk. It’s hard to eat lunch when you’ve got so many different things going on.“There’s times where I have to talk to myself in the mirror and tell myself: ‘It’s OK, you can get through this. I know you’re exhausted, but it’ll be all right.’ And I get my second wind eventually. I get that adrenaline boost that I need to keep teaching. But there are times when I’m just so tired and my body is making me think that it can’t take it any more.”“I try and leave school a little bit earlier than normal when I’m working just so I can have some extra time. When I go home I have to take care of my dogs first: I have to change clothes and I have to eat dinner because I don’t get home from PetSmart until 9.30pm and I’m not eating dinner at 9.30 at night. The hardest part is just managing stress.“The reason I took a second job is that I have some debt that I’m trying to pay off. I needed the extra money to pay my bills. I was struggling with just the teaching income and this makes it so that I don’t have to struggle financially. I can live on my wage, but I’m single and have no kids. There’s a lot of teachers who are single parents who are really struggling.”“We use the envelope system a little bit. This week’s softball lesson would go into an envelope for the tire fund. Or this week’s lesson, half of it would go for car maintenance.“I will probably continue my side jobs through at least my kids going to college. We’ve accumulated some debt over the years, because when you need tires, you just put down the credit card. When the washing machine goes out, you put it on the credit card. We’re going to be catching up from that for years. I’ve got a car that’s pushing 200,000 miles and another car that’s pushing 100,000 and we’ve got a girl going off to college next year. We haven’t contributed to our IRAs in about three years, maybe even longer than that.” “The teacher shouldn’t have to drive a bus. I don’t get to stay after school to help my students for even five minutes if they have a question after school. Sometimes I feel like I’m letting my students down because I have to go directly to my bus. I don’t even get to stop for a bathroom break.“Without my second job, we flat out cannot make our bills. Even with my second job, we struggle to make the bills, without even adding on the food or extras that my kids want.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e7e9030dbc1e33b2ca10db032dc775747a5ca14/0_51_3576_2145/master/3576.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c97fbb302cb576b1a197da5ddb13102f","title":"germanys new movement a leftist pitch for the left behind","story":"Aufstehen is Europe’s latest bid to halt the flow of working-class votes to the rightEven in these globalised times, most political movements are a reflection of a national political culture, a specific personality, or a voting system, but the launch in Germany of Aufstehen, or Get Up, invites comparisons with Jeremy Corbyn’s Momentum, Podemos in Spain, Syriza in Greece and La France Insoumise led by Jean-Luc Mélenchon.If Aufstehen succeeds in its goal of uniting and reframing the German left, it could mean Europe’s largest economy joins other countries in housing Eurosceptic, nationalistic, anti-establishment parties at both ends of the political spectrum, united in their opposition to liberal elites, globalisation, excessive migration and even Nato.At the moment, Aufstehen is very much a reflection of its founders, especially the polarising Sahra Wagenknecht. Her insistence that the German left has to listen harder to German working-class anger over migration weakens the parallels with Jeremy Corbyn and Bernie Saunders. Some have described her as seeking a “red-brown” coalition, a reference to Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), which is polling as the second largest party in the country.If anything, her preoccupations take her closer to Blue Labour, the near-defunct movement associated with Lord Glasman, a one-time adviser to Ed Miliband.Aufstehen’s methods – it has a strong faith in digital campaigning – are similar to the Italian Five Star Movement. The idea of launching a movement, possibly as a precursor to a party, has echoes of Emmanuel Macron’s En Marche, but also of Podemos in Spain.Its very specific pitch is a universal concern of the European left: reversing the loss of working-class votes to either abstention or the right. Its target is the left behind.Wagenknecht herself says the inspiration for Aufstehen was La France Insoumise, or France Unbowed, the populist leftist movement founded by Mélenchon, a candidate in France’s last presidential elections.Mélenchon, a 65-year-old former senator and former junior Socialist minister, is also Russia-friendly and a critic of Nato who wants France to withdraw from EU treaties. He has targeted foreign newcomers, declaring that he’s “never been in favour of freedom of arrival” and disapproves of migrants “stealing the bread” of French workers. Wagenknecht insists the aim is not to form a new party, but to bring together the ided left, including her own Die Linke, the Green party and the SPD.But some of her language is apocalyptic, and primarily aimed at former SPD voters who have defected to AfD. She says, for instance: “Germany is changing in a direction that many people do not want.” The climate is becoming rougher and more aggressive, “the cohesion is lost”. If left unchecked, “then this country will be unrecognisable in five or 10 years”.At the launch of her movement on Tuesday she was reluctant to be specific about migration, saying excessive migration was putting pressure on public servicesHer critics claim she tilts at windmills. In a recent interview, for instance, she said that if the core concern of leftist politics was to represent the disadvantaged, then the no-borders position was the opposite of being on the left.She said: “All successes in restraining and regulating capitalism have been achieved within inidual states, and states have borders.”But she says it is inequality, as much as migration, that has been the breeding ground for resentment. Germany is full of contradictions: “We build internationally popular cars and machines, but we send our children in dilapidated schools where teachers are missing and repeatedly the class fails.” The government saves banks and subsidises corporations, but is not willing to protect old people from poverty.Her many critics on the left claim that, far from uniting the left, she is on the verge of forming a fourth party. Her rhetoric has the effect of amplifying AfD rhetoric rather than combating it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27b3c5528214d7b3bbce15056253276b63abc6cc/0_16_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88edef872242396fdfa741b0164cc414","title":"typhoon jebi thousands stranded at island airport in japan","story":"At least 11 people have died after worst storm in quarter of a century battered country’s western reachesThousands of air passengers in Japan have spent the night stranded in an island airport as Typhoon Jebi created havoc that has led to at least 11 deaths, 400 injuries and evacuation advisories for more than a million people.An estimated 3,000 people were trapped at the terminal of Kansai international airport, which stands on a manmade island in Osaka Bay, as the typhoon barrelled across large parts of western Japan.Their flights cancelled and with seawater flooding the runway outside, all the passengers could do was sit and wait until they could leave safely. That moment came on Wednesday morning, when high-speed boats began transferring passengers to nearby Kobe airport.“This storm is super-strong. I hope I can get home,” a female tourist from Hong Kong told the public broadcaster NHK as the storm swirled overhead on Tuesday evening.Another woman who was among the first to be taken off the airport island said she and other passengers spent a sweltering night in the terminal after its airconditioning failed. “I never expected a typhoon to do this much damage,” she said.There was no indication when the airport, which operates more than 400 flights a day, would reopen, but an unnamed industry source told the Yomiuri newspaper it could remain closed for up to a week.At the other end of a road bridge connecting the airport to the mainland, the Houn Maru, a 2,591-tonne tanker, lurched as waves repeatedly slammed it into the side of the structure. The tanker was damaged, but its 11 crew were unhurt, according to the coast guard.Unleashing torrential rain and winds of more than 200kmh (125mph), Typhoon Jebi left a trail of destruction as it passed over the western cities of Kobe, Osaka and Kyoto before heading into the Sea of Japan late on Tuesday.Television networks showed dramatic live images of waves crashing over sea defences, roof panels being dislodged and blown away by the wind, and high-sided vehicles being lifted on to two wheels and toppling over.In central Osaka, the wind sent a 100-metre-tall ferris wheel into a furious spin, even though its power had been cut off. “I’ve never seen anything like it,” an onlooker told the public broadcaster NHK.At the height of the storm, evacuation advisories were issued for more than a million people, according to the fire and disaster management agency, while 16,000 people spent the night in shelters across 20 prefectures, Jiji Press reported.About 10cm of rain fell on one part of Kyoto, Japan’s ancient capital, in an hour. Several people were injured at Kyoto Station when part of a glass ceiling collapsed.The typhoon brought widespread disruption to air and rail travel. Almost 800 domestic and international flights were cancelled, along with scores of ferry and train services, the public broadcaster NHK said. Bullet train services between Tokyo and Hiroshima were suspended – but resumed on Wednesday morning – while schools and factories were closed for the day.More than 1.6m households remained without power in Osaka, Kyoto and four nearby prefectures late on Tuesday, according to Kansai Electric Power.On Wednesday morning, details emerged of some of the casualties, including a 71-year-old man whose body was found beneath a collapsed warehouse. Another man in his 70s apparently died after falling from the roof of his house, NHK said, adding that more than more than160 people had suffered mostly minor injuries.Typhoons are fairly common in Japan at this time of year, although they rarely cause serious damage. Jebi’s arrival followed a summer of extreme weather in the country, including floods and landslides in July in which more than 200 people died, and a record-breaking heatwave that killed dozens of people and sent tens of thousands to hospital.Agencies contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74a36c9c74693f7579813c621010224f77a05e72/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5326a1e2705fe8a4fb51a0a96e3bb38d","title":"wednesday briefing we need a fairer form of capitalism","story":"Call for bold reshaping of British wages, wealth and investment … space station leak may have been sabotage … and the shark that eats grassGood morning – Warren Murray here to guide your finger on to the pulse.A radical overhaul of Britain’s economy is needed to address chronic disparities in living standards since the 2008 financial crash, according to the IPPR thinktank. Its commission on economic justice argues in a report published today that the shareholder-driven model of capitalism is outmoded, with the UK held back by a culture dominated by decades of short-term profit taking, weak levels of investment and low wages.The IPPR, which drove much of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown’s economic agenda, set up its commission two years ago after the Brexit vote. The commission’s members include the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, senior business leaders and economists like Dame Helena Morrissey, a senior L\u0026ampG executive, as well as unions. Its report calls for higher minimum wage rates that match the real “Living Wage” a national public investment bank workers on company boards higher corporate tax rates and anti-avoidance measures taxing wealth the same way as work replacing inheritance tax with a lifetime gift tax and giving the nations and regions more power over their economies.“By putting fairness at the heart of the economy, we can make it perform better, improving the lives of millions of people,” said Welby. “Achieving prosperity and justice together is not only a moral imperative – it is an economic one.” Morrissey, one of the most senior women in the City of London, called for “a more responsible and fairer form of capitalism … We need to increase the levels of investment. We need to address the needs of people who have been left behind.”The commission’s report is being launched ahead of the 10-year anniversary of the Lehman Brothers crash on 15 September 2008. Sabotage in space? – The hole that caused an air leak on the International Space Station was made by a drill, not a meteor fragment, and might have been sabotage, according to Russia’s space agency. A photograph posted online and attributed to Nasa shows the hole alongside scratches left by a straying drill. “There were several attempts at drilling,” said Dmitry Rogozin, head of Roscosmos, adding that it appeared to have been done by a “wavering hand”. “What is this: a production defect or some premeditated actions? We are checking the Earth version. But there is another version that we do not rule out: deliberate interference in space.” An investigation is under way – one theory is that a worker on Earth made the hole in the Soyuz module by accident and plugged it with sealant that fell off in space.

Thus “the bonnethead shark is the first known omnivorous species of shark,” said Samantha Leigh, one of the US researchers involved. Are we allowed to eat cod again?

In each of these countries, more than half the adult population was insufficiently active.The findings appear in The Lancet Global Health journal.Dr Guthold added: “Regions with increasing levels of insufficient physical activity are a major concern for public health and the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases.”–PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3618448.1536093132!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"new 1bn social housing project in dublin is put out to tender","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFour-storey modular apartments in Lewisham, London. Dublin City Council has plans to construct ‘close to 1,000 rapid-build apartments’ for social housing at different locations throughout the city.Builders have been given less than a month to tender for a contract worth up to almost €1 billion to construct factory-built apartments to help resolve the homelessness crisis.Despite asking contractors to bid for the contract, Dublin City Council says it probably will not spend “anywhere near that” because of a shortage of land for the properties. Developers have until noon on October 1st to express an interest in two “lots” – smaller housing developments valued at less than €15 million, and larger projects costing more than €15 million. Up to eight successful bidders will be asked to sign up to what the council is calling a “framework agreement” to design and build “volumetric” apartments.The apartments are built as pods or modular units in factories, complete with interior finishes and fit-outs, and then stacked together on site. There will be a mix of one-, two- and three-bedroom homes for families on social housing waiting lists.The overall estimated value of the contract is €950 million. However, Brendan Kenny, deputy chief executive of Dublin City Council, told The  it is unlikely it will spend anything more than a fraction of the total. “It is a very rough estimate of what might be possible and it is just to make sure we don’t have to set up a framework again.”Mr Kenny said the Government has made it clear “there is no shortage of money”. “The problem is that it takes a long time to build and land is limited. We have to go through a horrendous process of procurement like this one to get ready, but money is not the issue.” The council has plans to construct “close to 1,000 rapid-build apartments” for social housing at different locations throughout the city, which are expected to cost around €200,000 a unit. Most sites are “relatively small and will be tendered in bundles of three or four sites” under the framework, which will also be available to other local authorities nationwide.Once a contractor is on site, the schemes “should be completed in about six to eight months”, a council spokeswoman said.Modular housing has been used widely in the UK, Europe, Asia and the US, but pilot schemes in Ireland have been dogged by delays. Documents show the contract will be for one year but “with possible annual extensions . . . up to a maximum of four years, subject to satisfactory annual performance and review, budgetary constraints and government policy.”The tender is proceeding despite an admission by Dublin City Council’s chief executive Owen Keegan that “there is something seriously wrong” in the delivery of rapid-build modular housing.Pilot projects on Bunratty Road in Coolock and another five-unit city centre development on Fishamble Street, originally announced in November 2016, were delayed by nearly two years.The latest official figures on homelessness, released by the Department of Housing last week, show the number of homeless children has more than doubled in some parts of the State in the past year.There were 9,891 people in emergency accommodation during the week of July 23rd to 29th, including 6,024 adults and 3,867 children, up from 9,872 people in June. Compared with July of last year, the figures are up 21 per cent for adults (8,160 a year ago) and 30 per cent for children (2,973) nationally."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3618046.1536069833!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ff calls for public service obligation payment to save post offices","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFianna Fáil TDs Eugene Murphy,  Fiona O’Loughlin, Timmy Dooley and  Marc McSharry TD during a media briefing at Leinster House in Dublin. Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsThe motion recommends the Government introduce a public service obligation (PSO) payment to ensure post offices around the country remain open.Fianna Fáil spokesman on communications Timmy Dooley described the proposed closure of the post offices as a “planned attack” by the Government and An Post to eliminate a large proportion of the postal network which could create a “domino effect” on surrounding businesses and small shops in the area. An Post announced last week the locations of the 159 post offices which are set to close in the coming weeks and months as part of a restructuring plan. Minister for Communications Denis Naughten will face questioning before a parliamentary committee on Tuesday on the controversial plan to close so many.Fianna Fáil members said on Tuesday that the retirement of postmasters and postmistresses was being used as “a smokescreen” to cover up the closure of so many rural postal offices. The removal of the service will place an “intolerable burden” on the lives of the elderly and more vulnerable who rely on their local post office for pension payments and to pay bills, Mr Dooley warned, adding that elderly users would struggle to continue their transactions online. “We don’t believe that an essential public service should be viewed in terms of profit and loss,” said Mr Dooley. “We believe the viability of the villages and the people around it is more important.”He noted that a PSO payment was already used to subsidise public transport services and projected it would cost €8 million to extend the payment to post offices. “It is for the State and the Government to step in and ensure that these services are maintained and I believe the way to do that is a direct transfer from central exchequer to An Post to deliver an important service. We do it in so many other ways hospitals, community centres, nurses, doctors, guards, which we pay from central exchequer.”Asked to comment on the high number of post offices which closed between 2000 and 2011, during which time Fianna Fáil was in power, Mr Dooley said offices had closed due to a lack of demand in the area. “The difference between then and now is this has been a planned attack by the Government and An Post to eliminate a very significant section of the post office network. It’s happening in villages where there is a demand to retain the service.“Post offices cannot be viewed as simple accounting units with a focus solely on profit and loss. They are immeasurable part of community life across Ireland, but especially in rural Ireland, and the Government must listen and must intervene.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3618411.1536089540!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"people going to aldi and lidl to blame for post office closures minister","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe entire post office network almost collapsed last year as it struggled to cope with mounting multimillion-euro losses, the Minister said .Photograph: Bryan O’Brien Minster for Communications Denis Naughten has suggested pensioners travelling to the likes of Aldi and Lidl for their groceries are to blame for the imminent closure of village post offices around the country. Defending the controversial An Post plan to cull 159 post offices, mainly in rural areas in the west, midlands and southeast, Mr Naughten said communities themselves had voted for it “with their own feet”. “This is the fact of it, and some people have failed to acknowledge this, but the local community have bypassed some of those post offices, have gone to the bigger towns, have not used the local shop,” he said. Before a specially-convened Oireachtas committee hearing to debate the imminent closures, Mr Naughten insisted they were “not a surprise to anyone”. “So communities knew that their post office was under threat, yet they continued to pass by the front door, and are now concerned in relation to it.”Mr Naughten said: “The community has spoken themselves with their own feet.” The entire post office network almost collapsed last year as it struggled to cope with mounting multimillion-euro losses, he told the Oireachtas Communications, Climate Action and Environment Committee. An Post bosses had outlined for him a “very bleak future” and the “very real possibility” the State-owned company could go bust. “The potential for a complete shutdown of postal services with the loss of thousands of jobs was undeniable,” he said.Mr Naughten said the financial circumstances were so dire that immediate action was needed. “It was needed to ensure the survival of An Post,” he said. “It was needed to safeguard the post office network. It was needed to protect thousands of jobs across the country.” Mr Naughten’s remarks were backed up by David McRedmond, the company’s chief executive. An Post was “virtually insolvent” 18 months ago, he told TDs and Senators. Consultants brought in to assess the scale of the problem said the company faced further losses of €180 million over the coming five years, the committee was told. Mr Naughten also laid blame for the crisis on a failure to act by successive governments.But “after years of drift” the decision to restructure and consolidate the entire network means “the future is not as bleak”, although, he added, “underlying challenges” remain. Responding to repeated calls for the post offices to emulate community banking models in New Zealand and Germany, the Minister suggested a link up with Ireland’s own credit union movement could be a better option. Mr McRedmond told the hearing “there have been some discussions” with the credit union movement about a possible partnership. Mr Naughten denied a suggestion that postmasters were made “an offer they can’t refuse”, insisting the redundancy scheme leading to the closures was entirely voluntary. That a majority of postmasters did refuse the severance package proved this, he told the hearing. Postmasters themselves had asked for three things, he said: modernisation of the network redundancy packages and new services to bring in more customers. The Minister said all these demands are being met. Progress was being made bringing more government services to post offices while community banking services are being rolled out across the network, he added. Mr Naughten said An Post is the only postal service in the world “actually expanding” its services at moment, including in the most isolated rural communities. “But we can’t justify keeping a post office open that has 12 transactions a week,” he added. Responding to repeated calls for the post offices to emulate community banking models in New Zealand and Germany, the minister suggested a link up with Ireland’s own credit union movement could be better option.

The peak is determined by a number of factors such as genes, how well nourished a person was in the womb and childhood diet. After the age of 40, bone mass starts to decline with smokers, heavy drinkers, thinner people, those who exercise less and women more likely to be negatively affected. .html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}Building strong bones and strong muscles is the way to goDr Fernando RivadeneiraDr Rivadeneira said that the research findings suggest that health authorities may need to re-assess the wide-spread use of vitamin D and calcium in clinical practice.“One of the most important insights from our work for patients at risk of osteoporosis, is obtaining additional evidence from the genetic studies that \u0027widespread\u0027 vitamin D supplementation is unlikely to be effective for the prevention of fracture,” he added. “It’s an eye opener.”Osteoporosis, which causes bones to become weak and fragile, affects 9 million people around the world – including three million people in the UK.  It leaves sufferers at risk of fracturing their wrist, hip and spine bones. The disease can be so serious for some people that even a cough or a sneeze can lead to a fracture.Post-menopausal women are at particular risk due to the effects that changes in oestrogen levels can have on bone density.“Building strong bones and strong muscles is the way to go,” said Dr Rivadeneira. “You need increased physical activity or at least not to lose your physical activity level and to have a balanced diet.”Many studies have looked at the association between vitamin D and health, but doctors and researchers are still not agreed on the level of vitamin D healthy people need or the potential adverse health consequences of a lack of the vitamin. The \u0026#039sunshine\u0026#039 supplement: should we all be taking vitamin D?As well as providing more evidence that builds on earlier studies that have also called into question the benefits of Vitamin D in preventing fractures in healthy people, the researchers said that the findings will help scientists identify new treatments for osteoporosis. By understanding the genetic variations that predispose someone to develop osteoporosis, they hope that better targeted treatments can be developed.“Some of the identified genetic variants are related to genes part of pathways currently targeted by recently developed osteoporosis medication, while other novel ones hold potential to become drug targets in the near future”, said Dr Rivadeneira.“Instead of putting everyone in the same melting pot, we have different types – people who lose bone, people who cannot form bone, and people who have a combination of the two,” he added.While the researchers said that Vitamin D is unlikely to have a significant effect on preventing osteoporosis in otherwise healthy adults, they have not ruled out that there could still be a role for supplementation such as in people who have particularly low levels of Vitamin D.  The researchers also recommend that osteoporosis sufferers taking treatments for the disease do not discontinue their vitamin supplements since the effectiveness of many current treatments have been tested in conjunction with use of Vitamin D and calcium.Cyrus Cooper, Professor of Rheumatology at the University of Southampton and president of the International Osteoporosis Foundation who contributed to the study said that bone density was probably some two to three times better at predicting someone\u0027s risk of getting osteoporosis than their level of Vitamin D level. I don\u0027t think this paper debunks the idea that Vitamin D is useful, he said. It\u0027s just that it is a small determinant. You\u0027d do some good if you make sure that your Vitamin D levels are okay.Commenting on the current UK advice for management and prevention of osteoporosis he said: The current guidelines are appropriate however, a bone density evaluation needs to be done as part of fracture risk screening.Professor Juliet Compston, a bone medicine expert at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and  a clinical adviser for the National Osteoporosis Society supported the study\u0027s findings. She said: The results of the analysis confirm and emphasise further the major role of low bone mass density as a risk factor for fractures, something that has been recognised for many years. There is an increasing consensus that in generally healthy community dwelling people, calcium and vitamin D supplementation does not reduce fracture risk, and this is supported by the findings of the study.Although the findings of this study do not support population-based vitamin D and calcium supplementation in community dwelling adults, there is strong evidence to support the continued use of supplements in high risk groups such as the housebound and institutionalised. Secondly, in people receiving pharmacological interventions for osteoporosis, calcium and vitamin D supplements should be provided if calcium intake andor vitamin D status are inadequate, she added.  So the study does not change current guidance for managing osteoporosis.Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of articleProtect yourself and your family by learning more about  Global Health Security  .

ITV has previous broadcast a celebration of the Prince’s 60th, with a line-up including Robin Williams, Joan Rivers, Eric Idle, Rowan Atkinson, Michael McIntyre, Bill Bailey and a reunion between John Cleese and Andrew Sachs which saw him recreate the role of Manuel from the classic comedy series Fawlty Towers.Asked about We Are Most Amused and Amazed, a spokesman for Clarence House declined to comment on whether the Prince would recreate his 1975 trick on stage for the nation.  Jeremy Corbyn accused of attempting to \u0026#39sully\u0026#39 definition of anti-Semitism with last minute caveatAmerican Horror Story: Apocalypse - new trailer released, plus all we know about the new seriesThe Great British Bake Off 2018, Cake Week review: swearing in the tent, while Paul Hollywood gives out handshakes like an over-eager salesman Wanderlust, episode 1 review: this sex comedy is much more than mere titillationElon Musk brands British er in Thai rescue a \u0026#39child rapist\u0026#39 as feud escalatesViral children\u0026#39s song Baby Shark embroiled in row over sexismMervyn King blasts \u0026#39incompetent\u0026#39 Brexit preparations and says Government has no credible bargaining positionSounds of silence: Radio 3 to broadcast from empty battlefieldsWHO study finds 1.4 billion in world at risk of disease because of too little exerciseComment: It\u0026#39s about time ladies had paintings to lust over.

A recession is technically defined as when an economy contracts over two consecutive quarters. The main reasons behind the contraction in the second quarter were slowing agriculture, transport and trade sectors, according to Statistics South Africa. In particular, the agriculture market fell back by 29.2 per cent, taking 0.8 per cent off GDP. The main positive contributions came from the mining industry and finance, real estate and business services, SSA said. “The economy remains lacklustre, partially driven by policy uncertainty. Investment in manufacturing and development has been hampered by uncertainty regarding the mining charter and land redistribution,” said Bianca Botes, an analyst at Peregrine Solutions.Jeffrey Schultz, senior economist at BNP Paribas, added: “There is no way to sugar-coat the numbers, the growth picture in the first half of 2018 is ugly and it shows in this economy that there is broad-based weakness across the primary and tertiary sectors of the economy.”Meanwhile, George Glynos, head of research at ETM Analytics, said the recession was a result of years of poor administration, and added: “Clearly this is not what (President) Ramaphosa would like running into the elections next year.”South Africa condemns Trump for \u0027seeking to ide our nation\u0027 Why land expropriation won\u0027t work for South Africa\u0027s economySouth Africa\u0027s new government is part of the corruption problemThe rand was down 1.5 per cent against the dollar on Wednesday, with $1 buying 15.6 rand, and the South African currency was also down 1.2 per cent against sterling, with £1 buying almost 20 rand.

The firm’s\u0026nbsp16-week stockpile will double its seven-week reserves and should be\u0026nbspin place from January in advance of the UK’s scheduled departure date on 29 March 2019. Fellow insulin manufacturer\u0026nbspFrench firm Sanofi has already pledged to hold a 14-week stockpile, increasing reserves by nearly a third.“Our first commitment is to ensure that patients treated with our medicines remain unaffected in the event of a ‘no-deal’ Brexit,” said Pinder Sahota, corporate vice president of Novo Nordisk UK.“Our decision to increase stock is in line with the technical notices and guidance published by the government to industry.”How a new diabetes test could save millions of livesType 2 diabetes in children up 40 per cent, an ‘unmitigated disaster’Insulin pill could end need for diabetics’ daily injectionsThe Independent is leading a campaign to ensure the public gets a Final Say on the event terms of UK’s exit, and leading medical organisations have highlighted the serious health risks that need to be addressed first.Leaked civil service plans have shown how food and medicines in parts of the UK could run out within days unless a deal is in place, as additional delays and custom checks at Dover throw freight logistics into chaos.If prime minister Theresa May, herself a type 1 diabetic, is unable to agree a transition arrangement by March then the European Medicines Agency will deem the UK a “third country”.This will mean more stringent checks on imported medicines\u0026nbspuntil the UK gets its own systems in place for quality and assurance monitoring.The government is already preparing to turn the M20 into an overflow car park to manage queues at Dover and logistical disruption increases the chances of insulin stocks – which must be kept chilled – being spoiled.Despite these risks, the government is adamant that it will not give the public any vote on the terms of Britain’s exit.Dan Howarth, head of care at Diabetes UK, said: “This further commitment from Novo Nordisk will no doubt reassure those people with diabetes who rely on the insulin this company produces.“Insulin and other diabetes medication aren’t optional extras for the millions of people in the UK who rely on them. It’s incredibly important that the companies involved in their production and distribution, and those involved in guaranteeing their entry into the UK, work together so that supply continues uninterrupted.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/30/13/frestonia-1.jpg","title":"frestonia squatters london declare independence uk 1970s free independent","story":"Created with Sketch.The Free Independent Republic of Frestonia was born of a generation who knew counterculture as much as precarious living. Now a new book collects photography and stories from the communityClick to followThe IndependentThe community designed a flag, appointed ministers of state – including actor David Rappaport as foreign minister – made their own postage stamps and issued visas for visitorsThere was a lot of talk, in the wake of the Brexit referendum, suggesting that London should stage its own exit from the United Kingdom, declare independence, and ask to rejoin the EU as a nation state.Ignoring for now the fact that not everyone – though\u0026nbspit might seem that way to London – outside the capital voted to leave the EU, it seemed a satisfying, though jokey, postscript to the Brexit vote. Indeed, more than 180,000 Londoners signed an online petition calling for the mayor, Sadiq\u0026nbspKhan, to “declare London independent, and apply to join the EU –\u0026nbspincluding membership of the Schengen zone”.But what a lot of the signatories might not have realised was that there was indeed a precedent for London seceding from the UK. Or at least, one street of the capital.\u0026nbspWelcome to the Free Independent Republic of Frestonia. Or, what’s left of it, which these days amounts to the Frestonian Gallery, keeping the name and spirit alive of one of the most curious episodes in London’s history. It\u0026nbspbegan on Halloween\u0026nbsp1977, when the residents of Freston Road in Notting Dale, West London, which was largely comprised of squats and communes, declared independence.Threatened with eviction, the squatters said they were no longer part of the UK and appealed to the United Nations to send in peacekeeping forces to prevent Greater London Council turfing them out of the homes they had claimed. They designed a flag, appointed ministers of state, and even made their own postage stamps and issued visas for visitors.The short-lived story of the Free Independent Republic of Frestonia has now been documented in a new book of photographs by one of its residents, the photographer Tony Sleep, who was resident on Freston Road from 1974.\u0026nbspSleep describes the Frestonia experiment as “part publicity stunt, part theatrical protest”, and adds that while it wasn’t a serious attempt to break away from the UK, there was never any need to, because what became Frestonia “was already on a different planet”.He writes in the lavish book: “Frestonia was rooted in the counterculture of the time. The period is now dismissed as little more than daft clothes and hair, accompanied by a great soundtrack and the invention of sex and drugs.“It was, we are told, youthful self indulgence that ended badly because it was irresponsible and naive.”Frestonian Gallery)Frestonia was born out of problems that young people will recognise today: the lack of affordable accommodation. Sleep points out that the millennial generation might have a beef with the baby boomers who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s because they had it easy, and accommodation was cheap and plentiful. Not a bit of it, he says.“Rented flats were in very short supply, and mostly slum standard. You might achieve a rented bedsit as long as you weren’t black, Irish\u0026nbspor a dog. Then, as now, landlords wanted ‘professional’ people.“Council housing lists were only for families, and backlogged for decades. Despite what now seem like absurdly low prices, only the wealthy and secure could obtain mortgages at a time before easy mass debts. Less than half the population owned their own homes at the start of the 1970s.”Freston Road, where squatters and activists founded housing coop and community Frestonia\u0026nbsp(Getty)Many of the houses on Freston Road were empty, having been condemned as unfit for human habitation, and most of the residents had been relocated to the new highrise blocks of flats that began to go up in the 1960s and 1970s. There had been a move to demolish the vacant properties, but residents in neighbouring communities had complained that they would be looking out onto swathes of barren, rubble-strewn land that would encourage flytipping, so the authorities decided to take the cheaper option and just leave the buildings standing for a while.Freston Road might have been abandoned, but that didn’t mean it was unused. From 1974, squatters began to break into the empty houses and set up home there Tony Sleep, aged 24 at that time, was one of them.He recalls:\u0026nbsp“Squatting is distinctly equal opportunity. If you can gain possession, it’s yours. This led to an interesting mix of people who had little in common except needing somewhere to live and being poor for one reason or another. While some tried to make their new homes habitable, several houses were quickly wrecked.”Sleep remembers well his first sight of Freston Road. He’d been living in a “dismal rented basement” in west Kensington, but as he and his girlfriend parted company, he needed somewhere else to live, and heard about a street of empty houses. Some of his friends went to have a look and broke into two of the houses.“That night I paid them a visit,” writes Sleep. “Eight people, four guys, four girls, in one candlelit room, the only one that had windows. There was no toilet, no water, no electricity.”But his friends set to work installing plumbing and wiring as best they could, found an old toilet, rescued carpets and furniture from skips, and Sleep asked if he could move in with them.By 1977 Freston Road had settled into an unorthodox community, of sorts. But the attention of the GLC wandered back to these old, abandoned homes, and the squatters were told that they were to be evicted from these properties.The council offered to place the squatters in what were considered “hard to let” properties dotted around London, and some took the flats –\u0026nbspand, says Sleep, were promptly replaced in Freston Road by other people desperate for somewhere to live.\u0026nbspThe GLC announced its intention to bulldoze Freston Road after all, and a meeting was called, attended by 200 people. They decided – inspired by the Ealing comedy Passport to Pimlico – to go it alone. The Free Independent Republic of Frestonia was born. And the battle was on.The Frestonian National Anthem was written (“Long live Frestonia! Land of the free – not the GLC”) and a community newspaper, The Tribal Messenger, was distributed. Frestonia made the international press, and the Daily Mirror ran a piece declaring “All Hall, Frestonia”. The actor David Rappaport was made foreign minister, and playwright Heathcote Williams became ambassador to the United Kingdom.It was all a bit jolly and, of course, more than a pinch of Ealing comedy. But, Sleep points out, Frestonia was also an interesting way of putting British society under the\u0026nbspmicroscope.“Communities are defined, more or less, by what people have in common,” he writes. “That’s usually class, background or aspiration, sometimes race or religion. What people have in common helps them feel safe and valued. What is different can be threatening or isive.Frestonian Gallery)“Families, on the other hand, are a matter of being stuck with people you sometimes struggle to tolerate, let alone like. Frestonia was a bit of both.“Frestonians were, beneath the veneer of pragmatic anarchy, from different cultures. There were the hippies, idealists of a sort. There were the punks, nihilists of a sort. And there were the itinerant street people, whose lack of youth and lost changes gave them a thread of bitterness to chew on together.”Over the next couple of years, fighting the threat of the GLC bulldozers, the anarchic squat collective organised itself more seriously, forming the Bramley Housing Cooperative with an aim that was less about the fun of independence and more about securing the future of the Freston Road community.Eventually, the GLC won the war, and demolition of the squats began in 1983. But the Bramley Housing Cooperative, working with the Notting Hill Housing Trust, continued to fight for Freston Road as a residential area. And, ultimately, they won.Sleep says, “Frestonia didn’t cease when the squats were demolished. How could it? They were only useful ruins. Frestonia was about the people, its improbable family.“If you walk through Frestonia now, there’s little to suggest it is much different from anywhere else. You’ll find a street of small, but perhaps unusually pretty houses, built in the mid 1980s. They look carefully designed, a bit too inidual to be social housing. You may not notice the enclosed communal gardens, or the sheltered housing scheme that the coop insisted on, you won’t know the coop ensured housing for some of the more vulnerable Frestonians.”It might be that Frestonia would be forgotten all together, but for Tony Sleep’s photographic record of the people, events and houses on Freston Road in the late 1970s and early 1980s.‘Pop-up squat’: Activists occupy property to protest Housing BillNew photography exhibition shows the tough reality of squattingChallenging consumption and overwork in a Danish communityThe name does linger on in the form of the Frestonian Gallery, opened in 2017 by Matt Incledon and Rollo Campbell, who have published Tony Sleep’s photographs and recollections in Welcome To Frestonia. A pair of, in their own words, “itinerant art dealers”, they opened the gallery in The People’s Hall, a Victorian building that was once at the heart of Frestonia.\u0026nbspFrestonian Gallery opened in 2017 to remember a most curious episode in London’s history\u0026nbsp(Tony SleepFrestonian Gallery)Becoming appraised of the story of Frestonia, they were introduced to Tony Sleep, and arranged an exhibition of his photographs. They write in their foreword: “It was an exhibition unlike anything either of us had worked on previously. Each day at the gallery provided a steady stream of visitors keen to revisit and share their own personal memories of Frestonia. It would be a nice point at which to say ‘We then decided a book of Tony’s work needs to be published...’ but again, in truth, the decision had been made for us already by the sheer emotional response to this unique exhibition.”Was it all worth it for the Frestonians? Did it make a difference? Tony Sleep closes his remarkable document of this time by musing, “Forty years on, the UK seems to have travelled in a large circle and arrived little the wiser, but probably angrier, more cynical and more ided than ever.\u0026nbspWe are all Frestonians, on this small blue dot in the middle of nowhere. We are all one family, whether we like it or not.”Welcome to Frestonia by Tony Sleep\u0026nbspis published by the Frestonian Gallery (frestoniangallery), priced £35Free Independent Republic of FrestoniaEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/28/10/POLITICS-Africa-085924.jpg  width= 2500  height= 1666  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/28/10/POLITICS-Africa-085924.jpg","title":"south africa recession rand weak economy ramaphosa","story":"Created with Sketch.A slowdown in the agriculture sector was a main driver for the overall economic declineClick to followThe IndependentThe rand fell against major currencies after the economic data was publishedSouth African rand weakens as economy enters recessionSouth Africa has gone into recession after its economy shrank by 0.8 per cent in the second quarter of the year. A recession is technically defined as when an economy contracts over two consecutive quarters. The main reasons behind the contraction in the second quarter were slowing agriculture, transport and trade sectors, according to Statistics South Africa. In particular, the agriculture market fell back by 29.2 per cent, taking 0.8 per cent off GDP. The main positive contributions came from the mining industry and finance, real estate and business services, SSA said. “The economy remains lacklustre, partially driven by policy uncertainty. Investment in manufacturing and development has been hampered by uncertainty regarding the mining charter and land redistribution,” said Bianca Botes, an analyst at Peregrine Solutions.Jeffrey Schultz, senior economist at BNP Paribas, added: “There is no way to sugar-coat the numbers, the growth picture in the first half of 2018 is ugly and it shows in this economy that there is broad-based weakness across the primary and tertiary sectors of the economy.”Meanwhile, George Glynos, head of research at ETM Analytics, said the recession was a result of years of poor administration, and added: “Clearly this is not what (President) Ramaphosa would like running into the elections next year.”South Africa condemns Trump for \u0027seeking to ide our nation\u0027 Why land expropriation won\u0027t work for South Africa\u0027s economySouth Africa\u0027s new government is part of the corruption problemThe rand was down 1.5 per cent against the dollar on Wednesday, with $1 buying 15.6 rand, and the South African currency was also down 1.2 per cent against sterling, with £1 buying almost 20 rand.

We were told to go to the British embassy, but it was Sunday and the next\u0026nbspday was a bank holiday. I had to call the Belgian police, who gave me a document saying I should look after the child until a solution is found.”Mr Diallo\u0026nbspsaid that Mohamed appeared to be\u0026nbsprelaxed about the situation so far, but warned that it may become more difficult once his friends go back to school on Wednesday, at which\u0026nbsppoint he will be looked after by Mr Diallo’s mother.“We’re going to have him for one more week. He has been happily playing with my eight-year-old daughter and\u0026nbspmy nephew who is six, but they will start school tomorrow. That’s\u0026nbspwhen he will start realising the situation,” he said.“Hawa is residing in the UK based on his British nationality, so she\u0026nbspcannot leave the country, meaning for the time being the child is stuck here. No matter what the parents\u0026nbsphave done, the child shouldn’t be separated\u0026nbspfrom them.”Responding to the incident, Ms Abbott told\u0026nbspThe Independent: “This case is truly shocking. That this government would preside over a system blocking a six-year old born here from returning home is almost beyond belief.“We have ministers telling us they are sorting out the\u0026nbspWindrush\u0026nbspscandal, and their hostile environment\u0026nbspisn’t to blame. But this shows their reassurances are worthless.\u0026nbsp“People being refused re-entry here is exactly one of the effects of their policies.

It is about getting Brexit right.“If that fails and we are left on the cliff-edge of no deal with no other options, then and only then would I endorse the call for a people’s vote on the proposed no-deal departure and encourage our MPs to do the same.“A price would undoubtedly be paid in terms of social cohesion but it would be a necessary one to protect the damage to people’s jobs, families and lives.“I realise that this is an unfashionably nuanced position when simplistic big positions are all the rage.”People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchMr Burnham will argue that the result of the 201\u0026nbsp6 referendum was “as much an instruction for Westminster to review its relationship with the rest of England” as Brussels.“If the phrase ‘take back control’ is to mean anything, it must mean substantial devolution of power and resources out of Westminster to all of the English regions,” he will say.A Department for Exiting the European Union spokesman said: “As the prime minister has made clear, we are leaving the EU on 29 March 2019.“We have made good progress on the withdrawal agreement.

Mr Corbyn’s close ally – shied away from backing a fresh referendum.Conference delegates instead endorsed a weaker statement, where Unite remains “open to the possibility” of another EU referendum “depending on political circumstances”.Up to 200 local Labour branches will attempt to make a further Brexit referendum official party policy at the conference in Liverpool, starting on 23 September.Mr Corbyn hopes to force the prime minister into another general election if her Brexit deal is rejected by parliament this winter, or if she fails to strike any agreement at all.However, the party has been edging closer to backing a referendum, with both John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, and Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, insisting it must remain an option.The issue will also be debated by the union movement in Manchester next week, at the TUC conference.Responding, Brandon Lewis MP, Chairman of the Conservative Party, said: “Rerunning the referendum would take us all back to square one.“Jeremy Corbyn should stand up to his union paymasters and rule out a second referendum once and for all.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that

Bosnia wearing the European Union flag on their uniforms.“No one should now join the British army until we have left the EU and this has all been reversed,” Mr Batten said.“Our soldiers are no longer fighting for Queen and Country but under a foreign military command.Our ancestors, the heroes of The Armada, Waterloo, Trafalgar, Passchendaele, El-Alamein, and others too numerous to mention, did not fight so that their descendants could serve under the flag of a foreign power.”Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: “For goodness sake, this is ridiculous. We’d have lost the war if we’d have refused to work with our allies.”But Mr Batten said it was only after the UK left the EU that “we will be able to rebuild our military into a force which serves the interests of our nation first and foremost.

Quite genuinely, I don’t want to pre-judge our own democracy, but I feel that appetite is growing.”May will by-pass Brussels and press EU leaders on Chequers planNew Brexit referendum backed by GMB unionThe TUC is due to discuss its official position, which O’Grady will\u0026nbspgive voice to, at the event.\u0026nbspHowever, the union movement is increasingly in favour of giving people a final say, putting Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn under pressure to shift his party\u0027s position.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBritain’s third biggest union, the GMB, delivered a major boost to The Independent’s campaign by backing the call yesterday.\u0026nbspIn a video statement Tim Roache, its general secretary, condemned “the mess this government is making of Brexit” when “there is so much at stake”.\u0026nbspO’Grady said on the same subject: “Right from the start of this process it should have been about protecting the economy, workers’ rights and jobs, as well as the peace process in Northern Island. Those should have been the red lines.”The union chief has repeatedly said that the UK should consider the so called \u0027Norway plus\u0027\u0026nbspoption of a Brexit under which the UK retains membership of the European single market and customs union.\u0026nbspShe said: “That is our assessment of the best way of protecting jobs and the economy.”\u0026nbspO’Grady said she was concerned about answering a complex problem with a simple question in a referendum but she added: “I’m a trade unionist and there is no way that union negotiators would go into a negotiation about what is going into a deal without getting the approval of the membership.”The UK’s economy was the fastest growing in the OECD prior to the EU Referendum, but since then it has sunk to the bottom of the table. The latest Purchasing Managers Index data on construction and manufacturing have pointed to a slowdown in both sectors.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, there are growing fears about\u0026nbspthe impact of a no-deal Brexit – still the bookies favourite – on ordinary people, particularly those who are “just about managinig”.\u0026nbspA TUC analysis of official data published today will show that average household income has fallen short of spending in every quarter since Theresa May became Prime Minister, with a typical\u0026nbsphousehold pushed £1,250 into the red during her time in Number 10 Downing Street, further underlining the problems created by Brexit.\u0026nbsp“The Government’s own advice shows life will be harder under Brexit and the harder the Brexit the worse it gets,” O’Grady\u0026nbsptold The Independent.\u0026nbspShe said she believed many of those who voted Leave\u0026nbspwere people who felt they had been forgotten and left behind in Britain.\u0026nbsp“I understand Brexit is the key issue that has dominated government policy, and that it is the most important issue facing the country, but the problems that made people vote that way, people who felt treated like they were disposable, they were there before the referendum they are still there and they are getting worse.\u0026nbsp“Government can’t be a one trick\u0026nbsppony and it is possible to delegate. I want to know who is looking after the interests of working people in this country? Who is minding the shop?\u0026nbsp“I was just re-reading\u0026nbspthe speech Theresa May made on the Downing Street steps when she took office. It is about the government being on the side of working people and prioritising their interests against those of the\u0026nbspwealthy. But that has’t happened.“Look at the way having workers on boards was dropped.”O’Grady also highlighted how\u0026nbspthe Government commissioned review into modern working\u0026nbspand the gig economy\u0026nbspby Matthew Taylor\u0026nbsphas been kicked into the Whitehall long grass.\u0026nbsp“As far as we were concerned it didn’t go far enough. But where has it gone?\u0026nbspWhatever happened to it?\u0026nbspOur release shows that\u0026nbspevery single quarter under Theresa May average households had more going out than coming in. This is what happens when you have flat wages and insecurity at work.“We have seen the balance of power shift against working people. We know there are nearly 4m on zero hours contracts, agency workers, temporary workers or very low paid self-employed workers, which is very often a proxy for not being\u0026nbspself-employed at all.\u0026nbsp“They don’t have any basic rights. So if they fall sick, want to have a baby, or simply want the national minimum wage it is a struggle for them.

The International Monetary Fund warned in April that at least 40 per cent of low-income countries in Africa are either in debt distress or at high risk. Since the last FOCAC forum in South Africa in 2015, a number of countries have attempted to restructure their debt.But Chinese officials have previously denied taking part in so-called “debt trap” diplomacy, and on Monday Mr Xi said government debt from China’s interest free loans due by the end of 2018 will be written off for indebted poor African countries.“Unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise,” Mr Xi warned, an apparent reference to an ongoing trade war between his country and Donald Trump’s America.“China-Africa cooperation under the BRI (Belt and Road Initiative) is a way to common prosperity that brings benefits to both our peoples.”The only African country not represented in Beijing at the summit, which continued on Tuesday with meetings between business leaders and entrepreneurs, was newly-renamed eSwatini, formerly Swaziland.That’s because it is now the only nation left in Africa still conducting diplomatic relations with Taiwan, the self-ruled territory claimed by China. Beijing refuses to do business with any country that maintains ties to Taipei – business which the rest of the African continent has decided it cannot afford to lose.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/03/15/ap-18246372421934.jpg","title":"netanyahu duterte israel philippines visit obama","story":"Created with Sketch.The Philippine president, who likened his country\u0027s war on drugs to the Holocaust,\u0026nbspeyes arms deal with Israel during a\u0026nbspfour-day tour\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte in Jerusalem on MondayBenjamin Netanyahu has warmly welcomed\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspcontroversial Philippine president, who once\u0026nbspcompared himself to Hitler, adding to mounting criticism of the Israeli prime minister’s close ties with authoritarian world leaders.Rodrigo Duterte, who is in Israel for a four-day tour, is the first Philippine leader to visit the country since the two nations established diplomatic relations 60 years ago. \u0026nbspThe firebrand president is expected to sign a major oil deal with Israel and to purchase Israeli arms, during the short tour in which he has been accompanied by an entourage of security forces.\u0026nbspMr Duterte has faced widespread criticism for his deadly crackdown on drugs back home which has left thousands dead and for several foul-mouthed comments, including comparing his war on drugs to the Holocaust, and most recently\u0026nbspjoking about rape.Despite the many controversies, on Monday Mr Netanyahu highlighted the two country’s historical\u0026nbspfriendship, including the Philippines’\u0026nbspdecision to vote in favour of Israel’s establishment in 1947, becoming the only Asian country to do so.“We remember our friends and that friendship has blossomed over the years and especially over the last few years,” Mr Netanyahu said, after signing three agreements on trade, science and care-giving.Mr Duterte, who later visited the country’s Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial and met top officials including President Reuven Rivlin, said they “share the same passion for peace”.“Israel can expect any help that the Philippines can extend,” he added.We remember our friends and that friendship has blossomed over the years and especially over the last few years\u0026nbspThe Philippines has enjoyed\u0026nbspincreasingly strong ties with Israel over the years. In December it abstained from a vote at the United Nations General Assembly rebuking the US for moving its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Washington’s controversial decision recognised Jerusalem as Israel’s capital despite the fact it is contested city claimed by both Israelis and Palestinians. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe Philippine president is also seeking new sources of military hardware and emerged as a significant new customer in 2017 for Israel, with sales of radar and anti-tank equipment worth $21m.Mr Netanyahu has been praised for forging ties with new allies abroad, where Israel has often lost support for its occupation of the Palestinian territories.However, in recent months the Israeli leader has come under fire for the choice of those partners.Why Netanyahu sees Poland as Israel’s most important ally in EuropeIsrael’s Netanyahu criticised for wooing Hungary’s far-right PMWhy has Netanyahu pushed through the Jewish Nation State bill now?Benjamin Netanyahu questioned by police in corruption investigation Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu flies to Europe to lobby May on Iran dealMr Duterte’s visit comes just weeks after Netanyahu welcomed Viktor Orban, Hungary’s four-time prime minister who was criticised last year for praising Miklos Horthy, Hungary’s World War II-era ruler and a Nazi collaborator.Mr Orban was also accused of employing anti-Semitic tropes against George Soros, a Jewish Hungarian-American billionaire philanthropist, during his re-election campaign. During Mr Orban’s visit to Israel in July, Mr\u0026nbspNetanyahu praised him for combatting anti-semitism.Mr Netanyahu was also criticised for striking a deal with Polish President Andrzej Duda over his country’s controversial Holocaust speech law, which would have criminalised blaming the Polish nation for crimes committed against Jews during World War II.Mr\u0026nbspDuterte, who assumed power 2016, did little to assuage fears on Sunday when he kicked off his four-day tour of Israel with a rambling expletive-ladened speech to members of the Filipino community in Jerusalem.During the hour-long talk he justified comments made on Thursday that the high rape rate in a Philippine city was due to the number of “beautiful women”. And he apologised for calling former US president Barack Obama a “son of a whore”.Duterte defended by spokespersonIn 2016, Mr Duterte drew worldwide anger when he said he would kill as many drug addicts as Hitler did Jews, adding “I’d be happy to slaughter them”. \u0026nbspIn the same speech he had also claimed three million Jews were killed in the Holocaust, half the number agreed by historians. The president later apologised, saying he had been misunderstood.But his comments were not forgotten in Israel. Left-leaning daily Haaretz\u0026nbspon Monday published an editorial headlined “A Hitler admirer at Yad Vashem,” while The Times of Israel asked why Israel was “opening its doors” to Mr Duterte in a piece entitled “this man has no place in our country”. Left-wing politicians, meanwhile, questioned why Mr Netanyahu wanted to “whitewash an illegitimate leader”.He “took pride in massacring his citizens and violating human rights… so why?” Tamar Zandberg, head of the leftist Meretz party, wrote on Facebook.“Because Duterte is willing to support the occupation (of the West Bank),” she said.The most controversial quotes from Rodrigo Duterte“These sons of whores are destroying our children.

In the past he has joked about wanting to rape an Australian national who was killed during a prison riot in 1989, he called Pope Francis a “son of a whore” for causing a traffic jam in the capital Manilla, and labelled God a “son of bitch”.He has also advised citizens not to wear condoms despite an HIV crisis, forcibly kissed a woman on stage and told soldiers to shoot female rebels in the vagina.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/183x122/1013012_1.jpg","title":"Brexit news UK EU Theresa May Dominic Raab Labour Party Keir Starmer House of Commons","story":"Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab claimed the Labour Party would be \u0026ldquouseless in standing up for the UK in negotiations with the EU.Responding the Labour\u0026rsquos shadow Brexit secretary in the House of Commons, Mr Raab also criticised Labour for \u0026ldquodangling the prospect of a second referendum, which he claimed would only invite the worst kind of deal from the bloc.\u0026nbspDuring his speech, the Brexit Secretary updated MP\u0026rsquos on negotiations with the European Union claiming he was \u0026ldquoconfident that a deal is within our grasp.Responding to the speech, Sir Keir branded the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos Brexit blueprint a \u0026ldquofudge.

Fury as Archbishop of Canterbury hails European Union in new speech                Welby\u0026rsquos worship of European Union is nonsensicalThe widening gulf between rich and poor, and fears about the future among young people and their parents, have damaged our nation\u0027s sense of itself.Our report shows that it doesn\u0027t have to be like this. By putting fairness at the heart of the economy, we can make it perform better, improving the lives of millions of people. Achieving prosperity and justice together is not only a moral imperative - it is an economic one.The report drawn up by the Commission on Economic Justice said the UK was on the cusp of a new era that required a radical re-think of economic policy.Britain was facing comparable challenges to those faced by Clement Atlee\u0027s Labour government in the 1940s and Margaret Thatcher\u0027s free-market reforming administration in the 1980s, the report said.he Archbishop joined figures from business, trade unions, universities and other bodies. (Image: ) (Image: )It put forward 73 recommendations in a 10-year plan for the country\u0027s future including raising the minimum wage by \u0026pound1 an hour and a hike in corporation tax.Other recommendations included a single income tax to cover both earnings and wealth and replacing inheritance tax with levies on gifts.Among other proposals were a new National Investment Bank, workers on company boards, an increase in corporation tax, higher pay for workers on zero hours contracts and accelerating automation of workplaces.The report said that, almost a decade since the financial crisis, the living standards of tens of millions of people had stagnated, young people had seen life chances deteriorate, and the economic gulf between London and the South East and the rest of the country had widened.Low investment and productivity and an unsustainable trade deficit had developed over the past 40 years, so the economy needed to be hard-wired for justice, the commission said.Economic power should be re-balanced, from corporate management to workers and unions, and from Westminster to regions, it was suggested.Frances O\u0027Grady, general secretary of the TUC and another contributor to the report, said: It\u0027s time for a once-in-a-generation rethink of our approach to the economy. Working people have had enough of stagnating living standards and massive inequality, and no-one\u0027s buying the idea that there\u0027s no alternative.A better deal for working people is possible, and will allow us to build a stronger, fairer economy.

He had shot them with his fathers rifle, then made it look like his sister had done it.The White House Farm murders were one of the most brutal in UK history.Jeremy, then 24, savagely murdered his adoptive parents, Nevill and June Bamber, his adopted sister Sheila Caffell and her six-year-old twin sons Daniel and Nicholas - with his fathers gun.The murders are now the focus of an ITV drama, White House Farm - which will air in 2019 - starring Freddie Fox as Jeremy and Prince Harrys former girlfriend Cressida Bonas as his doomed adoptive sister Sheila - a schizophrenic model nicknamed Bambi.Jeremy was jailed for 25 years but still maintains his innocence - and had appealed his conviction several times.Here Sun Online takes a look at the real story behind the crimes that shocked the nation and remain controversial 33 years on.On 6th August 1985, police received a call from a distressed Jeremy, then aged 24.He said hed received a phone call from his dad Nevill about his adopted sister Sheila going berserk with a gun - and that the line had gone dead in the middle of the call.Jeremy - who had been adopted by the family as a baby - met officers at the home, saying his sister was a nutter who knew how to use guns.Police were confronted by a massacre. First, they discovered the body of Nevill, 61, next to the AGA - he had been shot eight times and had head injuries.On the upstairs landing lay his wife June - shed been shot between her eyes.Sheila lay in the bedroom with two bullet wounds to the throat and a rifle across her body - leading the police officers to initially believe shed killed her family then herself.Her six-year-old twins Daniel and Nicholas were in the next room, both having been shot several times in the head.Officers thought they knew the truth - Sheila, in a psychotic episode, had killed her family then herself.Her mental health struggles were well-documented in the press over the following weeks - a model, whose marriage to husband Colin had broken down, shed received treatment for paranoid schizophrenia and anorexia.At first, police accepted that Sheila was responsible for the killingsAs well as taking anti-psychotic medicine, she was snorting cocaine - racking up drug debts of £40,000 - and sleeping with older men.Her relationship with her adoptive parents had been strained. It seemed logical she was the killer.But it wasnt long before cracks started to appear in their theories.Detectives started to wonder if a slim woman who was fatigued from anti-psychotics could really overpower and kill her 6 foot 4 well-built father.Then, at the funeral, Jeremys extended family said hed cracked smutty jokes and gave a chilling, big grin.He also acted over-the-top: falling on his knees and howling in front of the TV microphones.Soon after, Jeremy split with his girlfriend Julie Mugford and new evidence came to light.Julie told the police hed rung her on the night of the murders to say its tonight or never and that hed been plotting to kill his family for 18 months.Jeremy was arrested on 8 September, denying everything and accusing his ex-girlfriend of being angry about their breakup.Privately-educated Jeremy was no stranger to criminal activity - a few weeks before the murders he robbed the family business, making it look like an inside job.And when travelling around Australia and New Zealand, he stole from a jewellery shop. He also boasted about smuggling heroin.His extended family, who inherited the family fortune, said Jeremy often provoked his parents - starting arguments and even hiding a bag of live rats in his fathers secretarys car.There had been tension leading up to the killings: Nevill told ious people, including his secretary, that he foresaw a shooting accident.Police became more and more suspicious.The rifles silencer was found in a cupboard on the farm by Jeremys cousins and it was noted that Sheila wouldnt have been able to place it there after shooting herself.Sheilas feet were also clean - if shed gone on a rampage they would have been blood-stained. Photos of Jeremys feet showed blood on them.The bedroom phone was found plugged into the kitchen socket - something experts say Sheila would have been unlikely to have done during a psychotic episode.There are an estimated 75 prisoners serving whole life terms in UK prisons at present, while others have passed away in jail.Five notable criminals sentenced to life imprisonment include:Jeremy was finally charged with the murder of all his family members a month later.Described by his trial judge as evil beyond belief, Jeremy was found guilty by the jury on a ratio of 10-2 - and sentenced to 25 years - extending to a whole life order in 1994.He has been in HM Prison Wakefield ever since.But despite the evidence, many of Jeremys supporters believe he is innocent - and that Shelia committed the gruesome mass murder.They say that the blood on his feet was that of a rabbits - and that the police destroyed evidence.Bob Woffinden, an expert in miscarriages of justice, previously believed Sheila was the killer.However, he changed his mind in 2011, when researching the theory about the house phone.After reading numerous police reports, his theory is that on the evening of the murders, the first thing Jeremy did was to take the kitchen phone off the hook, disabling every phone in the house.Bob believed Jeremy was wearing a wetsuit to avoid getting his clothes covered with bloodstains, and shot the children with his fathers rifle first.But when his father tried to call the police from the bedside phone, he wouldnt have been able to.Jeremy then shot Nevill before battering him to death with the rifle butt. He then shot his mother and sister.Bob says Jeremy needed to direct one bullet at a precise angle to Sheilas throat to make it look like a suicide. But the first didnt kill her, so he shot her again.This was a mistake - if it was suicide she couldnt have shot herself twice.After showering in the wetsuit - which he later disposed of - he got dressed before plugging the bedroom phone into the kitchen socket.If Sheila had killed her family and herself, she couldnt have rearranged the phones.This is the final piece of evidence in the case for Jeremys guilt, and Bobs theory has been accepted by many experts.  However, Jeremys supporters, who include MPs and campaigner Peter Tatchell, say the case is one of the worst miscarriages of justice in British history - and the website calling for his release has a forum where hundreds of people attempt to prove his innocence.But with his last appeal bid being rejected six years ago, Jeremy seems destined to spend the rest of his life in prison.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Far left Trotskyite infiltrators — operating under the banner of the Militant Tendency — took over the city council.Under the leadership of the charismatic but confrontational Derek Hatton they were set on purging traditional Labour voices and creating Moscow on the Mersey.They ramped up tension between the city and central Government by playing politics with council jobs.Their antics provoked then Labour leader Neil Kinnock into giving one of his most famous speeches when he condemned the “grotesque chaos” of a Labour Council sending redundancy notices to its own workers by taxi. Eventually, the moderates won, Militant was defeated and the city was saved.But now, fast forward 33 years and another titanic struggle for the future of Labour is being played out in Merseyside.Veteran Labour MP Frank Field who was the target of Militant in the Eighties, has sensationally been thrown out of the party he’s served all his life after resigning the whip in protest at the rise of the new extremists.But this time it’s not just Liverpool that’s being taken over by the hard Left but the Labour Party itself.And instead of Labour’s leader mounting a fightback for moderation, as Neil Kinnock did, the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn is the heart of the problem.Corbyn will be in Liverpool later this month for Labour’s own party conference — where the fate of the party may be decided.Will it cement victory for the new militants, now calling themselves Momentum, or be the moment that we get, in every sense, the opposition we need?I’ve known Frank for many years and he’s Labour to the core.He’s dedicated his life to fighting poverty. He has been a tough critic of my party and speaks with the moral authority of someone whose whole life has been given to serving the poorest.He pursued Philip Green over the collapse of BHS and got millions back for the company’s pensioners.But because Frank is an authentic spokesman for working people, including on issues like Brexit, he’s been targeted by the new militants who want everyone to follow Comrade Corbyn’s rigid party line.Frank is also heir to the Old Labour tradition of fighting racism and intolerance wherever it comes from. A war baby, he cherishes the role Labour played in defeating fascism. So when he takes such a stand against the party he loves, and does so citing the leader’s own complicity in anti-Semitism, then this is an alarm bell no-one can ignore.Other Merseyside MPs including Luciana Berger and Louise Ellman have also spoken out against rising anti-Semitism and intolerance within Labour ranks and the abuse they have received is truly shocking.The question now must be, will others follow Frank?With not just local parties, but the leadership itself, implacably in the grip of the hard Left, can moderates stay, and thus lend cover and credibility to the current leader?Labour was the party, when Frank was a boy, which helped create the state of Israel as a homeland for the Jewish people, which helped build Nato as a bulwark of Western values and which put the interests of working people first.Now that Labour’s leadership is criticised by our own Chief Rabbi for its attitude to Israel and the Jewish community, now that Labour has a leader who doesn’t believe in Nato and a strong defence, now that Labour is more interested in single-issue protest than building a better future for workers, can the majority of Labour’s MPs, who are decent, hard-working and moderate, really stay?Frank is right to shine a light on the issue of anti-Semitism. And not just because it is truly horrendous that, after the horrors unleashed in the 20th Century, this intolerance should return.But also because attitudes towards the Jewish community are the best indicator of how free and progressive a country is.Throughout history, the countries where Jewish people have felt safest, like the Netherlands and the UK, have been among the world’s freest.Countries where Jewish people have faced growing prejudice, like Germany and Russia during the last century, have been countries slipping into darkness.And as the Chief Rabbi has reminded us, what starts with prejudice against Jewish people spreads to taint society more widely.The Jewish community is the canary in the coal mine.And if our democracy is to stay strong then we need to have political parties that are broad-based social movements and not increasingly ideological sects.I am a Tory but I grew up to admire and respect the patriotic Labour tradition of people like Clement Attlee, Ernie Bevin, Jim Callaghan, Peter Shore, Barbara Castle and Frank Field.I wish him well and hope that his bravery will prove the wake-up call his party and the country needs to ensure there’s a sensible party of the centre left once more.NO more heroes any more, the Stranglers sang. Well, they reckoned without Lewis Pugh, a man whose grit, endurance, idealism and dedication make him the very model of a modern hero.Lewis is the endurance swimmer who powered his way into the record books this week by covering the length of the English Channel – from Land’s End to Dover – in 50 days.He covered the 330 miles – past the Eddystone Lighthouse, the Isle of Wight and Dungeness Power station – in just Speedos, cap and goggles.In stormy waters, sometimes swimming in the dead of night, through rain and high winds, with shoulder injuries, jellyfish stings and treacherous currents to slow him down, Lewis triumphed in a trial of character and cojones, which takes the breath away.But what drove Lewis on was not a desire to etch his name in the record books.It was a swelling passion for our seas, the wildlife in them and the future of our planet.In our own waters, and across the globe, the seas have suffered as a result of past exploitation, the growing danger from climate change, acidification and the rising tide of plastic waste.We have an opportunity to change that now.Leaving the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy means we can have a more sustainable approach to managing the fish in our seas.And reducing our reliance on single-use plastics, as well as improving recycling, can stem the flow of waste into our seas.But there is still more to do and making sure that more of the Earth’s surface is protected from exploitation is critical.Lewis records that during the length of his swim he encountered jellyfish in abundance, happy to bask in our warming waters, but far fewer fish, dolphins and other marine wildlife than he would have expected.As another modern hero, Sir David Attenborough, has reminded us, our Blue Planet is a precious but fragile place and we all have a responsibility to think about our impact on our seas.But the good news is that more and more people in Britain are cutting down on plastic, recycling more and helping nature recover, which is heroic in itself.The tech giant is planning to co-operate with China to censor material online.But it won’t respond to calls from the UK, US and others to co-operate in removing horrific images of abuse.The company’s motto used to be “Don’t be evil” but that was dropped earlier this year. Now we know why.I’M not surprised Prince Harry burst into song – albeit briefly – when he and wife Meghan met the cast of hit musical Hamilton.The hip-hop lyrics are infectiously catchy, so much so the Gove family often sing along to them in the car.And a musical about breaking free from an overbearing and distant overlord who doesn’t govern in your interests does have a special resonance for us.Happily, she accepted and will presumably now promise to forsake all udders.SAD to see the lovely Kirsty Young having to take a break from Desert Island Discs to battle fibromyalgia.This terrible condition – marked by chronic pain and extreme fatigue – has no ready cure.It can strike any of us down, casting a shadow over even the simplest pleasures.I hope Kirsty recovers soon ­– and I also hope that the light shone on this illness hastens progress towards a cure.Almost everything you need for a healthy, balanced diet can be sourced from British farms and fishermen.And you know it will have been caught or grown in a way that respects the environment.Instead of our diet going south, why not save on the food miles and help the planet by buying British?THE return of Strictly to our screens this autumn divides the Gove household. But not in the way you might think.My wife can’t stand the show and my daughter cringes at it – but my son and I are hooked.We’ve cheered on Ed Balls’ Gangnam Style and rooted for Susan Calman last year.This year I think Casualty actor Charles Venn and Paralympian Lauren Steadman could become popular favourites.But no, I won’t be harbouring dreams of joining in.

They trust our laws and our financial services, they admire our Armed Forces and they envy our universities.Actually, that’s not quite true: everywhere I go in the world, except right here in the UK.There are some who can’t or won’t see the natural advantages we have and the opportunities that exist for us. I get frustrated when some people purposefully choose to ignore good news such as last week when China opened up their market to UK dairy products.Britain can and should be confident and the world needs a confident Britain.A confident Britain can bang the drum for free trade across the world, as more and more countries look to pull up the drawbridge and turn away from the huge benefits that we have seen in poverty alleviation.A confident Britain can work with African countries to tackle extremism and instability which threatens millions of people across the world, including right here in the UK, as the Prime Minister promised to do this week.A confident Britain with an independent seat at the World Trade Organisation can be a leading voice for free trade and prosperity.A confident Britain is good for the world, and it’s good for us at home too. Why?Because free trade means we can sell more world-class British goods and services across the globe. That means safeguarding and creating jobs as well generating revenues for the Treasury to spend on our vital public services.That’s why I launched the Export Strategy last month: to turn the UK into a 21st Century exporting superpower.We need to work together to ­create a more confident Britain that can export to the world.To do that, we need to support business the length and breadth of the whole UK.Over 99 per cent of our businesses are small or medium-sized, and 96 per cent are micro-sized, employing fewer than nine people.That means many thousands of Sun on Sunday readers either own one or work for one.You are the lifeblood of our economy — it’s your entrepreneurship, risk-taking and innovation that drives the entire economy.It’s your wealth creation that provides the income we all depend on for our public services, from funding our NHS to paying our brave Armed Forces.It also means that you might not be exporting — yet — because more than 90 per cent of companies aren’t currently seizing the opportunities of exporting.That’s where we can help.Government doesn’t manufacture products and doesn’t provide services for exporting.But we can help create the right conditions by intervening where only government can.We have created a network of Her Majesty’s Trade Commissioners to lead the Government’s trade and investment promotion and policy in high-growth regions across the world.And I as International Trade Secretary can step in and speak to foreign ministers about overcoming a trade barrier — as I did last week, when I signed a deal in Beijing to enable the UK to export seed potatoes to China or help a UK company close a deal in an overseas market or seal a partnership with a foreign company.And to support British businesses — whether they produce farm products, or manufacture playgrounds, or provide legal services — we are also creating a network of Export Champions, people who run businesses that successfully export, to guide their peers and share their expertise.As I’ve often said before, in the next ten to 15 years, around 90 per cent of global economic growth is expected to be outside the EU.I truly believe that Brexit is an ­opportunity.The positive response and engagement we’ve seen from the EU negotiators to the Chequers proposals makes me believe that a good deal is now more likely.At Chequers the Government agreed its proposal for an economic partnership with the EU after the UK leaves on March 29, 2019.It confirmed that the UK will leave the Single Market and the Customs Union and will seize new opportunities from trading with the rest of the world.That’s why the Prime Minister visited Africa, one of the fastest-growing regions in the world, this week.It’s why I visited China last week, and am visiting India later in the autumn, to ensure Britain can make the most of their breakneck growth.Booming countries across the globe are confident in Britain.They’re confident in our crucial role in supporting world prosperity, world security and world growth.If they have faith in us, we need to have more faith. Because a more confident Britain is a better Britain for the world.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They want our politicians to get on with it.Mrs May has also claimed that she is going to start focusing on her domestic agenda. About time.Away from Twitter and Westminster, voters aren’t worried about the latest Project Fear smear.They care about the NHS, schools, being able to afford a home, and money in their pockets.Mrs May said she was the PM for the “Just About Managings”.

As with most of her premiership, Mrs May mustered her best in an awkward situation.This approach helps explain why a poll shows that Tory voters believe she is the figure who can unite Britain, ahead of other leadership prospects.Meanwhile, Liam Fox writes on this page that Britain should be confident going forward as an independent nation.There might finally be light at the end of the Brexit tunnel.IT is shocking that schools are calling for pupils to bring in loo roll because of cuts.Others are cancelling lessons and closing early.

He knows now.Last week, Field quit the Labour Party whip amid a barrage of “intolerance, nastiness and intimidation” from Corbyn outriders over his stand against anti-Semitism.Along with other moderate Labour MPs, he was battered by Twitter storms using the vilest language to wish him dead.Field bluntly accuses Jeremy Corbyn of racism and hints he is ready to force a by-election if kicked out of the Labour Party. Others facing deselection may follow suit.Leadership critics have endured relentless bullying and abuse, a trademark of the brutal machine which swept Jezza to power and intends to keep him there. As Frank Field himself now admits, Corbyn is going nowhere.The party might split but the ageing hippy “will lead Labour into the next election”. Corbyn’s sullen anti-Semitism triggered this revolt, but it is only a symptom of the sinister nature of hard-Left politics which brooks no criticism.Labour really is the Nasty Party. Jezza’s pro-Russian, anti-capitalist malcontents loathe everything the UK and other Western democracies stand for.They support some of the world’s most brutal tyrannies and catastrophic economies while railing against free speech and Press freedom.Corbyn sees no evil in these repressive forces and this week shelved an invitation from MI5 chiefs to show him the secret intelligence. On such evidence alone, it is fair to say Corbyn as PM would permanently damage this country, its freedoms and its prosperity.We knew all this when Ed Miliband threw open the party’s leadership to anyone with three quid to buy a vote. Thanks to his stunning act of stupidity, the “broad church” Labour Party of Clem Attlee, Hugh Gaitskell, John Smith and Tony Blair is history.It lives on in name only, an empty husk colonised by Momentum parasites who once fought the party they now own. Corbyn didn’t even want the job, telling supporters: “You’d better make f***ing sure I don’t win.”When he surprised himself by storming to victory in 2015, shell-shocked Blairite MPs assumed they could get rid of him if he stepped too far out of line.They tried that in 2016 — turning Jezza into the unassailable champion of the loony Left and handing over the keys to the asylum. Theresa May bolted him in place with her botched General Election. No wonder the Glastonbury millennials cooed: “Oh, Jeremy Corbyn.”Have we learned from Frank Field’s mistake? Or do we believe, as he did, voters will never be silly enough to give Corbyn the keys to power? Well, look at the polls. They show nobody much rates Jezza, but Labour remains neck and neck with the Tories.Theresa May has yet to navigate her way to a tricky Brexit deal with Brussels — or to a no-deal rejected by Commons Remainers. She has rightly turned her face against a second referendum, a democratic abomination.But who knows who will be leader by then? Boris Johnson is circling, helped by a growing team of sponsors and supporters. Mrs May would do anything to stop BoJo. She is even seeking official advice on another snap election gamble. Good luck with that, Theresa. But Remainers should be careful what they wish for.Corbyn, a fervent fan of arch-Eurosceptic Tony Benn, loathes the EU as much as the angry Labour supporters who voted Leave. But he would conveniently bury that hatred for the time being if it meant riding a Remainer wave into Downing Street.Pro-Brussels campaigner Keir Starmer would emerge, not for the first time, as a “useful idiot”.The Purge will have just begun.At a media event before his referendum, the ex-oil analyst confidently bet the price would not crash below 50 a barrel. It did. He sent me my winnings but they apparently went astray.So he offered double-or-quits. The price stayed below 50 for yet another year – and is still only a bit higher today. My winnings, £60 in today’s money, allegedly went to a charity. I never saw any evidence of that either.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She says we can leave in a safe and orderly manner through the Chequers plan or we can leave dangerously and chaotically if we don’t agree a departure deal with Europe.In truth, there are other choices. We could surrender less sovereignty by proposing a conventional trade agreement, as Davis suggested in a white paper that was rejected by the PM.But his proposal was never published, and Davis is now on the backbenches.We could join the European Economic Area, like Norway, leaving us subject to European laws, including free movement, and paying into the Brussels budget.Advocates, including the Tory MP Nick Boles, say this would buy us time to sort out our long-term relationship with Europe, but we would risk getting stuck half-in, half-out of the EU for years.Whatever the merits of his case, however, Boles is a backbench MP who cannot impose policy on the Government.Because Theresa May is the Prime Minister, Chequers is the only policy on the table. But Chequers, as bad as it already is, will not be the final deal.Downing Street insiders insist it is “obtainable” without further compromises, while the PM says she will not accept compromises “that are not in our national interest”. But this is the problem: There will be further compromises, which come on top of an already flawed proposal.And this is hardly a surprise, because Chequers is unacceptable to the Europeans.The EU’s number one rule is that the “four freedoms” of its single market — in goods, services, people and capital — cannot be divided.And yet Chequers — as unacceptable as it is to British Eurosceptics — seeks to divide these four freedoms.Britain is effectively asking to stay in the single market for trade in goods but not in services, people and capital.If we want what we have proposed for goods, the Europeans will say we must accept the other obligations.As part of an agreement about services, they will insist on Britain accepting more EU laws and a greater role for the European Court.They are likely to demand financial contributions and access to British waters for their fishing industry.And while they might not call it free movement, they will insist on concessions that grant Europeans almost automatic access to the British labour market.This prediction is not plucked out of thin air. It is based on decades of EU policymaking, and everything European leaders and their negotiators have said since the referendum.It is reflected in the EU’s own negotiating guidelines, issued to the European Commission by the Council of Ministers.And it is why, in her Lancaster House speech last year, Theresa May ruled out single market membership.Having to accept its obligations, she said, “would to all intents and purposes mean not leaving the EU at all”.And yet this is the danger we now face. According to several Government sources, the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, is “itching” to make a “generous offer” on immigration. Some believe he wants to retain free movement rules, because he says we cannot get a good trade deal unless we do so.Theresa May, on the other hand, is adamant that free movement must end.But whether or not we are legally part of EU free movement rules, the question is whether her deal will regain full control of immigration to Britain. And what we know already is alarming.There is nothing wrong with allowing tourists to come here easily, students to attend British universities and business people to travel without bureaucracy.Nor is there a problem with firms moving their workers across borders quickly and easily to provide services.And it makes sense to give Europeans preferential access to Britain compared to people from further away.But few ministers care about reducing immigration, and the Chequers white paper is remarkably open about the options. It proposes, for example, a “youth mobility scheme” that would give young Europeans the right to live and work in Britain for fixed periods.Without strict limits, this alone could destroy meaningful immigration control, because most people who want to migrate are young.Around 64 per cent of EU migrants to Britain are under 30, while 86 per cent are younger than 40.The white paper suggests “other specific mobility areas”, without giving further details. It proposes “social security coordination” which might allow migrants to claim benefits for children living back home in countries like Poland.And it says nothing about our ability to deport or bar European criminals from Britain.Most worryingly, there is no proposal for a visa system for European workers.Without that, unskilled and low-skilled immigration will continue without limit.It does not need to be like this.We are discussing these unacceptable compromises because Chequers proposes partial membership of the EU’s single market.If we want to escape Europe’s laws, its court and its demands for our money — and if we want to control immigration — the Government needs to revive its plans for a free trade agreement, and it needs to do so urgently.Unless it does, Brexit will not mean Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I don’t remember any takeaway dinners.”But new footage published by The Sun today shows him declaring the meal was “very nice of them and a quite a nice gesture”.He added “certainly the food was more edible than you get in some other places, it was really good”.Hamas bosses are on UK sanctions lists and a proscribed as a terror group by the US and EU.GOT a story?

If she hardens it for Brexiteers, it’s even less likely to fly.Whatever Downing Street says, it’s not a plan if it has no possibility of proceeding. And if it’s a non-starter, isn’t it time to accept it and focus on a more basic free trade deal?

Most of my family have.His dad was first sent away when James was nine, and his cousin, who is the same age as him, has recently been handed a lengthy prison sentence for stabbing someone.And having been arrested five times already - all for small things - James fears that it wont be long until he ends up joining his dad.That is, unless he can get a job and break the cycle... but, as many of James peers are finding out, Redcar isnt bursting with the same opportunities it once had.The once-thriving port town is now short of work following the closing of the Teesside steelworks in 2015.Over 3,000 jobs vanished - and repercussions from the loss of income are being felt throughout the town.For 16-year-old Kaitlyn, the upcoming school prom is a far more immediate concern than finding work.However, prom is an expensive business, and her mum, Kat, has found it so hard to find a full-time job in the town that she currently holds down three different part-time positions.The relentless combination of energy bills, council tax, and food costs - plus the prospect of Kaitlyn going to university in the not-too-distant future - mean she can sometimes end up working 75-hour weeks just to make ends meet.Then, a couple of years ago, after splitting from Kaitlyns dad, the pressures became too much for Kat to bear.I was in this dark place on the weekends when Kaitlyn was out with her dad, she says on BBC2s The Mighty Redcar.I went out with my friends and started drinking loads. She even had to dress me one day, and I just thought: thats it.Kat found herself relying on a food bank to survive, and was spurred on to throw herself into work.With Kaitlyns prom looming, Kat, who works as a cook and a carer, has been putting away £10 a week for the whole year, just to spend on the dress.It means that when the end of term comes around, she can afford to splash out on a stunning £600 gown for her daughter, but the biggest financial challenge is yet to come.Drama-loving Kaitlyn is currently studying musical theatre at a college in Middlesbrough, and she is already making a name for herself as an up-and-coming performer.Although Kat is concerned about the £9,000-a-year fees, Kaitlyn hopes that she can eventually go to uni in Manchester, Liverpool, or at RADA - the prestigious acting academy in London.Despite Redcar always being my home there are just more opportunities in the big cities, Kaitlyn tells Sun Online.I never faced any problems growing up in Redcar. I had everything I needed.I know I’ll be happy as soon as I go but I’ll miss my mum, dad and all my family.Kat and Kaitlyns story is fairly typical for Redcar - a town where no matter where you go, you never seem able to escape the shadow cast by the abandoned metalworks.The North Yorkshire coastal town used to be a manufacturing hub and a busting holiday destination, with a sprawling beachfront and a lively fishing industry to boot.Its enormous steelworks were staffed by hard-working local people, and world-renowned steel made in Redcar was used to build the iconic bridges over the river Tyne and Sydney Harbour.But as the 2010s approached, global steel prices slumped, production left the UK, and in 2015 the towns furnaces were shut down forever - sending over 3,000 jobs up in smoke.Long before then, cheap overseas holidays had stunted the towns tourism industry, and declines in the fishing industry gutted the areas other big profession.But although everyone always talks about the steel leaving the town, its clear that the locals still have it in spades.People are also quick to look out for each other, and four volunteer-run food banks have recently opened in Redcar to combat the job losses from the collapse of the steel industry.Weve only got one Costa coffee though, says the shows narrator, local student Madison Cooper. I guess that says a lot.Kat says its the people of Redcar who make the town a great place to live.Were very proud to be from Redcar, she tells Sun Online.Some people get down, and theres some negativity, but there are always people there to support and help each other. That makes Redcar. Theres a community feel to the place.Im proud as punch of my daughter and Im proud as punch of Redcar.In James case, theres been no shortage of help in his job search. Hes being personally mentored by council worker Lynn and local businessman Ray.Thanks to Rays efforts, James lands a weeks trial at a gardening firm on the first episode of the show.Hes grateful for the cash, but hes earning just £20 a day. Just a few years ago, manual workers in Redcars steelworks could have expected a comfortable salary of over £30,000 a year.I want a job, says an exasperated James. I want a regular income. I want a career and a quiet life.Redcars population is falling by the year as people leave to look for better jobs but, for the 35,000 people who are left behind, it can feel like theyve been, well... left behind.Now, documentary series The Mighty Redcar has captured the reality of growing up in a proud British town ravaged by job losses, economic pressures and globalisation.Billed as a real-life soap, the show follows young people from the town over the course of a year as they chase their dreams of making it big - or at least carving out a living for themselves and their families.But with unemployment at 8.3 per cent , Redcar isnt the easiest place to find a job, let alone a career.The steel, tourism and fishing jobs may be all gone forever, but the people of Redcar do still have their work ethic and optimism to fall back on.One of the most determined characters in the whole town is 23-year-old Dylan, an aspiring musician who moved to Redcar when he was 15.In and out of the foster system for his whole life, he left his biological family as a teenager to live with his childhood foster mum, Wendy, who chose to live in Redcar because she wanted to be by the sea.When I came to school here I was the only black kid, Dylan says. You dont get many big black guys with afros in Redcar.Choosing to leave his family behind was tough, but Dylan said he had to leave his old home for the sake of his safety.To me, Redcar is everything, he says. It became my Mecca - a safe place where I can live my life.Im unbelievably lucky to not be on drugs, in jail or dead.The dream is to make a living and never have to work in a bar or call centre again.For a while, Dylan worked as a bartender in a Wetherspoons, but his real passion has always been for hip-hop music.Every night after work, he would spend hours locked away in his bedroom, writing and recording songs, which he performed at weekend gigs in nearby pubs and clubs.His hope was always that he could make it big and take his 15-year-old brother out of foster care and bring him to Redcar to live with him.Then, at the end of the documentary, Dylan is invited to the Universal Music HQ in London.After being scouted at a gig, producers have spotted his talent and want to offer him a record deal - which should pay for a flat he can rent with his brother.Many of his peers may still be struggling to find meaningful work, but Dylans story is proof that theres always hope - and it goes to show that the mettle never really left the Mighty Redcar.The Mighty Redcar airs on Thursday at 9pm on BBC2. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Our soldiers are no longer fighting for Queen and Country but under a foreign military command.Our ancestors, the heroes of The Armada, Waterloo, Trafalgar, Passchendaele, El-Alamein, and others too numerous to mention, did not fight so that their descendants could serve under the flag of a foreign power.The sooner we are out of the EU, the sooner we will be able to rebuild our military into a force which serves the interests of our nation first and foremost.Meanwhile British men and women should vote with their feet and not join the armed forces.Defence sources ridiculed Ukips claim - pointing out that Britain has been part of the EU-led force in Bosnia for 14 years.They also said UK troops routinely carry the flag of multi-national organisations such as Nato or the UN on their uniform.A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said: “It is untrue to suggest this is the first time our soldiers have worn EU badges, just as it is untrue to say they don’t wear the Union Flag.They have worn both since the mission in Bosnia And Herzegovina began in 2004, much like UN and Nato operations where the respective badges are on uniforms.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT0004309654041.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jeremy corbyn urged to rule out a second brexit vote for good after his big union backer calls for a second eu referendum","story":"The GMB, who have handed over hundreds of thousands of pounds to the Labour leader and his party in the past few years, say people deserve a final say on the deal Theresa May brings back from Brussels.In a statement today they claim that promises made during the campaign in 2016 are “not the reality we are facing”.But the Tories are urging Mr Corbyn to “stand up to his union paymasters” and remain firm in his commitment to honour the original decision of the electorate.The GMB union said it had consulted thousands of its 620,000 members, and there was widespread support for holding another ballot once the negotiations are complete.Its general secretary Tim Roache said: Sitting on the sidelines watching the mess this Government is making of Brexit is infuriating, because there is so much at stake.GMB respects the result of the referendum, but how we leave the EU is as important as the decision to leave in the first place.“Thats why today, GMB is calling for a public vote on the final deal.As trade unionists, when we negotiate a pay deal with an employer, we go back to our members and ask them if theyre happy with it.

At the moment I dont have the chronology so I dont know.I accept the date on it is the second. As I understand it thats the date it was printed. Not the date it was served.Mr Freeman added: What Im saying is the notice is defective because it arrived out of time.The court was told a stamp to indicate receipt of the letter was dated February 7.Prosecutor Simon Maughan said: Im accepting of the letter, Im accepting of the date on the letter, Im accepting that the seventh has been stamped on the letter.There can be no issue with the date on the letter.Beckham, of Holland Park, West London, allegedly broke the limit while driving on the A40 flyover in Paddington, Central London.Referring to the punishment if Beckham is found guilty, District Judge Barbara Barnes said: I think were in unlimited fines territory.She added: Service of the intended prosecution should be received within 14 days. The defence say it was outside 14 days.Asked whether Beckham would be present at the trial, Mr Freeman said: I dont anticipate it.He added: If the case goes against him and if the result is disqualification then I will make it absolutely clear.A trial date has been fixed for September 27.Most people who admit doing 59mph in a 40 zone take what’s coming. They can’t afford fancy lawyers infamous for getting celebs off on technicalities.But just because you can doesn’t mean you should.No one — not the punters, nor the honours committee — will be patting Becks on the back if he effectively spends his way out of a conviction.

But one of ­Parliament’s biggest secrets is that most of the men and women in it are actually pretty decent.What rightly makes voters angry with Parliament is that it doesn’t look like the country it represents, and approves policies that often make the world a worse place. In the current Parliament, 29 per cent of UK-educated MPs went to private schools.This is a record low, but it is out of step with the public, which is around seven per cent privately educated. Only 32 per cent of MPs are women, and 7.8 per cent are from ethnic minorities, while roughly 14 per cent of the general population is black or minority ethnic.The majority of MPs were already working in politics before being elected or held well-paid jobs as lawyers.In my new book, Why We Get The Wrong Politicians, I’ve discovered one of the main reasons why only well-off people become MPs. It’s because they have to spend tens of thousands of pounds of their own money on standing for Parliament.I asked 532 candidates who stood in the 2015 election how much it had cost them, and was shocked by the answers. The average cost for all candidates, whether they were standing in a seat that they’d certainly win, one where they might win or a no-hope constituency, was £11,118.For those who had to fight in marginal seats, the costs were even higher. Conservatives who won their seats spent £121,467. Their colleagues who failed to win still lost an average of £18,701.Labour was no better. If you won your seat, you lost around £19,022, but those who failed to get elected spent even more — £35,843.Some spent money they had saved to buy a home. Others maxed out their credit cards and are still paying off the debts today. This money didn’t go on leaflets or any of the other official campaign spending that is tightly regulated.Instead, it was working for free for up to two years, travelling around and sometimes even moving to the constituency, and attending local events. One broke candidate needed help from members of her party to pay her mortgage. She didn’t even win her seat.Another ex-candidate was delighted when he landed a new job and could afford to buy a house — before he realised he’d spent the deposit on campaigning, ironically for the “party of home ownership”.This ludicrous cost excludes so many people who would make much better MPs than the ones we currently have. MPs do not really do the job they’ve been elected to perform, anyway.The pressure is for them to do as their whips tell them, rather than to look at the legislation going through the House of Commons. Most vote on bills without realising what they might entail.Even when they are appointed to the bill committees scrutinising every line of a law, MPs in the governing party are told to sit quiet and vote with the Government every time. Many write their Christmas cards in these committees.From the “bedroom tax” to interventions in Iraq and Libya, MPs have failed to notice problems before they turn into real crises.It doesn’t have to be like this. The parties could pay their candidates to stand. The Conservatives have already announced a modest bursary fund, and Labour has toyed with the idea too. Other groups should stump up some funding as well.The Women’s Equality Party, for instance, is stunningly well-funded but has little chance of getting an MP elected. It would be much better to use that money to get more women MPs in all the political parties. Currently MPs don’t have to take any responsibility for approving dud policies.My book suggests a new stage for legislation, called “Public Payback Panels” where people directly affected by a government policy could ask the minister and members of the bill committee who approved it to explain why they voted the way they did.This would encourage politicians to take their job seriously and really look at the laws they were approving.If this doesn’t change, MPs will still have the most expensive job interview on Earth — and will then be told when they arrive in Parliament not to do their job.

In Scotland, tenants already enjoy the right to stay in their home for as long as they like.Tory MPs believe the policy has massive political importance and could even keep the Conservative government in power at the next election.It would help them win back tens of thousands of renters who defected to Labour in 2017.Research has revealed the Tories lost almost a third - 29 per cent – of all renters who voted for them in 2015 during last year’s nationwide poll, with three-quarters of them switching to Labour.Backbenchers insisted mandatory three year tenancies must not be scrapped.Backbench Tory MP Will Quince said: “Insecure tenancies are a leading cause of homelessness, as well as causing anxiety for parents worried about their children’s schooling arrangements.“Only by legislating can we ensure that landlords offer households the longer tenancies they want and give families the stability they deserve.”Homeless charity Shelter also back the policy. Its CEO Polly Neate said: “As it stands, families across the country have to put up with blink-and-you-miss-it six-month contracts.“This is nowhere near enough time to put kids through school and in the worst cases leaves renters looking over their shoulder worrying about the terrifying threat of homelessness.“We need the government to fix this mess by standing up for renters and giving them a legal right to stay in their home for longer - anything short of this will be a complete and utter waste of time.”Nearly five million rent privately — 20 per cent of households.The figure is up 74 per cent in the past decade, with 46 per cent of 25 to 34-year-olds now living in private rentals as house prices rocket.Initial government proposals for the ground breaking policy were made in June, and are currently being consulted on for a decision in time for Tory conference.And it’s not just a sensible thing to do. It’s critical to win back Millennial votes.But Treasury officials fear it will deter property investors. Are they mad?Whose side does the Government want to be on?

As the volume of water decreased, the concentration of salt increased, poisoning everything in the sea.The Aral Sea now occupies 10 per cent of the area it did half a century ago. Agriculture has continued to drain it.Four rusting ships on the dry bed of the sea were pictured by the QuickBird earth observation satellite.An electronic music festival next Friday will be held in Uzbekistan to draw attention to the environmental disaster that caused the waters to recede.The aim of the Stihia  festival is to “raise global awareness about the desiccation of the Aral Sea and encourage its revitalisation and a more responsible and rational approach to using water in the region”.Artists from Russia, Georgia and Uzbekistan will perform near Moynaq, the once bustling post.“Hypnotic and harmonic sounds will be directed towards the lost sea, with the DJs echoing the rainmakers who were once part of the region’s nomadic tribes,” the organisers said.In Kazakhstan there has been limited success in rejuvenating an area sometimes called the small or North Aral Sea, with the water depth reaching 100ft in some places.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Good. Then let’s proceed, in an open-minded fashion, with X Factor, the focus group years, where there are some new faces on the panel.We’ve got Louis “lad” Tomlinson, who brings the experience of taking part in the show.Robbie Williams, who brings the ­experience of over 20 years in the music industry.And Ayda, who brings the ­experience of playing Angela Moroni in Days Of Our Lives.Ironically, though, the newest face of all probably belongs to Simon Cowell, whose head now requires constant fanning and is so curiously swollen they could shove it on a plinth in the FA Museum above a plaque that reads: “1923 Cup Final ­football.”What caused it to balloon, I cannot say for sure, but if it was done to divert attention from the other end of the judging panel, he’s seriously underestimated the attention-seeking and self-absorption of Robbie Williams, which is total.A factor not helped by the adoring presence of Ayda, whose public displays of affection for “Rob” could quickly become the X Factor’s most nauseating ever detail.Enormous as it is, there’s not much Simon’s head can do about the singing either.The problem here, of course, is that almost everyone who wants to audition for a karaoke show has now auditioned, or sung professionally.So we were swamped with re-treads on this weekend’s double-header.Among them were: Danny Tetley, who appeared on Pop Idol, Caribbean ­talent show ­veteran Olatunji Yearwood, who’s already got a record deal, Livin’ Joy’s Janice “Dreamer” Robinson, and Brendan ­Murray from Hometown, a Sony act who were managed by Louis Walsh. Not that anyone was admitting as much.If there was any joy and spontaneity to proceedings, though, it was generally ­provided by those random whack-nut contestants who don’t appear on Simon’s approved list.Acts like Livia and the Elementals, Aaron Denham, who looked like he’d absconded from Guantanamo Bay, and Andy Hofton, who performed a song called Castle Of Love that’s been 20 years in gestation and, to no tune at all, went like this.“All my life, I’ve been building a castle of love. That lifts me to your heart.“Here I am, I’ve built my castle of . . .”“Andy! ANDY!” Simon’s hand of objection went up. He was then asked if he had a second song. Angels kicked in and I think you know what happened next.If someone on the judging panel had their wits about them, obviously, they’d have waited for Andy and Robbie to finish their duet then said: “Actually, let’s try Castle Of Love again.”No chance of that, though, as Cowell set his stall out, day one, when he told Danny Tetley: “The music business should be more open-minded.”The irony of a show that’s spent 14 series steering viewers towards its preferred winner now demanding open-mindedness won’t be lost on anyone, but I think it’s just ­cosmetic.The sort of “let’s-pretend we’re-nice” ­cobblers political parties trot out when they’re in as much trouble as this show.It won’t work, though. ’Cos there were so many things the X Factor urgently needed to ditch — sob stories, manipulation, product-placement, deception, scripted “spontaneity” — yet it sounds like the only element it’s going to discard is the brutal and funny honesty which made it stand out from the competition.Show’s over, folks.Paul Merson: “The one person I feel sorry for is the Newcastle fans.”And Tony Cottee: “Hemed’s had two efforts, Freeman’s had two efforts and all three have been saved.”CELEBRITY Big Brother viewers finally got to see last week why the show paid £75,000 to book actress Roxanne Pallett, whose relationship with the truth could, at best, be described as flexible.Unwitting victim was Corrie’s Ryan Thomas, who engaged her with a spot of the house craze for shadow boxing on Thursday’s show, which everyone could see was entirely playful.Having initially laughed it off, though, Roxanne suddenly decided it was “an assault” and he was “a woman beater”, who had to be removed.It made a mockery of the real thing, obviously, and would have ruined Ryan’s life if there’d been a hint of doubt about the video footage.In the kangaroo court atmosphere of the #MeToo movement, however, and with a £75,000 investment to protect, Channel 5 had to indulge her fantasies and give Ryan an official warning for his “behaviour”.She’s since fled the house, of course, without her fee, and apologised.If anyone’s missing Roxanne’s histrionics, though, there’ll soon be another chance to see the dingbat lose her s**t on Celebrity Island With Bear Grylls, where her stay comes to a tearful climax over the camp fire which, apparently, sparks fevered memories of a teenage house inferno that could’ve killed her entire family. But didn’t.It’s a pattern likely to continue as well.Given the fact then that reality television clearly causes Roxanne Pallett such huge emotional distress and painful memory spasms, it’s probably best if neither she nor the toxic show that booked her ever troubles us again.BBC2’s Eight Go Rallying, in ­CambodiaBBC1’s Bodyguard is a curse, a liability, a Jonah. Norman bloody Wisdom in a bullet-proof vest.He sits on a train, ­suicide bombers appear in the next carriage.He gets in a car with the Home Secretary, a sniper’s killed Terry the driver.He turns up to see her speak? KABOOM! The front three rows of the ­theatre suddenly explode.Where Sergeant David Budd goes, trouble ­immediately follows.And still no one at MI5 or Scotland Yard has made the connection.Mind you, it took the best brains at the Met several days to work out the sniper, who had a shot on him like Yul Brynner in The Magnificent Seven, “might be ex-Forces”.Yeah, well, it’s not a bad theory, I suppose, though you couldn’t rule out the possibility they’ll haul in David Blunkett for questioning next week, as this lot all seem to have trained with Walford CID, the world’s stupidest police force.It’s just one of several reasons why I’m still not buying into Bodyguard.The others being, its idiotic levels of political correctness, the stilted performance of Richard Madden as Budd, and his entirelyunbelievable relationship with Keeley Hawes’ Julia Montague.Mind you, she did conjure up an even more far-fetched and disturbing possibility on Sunday night when she told him: “Sex with the Home Secretary, it’s a heinous crime.”Sex with the Shadow Home Secretary.

Voters who backed Leave were protesting as much about centralised power in Westminster as they were about Brussels bureaucracy, the Greater Manchester Mayor says. Now neglected regions must get more power to build their own future as the UK quits the EU next year. The Labour ex-cabinet minister will say: “The referendum result was as much an instruction for Westminster to review its relationship with the rest of England as it was for it to review its relationship with Brussels. “What found its voice was the deeply held sentiment that our over-centralised political system neglected some areas in favour of others.  “But that uncomfortable truth has been allowed to be overlooked in all the to-ing and fro-ing over Europe. To leave it unanswered is dangerous. “If the phrase ‘take back control’ is to mean anything, it must mean substantial devolution of power and resources out of Westminster.”  In the speech, backed by the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, he will call for “a big reset of our own political system” whatever the outcome of Brexit negotiations.   He will also signal support for delaying Brexit if no deal looks likely to be agreed before the March exit, as well as potentially backing a second referendum on the departure terms.

The party\u0027s ruling national executive committee added a statement allowing freedom of speech which some campaigners warned was a “get out of jail free card” for racists to wage abuse. Mr Corbyn wanted to add a statement that said it should not be regarded as anti-Semitic to describe Israel, its policies or the circumstances around its foundation as racist because of their discriminatory impact. The party instead added a a line which said the changes do not in any way undermine freedom of expression on Israel or the rights of Palestinians. But senior backbencher Dame Margaret Hodge, who is herself Jewish, said: “He should have simply adopted the full international definitions with absolutely no ifs and buts.  He\u0027s sullied it. I\u0027m saddened that it was sullied by this attempt that there is a get-out clause – the sullying that he was reluctant to go forward.” She had described the NEC\u0027s decision as: Two steps forward and one step back. Dame Margaret said Mr Corbyn had more to do to reassure the Jewish community.  He now has to own the problem, he has to act and he has to start rebuilding trust, she told Today. He is the leader of the Labour Party , the onus is really on him.  Dame Margaret said it appeared that Mr Corbyn had sought a get-out clause from the IHRA definition, adding: It demonstrates to me a reluctance on his part, rather than a very public and intense acceptance of the need to deal with the issue.\u0027  I would love it if he proved me wrong, but we have to see both in his actions and in the way he consults and engages with the Jewish community over the coming period whether or not we are on the right road back to rebuilding trust. Dame Margaret said it was outrageous that disciplinary action was being taken against fellow Labour MP Ian Austin for protesting about the party\u0027s handing of the anti-Semitism issue, while Mr Corbyn had taken no action against NEC member Pete Willsman over a vile rant which he had personally witnessed. Shadow Attorney General Baroness Shami Chakrabarti insisted: “There\u0027s no sullying.” Lady Chakrabarti told Today: There was no sullying. The words were not a caveat, were not a dilution the words are true, which is that accepting these examples, in my view, in no way negates reasonable free speech around these difficult issues around Israel and Palestine.  She went on: This is about reassuring people that you can be a critic of Israel without being anti-Semitic, you just need to conduct your debate in a certain way. She added: I say to Margaret and I say to Rabbi Sacks and I say to everybody who has been hurt by this, this is the time to come back into the room for discussion. We have accepted these examples. It took so long because of genuine anxieties - however misplaced - about free speech on one of the most intractable problems in the world. Come back into the room. I will open the door. I will put the kettle on. But come back into the room because it\u0027s time for reasonable debate. Former Labour leadership hopeful Andy Burnham told the BBC: What has to happen now is that Jeremy personally, and leading figures at the top of the party, have to work hard to rebuild trust with the Jewish community. There is a lot of damage that has been done here and the party needs to draw a line and begin that work in earnest. This evening Labour MPs will hold talks on anti-Semitism in their first meeting since MPs left Westminster for the summer. Labour MP John Mann, chairman of the all-party parliamentary group against anti-Semitism, said there would have been turmoil if Mr Corbyn\u0027s proposal had been accepted. He told The Times: What was he thinking of, after all we have gone through, to try and create another almighty row? Labour Friends of Israel  said it showed that Mr Corbyn was part of the problem, not the solution. Director Jennifer Gerber said: It is appalling that the Labour Party has once again ignored the Jewish community: that it should adopt the full IHRA definition without additions, omissions or caveats.  She added: A \u0027freedom of expression on Israel\u0027 clause is unnecessary and totally undermines the other examples the party has supposedly just adopted.  Labour Against Anti-Semitism said the move appears to be about protecting the freedom of racists to present vile views. A spokesman said: There can be no caveats, no conditions and no compromises with racism. We are disappointed by the decision of Labour\u0027s governing body, the NEC, to diminish the IHRA working definition of anti-Semitism via the attachment of a \u0027clarification\u0027 that risks giving racists in the party a get-out-of-jail card. The NEC has been told repeatedly that it needs to adopt the IHRA in full, without caveats or conditions, if it wants the Labour Party to begin the process of dealing with its anti-Semitism crisis. Jewish Leadership Council chief executive Simon Johnson said: It has now become absolutely clear that the leader of the party attempted shamefully to undermine the entire IHRA definition. The \u0027free speech caveat\u0027 drives a coach and horses through the IHRA definition. It will do nothing to stop anti-Semitism in the party. The Board of Deputies of British Jews welcomed the NEC\u0027s decision to adopt the full definition but expressed concern about the leader\u0027s proposal. The group tweeted that Mr Corbyn\u0027s statement was of great concern \u0026amp would undermine the spirit of the attempt to tackle antisemitism.  There need to be answers to the many questions it raises, the group said. MPs and peers will discuss the NEC\u0027s decision when they gather later for the first Parliamentary Labour Party meeting since the summer recess.

Westminster must ensure those powers are not kept far from the people, but given to local politicians. The essential principle of the Northern Powerhouse is creating a balanced economy, creating skilled job opportunities and stimulating growth. So many of our towns and cities are close enough to develop a true single market which can make a national difference. Our businesses, civic leaders and communities are coming together across traditional political lines, putting strong and persuasive cases to government for vital investment. Yet the risk is these compelling proposals - focusing on education, skills, transport and productivity, to name but a few - are falling on deaf ears.  I believe our leaders, including the Prime Minister and Chancellor, are broadly supportive of the Northern Powerhouse and see the clear, economic rationale behind it. But they and the rest of the Cabinet are using the paralysis of Brexit to sit on their hands. The endless wrangling of our exit from the EU is being used as an excuse for government to ignore other issues far more important to ordinary people. This is causing major issues for the Northern Powerhouse.

In fact the four friends who wore almost comic disguises of fake moustaches, beards and wigs were amateur criminals and this was their first heist. And they almost got away with it. New film American Animals tells the story of one of the most audacious heists in U.S. history when three well off friends Spencer Reinhard, Warren Lipka, Eric Borsuk and Chas Allen decided to try and steal some rare books from a college library.  Is American Animals a true story? Based on the story, the film includes interviews with the foursome who attempted the bizarre heist it stars Barry Keoghan, Evan Peters, Blake Jenner, Jared Abrahamson and Ann Dowd. Spencer Reinhard and Warren Lipka were best friends from the age of eight - the former a talented painter and his friend a popular athletic scholarship student. But once at college they drifted apart and Lipka ultimately dropped out and moved into a lucrative sideline selling fake IDs along with former football team mate Borsuk. But the pair fell out over money and without his friend\u0027s computer knowhow he recruited his old pal artist high-flier Reinhard to help. Several weeks before Reinhard was approached by Lipka about the fake-ID business, he had been on a freshman-orientation tour of Transy, including the library and its exceptional collection of rare books and manuscripts.  “They take you in the Special Collections and show you these books,” he would later tell Vanity Fair , including Transylvania University\u0027s prized Birds of America, by John James Audubon, a four-volume set of life-size engravings the pioneer wildlife artist completed in London in 1838.   The set was one of fewer than 200 produced. “I’d heard about them before, but I didn’t know anything about them. And the woman there says, ‘We had a set just like this that we sold four years ago for like 12 million.’ It could have been eight. I’m not sure, but it was a lot. It immediately had kind of sparked my imagination, like a fantasy.” Slowly a germ of an idea began to form. One day Reinhard and Lipka were sat in a car smoking weed when they started to discuss the idea of stealing the books. What followed was an extraordinary tale of amateur criminals. In between studying for exams Reinhard scoped out the library for security and found just a solitary librarian who required visitors to sign in and out. Meanwhile Lipka worked on the problem of what to do with the books once they got them. Eventually tracking down a underworld contact called Barry who gave them an email address in return for 500. The two friends created an email account and sent a message claiming to have unspecified books in their possession. You need to come to Amsterdam, came the reply. Travelling on a fake passport - again supplied by their underworld fixer - he met four men who although put off by his youth and angry he did not have the books with him told him crucial step of selling rare books: appraisal by a legitimate auction house.  After researching auction houses online, they singled out Christie’s in New York - because no one would go to Christie’s with stolen books to get them appraised. Who was in the crew? Back in the US it was apparent that they were going to need help so they racked their brains over who they could trust. Lipka\u0027s old fake ID pal Borsuk was soon co-opted over pitchers of beer and pizza. Then over the 2004 summer break from college they met Chas Allen - the fourth member of the gang - who was cutting lawns with Borsuk as a part time job. In the autumn Lipka, skint after dropping out of college and closing down his fake ID business, moved into an unfurnished basement and focused full-time on the heist plan. After initially laughing at the plan Allen apparently decided to join them. In between football practice, classes, painting, and studying, Reinhard drew detailed sketches of the inside of the Special Collections Library and the adjacent Rare Book Room, making several appointments with the Special Collections librarian, Betty Jean Gooch, to scout the premises. The others spent time in the library, too, taking notes on staff routines and movements and escape routes. The men climbed onto dorm roofs and staked out the library for hours at a time, marking down the comings and goings of teachers, students, and security personnel. They also searched the Internet, using such key terms as “auction house appraisals,” “stun guns,” and “Swiss bank accounts.”  For inspiration, they watched heist films like Ocean’s 11 and Snatch.   What was their plan? Their plan included three stages. The first when disguised as old men they would arrive at the library, second when they carried out the robbery using a stun gun on the librarian, and third to getaway and take the books for appraisal before their theft is entered on a national database. Lifting a scene straight from the film Reservoir Dogs, they assigned code names based on colour: Mr. Green , Mr. Yellow , and Mr. Black  and Mr Pink . Lipka made an appraisal appointment at Christie’s in New York for Walter Beckman, a pseudonym inspired by the soccer star David Beckham. However, he made a fatal error and used the same email address for the Christie\u0027s appointment as he did to view the books at the library. The gang ordered stun guns online as well as cable ties, tape and a selection of disguises. Their first attempt at the theft was aborted after the stun guns did not arrive, they could not find a space near the library to park and their makeshift disguises drew strange looks. They decided to try again the next day - December 17 - and this time the robbery almost went to plan. Inside the library rare books section two of the gang zapped the librarian with a stun pen, tied her up and blindfolded her. They piled up the books on a bed sheet but they were heavier than they thought and they had to stuff some on backpacks and carried a large volume between them. However, they couldn\u0027t find the fire escape they planned to use and were forced to make a run for it after another librarian found her colleague tied up and raised the alarm. Lipka and Borsuk got out believing that they had escaped with next to nothing.   In fact, wedged in their backpacks was nearly three-quarters of a million dollars’ worth of books and manuscripts: an 1859 first edition of Charles Darwin’s On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection , an illuminated manuscript from 1425 , a set of the two-volume 15th-century horticultural masterpiece entitled Hortus Sanitatis , 20 original Audubon pencil drawings , and Audubon’s A Synopsis of the Birds of North America .  It seemed they had got away with it as there were no good descriptions of them and no one had their number plate. That weekend they drove to New York to get the books appraised however it did not go to plan. The junior member of staff they saw was suspicious of their youth and declined to help but took Reinhard\u0027s mobile phone number. Not getting the appraisal was a big blow and they returned home to stew on what to do next. How were they caught? Over the next few weeks the FBI investigation was painfully slow and it was not until January when they got computer information revealing the email address used to book the library visit had been used to email Christie\u0027s. There the police got CCTV footage of Reinhard and Lipka and traced the phone to the former\u0027s parents house. The FBI followed the boys and soon uncovered their co-conspirators.  On February 11, 2005, a SWAT raided the house where they were living and found the boys, the books and a five-page typed plan for the heist, an accounting book, wigs, instructions for opening a Swiss bank account, and stun guns, which had apparently arrived after the robbery. The men were given identical seven year sentences. Talking to Vanity Fair from jail Borsuk said: “We did the robbery as a way to escape.  “I think we all knew that we wanted something different, and we had to break away from where we were living. If we got away with it, we’d be in Europe living this crazy life thinking we were Ocean’s 11 types. If not, we were going to get caught and it was going to be a crazy story.”  "},{"url":null,"title":"holiday park bosss joke reply","story":"NewsHoliday park boss\u0027s \u0027joke\u0027 reply to \u0027concentration camp\u0027 jibe branded \u0027offensive and demeaning\u0027The comments have upset a leading Jewish academic but others say critics have lost their sense of humourShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsBySarah Hodgson23:27, 4 SEP 2018NewsPlassey Holiday Village in Eyton, Wrexham\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA holiday park owner\u0027s response to a TripAdvisor review calling his establishment a \u0027concentration camp\u0027 has been branded \u0027offensive and demeaning\u0027. Responding to a negative review of the Plassey Holiday Village in Eyton near Wrexham, owner John Brookshaw replied in German, signing off as SS Camp Commandant of Plassey.  After his reply, Mr Brookshaw has found himself at the centre of a political correctness storm with his post dividing opinion, the Daily Post reports.  His comments have upset one leading Jewish academic, while others have leapt to his defence, saying those who criticise him have lost their sense of humour. Mr Brookshaw insists his remarks were intended to be lighthearted.  The TripAdvisor reviewer, from Lichfield, left the negative post under the name “but2n2018” and headlined it: I though concentration camps were a thing of the past but obviusly not! They said: “It\u0027s a shame because the park itself is okay but the staff are rude and the owner is the rudest man I have ever encountered . My kids were constantly watched and the warden shouted at my daughter and made her cry and when I complained I was introduced to the owner who was equally as rude and I am guessing he trains his staff !!!!! Secondly lack of privacy why did I feel like I was constantly being watched by a warden looking into my caravan. If you are looking for a good fun holiday don’t go here.” Mr Brookshaw replied in German, signing off as SS Camp Commandant of Plassey. Translated, it read: “I am very sad that you do not enjoy my concentration camp, but assure it is one of the best in North Wales.  My camp commandants did not want to make you cry much, but it’s inevitable with the hard work, you’re locked up for hours, and the constant patrol of machine guns armed guards with bad dogs .  “I am disappointed that I did not meet you myself, but I assure you that you would not have been shot, as I am a very nice commander, better than the Gestapo commander of North Wales, who can be quite strict! Kind regards, John Brookshaw SS Camp Commandant of the Plassey.”  However, Professor Nathan Abrams, an academic at Bangor University who co-convenes the British Jewish Contemporary Cultures Network, described the post as insensitive given the current climate around anti-Semitism. He said: “It is offensive and demeaning from a Jewish perspective and is insulting to the victims and the seriousness of the events that took place. “It is a silly comment by the poster and it is a silly reply which is trying to be funny – although the original post is by far no means as bad, for him to reply like this is just stupid and offensive.  “I think with the Holocaust in particular and bearing in mind the ongoing row of anti-Semitism in the Labour party it’s all down to the language that is used and you have to be sensitive.  “This is an example of the misuse and abuse of language that upsets people. Speaking to the Daily Post Wales, Mr Brookshaw said: I have not meant to offend anyone and it should be taken as it was written – in a light-hearted manner. Both my parents and grandparents were involved in the war – I did not mean to cause any offence. “Our park clearly is not a concentration camp – it is one of the best in North Wales – that is why I am so disheartened.

The youngster has Spina Bifida and is paralysed from the chest down. She spent her early years in hospital and has had brain surgery seven times as well as around 40 operations. During the event the brave little girl had the opportunity to speak to Harry and Meghan, who she gave a bouquet of white blooms. For latest updates on the awards: Follow the live blog here.

She was later pictured clutching the flower close to her chest. Sharon Booth, 47, who lives with her daughter Matilda in West Yorkshire, said after the royal encounter: Matilda chose the flowers, she was shell-shocked to be given the rose, she said she\u0027s going to put it in her memory box. Not to be left out, Harry made a pinky pledge with the youngster during a reception before the awards ceremony began, hooking his little finger around the girl\u0027s matching digit. Mrs Booth said the royal urged her daughter to never stop smiling as you\u0027ve got a beautiful smile.  The youngster is this year’s Inspirational Child 4-6 years winner, and wants to be a nurse when she grows up. Matilda has a “great zest for life” and impresses all she meets with her great courage, strength and determination, the charity said.

Rajani Mohanial carried out the offences at a place of worship in Leicester, and at his home, between 2008 and 2013. His victims, both female, were teenagers when the abuse began, the Leicestershire Live reports. Mohanial appeared at Leicester Crown Court today to plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault on a female.  He pleaded guilty to two further counts of causing a female aged 13 or over to engage in indecent activity.  Mohanial, of Silverdale Drive, Thurmaston, had been due to go on trial yesterday, but he returned to the court today to enter guilty pleas. He is due to be sentenced on Friday, September 14. In the interim the judge ordered that Mohanial be placed on the sex offenders register for the rest of his life.  Leicestershire Police said in a statement this afternoon: “The court heard how Mohanial claimed he was a disciple of a guru in India and, following the leader’s death, he was given authority to continue with the teachings.  “The victims in this case attended prayers at a place of worship in the Rushey Mead area of Leicester and at the defendant’s home address, where they were subjected to sexual assaults between 2008 and 2013.” Detective Constable Shaheen Hovell, who led the investigation, said: “Mohanial abused his position of trust within the local community and had no regard for the effect his crimes would have on the victims, one of whom was just a teenager when the offences began.

Marcus, 38, and Zarrah Hayles, 34, were travelling home from their honeymoon in Cuba when trouble erupted mid-air.  The devastated couple told Nottingham Post they had not been offered any food or drink two hours into the journey.   And when the food did arrive, they said it was the combined main meal and snack, which was due later on in the flight .  Mr Hayles complained about the service and admitted he swore by saying what the f***, but says the comment was not aimed at the flight attendant.  But a member of the cabin crew told the delivery driver swearing was not tolerated and he could face arrest. Police entered the aircraft on arrival at Manchester Airport on Thursday August 30 and escorted the couple off the plane. Mrs Hayles, a Post Office worker, said: Two officers said \u0027can you please come with us?\u0027 and escorted us off the flight in front of everyone. I have never been so humiliated. I have never been in a situation like this before.  The reason they were called was \u0027disruptive and abusive behaviour\u0027. I felt victimised. It was the last day of the honeymoon. We were treated like criminals just because of an opinion on how the food was served. She added cops let the couple, from Sherwood, Nottingham, go once hearing their side of the story and later on that evening they received a phone call saying the matter had been dropped. Mr Hayles added: I felt demoralised over being treated the way I was just for having an opinion on the service I paid for. I did not threaten anyone or go over the top.

And they warn the drastic move could severely jeopardise the education of tens of thousands of children unless Theresa May ends her crippling austerity. Many have been left with no choice but to bring in a 4.5-day week for kids as they cannot staff classrooms properly. The measures come as a Mirror \u0026shyinvestigation found schools are so strapped for cash many special needs pupils are not getting support as heads have had to axe teaching assistants, leading to fears of behavioural problems. That is coupled with a lack of basic \u0026shyequipment, growing class sizes, no cash to repair leaky buildings, staff shortages and cancelled school trips.  At least 24 schools across the land, including 14 in Birmingham alone, have ditched lessons on Friday afternoons. And more than 200 other heads have warned they are considering doing the same. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Union of \u0026shyHeadteachers, said: “The idea that some schools have moved to a 4.5 day week and that others are considering the same option ought to be ringing serious alarm bells with the Government. “School budgets are at breaking point. School leaders have made all the obvious savings, now they are faced with having to make major changes to the way they provide education.” Kevin Courtney, joint general \u0026shysecretary of the National Education Union, added: “Unless this is addressed a dire situation will only get worse. Children and young people deserve better than this bargain basement version of an education system.” Sending pupils home at lunchtime on Fridays means heads can employ fewer assistants to provide cover for teachers who are out of the classroom doing vital preparation work for other lessons. Many heads, with some begging parents to provide cash for basic \u0026shyequipment such as exercise books and pens, have told how their schools will start the new term in debt. They expect the deficit to rise as their wage bills go up annually through statutory pay rises while income is static.

Since its founding in Manchester in 1868, the Trades Union Congress has backed workers and fought attempts to undermine their rights and pay. Today it represents five million people. This week the Mirror looks back at some critical points in its remarkable history. Hope Street in Liverpool has history seeping from every pore. Towering over its south end is the world’s fifth largest cathedral, Giles Gilbert Scott’s Anglican masterpiece, while at its north end, built on the site of a poor house, is the largest Catholic cathedral in England. In between, you’ll find the Medical Institution, where slavery abolitionist William Roscoe was born, and The Everyman Theatre, cradle of world-class writers Willy Russell and Alan Bleasdale. Then there’s the Philharmonic Hall, bearing a plaque to its musicians, who played on as the Titanic sank, and the art school where John Lennon met Stuart Sutcliffe, which is next to The Institute School where Paul McCartney met George Harrison. But nothing typifies the radical, ground-breaking spirit of this extraordinary street more than an ordinary three-storied building called The Casa.  In 1998, the semi-derelict shell, once a drinking den called The Casablanca, was bought by sacked dockers who had lost jobs that had been in some families for generations, after one of the longest disputes in UK history. Sacked for refusing to cross a picket line – a principle that resides deep in Scouse DNA, and one they thought worth fighting for to the bitter end. Sadly, not every-one, including the Transport \u0026amp General Workers’ Union leaders, and later the New Labour government, shared the stomach for the fight. Hardly anyone but the dockers themselves thought they would win and, like most landmark disputes of the last century – General Strike, the Miners’ Strike – ultimately they lost.  But those dockers never gave up the hope or the fight. And what emerged from that loss, in the form of that three-storey Hope Street building, is a testament to defiance, enterprise and solidarity. They simply turned defeat on its head by building a social justice hub which became a monument to their principles. The 850-day dispute started in September 1995 when Bootle-based docks firm Torside sacked 80 workers for refusing to accept the imposition of what we now call zero-hours contracts. Those dockers – holding a banner saying “Save The 80: Say No To Casuals” – handed leaflets to workers arriving at Seaforth container terminal and 329 workers employed by the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company refused to cross their picket line. Despite being described by Lloyd’s List as “the most productive workforce in Europe” they were all immediately sacked. The MDHC said: “The striking men are in breach of their contracts and we have therefore terminated them.”  The dockers, well used to scraps with management, believed it would quickly be resolved, but they miscalculated. It began to look like a carefully-laid trap to smash the unions’ influence on the docks and employ cheaper, casualised labour. And it worked. The dockers had not held a ballot, so the strike was declared unofficial by their own union, the T\u0026ampGWU. New Labour made it clear if they were elected they would not reverse any of the Tories’ anti-trade union legislation. In theory, the dockers were on their own. But not in practice. The support for their 28-month battle to be re- instated was incredible – and global. On one International Solidarity Day, workers in 52 countries came out on strike to back them.  American longshoremen and Australian wharfies brought their nations’ ports to a halt. Later, every Japanese docker stopped working, and in South Africa all ports were closed “in solidarity with the Liverpool dockers who stood by us during apartheid”. Youngsters from protest movement Reclaim the Streets went to Merseyside to occupy the offices of the MDHC. Liverpool star Robbie Fowler was fined \u0026pound900 by UEFA for unveiling a mock Calvin Klein T-shirt supporting the dockers in a goal celebration. Comics Jo Brand, Mark Steel, Jeremy Hardy and Lee Hurst, and musicians such as Noel Gallagher did fundraisers. At the 1998 Brit Awards Chumbawamba changed the words of Tubthumping to “New Labour sold out the dockers, just like they’ll sell out the rest of us”, and singer Danbert Nobacon famously poured a bucket of icy water over Deputy PM John Prescott, saying: “This is for the Liverpool dockers.”  Wives, girlfriends, aunts and mums joined Women of the Waterfront. They went on speaking tours, organised all-women pickets and marched on No10. In January 1998, after 28 months out of work, the dockers reluctantly accepted \u0026pound28,000 each to end their dispute. It was not the end of the story. They poured some of their pay-off money into retraining workshops, one of which involved a creative writing class, where Jimmy McGovern and Irvine Welsh gave tuition. Out of that came an agreement, brokered by McGovern, that they would make a film about their struggle. There were two conditions – the dockers had to write it, with McGovern “editing”, and they would receive all the proceeds. Channel 4 bit their hands off, and in 1999 the TV movie Dockers hit the screens, starring Ken Stott, Crissy Rock and Ricky Tomlinson.  The dockers wanted to leave a lasting legacy to the spirit of collectivism. So they used the \u0026pound127,000 they received from Channel 4 to buy and renovate The Casa, turning it into a community hub run on not-for-profit, socialist ideals. Downstairs became a bar and function room for parties, charity fundraisers, meetings, recitals, dramas, or rallies to promote progressive political causes. The floor above became an IT training centre, which helped people gain computer skills and find work. The third floor became a welfare advice centre offering free, expert help from professionals about benefits, debt, employment, asylum and health, or simply on how to fill out a form. Over the past 18 years it is estimated that more than \u0026pound15million worth of free advice has been given out here to people in desperate need.

It could even strengthen into a hurricane next week as it travels over warmer waters. Potent remnants of Florence could be absorbed by the jet stream and pushed towards Britain around mid September.  Dr. Claire Kennedy-Edwards, senior meteorologist of The Weather Channel, said: Some forecast models are favouring a more westward track for Tropical Storm Florence, which could impact north-eastern areas of the US.

Private hospital Elite Aftercare in Izmir insists it is open for business after Leah Cambridge, 29, died due to complications following the \u0026pound5,000 op. The mum-of-three suffered three heart attacks after the procedure and died - but the clinic has said that preliminary investigations have not raised any concerns over care. They said he death had caused a great deal of thought, reflection and consideration\u0027 and it was taking all reasonable steps to protect and reassure our clients.  Leah\u0027s heartbroken partner, Scott Franks, said Leah wanted the op because she was self-conscious of weight around her stomach from giving birth to their three children. Scott, of Leeds, West Yorkshire said: Leah was paranoid that she had excess weight from having three kids round her stomach. I told her she was beautiful how she was but she really wanted it for her own confidence. I didn’t think this would ever happen - or could happen to her. Scott believes Leah\u0027s operation went wrong after fat was deposited into her blood stream and her oxygen levels dropped. He says she was brought back to stable but she then had three heart attacks.  The family say the problems faced by Miss Cambridge resulted from fat deposits getting into her blood while she was under general anaesthetic.  It has been claimed the Turkish surgeon who carried out the operation told other patients he always made them as big as he could.  A TV crew caught Dr Ali Uckan boasting to another patient who asked him to make her bottom as big as possible, saying: That\u0027s what I do every time.

The Tesla CEO\u0027s unsubstantiated claims comes just weeks after he called diver Vern Unsworth pedo guy in an astonishing Twitter attack.  He later issued an apology after the earlier rant sparked a huge public backlash, as well as threats of a lawsuit from a furious Mr Unsworth. But in a new expletive-ridden email, which surfaced last night, he reignites his baseless attack on the diver, 63, who lives in Chiang Rai, Thailand. As well as calling Mr Unsworth a child rapist, Mr Musk accuses him of moving to the Asian country to take a child bride aged about 12 years old. Mr Unsworth, who has denied the accusations, has reportedly been with his girlfriend, aged 40, for seven years.  In the rambling email, sent to Buzzfeed News last week, Mr Musk says: I suggest that you call people you know in Thailand, find out what\u0027s actually going on and stop defending child rapists, you f****** a**hole. He\u0027s an old, single white guy from England who\u0027s been traveling to or living in Thailand for 30 to 40 years, mostly Pattaya Beach, until moving to Chiang Rai for a child bride who was about 12 years old at the time. He goes on to claim: There\u0027s only one reason people go to Pattaya Beach. It isn\u0027t where you\u0027d go for caves, but it is where you\u0027d go for something else. Chiang Rai is renowned for child sex-trafficking. The tech entrepreneur also alleges that Mr Unsworth wasn\u0027t on the cave dive rescue team and most of the actual dive team refused to hang out with him. I wonder why, he writes.  He sent the email to a BuzzFeed reporter after he was allegedly asked twice for comment on a legal threat from the rescuer\u0027s lawyer. In the correspondence, he also writes: As for this alleged threat of a lawsuit, which magically appeared when I raised the issue , I f***ing hope he sues me. While Mr Musk prefaced one email - including the child rapist claim - with “off the record,” the reporter says he did not agree to the condition. The journalist added: Off the record is a two-party agreement. According to the news site, Mr Musk did not provide any proof of his allegations and Mr Unsworth denied them through his attorney.  In July, the tycoon branded Mr Unsworth pedo guy in a bizarre series of Tweets, just days after 12 schoolboys and their football coach were rescued from a cave where they had been trapped for more than two weeks.  The founder of Tesla and SpaceX had claimed his prototype submarine could be used to rescue the group stuck in the flooded Tham Luang cave.  But after the boys were saved, Mr Unsworth told CNN that Mr Musk, 47, can stick his submarine where it hurts. He claimed it had absolutely no chance of working and it was a PR stunt. In an explosive Twitter tirade, Mr Musk hit back, raging to his 22 million followers: “Sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it.” Following his insult, Tesla\u0027s share price tumbled. There is absolutely nothing to suggest Mr Unsworth, who played a vital role in the rescue and has been hailed as a hero, is a paedophile.  But in a series of tweets containing the claim, Mr Musk, who visited the cave, also alleged: “Never saw this British expat guy who lives in Thailand  at any point when we were in the caves. “Only people in sight were the Thai navy/army guys, who were great. Thai navy seals escorted us in — total opposite of wanting us to leave. “Water level was actually very low \u0026amp still  — you could literally have swum to Cave 5 with no gear, which is obv how the kids got in. “If not true, then I challenge this dude to show final rescue video. The word sus is commonly used in the US as abbreviation for suspicious. He went on: You know what, don’t bother showing the video. We will make one of the mini-sub/pod going all the way to Cave 5 no problemo.  Mr Musk later deleted the insult and apologised on Twitter, replying to a tweet linking to a Quora article explaining his company’s involvement in the cave rescue mission. He wrote: “As this well-written article suggests, my words were spoken in anger after Mr. Unsworth said several untruths \u0026amp suggested I engage in a sexual act with the mini-sub, which had been built as an act of kindness \u0026amp according to specifications from the dive team leader. “Nonetheless, his actions against me do not justify my actions against him, and for that I apologize to Mr. Unsworth and to the companies I represent as leader. The fault is mine and mine alone. But Mr Unsworth expressed his fury at the billionaire\u0027s remarks. He earlier said: I\u0027ve been approached by British lawyers, American lawyers. I haven\u0027t decided what to do next yet. The diver told Reuters he can\u0027t let it go, adding: There\u0027s too much out there already.

The lion - called Filya - looked like it wanted to take the steering wheel and drive and appeared to be quite playful. It got up close to the tourists in the open sided vehicle - giving cuddles and even licking one woman in the face.  Green-shirted lion whisperer Oleg Zubkov, 50, owner of Taigan Safari Park in Crimea, was on hand. And the Russian tourists got some amazing selfies with the two-year-old big cat.

Olga Solomina, 46, from Kirov, said that the predator “bit through my right arm and used it to drag me - it like a puppet.” She revealed: “When I got back to my senses, I was already in the hands of the park’s staff who were helping me.  “When it happened, right at the moment of the incident, I actually said goodbye to my life. “I thought I was to be torn apart. “Oleg Zubkov was there helping me to bandage the wound. “It was bleeding. “Then he rushed me to the park’s medical point.” Zubkov refuses to halt his get-close-to-lions policy at the park in Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014. Olga had drunk alcohol before going into the big cat enclosure, he said.  “It was my mistake not to realise that she has had cognac before entering- possibly because she was scared. “She came inside and started ruffling the lions’s mane. “Vitya the lion came close to her and pulled her away by her arm. “She wasn’t pulled forcefully into the park. “She knew this was a dangerous site. “She was given health and safety instructions and entered voluntarily.

Sinead McNamara had been out dancing and drinking with friends in Argostoli, on the Greek island of Kefalonia, a bar manager says. The 20-year-old Australian was found in a critical condition about 24 hours later, tangled in ropes on the rear deck of the Mayan Queen IV yacht, but her death remains a mystery. Ms McNamara had been working on the \u0026pound108million boat - owned by Mexican mining magnate Alberto Baill\u0026egraveres - as a member of crew for just four months.  She is reported to have spoken to a security guard 15 minutes before the boat\u0027s captain found her at about 1.45am last Friday. She died en route to a hospital in Athens. Authorities said initial evidence pointed to the possibility of suicide but an investigation into her mysterious death has been launched.  Officers are now reviewing texts and photographs found on her mobile phone, according to local reports. About 24 hours before she was found, she had partied with friends at the Baroque bar.  Bar manager Makais Chaliodis told MailOnline that she arrived with five friends at about 5.30pm last Wednesday, adding: She sat on one of the stools by the bar with two male friends and had two cocktails and a club sandwich.   They all seemed to be in high spirits and were happy. They were having a good time. They left at 7.30pm but some of them, including the girl who died, came back again at 1am. The last time I saw her she had got up on one of the chairs and was dancing. The manager said Ms McNamara left about 30 minutes later and some of her friends stayed until the bar closed at 3am. Fellow crew members have told police that Ms McNamara had suffered a bad breakup shortly before her death, it was reported.  The young woman\u0027s body is due to be flown back to Australia today, and it is expected to be accompanied by her mother Kylie and her sister Lauren. They had already flown in from Australia and were due to meet Ms McNamara on the day she died to go on holiday together.

The shop down the road sells designer handbags and they won’t want undesirables hanging around either.“It won’t help the area – we want to keep it quite exclusive, especially with the V\u0026ampA opening soon.“We’d be supportive if this community fridge was inside the church rather than out in the open.”Tessa Tricks at Hubbub, who would build the community fridge, said: “Hubbub runs the National Network of Community Fridges and has had an active role in managing community fridges for nearly two years.“During this time we have never had any complaints of antisocial behaviour or vandalism at any of the fridge sites.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee have a real gem in young striker cedwyn scott says berwick boss","story":"\t\t\t\t\tYoung Dundee striker Cedwyn Scott has earned high praise after a brace on his debut for Berwick.Boss Robbie Horn was highly impressed by the teenager.His double came in a 5-3 win at Albion Rovers when he grabbed the third and fifth goals in a dramatic tie.Horn said: “My research had shown that Cedwyn was a good player but he is better than I had hoped for.

dad sean","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSome would say they deserve a medal after spending quality time with their parents – and that’s exactly what young Dundee kickboxer Riley Wanless will be hoping happens after weeks of training for a big title fight with his dad.The nine-year-old fighter, whose father Sean is an accomplished kickboxer himself, will on Saturday go for the WKA  Junior Scottish title.And Riley has been pushed to his limits in training by Sean at Dundee Elite Freestyle Kickboxing Fight School – which he owns and runs.The St Joseph’s Primary pupil has been working out five days a week as he tries to win the -25kg title at a special fight show at Rivals Gym in Wishaw.The show, in which Riley and his opponent are the only junior boxers involved, is set to raise money and awareness for mental health charity Chris’s House.Sean has been coaching his son for past seven years and feels he is fit and raring to go as he bids to bring the title back to Dundee, saying: “Riley is really excited about it.“He’s been training five days a week and we’re starting to do sessions on a Saturday night.“We’re just trying to get his body used to it as he’s fighting on a Saturday.“He’s a really hard worker and wants to go out all the time doing hill sprints and cardio work.“It’s real high-intensity stuff but he’s used to it.“He even does long runs up the Dundee Law, which is tiring for most adults.“He’s the first on the card on Saturday, opening the show and fighting for the junior Scottish kickboxing title.“He and his opponent are the only juniors involved and it will be the first time he has had a proper fight in a ring so it will be a great experience for him.“He is looking in good shape and we are hoping to take the title.”Riley, who has shown promise in the sport practically since he could stand up, is a ferocious competitor and trainer.Much like his dad Sean, who has the ring nickname of the Warrior.However, Sean insists his “wee ninja” Riley has taken his title as the warrior of the family.He added: “He has had the pads on since he was two and I took him to his first class when he was just three.“Even back then in 2012 he was absolutely amazing – a wee ninja!“He has been absolutely brilliant ever since and it’s been good working close together at the fight school since I started that up in 2013.“He’s a wee warrior now and is taking over my title!”Sean is extremely proud of his son and the rest of the lads he coaches and mentors at Dundee Elite Freestyle.With more events on the horizon for Riley, himself and the rest of the fight squad, Sean is delighted at how things have been progressing.He added: “Riley just keeps progressing and getting better and better.“He’s managed to get his own motivation now and works really well with the rest of the lads in the squad.“They’ll all be fighting at the Scottish International Open on September 15 and the WKA World Championships in Dublin in October.“I’ll be back in the ring in Dublin, too, so I’m looking forward to it.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b8e4c332c791-432x564.jpg ","title":"dundee locals dig deep for loved pooch mr chang

operation he had for a slipped disc.It was feared he would have been left paralysed had the surgery not gone ahead.After owner Michelle Boyack forked out £3,600 for the operation at the Albavet Veterinary Hospital in Kirkcaldy, Lochee residents have been dipping into their pockets to help pay for it.A fundraising night is also set to take place at Club 83 in St Salvador Street next month.Michelle, 49, said: “My dog had to have an operation, which we were able to put off for a while.“In February, he basically had a slipped disc and he became quite poorly.“We thought we were going to need to pay out for the operation at that time but the vet said he just needed eight to 12 weeks cage rest and he ended up being OK.“However, three weeks ago he suffered a relapse and we had to pay the £3,600 to get him sorted out.“The vet said that he could have been paralysed if he didn’t have the surgery so we’re quite lucky.“He’s recovering now and he’s a big part of the community here in Lochee, people love him.”Michelle, who runs Short Bark and Tails in the High Street, had to use her daughter’s credit card to pay the bill for the two-year-old pooch’s treatment.Mr Chang has quickly gained a host of admirers in Lochee with Michelle receiving regular visitors to her shop to help pay for the treatment.Michelle said she’s been overwhelmed by the support from people in the area.She added: “I’ve honestly felt like crying with some of the stuff I’ve seen and people coming in to give some money.“There’s a few people who I’m sure don’t really have much that have been coming in to give up their last fiver just because they love the dog so much.“He’s part of the community here but it’s still really a testament to Lochee that people are coming out and doing that. I’ve not long opened my business and I don’t have that money to spend but your pets are like your kids.“Lochee sometimes gets a bad rap but to see people coming in to give their bit is brilliant.“I’ve managed to get £150 back already but we’re going to be holding a fundraising night at Club 83 on October 5.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people youngsters to bring the king and i to stage","story":"\t\t\t\t\tRising Youngstars Junior Musical Theatre Group will soon take to the stage for its performance of Rodgers and Hammerstein’s The King and I.Members of the cast, with ages ranging from six-17, have been working hard learning their lines, music, songs and dances over the past six months to bring the action-packed show to Kirriemuir.Yvonne Fraser, vice-chairwoman of the group, said: “We are a voluntary group who fundraise throughout the year and, with help from the community and parent and carer helpers, we produce a musical for the young people to perform.“This year the main principals have been double cast so it gives an opportunity for more of the cast to perform in a principal role.”Rising Youngstars will perform The King and I at Kirriemuir Town Hall from Wednesday September 12 to Friday September 14, starting at 7.30pm.Their final show will be on Saturday September 15 at 2.30pm.Tickets are available at risingyoung stars or from Visions in Cards, Glengate, Kirriemuir.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b8e4cf82915d-846x564.jpg ","title":"dundee school takes new approach to help struggling children through playing","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWhat did primary school look like when you were growing up?For many, it was stuffy classrooms with lines of identical desks and a teacher pointing at a blackboard.However, if you were to step into a classroom at a school like Dens Road Primary, you’ll find learning is now very different.There’s relaxed music playing on TV as children mill around, playing with pens, play dough and Lego.Teachers sit with pupils helping them to practise writing numbers.But most children aren’t sitting down – they’re playing.Welcome to the world of play-based learning – a venture based upon research on schools at home and abroad, which aims to help younger kids who struggle in a traditional classroom to thrive.Studies have linked play with the development of life skills and overall better health.Members of Dundee City Council were able to see this first-hand on a visit to the school.Head teacher Ann-Marie McDonald said: “Children are coming out of nursery having been given a lot of attention – often one-to-one – and the usual classroom isn’t set up for them.“These are the kids that are traditionally getting into bother but it’s actually unfair on them.“So we did a lot of research – and this is our approach.”In a traditional classroom, teachers have a class of up to 25 pupils, which means kids don’t always get the attention they need. But in these more open, free-form classes, there are up to five teachers for 50 pupils.Small groups are taken aside for a short time each day to focus on traditional learning, such as numeracy and literacy – but outside of that they’re free to play as they see fit.And while it can all look messy from the outside, each of the play areas – from a model kitchen to a sandpit – is designed to complement pupils’ learning.For those wanting me-time, there are “quiet zones” with books to read and cosy chairs.There’s something for everyone – and kids can do whatever they want to do – which seems to work.Early indications from teachers suggest kids are more attentive, better engaged with their work and happier.However, it won’t fit everywhere and schools have a degree of autonomy when it comes to choosing how to teach.Dens Road is one of several Dundee schools receiving Pupil Equity Funding from the Scottish Government, with an extra £5 million allocated to the council for the 2018-19 year.This is set to be discussed at committee next week, alongside an Education Scotland report outlining the city’s “good progress” in closing the gap.Audrey May, chief education officer with Dundee City Council, said: “It’s a really positive report on the good progress we’ve been making. It’s a statement of confidence – but we are not complacent and know there’s a long way to go.”Education convener Stewart Hunter said: “The Attainment Challenge is good for us but it’s good for the schools and the kids as well.“The schools put a lot of hard work in – and based on our visit today the proof is in the pudding.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b8e4d427df01-507x564.jpg ","title":"dundee united must win dirty games laments csaba laszlo","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIn the wake of Saturday’s 1-1 draw at Alloa, Dundee United boss Csaba Laszlo still cuts a frustrated figure.The Terrors, and Csaba, had been on a high after comfortable wins over Queen of the South and Partick Thistle saw them, seemingly, turn a corner.United controlled and managed those matches well but all their good work came undone as they laboured to a point at the Indodrill Stadium at the weekend.Csaba had spoken at the start of the season about his side’s need to start grinding out results if they want to win the Championship.And his disappointment and anger was evident as they couldn’t dictate what he called a ‘dirty game’ in Clackmannanshire.“It was a dirty game but one which really, if you want to make the top league, you have to manage all the time and finish,” he said.“This is not about dominating the game, it’s about winning the game.“It is clear for us that this was an artificial pitch and even it was seven, eight yards shorter than usually.“So I wait for my team and it’s clear, in this case, you have to circulate the ball quicker, you have to move the ball out quicker to have the possibility to move up the pitch.”United had opened the scoring in the second half through a Paul Watson header on 71 minutes, his third goal in two games, and it could have been more.Yannick Loemba had what would have been his first strike for the Tangerines ruled out for offside and Csaba felt 18-year-old Declan Glass could have played in fellow-sub Callum Booth to put the game beyond doubt.As it transpired, the kid gave away possession and Alloa broke to win the free-kick which Iain Flannigan curled home on 82 minutes to earn the Wasps a point.It was no less than the home side deserved but Csaba couldn’t help scrutinise his team’s game management.“We were in front, you have just to keep the ball and keep the result,” he added.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/07/59649428c4d5e-e1499773791488-957x575.jpg ","title":"grab a hot drink at venues across dundee for worlds biggest coffee morning","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee will join the rest of the UK in raising funds for Macmillan’s annual World’s Biggest Coffee Morning later this month.Two coffee mornings will be held at Marks \u0026amp Spencer stores in the city on Friday September 28, at the Murraygate branch and the Foodhall in Gallagher Retail Park.

The new blocks A and B will still be three storeys but sit lower than the eaves of the school building, containing a combined 16 housing units.Block C will have four two-bed apartments set over two storeys.There will be a total of 54 car parking spaces.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b8e4d5611cad-e1536054160536-814x564.jpg ","title":"no excuses for display at alloa says dundee united midfielder adam barton","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United midfielder Adam Barton insists they can have no excuses for their poor performance at Alloa despite the tough conditions.The Terrors drew 1-1 with Jim Goodwin’s side on Saturday in a game they were expected to win.The synthetic surface at the Indodrill Stadium was narrowed for United’s visit and the hosts made life difficult for Csaba Laszlo’s men throughout.Despite opening the scoring through a Paul Watson header on 71 minutes, as well as enjoying some bright spells in the second half, the Wasps were always in control.A sublime Iain Flannigan free-kick earned Alloa a well-deserved point and it could’ve been more.Barton said: “If we want to win the league, these are the places you’ve got to go and do the job.“What frustrates me is people on the outside, particularly the fans, who were there in good numbers on Saturday. They don’t understand how difficult it is to go to places like Alloa and do what you usually do.“Looking at the pitch, compared to Tannadice it’s completely different altogether, so you have to adjust your game. Alloa are playing there nearly every week so they’re used to it.“You’ve got that against you but it’s not just us, it’s going to be every team that goes there.“It was a difficult task on Saturday but again that’s an excuse and we shouldn’t have excuses.“We should be going there and doing the job.”Barton and central-midfield partner Christoph Rabitsch endured a difficult afternoon as Alloa’s Allan Trouten and Steven Hetherington engaged them in a physical battle.And the 27-year-old Englishman admits they lost control of the match.“We didn’t control the game at all, it’s as simple as that, we tried and couldn’t. It’s just the way the game was,” he added.“I’m sure at home it will be a completely different game but we weren’t used to the conditions and the width of the pitch, so it was tough.“I thought we deserved a point. I don’t think we deserved to win the game and fair play to them because they gave everything they’ve got.“We went to Alloa knowing it was not going to be easy. We didn’t underestimate them but they just played their game very well.“Even in midfield I drop in to get the ball and we mostly look like a back three.“We couldn’t do that against Alloa because it would give them a chance to press us and we were unable to do that.“That was one way in which we were affected in the way we like to play but I’m sure a lot of teams will go there and struggle to play their game.”Barton was honest in his assessment of the performance and says United’s players are not used to a more physical game but insists he knows they’ll need to get used to it.“It turned into a bit of a scrap. We don’t set up to play that kind of football and we don’t have the players who do that.“A lot of people would say you need to be able to adapt to most games but even the best players in the world don’t do the scrappy side of things. It’s just the way it is.“It’s in your nature, you can’t work on the physical side on the training pitch, you can work on being organised and having a better structure but you can’t go into training and work on aggression.“It just doesn’t happen and if you’re an aggressive person, great – if you’re not then you’re not.“You can’t wake up one day and say ‘I’m going to be aggressive’.“We’re not bothered about the play-offs, we want to win the league and we need to go to Alloa and win.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"poll results dundee fans give clear verdict on whether neil mccann should stay as manager","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee fans have given a clear message to the board regarding the future of manager Neil McCann.The Tele yesterday ran an online poll asking fans if McCann deserves more time to turn things round after at Dens a terrible start to the season.His position as Dundee manager is coming under increased scrutiny after his side lost for the fifth match running on Saturday.The Dark Blues went down 3-1 at home to Motherwell – and it could have been a lot worse.The Dee sit bottom of the table without a point and have twice been beaten by lower league opposition in the Betfred Cup.McCann is correct when he says his team had a similarly bad opening to last season’s campaign before recovering to finish safely in ninth place.However, less than one in five supporters shared his optimism as 80% of Dundee fans who voted in our online poll called for him to be dismissed after 17 months in the hot seat.Of the 1,609 votes submitted, 1,297 believed his time was up.One of our readers wrote: \u0026#8220His tactics and player recruitment have not been good enough.\u0026#8220There is no passion in his players, they were second best against a Motherwell side who chased and harried for everything throughout the match.\u0026#8220He should do the gentlemanly thing and resign and realise he is a better pundit than a manager.\u0026#8221Just 312 people felt he deserved more time.One wrote: \u0026#8220He is still a rookie and there are worse teams in the league.\u0026#8221McCann has time to regroup his players during the international break before a trip to Rangers, one of his former clubs, a week on Saturday.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"poll time up for neil mccann as dundee manager","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNeil McCann\u0026#8217s position as Dundee manager is coming under increased scrutiny after his side lost for the fifth match running on Saturday.The Dark Blues went down 3-1 at home to Motherwell \u0026#8211 and it could have been a lot worse.The Dee sit bottom of the table without a point and have twice been beaten by lower league opposition in the Betfred Cup.McCann is correct when he says his team had a similarly bad opening to last season\u0026#8217s campaign before recovering to finish safely in ninth place.After the weekend\u0026#8217s game he put it down to \u0026#8220a wee lack of confidence\u0026#8221.He added: \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s hard to take when you\u0026#8217re not getting results.

What do they do each day and how do they feel about their area?In the second of an eight-part series, we aim to paint an up-to-date picture of how the city’s people live, based on the results of a new survey.Dundee’s most recent citizens’ survey was carried out last year and local area results are now available. Today Jon Brady and Sarah Williamson look at Maryfield, where locals were asked about their lifestyles.MARYFIELD is one of the city’s most diverse wards, covering residential areas such as Stobswell all the way down to the city centre and the harbour.So it’s not surprising to see that some of the area’s residents point to the fact it’s “peaceful” – while others enjoy being “close to shops”.The majority of people like where they live – with 97% of people rating their areas either “very good” or “fairly good”.Maryfield is a ward of movers and shakers, with 55% of residents having lived in the area for less than five years.There’s a near-equal split of homeowners and those who rent from private landlords  with most people satisfied with the quality of their homes.They are less satisfied, however, with the quality of roads, pavements and street lighting.About 36% say they are “fairly dissatisfied”, while a further 2% are “very dissatisfied”.Maryfield residents are also a social bunch, going by the results of the council’s survey.Eight out of 10 people go to organised sports classes each week and 75% meet up weekly for organised social activities.Half of all locals also exercise four days a week or more.Maryfield residents are also cultured: two-thirds have been to a live music event in the last year, and 69% make use of their local library.However, the area’s lack of organised community groups such as community councils and traders’ groups is evident: everyone asked said they “never” attend any such meetings.And despite groups like Stobswell Forum, which organises the annual Stobfest community festival, a quarter of locals believe they can’t influence decisions in their area.Richard Robertson, 54, who has lived in the Stobswell area for seven years, said: “There is nothing in the area. There is not a main bank.“The shops are losing their custom. You don’t see many people walk about here now. It was always a busy area.”He added it was sad for the older generation as there are not many places for them to go out and meet people.Emma Lowther, 22, a full-time receptionist, said: “It’s fine. It’s a cheap area to live. I think a lot of young people stay because its really cheap to stay in.“You’ve got Lidl and stuff really close by. It can be really dirty, the streets have dog mess and you sometimes find a lot of glass. It is really good for young people to get started with their first place. I walk to and from town most days.”Linda Stewart, 67, said: “I have lived in the area for about 48 years. There is nothing to do around here.

It changes the dynamic in the market hall. It\u0027 a great unit with fantastic windows and great visibility.The idea is to charge \u0026pound20 per hour for use of the premises.If the initiative is approved by the council\u0027 city committee, Mrs Murray promised the unit would be redecorated before it is let.Meanwhile, the market could be renamed Old Town Arcade Inverness in a major rebranding exercise.The proposal has emerged after talks between interested parties and council, which has employed consultant Tristram Woolston Design of Cannich to look at the marketing of the landmark, which has often been a focal point for city visitors from home and abroad.Mrs Murray said further talks will be held before it goes to Highland councillors for consideration.\u0026ldquoThe consultant has identified problems with the existing name, in that the building and its environment doesn\u0026rsquot strongly present Victorian qualities and it\u0027 not a \u0026lsquomarket\u0026rsquo as such, but has permanent enclosed retail units rather than changeable stalls, she said.\u0026ldquoThe vision for this historic building after refurbishment is to provide a high-quality destination with a mix of unique Highland brands and products, a place to eat and drink, and a venue for events and entertainment.\u0026ldquoOther similar destinations in the UK and abroad call themselves arcades and hence the proposed new name is Old Town Arcade Inverness.Those involved will discuss the new image for the facility in September.Inverness economist Tony Mackay said it might be better to focus on other matters.\u0026ldquoTo be honest I\u0026rsquom not sure what sort of impact changing the name will have, he said.\u0026ldquoThere needs to be improvements at the market, there are a few empty premises in the centre. It\u0027 gone downhill due to lack of investments and the decline in people shopping in the city centre.\u0026ldquoWe need to move away from the traditional shopping idea, more social activities and more attractions are what is needed. The shops at the Victorian Market shut at 5pm. Staying open later and having maybe street entertainers there in the evening could attract more people.Wednesday 5 Sep 2018 10:35 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116827.jpg","title":"City centre eyesore gets demolition approval","story":"\u0026nbspTHE owners of a fire-ravaged building blighting Inverness city centre will meet Highland Council representatives this week to set out a timetable of work after the go-ahead was given for its demolition.Hopes are growing of a breakthrough in the impasse over the former Eastgate Hostel which has been an eyesore since going up in flames in April 2013 \u0026ndash some 1984 days ago \u0026ndash although the council has acknowledged a compulsory purchase order could be considered if an agreement is not reached.Public frustration has been growing over the lack of visible action at the site.A planning application was lodged with the council earlier this year to remove scaffolding and demolish the remaining structure ahead of reconstruction. But hopes that work would start in June floundered when a council officer and Historic Environment Scotland voiced disquiet over proposals for a rebuild that would have been lower than the original building.Although talks are still ongoing regarding the rebuild, planning officers using delegated powers have now given permission for the demolition on the condition the stones are numbered and stored for the rebuild.Central ward councillor Bet McAllister who will attend a meeting with other councillors, officials and the\u0026nbspowners tomorrow\u0026nbspis confident of a solution and hopes the project will be completed by this time next year.\"I would like to see work start before the end of this year and then once the better weather comes in March or April to have it rebuilt next year unless they hit any other snags,\" she said. \"That would be my dream.\"She also insisted that the building should be reinstated to the same height.\"We will stick to our guns on that,\" she said. \"It has to be done to what we want.\"Cllr McAllister said a compulsory purchase order could be an option if a resolution was not forthcoming.\"Hopefully, it will not come to that,\" she said. \"I am confident the owners will play ball and that everything we have asked them to do will be done.\"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspA council spokeswoman confirmed discussions were continuing regarding a rebuild and expected details of the project\u0027 programme to be released next week.Asked whether the council was considering a compulsory purchase order if the talks and proposals failed, she replied: \"All options remain under consideration which will enable the High Street being restored to full use.\"Pat Hayden, chairwoman of Crown and City Centre Community Council, said work should start as soon as possible and felt a more contemporary design for the rebuild should be considered if it would speed up progress.\u0026nbsp\"Time is being wasted,\" she said. \"If it is too difficult to rebuild as it was, let\u0027 forget it. Why not make it one storey lower? Anything to make it easier.\"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspChiropodist Jim Crawford, whose practice is in Stephen\u0027 Brae, has been a constant critic of the lack of action at the site and said the option of a compulsory purchase order had always been available to the council.\"This has now been going on for more than five years,\" he said. \"It is ridiculous.

Detailed measures will be presented next week.Leaders of the minority independent administration said every attempt would be made to minimise the impact on services but \u0026ldquosome impact on service is inevitable.Budget leader Alister Mackinnon said: \u0026ldquoOur  reserves of \u0026pound8 million are well below the minimum recommended by Audit Scotland and it\u0027 vital that they\u0026rsquore not depleted further. The committee agreed stricter controls on recruitment and overtime, a review of all agency appointments and tighter controls on staff travel.The \u0026pound5.1 million figure equates to one per cent of the total budget and compares with a \u0026pound2.7 million estimate at this stage last year. The potential overspend is blamed on high cost placements for \u0026lsquolooked-after children\u0026rsquo, lower income from new parking charges and fewer savings from toilet closures because those two policies have not yet taken full effect.Council chiefs insisted no staff jobs were at risk.Finance director Derek Yule, however, warned there were \u0026ldquono more rabbits to be pulled from hats to tackle the problems.Black Isle Liberal Democrat Gordon Adam blamed Scottish Government grant cuts while SNP city councillor Richard Laird said the crisis was \u0026ldquoentirely of this council\u0027 making.Council leader Margaret Davidson claimed local government services were \u0026ldquonot a priority for the Scottish Government.The budget leader angered the SNP benches, accusing group leader Maxine Smith of not fully participating in budget discussions. He said he invited her to meetings but had been turned down \u0026ldquobecause she views her private commitments more important than reorganising her diary.She was not in the chamber to respond. In a later statement she said: \u0026ldquoOn Friday, I received a request to attend a meeting on Monday to discuss the budget. I had commitments but they were pre-arranged meetings with constituents. I\u0026rsquove sent him a meeting request for tomorrow. I\u0026rsquom available any time, so hopefully he\u0026rsquoll re-arrange his diary. On the budget, our job in opposition is to scrutinise.A spokesman for the Scottish Government said: \u0026ldquoHighland Council has had more this year despite UK government cuts to our budget. It will receive over \u0026pound487 million Scottish Government funding in 2018-19.n Support was voiced for a city councillor who has quit as the SNP\u0027 deputy leader on Highland Council.Richard Laird  cited health reasons for his decision. He will remain a Central Ward councillor. He said: \u0026ldquoMy health isn\u0026rsquot good enough. That\u0027 the reason I\u0026rsquom stepping down. For the last year or so, both my physical health and my mental health have been in decline. I\u0026rsquove been told by the doctor to reduce my workload a bit.SNP group leader Maxine Smith said: \u0026ldquoI am saddened that Richard has had to step down as depute group leader, as we have worked well together. His illness has been creeping up on him for some time and he feels he needs time to rest, so removing the huge responsibility of chairing a strategic committee is a sensible thing to do.

But Cllr Gowans added: \u0026ldquoInverness schools are one of the biggest budget pressures we\u0026rsquore going to face. The last estimated cost to resolve the issue would be something like \u0026pound200 million.\u0026ldquoThat would affect every single service within this council \u0026ndash not just Inverness. But they\u0026rsquove been restricted to Inverness members.\u0026ldquoI cannot fathom why such important issues as Inverness schools, and the implications that has for the resources of Highland Council, are not being brought forward in an open, transparent way in the chamber so they can be discussed.\u0026ldquoThat way, we could reassure communities that this matter is being addressed.Ross and Cromarty area committee chairwoman Fiona Robertson, an independent councillor, did not join the chorus but, speaking after the committee meeting, said: \u0026ldquoWhen it comes to the allocation

West Link project.Councillors and Highland Council staff were taken on a tour of the development last week and hailed the impact of the new, improved facilities.Inverness South councillor Duncan Macpherson was among those who attended the visit and believes the new facilities can have the same positive effect on the whole community as Highland Rugby Club\u0027 Canal Park.\u0026ldquoMore and

trauma centre is to open next month, it has been revealed.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told MSPs the unit will open in October as she laid out her programme for government for the coming year yesterday.The state-of-the-art facility will be part of a major trauma network that includes Dundee, Glasgow and Edinburgh and will provide specialist emergency care.Ms Sturgeon said in parliament: “I can also confirm that, as part of our work to create a specialist major trauma network, new major trauma centres will open in Aberdeen next month and in Dundee in November.”This will mean the facility – which could save up to 40 lives a year – would be the first in the network to open.North-east Labour MSP Lewis Macdonald welcomed news of an opening date.He said: “It’s great that two years on we have a date for when that will go forward.“It’s particularly pleasing that Aberdeen will be the first in the country followed quickly by Dundee.“Foresterhill already has most of the services on the site and so, as we argued around two years ago, this decision shows Aberdeen is best placed to carry that forward.”In 2016 concerns were raised Aberdeen would miss out to the central belt after former Health Secretary Shona Robison appeared to backtrack on her government’s commitment to deliver the centre.Dozens of top doctors at NHS Grampian voiced concern about basing the units in just Edinburgh and Glasgow, suggesting lives could be put at risk, and more than 3,500 residents also signed a petition demanding the need for the facility.But Ms Sturgeon intervened, pledging the trauma centre would be built in the city.She also unveiled plans to invest an additional £7 billion in schools, hospitals, transport, digital connectivity and clean energy by 2026.She said a new welfare payment aimed at helping low-income families in Scotland will be introduced ahead of schedule.The Best Start Grant, which replaces the Sure Start Maternity Grant north of the border, is one of 11 benefits being devolved to Holyrood.Ms Sturgeon said the first payments will begin before Christmas, six months earlier than originally planned.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"chance to zip wire down aberdeens

month.Skyfall, the first mobile zip-wire ride of its kind in the UK, will come to the city as part of In Town Without My Car Day.Visitors can also look forward to a bungee run, a giant boot camp course and a helter skelter.The event – which takes place from 10am until 4.30pm on Sunday September 16 – will see Union Street closed between the Bridge Street and Market Street junctions.The day will also feature Aberdeen\u0026#8217s own version of carpool karaoke as well as the chance to win a £250 bike store voucher.The zip wire ride, which will be at least 140 feet long, will be set up on Union Street with a maximum speed of 21mph and is suitable for those aged four to adult.In the boot camp challenge, contestants will negotiate their way through 26 metres of cushioned obstacles, from squeezers to a tyre gauntlet challenge, swinging across an inflatable ravine, through the tunnels, up the steps and down the slide to the finish line.On the bungee run, two players will go head to head to see who can get their baton the furthest along the centre wall whilst fastened to bungee cords.This year’s theme is “multimodality” and is encouraging everyone to explore the options available for getting from A to B, and to think about the mode that best suits each journey.The Lord Provost of Aberdeen Barney Crockett said: “In Town Without My Car day is always a fantastic event and this year promises to be bigger and better than ever.\u0026#8220The public provide great support and really get behind the day and everyone is welcome.“There’s a serious message behind the fun around the importance of sustainable transport and it’s a great way of promoting our aims, working with partners who share the Council’s ambitions.”The event is one of several planned across the year to help people find out more about public transport, responsible car use, cycling and walking alternatives to using a car and to demonstrate to people how space can be used differently.In Town Without Your

We were probably more excited about them than they were.“They were just cuddled up together.

I foolishly stood up too soon approaching the Kilmartin stop and fell forward, landing head to door and feet in the air.Thank you to the doctor who checked me over, and to the driver and passengers who waited until I had been checked.Janet Jardine, KilmartinSir,I would like to give thanks to Tarbert Festivals Committee for all their hard work in organising the very successful Seafood Festival.Tarbert Festival Queen 2018 Chloe MacDonald with her Princesses Cara and Kaitlyn were beautiful and a great credit to the festival.My thanks again to everyone who helped in any way to make this year’s festival such an amazing event and to the very many people who visited the village for the occasion.Councillor Anne Horn, TarbertEditor\u0026#8217s note: With apologies to Councillor Horn for the delay in publishing this letter, originally submitted in July.Sir,The closure of the tourist centres at Tarbert and Inveraray is very worrying and I can’t understand why VisitScotland, backed by the Scottish Government, came up with such a decision.Tourism is extremely important to Argyll and Bute, and all agencies should be working together to assist the tourists that come to this area.Tarbert is in my council ward and I know how valuable the centre there is. The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray. They searched all the places they had visited, including the George, but the keys were not found, so they returned to Cairnbaan by taxi.Fortunately the hotel found the keys and managed to make contact with them, and they returned to Inveraray by taxi to collect the keys from the staff who had been kind enough to wait for them.Once again I would to thank you for your help in making my guests\u0026#8217 stay memorable.Pauline Houston, Crinan Canal CottageSir,I was very happy to attend this year\u0026#8217s Islay, Jura and Colonsay Agricultural Show.It was great to hear about the terrific work being done by the Islay Development Initiative with their Islay Pollinator Initiative which generates employment, including two Modern Apprentices in Beekeeping.I spoke to local farmers about single farm payment delays, feed prices, fuel prices, broadband speed and the poor quality of our infrastructure. I also met with the Islay Book Festival team and heard from my constituents from across Islay, Jura and Colonsay about numerous local issues, all of which will addressed.A huge thank you to all the hard-working volunteers who helped make this year\u0026#8217s show possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 33","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 19/08/18, 2:04 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There has been talk of a new rugby pitch for a while, but plans presented to community councillors on Monday go further than that.We hope everyone involved is as enthusiastic as Mid Argyll Rugby Club and more power to their elbow.This year\u0026#8217s has to go down as one of the best Mid Argyll Shows in recent times.The weather helped bring out the crowds in big numbers, but the real credit must go to the volunteers who organise the show.

The cyclists were faced with  2,500 feet of climbing, and descending, with flat fast sections and breathtaking scenery.Stephen added: ‘I particularly enjoyed us chasing and catching the postman in his van on his rural round.’Sixteen-year-old Ethan Gascoigne said: \u0026#8216I really enjoyed the tough route. I was glad the age limit had been lowered since I could enjoy the race with my dad.\u0026#8217John Hardie, the event organiser said: ‘With the guidance of British Cycling we managed to stage our event. As usual, the support from the people and businesses of Tarbert has been exemplary.\u0026#8216We wanted cyclists of all levels to enjoy the glorious cycle route 78, better known as the Kilberry Loop. It is a 40 mile cycle, not long for a sportive, but it is within the capability of most cyclists. Stuart Ashley shot round in an astonishing 1 hour 48 minutes.\u0026#8216We will definitely be organising it again next year, so look out for its launch and get pedalling.’\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"fun for all ages at inveraray shinty club open day","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 22/08/18, 11:31 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowInveraray Shinty Club hosted its annual open day at the Winterton on Sunday August 12.The day started at 10am with the club\u0026#8217s youth coaches putting the primary aged players through their paces with some fun skill-testing.  As part of the day each member received some training gear kindly sponsored buy Cooke Aquaculture Scotland who also paid for a new set of children’s strips.As with last year the ‘older generation’ then got in on the act with five teams competing for the six aside Peter MacCallum Memorial Quaich.

To achieve this, he worked for two years with the Beaver Colony, members aged 6 to 8, and took on a senior leadership role.In February 2018, eight young people from the group took part in a selection process to secure a place at either the World Scout Jamboree in North America in July 2019 or to join a major expedition to Malaysia in July 2019.  More than 250 young people attended the selection process with 70 places available. All members of the 19th Argyll were successful and, as far as we are aware, it was the only unit to achieve this feat.Two of the team, Martha Payne and Polly Payne, have secured places at the World Scout Jamboree, a three-week adventure at the Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve in West Virginia, USA. The event is being hosted by the Boy Scouts of America, Scouts Canada and the Scout Association of Mexico.  Seventeen thousand Scouts from across the globe will attend. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to build relationships, explore other cultures and go on life-changing adventures.Six of the team \u0026#8211 Andrew Smart, James Urquhart, Lorne Barrie, Liberty Hampton, Cameron Garrett and Anna Turner \u0026#8211 have secured places in the West Region 2019 expedition to Malaysia.

But Alfie Briggs does plan to downsize the long-established business. Mr Briggs, 74, wants to change part of the arcade, to create a town house. And he has been granted planning consent by South Ayrshire Council. Mr Briggs says he will transform the smaller part of the arcade - next to the Harbour Bar pub - back into a house. But the larger, deeper part of the business will remain an amusement arcade. However, Mr Briggs also has consent to create a house there, should it ever be required. He said: “I was advised to do it  this way. But I’m definitely not closing the arcade.” He added: “I won’t be around forever, and maybe my children will decide it should go back to a house. “But I know I won’t do it.” Mr Briggs, who lives in Ayr, has owned Mayfair Amusements since 1984. The business was created in 1962 by the late Edwin Lawrence, a former travelling showman. He had bought the two-storey house next to the Harbour Bar pub, and converted the downstairs front into a small amusement arcade. This had originally been John Carson’s fish shop. The arcade was greatly expanded around 1970, after the acquistion of a house at No 29 Knockcushan Street. The arcade, which included a prize bingo and a shop, was run successfully by Mr Lawrence and his family, until bought by Mr Briggs. The new owner kept the name ‘Mayfair Amusements’ which was a tribute to Mr Lawrence’s wife May, as well as an affluent part of London. Alfie Briggs recalls: “There was more business for everyone back in the days when there was about five amusement arcades in Girvan. “Takings have certainly gone down, but we’re still getting by. “This conversion will allow me to rent out a house and a flat, instead of just a flat.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilGirvanAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"ayr united fans under starters","story":"NewsAyr United fans under starter\u0027s orders for Somerset Park charity racenight in aid of Ian McCall\u0027s player fundInternet supporters\u0027 team KaisAyr is staging the bash this Saturday night in United\u0027s Hospitality Suite.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson10:56, 23 AUG 2018NewsAyr\u0027s Craig McGuffie and Alan Forrest go for a ride with mascot Pandamonium \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThey’re under starter’s orders for a top night of action at Somerset Park this Saturday.

Pupils, parents and teachers surrounded the car park of Kyle Academy to show their appreciation of Gavin Drysdale, who smashed a world record at the European World Para Athletics in Berlin. S6 pupil Gavin, of Ayr, brought home the gold in the race running 100m category with an incredible time of 17.37 seconds. And he was given a hero’s welcome as he was led in by a bagpipe performance. He made his way round the hundreds of emotional crowd, and there was barely a dry eye to be seen. It was clear to see how much Gavin had brought the community together, and how immensely proud they were of the superstar. A teacher was even seen asking “is my mascara running?”, which summed up the emotional parade for Gavin. And it was so clear to see how delighted Gavin was with the turnout, with pupils even running over to grab selfies with him. A buzzing Gavin said: “The reception I got coming back to school was overwhelming. “I wasn’t expecting anything like that reaction I got, it was great. “Kyle Academy are always very supportive of any competition I am doing.” Gavin, 17, has cerebral palsy and has been race running for 10 years. He trains at Dam Park, and when he started way back in 2008 he was the only race runner from Scotland. Now there are over 100 competitors from the country.  He is part of the race running club which is supported by Blue Rock Insurance Brokers. The race club is a branch of Ayr Seaforth and is coached by David Phee. Gavin also trains at Red Star in Glasgow with Janice Eaglesham. And the race running has came so far since he started, and these games have helped it get well on its way to being a part of the Paralympic games. Gavin competed in a special racing trike, which has impressive Continental tyres on it. Gavin is still on cloud nine after bagging the top prize in Berlin. He said: “When I won I was totally stunned. “I felt like I had already won a gold medal just by being there, so the fact I actually won was amazing!”  All the way through Gavin’s journey, his mum Margaret and dad Peter have been there supporting him. His family and friends have helped him along the way, and his sister Natalie even had banners up at the family home to celebrate his success for when he got back. Dad Peter said: “We are just so proud of Gavin. “We were so relieved when he won the gold - as we knew how much hard work he put into his progress. “The games went great, and it’s incredible to see how well the Scottish athletes done at the games.  “We have to extend our thanks to Kyle Academy for being so supportive and for this spectacular welcome they have given us.” Gavin isn’t just a star on the track, he has just sailed through S5 picking up an impressive five highers at A and B grades. He was also a part of the Commonwealth games baton relay in 2014. Headteacher for Kyle Academy, Mary Byrne said: “The whole school is so proud of Gavin. “We are delighted that we are able to show our support for him, and everyone at the school is delighted for him.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13159837.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_swr_ayp_010915cinema.jpg","title":"kyle centre ayr bids open","story":"NewsKyle Centre in Ayr bids to open 24 hour Energie Fitness Gym in town centre shopping mallBosses say the move is part of a strategy to keep the ailing retail hub sustainable in the long term.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson16:44, 29 AUG 2018NewsKyle Centre manager Fiona Paton \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailShopping bosses want to launch a 24 hour gym in Ayr town centre, the Ayrshire Post can reveal. The ailing Kyle Centre is to lodge plans for a round the clock fitness facility. Retail chiefs want to rival Heathfield’s bid for a similar project on the outskirts of town. Both are now set to go before South Ayrshire Council in a battle for planning permission. Kyle Centre boss, Fiona Paton, said: “Lifestyles and work patterns are changing and we believe there is demand for this. “There is no escaping that we, as a centre, need to evolve and we’ve had to adapt our business model since I came here 10 years ago. “Opening a gym is part of that direction of travel and can help sustain the centre moving forward.” Energie Fitness has agreed a deal to open an 8000sq foot unit within the barren centre. And bosses claim their stalling dream to open a cinema is far from dead.  Negotiations, understood to be with screen giant Odeon, have so far failed to bear fruit. But Fiona, 48, said: “This sits separately from our plan to open the cinema, which very much remains the long term aim. “Unfortunately it has taken longer than we’d have liked but we are getting there with it. “I can understand why some people have given up on the Kyle Centre – but I wouldn’t be here unless we had a bright future. “We have private investment and our vision is very clear, it is just a matter of staying patient. “People say that our success is vital to the town and that is true. “There is a lot going on in Ayr at the moment and a prosperous Kyle Centre is key to that.” We revealed earlier this summer that retail rivals Heathfield had signed a deal with the Gym Group to open a 24 hour gym. Both plans are now subject to council approval.

much loved Scottish meals with a distinct Bajan twist.\nThe now popular festival had humble beginnings in the 1990s when a Welsh men\u0026rsquos choir travelled to the island to perform in a local concert hall.\nSince then, the celebration has expanded and has featured Celtic acts from Canada, across the UK, Ireland, the USA and even Australia.\nFestival director Carol Anderson from Edinburgh

used in practice.\n\u0026ldquoIn the last year there have been 15 dog control notices with two pending, although there are some issues with obtaining owner details. Some owners just need to be spoken to and advised of their responsibilities.\nDog control orders allow Scottish Borders Council to impose certain conditions on dog owners. For example, a dog which frequently runs away may be required to be kept on a lead at all times, or an aggressive dog may have to be muzzled when in public spaces.\nThe control orders can also be used to compel dog owners to seek training for themselves and their pet. Failure to adhere to a dog control order could lead to a ban from keeping animals or the dog being put down.\nA Scottish Borders Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe council is currently reviewing its responsible dog ownership strategy, which will aim to remind owners of their social and legal responsibilities.\n\u0026ldquoAs part of this strategy, the council works in partnership with local and national charities to promote responsible ownership and dog control by educating the public at ious events across the Borders.\n\u0026ldquoThe council responds to all complaints received concerning out of control dogs, but in order to assist us in investigating each complaint fully, we ideally require the dog owner\u0026rsquos details.\n\u0026ldquoMembers of the public can contact 0300 100 1800 or visit www.scotborders.gov.uk if they have a concern about a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour.\nMs Grahame added: \u0026ldquoMy main concern is that members of the public may not be aware that if a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour is causing concern, for example being allowed to be out of control, they can report it to the council through this route.\n\u0026ldquoThe police, of course, deal with the most serious incidents.

B-listed Gothic church would be uneconomical.\nAt a meeting of Scottish Borders Council\u0026rsquos planning and building standards committee on Monday, principal planning officer Barry Fotheringham said demolition was the only economically viable option left.\nHe said: \u0026ldquoThe building is not physically incapable of repair, therefore the overriding principle that needs to be satisfied is one of economic viability.\n\u0026ldquoThis application is supported by feasibility reports and valuations which estimate the building is beyond the point of economic repair.\n\u0026ldquoVarious options have been explored, including the conversion of the church into residential properties, though this would incur a loss of \u0026pound700,000, based on 2018 costs.\n\u0026ldquoAn alternative scheme for a development which would retain the front facade of the church and the spire was also evaluated, and this would potentially result in a loss of around \u0026pound1m.\n\u0026ldquoThe applicant provided subsequent figures that would need to be invested in order to make a profit. \u0026nbsp\n\u0026ldquoThese assessments conclude that in order to make a reasonable profit, 29 units would be required on site, with 24 units behind the facade and five on the site behind the church.\n\u0026ldquoIt is accepted that not all options have been explored, but it is reasonable to assume that the applicant has demonstrated that a substantial and likely inappropriate development would be required to make the scheme viable.\n\u0026ldquoI am satisfied that the viability argument has been met.\nSpeaking in favour of allowing the demolition, East Berwickshire councillor Helen Laing said: \u0026ldquoI just think this is really, really sad to lose this fabulous building.

local schools.If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved  school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities.Council authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system.Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is of course partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms so as to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew’s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus

is encouraging those working within the industry to make safety a priority.FSPS, which consists of key industry stakeholders, will focus on different types of farming activities, each quarter, to deliver key messages and encourage those working and living on Scotland’s farms and crofts to take action.This week, the campaign, trailing on from Farm Safety Week in July, is urging people to make an active choice about their safety and will focus on the following between September and November: general maintenance on farm, falls from heights and safety at harvest.Last year there were 33 deaths in the agricultural industry in the UK, with five in Scotland.The most common causes of death in the agricultural industry continues to involve falls, transport, animals and equipment.Over the last five years 38 people have been killed in the UK by a moving vehicle 12 people have been killed by contact with machinery 10 have been killed by asphyxiation or drowning, including in grain stores or pits and slurry pits and eight people have been killed by contact with electricity.This data does not take into account the number of injuries on Scotland’s farms and crofts, a number that is believed to be significantly higher.For those amidst harvest, it is essential that they practice the ‘Safe Stop’ method when working with machinery, equipment and vehicles \u0026#8211 handbrake on, controls in neutral, engine off, keys out.Anyone working with equipment or machinery should also be appropriately trained, with full risk assessments carried out, particularly when working near power lines.Speaking on behalf of FSPS, NFU Scotland chief executive Scott Walker commented: \u0026#8216One death or injury on Scotland’s farms and crofts is frankly one too many and as an industry we need to take action to make a conscious effort to put our safety, and that of those living and working around us as a priority.\u0026#8216Whether it is carrying out maintenance to a roof, checking over a machine, or working in a field with power lines, injuries and deaths through accidents most of the time are preventable by taking simple steps and precautions.\u0026#8216This campaign encourages farmers and crofters to make a point of ensuring their working environment is safe, to help us work together to reduce the death and injury toll on our farms and crofts.\u0026#8216This autumn, it is about your Safety, your Choice, and as the darker nights draw in, and many are rushing to get the job done it is important to take a step back to make sure you are working safely.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter dogs are not sensible cycling accessories","story":"I was interested at your article about the Bartholomew family and their cycling exploits.As

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.

If approved, the merger would follow the expected merger of Haddington Infant School and King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School, which have Jacqui McKinnon, headteacher at Cockenzie Primary School, as interim headteacher until their formal merger goes ahead.  According to the Prestonpans proposal, the two schools would \u0026lsquoclose\u0026rsquo in February \u0026ldquoor as soon as possible thereafter, with a new non-denominational primary school then created. The town\u0026rsquos St Gabriel\u0026rsquos Primary School would be unaffected.  The merged school would continue to operate over the two sites within the existing buildings and facilities, but with a single management team.  Currently, Prestonpans Infant and Nursery School, on West Loan, has a school roll of 358 up to P3, with the primary school, on Preston Road, home to 332 pupils from P4 to P7.  The leadership of Prestonpans Early Learning and Childcare Centre, which opened last year on Kirk Street to provide additional nursery places for the town, would also transfer to the headteacher of the new single school structure if the move goes ahead.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, was surprised to hear the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoFirstly, I would like to see the details of it and what is behind the proposals because the infant school is a superbly-run school and works exceptionally well.  \u0026ldquoThe primary school is a very well-run and successful school as well \u0026ndash we have got two very well-run and successful schools.  \u0026ldquoWe would need to look at what the implications are.  Fiona Robertson, East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos head of education, stressed the local authority was \u0026ldquoabsolutely committed to continuously improving the quality of education at the two schools.  She said: \u0026ldquoOur Education Service Local Improvement Plan sets out a range of key outcomes, one of which is to ensure consistency in our approaches to planning learning, teaching and assessment.  \u0026ldquoWe believe that the proposal to establish a single school operating under a single management team offers the best solution to ensuring this consistency, improving transitions for children, and will deliver considerable educational benefits to all of the schools\u0026rsquo children and young people.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet member for education and children\u0026rsquos services, said: \u0026ldquoOur first priority is to ensure that we provide the best educational experiences and outcomes for the children and young people of Prestonpans. The consultation process will focus on how we do this through an educational benefit statement.  \u0026ldquoWe have already informed the chairs of the parent councils of this proposal.  \u0026ldquoAll parents, carers and the wider school community will have the opportunity to comment on the proposal once the consultation has been published and the statutory consultation period begins on Monday.

And it takes the masterplan a stage further with more detailed ideas for each of the zones proposed in its vision, including calling for the Scottish Government to be invited to base its HQ for its proposed state company on the site, as well as suggesting offshore windfarm company Inch Cape \u0026ndash which wants to place a substation on the land to bring energy ashore from proposed turbines \u0026ndash should also be encouraged to put its Scottish base there.  The community council document comes in the wake of a brochure produced by neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council promoting its vision of a Port of Prestonpans cruise terminal at the former power station site.  That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.  Graeme Jeffrey, community council chairman, said: \u0026ldquoAs a community council we are promoting our vision of what we would like to see.

Plans lodged with East Lothian Council are split into two.  The design and access statement states: \u0026ldquoThe brief is twofold: to diversify the core business on the site with the introduction of small-scale gin and whisky distillation to enable the production of speciality spirits for sale within the business pub chain.  \u0026ldquoSecondly, in light of the increasing demand for both brewery tours and the use of the Monk\u0026rsquos Retreat as a function venue, it is felt that the facilities require being upgraded, both in terms of general amenity, improving the visitor experience and to provide for the disabled visitor with the addition of a platform lift and accessible toilet.  A spokeswoman for owners Greene King explained why they were looking to diversify at the site, on Belhaven\u0026rsquos Brewery Lane.  She said: \u0026ldquoLike any business we are always exploring options to develop our business and facilities. The recent planning application is just one of many opportunities we are considering but no decision has been made yet about whether it is an option we will pursue if planning permission is granted.  In terms of the production of gin and whisky, a still house would be created.  According to the design and access statement: \u0026ldquoThe distillery will be designed to produce 250 litres of spirit a day. It will be unique in the marketplace, making spirit from the same wurt as the beer.  \u0026ldquoThe spirit will be a mixture of Scotch whisky, gin and rum.  \u0026ldquoThis volume and complexity will mean that the brewery will need to employ an additional person to run the distillery.  \u0026ldquoIn time the site would like to re-instate a historical greenhouse within the gardens in order to grow their own botanicals to add to the gin however, this will be part of a separate application.  The new still house would mirror the mash house, which was given planning permission in January 2011, in terms of its look.  It is two storeys, with a more modern design than some of the historic buildings on-site.  If the plans were given the green light, work would also be carried out at the main building on the Belhaven site.  A museum is already in place on the ground floor of the main building, with a pub on the first floor.  Plans show a refurbishment of both floors as \u0026ldquothe existing interiors are now tired and dated and in need of a revamp.  The application, which could go before members of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee later this year, adds: \u0026ldquoConsidering the site\u0026rsquos historic importance both locally and within Scotland, it is clear that any development both internally and externally requires to be sensitive.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to recognise the value of this development in terms of the improved visitor experience, which will impact visitor numbers to the area as a whole, and the business diversification."},{"url":null,"title":"avid-lynyrd-skynyrd-fan-pens-foreword-to-new-book-about-his-idols","story":"  Iain Monk has contributed to The Gospel According to Abraham by Paul Abraham, who was the American band\u0026rsquos road manager for a decade.

Iain said: \u0026ldquoI became an instant fan of the band in the 1970s and was instantaneously hooked by the music, that kind of southern rock music.  \u0026ldquoMy obsession for the band just grew from there but the first time I saw them live was in 1988 in New York when I flew over to see them.  \u0026ldquoI had written to the band\u0026rsquos management to see if they could help me with tickets and I think they were impressed that I was coming from Scotland to see the band.  \u0026ldquoThat relationship grew with management, road crew and members of the band and I started following them across America.  Iain, who lives in Gullane, has spent countless hours travelling across the globe to see his idols perform at 31 shows, ranging from New York, Boston and Washington to Belgium, the Netherlands and all across the UK.  His friendship with band members and those associated with the band has even seen him spend a week at the family home of Randall Hall, who was the band\u0026rsquos guitarist, in Florida. A friendship also grew with Paul Abraham, with Iain interviewing the road manager for his Lynyrd Skynyrd blog about his intention to write a book.  Iain said the band, which was formed in 1969 and continued following the tragic death of lead singer Ronnie Van Zant in 1977, were \u0026ldquoamazing live but also \u0026ldquolovely people.  He added: \u0026ldquoThey are down to earth, very friendly people in my experience and the people that formed the band are very approachable.  \u0026ldquoI have been very, very fortunate that I have been given access to the band over the years.  \u0026ldquoThat is something most fans would simply not get and I think that is down to trust and trusting me not to take advantage of their generosity.

ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad that there is going to be a hearing on this application.  \u0026ldquoI, of course, would prefer if members of the public could also speak at the hearing to give their views and opinions but I do think that community councils being invited is a welcome step.  \u0026ldquoOf course, this is again lengthening the process of the application out. If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.

He said: \u0026ldquoUsing the flood mark in the video-still as a reference, I got a friend who has access to a theodolite to use this and project this water level to other landmarks around the river and town centre.  \u0026ldquoRobert Byers from Haddington Camera Club then used his photo editing skills and a photoshop \u0026lsquoflood\u0026rsquo plug-in to reconstruct the photos.  In August 1948, persistent heavy rainfall saw the county face its most serious flooding in history.  Although much of East Lothian was affected, Haddington took a major hit. High Street as far west as the Town House was under several feet of water which stretched to the gates of Amisfield Park, a distance of more than half a mile.  Distillery Park, the Nungate, Peffers Place and Brewery Park were similarly devastated.  The Biel Burn also flooded, submerging all the low-lying land north and west of West Barns.  The flood occurred as the culmination of a period of truly exceptional rainfall \u0026ndash 122 mm of rain fell between August 1 and 8, followed by 153 mm in the next five days.  The saturated ground then received a huge 139 mm of rain in the next 24 hours, bringing severe flooding across the county.  The Haddingtonshire Courier reported on \u0026ldquodisastrous flooding without parallel in living memory \u0026ndash if not in history.  In the August 20, 1948 edition of the Courier, \u0026ldquoserious damage was inflicted on the banks of the River Tyne while other streams burst their banks and \u0026ldquoleft destruction in their wake.  It added: \u0026ldquoSo heavy was the flood of water that the streams made courses for themselves, with the result that many people were flooded out of house and home.  \u0026ldquoOne of the worst areas to suffer was Haddington, where a large number of people were rendered homeless, while shops and business premises were flooded to a depth of several feet.  Meanwhile at West Barns, the Biel Burn overflowed, causing serious damage to houses and shops in the village but fortunately \u0026ldquono loss of life is reported, although some people had narrow escapes, so suddenly did the water levels rise.  The floods also caused serious damage to crops on farms close to the Tyne and extensive damage was also caused to the now-demolished New County Cinema on Hardgate.  Nungate residents who had been enjoying the evening\u0026rsquos film were instructed by cinema management to return home to avoid being cut off as water levels rapidly rose.  And slightly further afield, the electricity supply in Gifford and Saltoun was interrupted, and at the Maltings in Haddington the sub-station was completely swept away. It was anticipated it would take many months for the affected areas to return to normal, and calls for assistance to help with the recovery were issued."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-the-commodore-of-haddington","story":"  TEENAGERS often get a bad press. To be sure, it\u0026rsquos a time when parents wonder what has happened to their children and feel they have lost them or gone wrong somewhere. This is because teenage years are a time of great change in terms of brain development. Quite literally the teenage brain is being remodelled and new priorities and emotions are created as a result.  It\u0026rsquos a time when peers and their approval become more important than parents or family, or almost anything else. Taking risks, or doing seemingly foolish things, are all part of this. We are familiar with the term \u0026lsquopeer pressure\u0026rsquo, but in our teenage years, approval by our peers and being included by them takes on a massive importance. It is an essential part of growing up and creating a new self-identity.  And a story from over 200 years ago shows that although the word teenager may not have been invented, and that there was no such thing as \u0026lsquoyouth culture\u0026rsquo as we now know it, behaviour was much the same.  It involves a group of young men who we would now call teenagers. They were a group of friends from Haddington. They included George Neill, John and William Haldane who were brothers, Peter Martine, Benjie Hunter and John Davie, whose nickname was \u0026lsquoLettie\u0026rsquo. They were all from Haddington, and their escapade became a story told well into their senior years. The nickname \u0026lsquoCommodore\u0026rsquo was coined for George on this day and stayed with him until he took it to his grave many years later.  Much of the tale is left to the imagination but the essentials were well told. One of the group came up with the idea of hiring a boat and heading out to Fife. These young men were not from poor backgrounds and so had the means to do this. So with the madcap plan devised, they set off as a group to the fishing village of Prestonpans.  The negotiations to hire a boat were concluded and they set off for the foreign shore of Fife, aiming for the town of Kirkcaldy. I cannot comment on their sailing abilities but they must have had some experience for they successfully navigated themselves to the shore of the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo, possibly using the Lomond hills as a marker.  They came ashore like invading Vikings, intent on mischief. No social media in those days, but each town had a drummer who would disseminate news. And so they found Kirkcaldy\u0026rsquos drummer and paid him to announce to the town that at three in the afternoon there would be a spectacular diving and swimming show at the harbour entrance. The drummer set forth announcing the news, creating an air of expectation.  The group chose Lettie to be the performer. He was the best swimmer amongst them. As 3 o\u0026rsquoclock approached, a large excited crowd assembled on the harbour walls. The Haddington lads looked at each other with wry smiles and secret sniggers. Their ruse had worked, perhaps too successfully.  \u0026ldquoShow them what ye can dae, Lettie was told by his friends. And so Lettie stood on the edge of the boat and dived into the sea, from a height of about two feet. The crowd was silent, except for a wee five-year-old girl who clapped. She was the only one impressed by the spectacle.  There were murmurings as the Kirkcaldy folk began to realise they had been duped and were being made a fool of by these young Haddington lads. The mood began to get angry, and boos were followed by threats and words I cannot print here. It was clear it was time to go.  \u0026ldquoThank ye, the lads said, bowing to the crowd and laughing, mocking them for being so gullible. Stones began to fly towards them as they set off back towards Prestonpans, gesturing to the now-furious crowd. The lads in the boat were hysterical with laughter. They had raided and fooled the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo.  But then their laughter stopped. Emerging from the harbour was a boat filled with angry Kirkcaldy lads who were shouting serious threats. The prank looked as if it might end unpleasantly so the Haddington lads had no choice but to row for their lives.  George took command. His friends had nicknamed him the Commodore at the beginning of their voyage, not so much because of his nautical skills but because of his leadership qualities. They were now desperately needed.  \u0026ldquoRow lads, row, he called on them. To be truthful the Haddington lads were at a disadvantage. They were not skilled seamen and in truth they were more bookish than brawn. But fear can do mighty things to a man\u0026rsquos capabilities, and as the adrenaline pumped through their veins they found levels of strength they didn\u0026rsquot know they had. They rowed like true Vikings, heave ho, heave ho. The sea splashed at their feet, their hearts nearly burst, but they kept the pace.  Slowly they began to pull ahead from the Kirkcaldy boat. \u0026ldquoKeep rowing, lads, dinnae look back, dinnae slow doon, called George, who was himself rowing as hard as he could. The tide was strong, the night was drawing in and the weather was beginning to change. The Kirkcaldy boat turned back, but the Haddington lads dare not attempt a Fife landing. They had no choice but to cross the Firth.  Darkness fell, then a thick haar covered them in freezing mist. They rowed through the night not sure in which direction they were headed. They wondered if their parents would ever know what had happened to them if, as now seemed likely, they were lost at sea.  The morning sun slowly burned off the mist. Thankfully they were still in the Firth, and there in front of them was the smoke coming from the lums and salt works of Prestonpans. They wept with relief and summoned up their last drops of energy to row ashore. Their final few hundred metres to the stony beach was watched by village children and women drying clothes.  Some fishermen helped pull the boat to land and the Haddington lads literally collapsed out of the vessel onto the beach, utterly exhausted but elated to be still alive.  George Neill was later to become a well-respected Baillie in Haddington, a bookseller and publisher of great local repute. He outlived his friends who had shared that day of adventure and danger.  He was often asked by those who knew him less well: \u0026ldquoWhy do people call you the Commodore? He never tired of telling the tale of his teenage adventure."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-secondary-schools-delighted-with-pupils-exam-results","story":"  This year saw the best pass rate in Higher exams across East Lothian for five years.  East Lothian Council said that pupils across its six secondary schools \u0026ndash Musselburgh Grammar School Knox Academy, Haddington North Berwick High School Preston Lodge High School in Prestonpans Ross High School, Tranent and Dunbar Grammar School \u0026ndash improved their performances, with the number of Highers passed going up to more than 79 per cent.  Lauren Rodger, headteacher at North Berwick High School, told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results are brilliant and we\u0026rsquore really pleased with how all the current sixth year pupils have performed.  \u0026ldquoI know schools are judged on their exam results, but for us it\u0026rsquos also about seeing the pupils develop \u0026ndash that\u0026rsquos the most pleasing part.  Similarly pleased was Paul Reynolds, the Ross High School headteacher.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are delighted with the exam results.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results have been record-breaking and the sixth-years who have just left us have got really positive results that will allow them to hopefully go to uni or further education.  Meanwhile, Musselburgh Grammar School is celebrating record attainment levels for S5 and S6 pupils at all levels in this year\u0026rsquos exam results.  Headteacher Colin Gerrie said that there were also many \u0026ldquoexcellent results achieved by pupils in S4.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe results achieved by our students this year are exceptionally good and continue the successes of recent years, with school records broken on an annual basis.  \u0026ldquoWe do not underestimate the hard work of our pupils and the commitment of our teachers to make this happen.  His counterpart at Preston Lodge High School, Gavin Clark, also gave his thoughts.  At PL, four S5 pupils achieved six As at Higher, although the number of pupils gaining one, two, three or four Highers dropped from the last set of results.  Mr Clark added: \u0026ldquoWe expected that to happen, as a result of our regular tracking process.  \u0026ldquoThis dip in no way diminishes the achievements of those who performed so impressively in examinations.  At Knox Academy, new headteacher Susan Cook gave an update on how the school was performing.  She said: \u0026ldquoSeventy-four per cent of S4 pupils attained five or more qualifications at National 3 69 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 4 and 47 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 5 at grades A-C and 55 per cent at grades A-D.  \u0026ldquoThere were some outstanding individual performances in S4, with eight of our candidates achieving seven A passes at N5.  \u0026ldquoThese results are a really strong foundation to build S5 performance upon and I would encourage all parents/carers to continue to support their child to study at home as the transition from S4 to S5 in terms of challenge and pace moves up a few gears and much more study is required, especially at Higher level.  Meanwhile, the performance of S5 pupils in their Higher exams was down on the previous three years.  Ms Cook added: \u0026ldquoFifty-five per cent attained one or more Highers 35 per cent three or more and 16 per cent attained five or more Highers.  \u0026ldquoTwenty-two of our pupils achieved five Highers and some with straights As across all subjects.  \u0026ldquoMany other pupils achieved a mixture of Higher and National 5 awards and will build upon these in their sixth year.  Finally, there was \u0026ldquoan improving trend for S6 pupils over the last four years at Higher level, Ms Cook added.  The headteacher said: \u0026ldquoThose attaining one or more Highers was 62 per cent and then added to their results from S4 and S5  this rose to 76.22 per cent having achieved one or more Highers over S5/S6 \u0026ndash one per cent lower than last year, which in terms of statistics is not significant. However, it\u0026rsquos more than 13 per cent more than pupils attained in 2015 and 2016.  \u0026ldquoThirty per cent of the year group attained three or more Highers and the accumulate total was 66 per cent .  Finally, Claire Slowther, headteacher at Dunbar Grammar School, told the Courier that the staff at the school were \u0026ldquovery pleased with the exam results and said: \u0026ldquoAt Dunbar Grammar we are very pleased with the SQA results our students have achieved.  \u0026ldquoIt is wonderful to see the hard work of our students be rewarded with great results.  \u0026ldquoOur excellent team of teachers always work hard to support and challenge students and we were all really delighted to see them do well.  \u0026ldquoWe are incredibly proud of the achievements of our students and are looking forward to celebrating these at our awards evening, which will be held on September 12."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-longniddry-south-to-go-on-display","story":"  Developers Cruden Homes  and ZeroC will be displaying their proposals for development at the Longniddry Inn on Wednesday from 3pm to 8pm.

That project came about following rising safety concerns from drivers who did not feel confident using the unlit road.  Since then, driver confidence has improved by 78 per cent, with the project, which was undertaken by UK-based Clearview Intelligence in partnership with Transport Scotland and Amey, shortlisted in the Road Safety, Traffic Management and Enforcement category at the National Transport Awards, which take place in October.  Councillor Norman Hampshire, a Dunbar ward councillor and deputy leader of East Lothian Council, as well as chairman of the A1 Action Group, was one of those hailing the project as a big success.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe installation of the studs has, in my view, revolutionised the driving experience on the A1 after dark.  \u0026ldquoThe studs have improved night-time visibility beyond all recognition along certain parts of the route.  Concerns about driving conditions on the unlit road were first raised by the A1 Action Group, which comprises councillors from Scottish Borders and East Lothian Councils, transportation groups and community councils.  Transport Scotland met with the action group and, upon investigating the road, recognised that entering or exiting the A1 during the hours of darkness was a key area of concern due to a lack of visibility, junction definition and consistency in signage and road markings.  Clearview Intelligence was then appointed by Amey to make improvements to the road as part of a wider project and installed the road studs to give a visual consistency to the route by ensuring all major junctions were visible and treated similarly.  This included using white, red, amber and green studs to effectively highlight road edges, the centre of the road and junctions.  Andy Salotti, director of solutions at Clearview Intelligence, said: \u0026ldquoWe are immensely proud of the work we did to improve the driving conditions on the A1 and delighted this has been recognised at a national level.

They said the only way to make the \u0026ldquonumbers add up was to create a mixed use site with housing and industry.  But their claims were rejected by councillors after Provost John McMillan , cabinet spokesman on economic development, insisted: \u0026ldquoIf we build it, they will come.  The quote, paraphrasing one made famous in the US baseball movie Field of Dreams starring Kevin Costner, came as he backed council officials who recommended the plans from Barratt and site owners The Co-operative be thrown out.  Jason Watt, from Barratt, told a meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington last Tuesday that site drainage and geology issues meant it would cost \u0026pound1.5m to get ready for development.  Once general costs were taken into account, the total development bill would be \u0026pound2.25m \u0026ndash yet the value of the land was estimated at only \u0026pound1.1m.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe numbers clearly do not add up and never will unless there is cross subsidising with a mixed use development.  Ward councillor Kenny McLeod  backed the Barratt proposal, highlighting the lack of council housing available for rent in Tranent: the proposed Barratt development included 25 per cent affordable housing.  Mr McLeod said: \u0026ldquoWe need to keep the local connection and they are not building housing for rent in this area.  \u0026ldquoIt must be 50 years since a house was put in the area for rent.  However, fellow Tranent, Wallyford and Macmerry councillor Colin McGinn  said he was concerned about the traffic that would be created by more than 100 homes on the site, which is on the opposite side of the town\u0026rsquos Haddington Road from Steading View.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe have a responsibility within Tranent to increase employment and opportunities for our young people.  Councillor Brian Small , opposition leader, told the committee: \u0026ldquoThere is no point in having a [Local Development] Plan if at the first turn we think we can turn it over. We need to give this business land the opportunity to develop.  The committee was told that while the district valuer had agreed with developers that the land was not financially viable as a single business plot, they had said it could be made financially sound by developing it in phases.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoWe have enough land set aside for housing.  \u0026ldquoPeople want \u0026ndashand need \u0026ndash local employment and if we build it they will come. This is a signal to developers we want to grow the number of jobs around the county.  The committee voted by nine votes to two to support the officials\u0026rsquo recommendation to refuse the plans."},{"url":null,"title":"transport-co2-emissions-on-the-rise-in-east-lothian","story":"  The latest data from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has revealed that CO2 emissions from freight and passenger transport rose by 4.2 per cent in the county between 2011 and 2016.  That means traffic was responsible for 18.5 per cent of the total amount of carbon dioxide released in East Lothian in 2016.  But in total, CO2 emissions in the county fell over the same period.  Jason Rose, from East Lothian Greens, blamed more housing developments in East Lothian for the rise in CO2 from emissions relating to transport.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoTo live [in the new developments], you need a car. More houses means more cars.  Mr Rose also highlighted the fact that nearly half of East Lothian residents commute to Edinburgh every day for work.  \u0026ldquoThe main issue is half the people who live in East Lothian work in Edinburgh, so they have to commute, he said.  \u0026ldquoBuses take a long time, you want cheap and reliable.  \u0026ldquoWith trains, there definitely needs to be more of an effort to improve length and frequency.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council should be trying to increase employment in East Lothian, so people don\u0026rsquot need to commute.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove heard some people say, \u0026lsquooh what if you open a bridge here or build another road?\u0026rsquo but creating more roads just increases traffic and spreads the problem around.  Overall, emissions from transport, both private and for business purposes, increased by 3.5 per cent in the UK over the period between 2011 and 2016.  However, total CO2 emissions fell by 4.6 per cent over the five years in East Lothian.  The county was responsible for releasing 1.1 million tonnes of CO2 in 2016 \u0026ndash down from 1.15 million tonnes five years earlier.  But Mr Rose highlighted that it was not just CO2 emissions that needed to be monitored.  \u0026ldquoWe need to watch for NO2  and PM10  \u0026ndash those are the pollutants that can cause health risks, he added.  In East Lothian, industrial and commercial activities are by far the main producer of CO2 emissions, releasing 63.9 per cent of the total. In 2016, households produced 16 per cent of the CO2 in the county, lower than five years earlier.  The Department also takes into account the amount of CO2 produced by farms and through other rural activities and the CO2 removed from the air by trees.  According to its estimates, these agricultural activities produced more greenhouse gases than forests removed, and so were responsible for 1.6 per cent of the carbon emissions in East Lothian in 2016.  Overall, the UK reduced its carbon emissions by 15.4 per cent over the five years."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  We\u0027ll also reveal the Top 25 in this year\u0027s Pet Idol competition.

Jane said: \u0026ldquoWhat I have been really impressed with is the way the club and coaches have adapted to him.  \u0026ldquoThere is mainstream gymnastics but they have adapted lessons for his needs.  \u0026ldquoIt has made him not feel different and he still feels part of the club \u0026ndash he really enjoys it.  \u0026ldquoCameron\u0026rsquos disability comes under Global Development Delay.  \u0026ldquoHe has a real difficulty with comprehension and understanding what is being asked of him, following instructions.  \u0026ldquoHe is also very sensitive to noise and sudden loud noises.  \u0026ldquoThat is what they have managed to do really well, break it down into small parts for him.  \u0026ldquoThrough time, it becomes a routine and he understands what is being asked of him.  Jane, who lives near Gifford, has been a keen swimmer for a number of years and represented Scotland in the 1994 Commonwealth Games, in Canada.  However, after a break from swimming she returned to the pool at the beginning of the year before swapping the pool for the sea earlier this summer.  She said: \u0026ldquoI kept swimming as a hobby and to keep fit.  \u0026ldquoI have always swam but it has always been indoor swimming.  \u0026ldquoI started looking about and had always had an interest in open-water swimming but never did it.  \u0026ldquoI came across the Firth of Forth swim and that quite appeals to me and thought I would give it a go.  The mum-of-two signed up in March for the swim, which sees swimmers head off from Hawes Pier and swim alongside the Forth Bridge towards North Queensferry.  Swimmers set off at 2.10pm and have an hour to complete the 1.4-mile swim.  In preparation for the fundraiser on September 22, Jane has taken to the waters off Dumfries and Galloway\u0026rsquos coast and has also linked up with the Bass Rock Swimmers, who are based in North Berwick.  Despite being an accomplished swimmer, Jane said there were still challenges.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe currents are certainly a big factor.  \u0026ldquoIt is just your awareness and you can go off track very easily and just that anticipation of what is below you and what you are swimming over.  \u0026ldquoI have enjoyed the challenge and it has certainly put me out of my comfort zone.  \u0026ldquoI have really enjoyed it and met some really lovely people.  \u0026ldquoMy thanks go to my husband, Garry, and family for support and encourage to take on the challenge and to Duo Gymnastics Club for the support and help they have given Cameron.  Pamela Fletcher, from the gymnastics club, said: \u0026ldquoThanks to Jane undertaking the swim, the club can purchase a new and much needed vaulting table for the gymnastics at Aubigny Sport Centre. Due to local support we have now met our target however donations continue meaning we can hopefully purchase some more equipment.

I\u0026rsquom now in my late 50s, and 60 is looming ahead of me like a cat waiting to pounce and have cruel fun. Yet I know people who are in their 30s and 40s who are much older than me, and folk in their 60s and above who are younger. My oldest daughter is in her early 20s and is already lamenting the fact she is no longer \u0026lsquoyoung\u0026rsquo.  The truth is that age is a mentality or, as is often said, \u0026lsquojust a number\u0026rsquo. Of course, deteriorating health and pain can come with age, as I have experienced, but even then, getting this far makes me very thankful despite the wear and tear.  I often say that life is like toothpaste: we use it with abandon at first and then, as we realise it\u0026rsquos running out, each squirt becomes increasingly more precious and satisfying.  \u0026ldquoA whole summer seems nothing these days, it\u0026rsquos over before you get used to it, a friend said to me recently. And indeed it is nothing if we measure it by days passed.  Yet if we measure not the passing of hours, days or years but the accumulation of memories and experiences, then time seems longer, both in quantity and quality. The trick, then, is to make those experiences and memories, and to truly live in them as they happen. This means understanding what is truly meaningful to us, and what gives genuine joy and fulfilment.  I think that is the secret to a long life, regardless of what number you reach. It\u0026rsquos not just about how much toothpaste is in your tube, it\u0026rsquos about how much you savour and use the amount you have. All of us savour key moments, of course. The first day at school for our children, our holiday time, time with friends or spent doing things we enjoy.  Yet inevitably such moments are less common than what we might call the daily routine of life. I suppose that\u0026rsquos what makes them stand out. Thus the daily routine of \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo life shoots us by, almost without us noticing. And that\u0026rsquos most of our life.  And so I am now more determined than ever to make my life \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo for as long as I may have left. This isn\u0026rsquot a commitment to hippy living in a campervan  but a conscious decision to savour every day as if it were my last. And what really helped me in this realisation was a conversation one day while waiting for a train. . .  One spring morning just before this summer, I was standing on the platform at Prestonpans station waiting for a train. I was not used to getting this early train and was surprised how busy it was. I was heading into Edinburgh to do some storytelling and so unusually sharing my journey with commuters.  It was a beautiful warm sunny morning, the herald of the heatwave soon to arrive. As I waited for the train I scrolled on my phone. Then I heard a voice behind me saying: \u0026ldquoOn your death bed, will you really look fondly back on the countless hours, equivalent to years of your life, spent scrolling on a phone? Will you remember just one per cent of that activity, or even want to?  I turned round to see who was speaking to me there was nobody. Then I noticed the hawthorn tree.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos better, the hawthorn said. It was resplendent with blossom, leaning over the edge of the side of the bridge which takes the cars below the station.  Perhaps I had seen it before, but this time I really noticed it because it had spoken to me. I studied its flowers and took in the immense beauty of it. It\u0026rsquos perfectly situated to admire, but the hawthorn seemed sad.  \u0026ldquoCan you imagine the effort it takes to get this magnificent and beautiful? it said. \u0026ldquoYet nobody seems to notice me.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure they do, I replied. \u0026ldquoNo, they don\u0026rsquot watch, insisted the tree. And so I did.  The hawthorn was right. People walked past the tree, stood next to it, but nobody seemed to notice it, and certainly nobody took any time to admire it.  \u0026ldquoBut they are busy, I said in our defence.  \u0026ldquoWe are all busy in different ways, said the tree. \u0026ldquoBut we can choose to be \u0026lsquotoo busy\u0026rsquo for some things while being busy doing others. Often you decide what is important to be busy with so you exclude what you think are the less important things.  \u0026ldquoLike looking and admiring you? I replied sarcastically.  \u0026ldquoPrecisely, said the hawthorn, perhaps not understanding a sarcastic tone.  Suddenly the train arrived. People put away their phones and I bade a hasty farewell to the tree. We all crammed into the carriage and it filled up to the brim. I saw the blazing white of the hawthorn\u0026rsquos blossom through the window. Then we headed for Wallyford.  The train ground to a halt and the doors opened. There was a crush and people calling out politely \u0026ldquoplease move up. I wondered if everyone would get on, and I think they did, but only just. Now the train felt overloaded and it literally ground its way out of the station.  When it arrived at Musselburgh, the doors opened to present a human wall made of commuters from the Pans and Wallyford. There was simply no way anyone was getting on. I watched from the privilege of my seat. Two young men with suitcases, obviously going on holiday had no chance, and didn\u0026rsquot even try.  As the train pulled away, leaving dozens of people stranded on the platform, I felt a sense of guilt at having a seat. At Waverley we were trapped in a bottleneck by ticket collectors, ensuring that none of the lucky ones who had actually managed to get onto the train would escape paying for their good fortune.  When I returned I had to cross the bridge to my car. And there was the hawthorn tree, showing off its blossom like a peacock trying to impress a mate with its feather display.  And I have noticed the hawthorn ever since. The blossom faded as summer arrived and now it bears it berries. Its haws glisten where once there was blossom, reminding me that summer has had its course, and asking the question of how I made it memorable.  I am so thankful for the hawthorn\u0026rsquos advice. It was simple but so important. The trick is to live in the moment to notice that which makes the mundane and normal extraordinary or beautiful or special.  We can pepper our daily life with simple but extraordinary moments of connection, so a day never really remains \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo. We just have to truly live in that moment, to come out of our busyness and worries, and savour it.  Maybe the hawthorn tree will speak to you if ever you find yourself at Prestonpans train station. Or maybe someone else will your child, your grandchild, your partner, friends, your grandparents, your work colleague, or perhaps your inner self.  Maybe it wasn\u0026rsquot actually the tree which spoke to me. Perhaps it was my inner self. But then again, perhaps it was a speaking hawthorn, and you have to be \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo to hear it!"},{"url":null,"title":"leader-of-councils-conservative-opposition-steps-down-after-health-issues","story":"  Councillor Brian Small, who has held the position since being one of seven Conservative councillors elected in May 2017, stood down for a brief period last year following a severe bout of sepsis before returning to the post.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In lengthy posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be, if not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to return to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But if this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But if Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8486553.jpg?type=article-full","title":"five-women-in-business-speak-out","story":"  All women can think of another woman who has inspired her to try a career in business, education or industry.

It seemed the perfect job Helen didn\u0026rsquot drink yet was interested in finding out more about the process. Little did she know it would take her life in a whole new direction.  Rather than viewing distilling as chemical engineering, Helen found it felt far more artistic - all based on the creative expression of how it looks, smells and tastes. After inheriting an old family book detailing how her relatives used to distil on the family farm, Helen realised distilling was part of her history and heritage.    With derelict out-buildings on her family\u0026rsquos farm, Helen had a fresh appreciation for these old spaces once viewed as a millstone around her neck. Buildings that were near fresh spring water, surrounded by botanicals created a unique opportunity.  Gin attracted Helen initially as the old distilling manual described how people used to flavour spirits with whatever was around them. The farm had a wealth of natural botanicals, including Scottish juniper, so suddenly this untapped heather hill was incredibly valuable.  The gin is named Badvo, after Helen\u0026rsquos family farm where the stories of distilling inspired Helen when starting out. The heron logo represents the fresh spring water used, as only a very pure spring can support enough fish for a heron. To fund the start-up, Helen pre-sold the first batch of 105 bottles collectively for \u0026pound6,500, going on to use the money to unlock match funding, which snowballed until the entire distillery was grant funded.    Helen commented: \u0026ldquoI got a lot of flak for being a solo entrepreneur. Yes, there are downsides to being a one-man band, but it gives you the opportunity to be dynamic. You can make a decision and you don\u0026rsquot have to justify it to anyone or get it past any board.  \u0026ldquoIt hurts occasionally when people assume someone else set up the distillery as I am too young or too female to have accomplished this alone. I just don\u0026rsquot think some people can comprehend how you can cover so much ground at this stage in life, but I think this is the perfect time.

On the contrary, her peer group expected that students of both sexes could progress to further education, and into careers of our choice. This certainly was Julie\u0026rsquos experience.    Graduating from Glasgow University, Bachelor of Laws with Honours in 1993, Julie then went on to complete the required post-graduate Diploma in Legal Practice in 1994. A legal Traineeship commenced immediately, and she was formally admitted as a solicitor in 1995, at the age of 23. By 27, Julie had been promoted to partner. At that time, she was one of the youngest female partners in a law firm in Scotland. By 2015, more than 60 per cent of solicitors under the age of 40, practising in Scotland, were women \u0026ndash unimaginable in 1995, far less in 1918. For the following 11 years, Julie practised a wide range of areas of law and managed three of her firm\u0027s\u0026nbspbranch offices. She was in charge of HR, and worked long hours.  In 2010, Julie decided to leave the relative security of her large firm behind. Seeking a better work/life balance, she set up her own firm \u0026ndash Millen Solicitors. Hard work continued, and although she faced pressures of a different kind as a sole practitioner, she succeeded in achieving a balance, not only for herself, but for every member of her team.  From the outset, Julie envisaged a practice which would provide an exceptional level of service to clients, and a collegiate and stimulating environment for employees. These values continue at the core of Millen Solicitors as they approach the end of their 8th successful year.    \u0026ldquoFamily Solicitors For Generations is the business maxim, with a nod to their specialisms in all aspects of family law, as well as powers of attorney, wills and executries. Julie and her team provide an outstanding, supportive and compassionate service to families, parents, grandparents and children in times of crisis or uncertainty, at ying stages of their respective lives. Their clients agree, with the majority of work now coming in the form of referrals from satisfied clients, and professional colleagues seeking their expertise.  Julie comments: \u0026ldquoI am proud to have contributed to the cracking of the \u0026ldquoglass ceiling, and I look forward to seeing Scotland\u0026rsquos entrepreneurial women achieve its eventual demise.

Adoboli\u0026rsquos lawyer is preparing a new appeal for the Home Office.  A fund-raising campaign to continue his legal battle to remain in the UK has raised over \u0026pound17,000 Adoboli who is Ghanaian, but has lived in the UK since the age of 12, does not hold British citizenship.    The 38-year-old, who describes himself as British, has since his release from jail given many talks to students, financial traders and others in the banking industry about how to operate ethically and avoid making the mistakes he made.  He had been reporting once a month to the Home Office and had feared that he may be arrested in preparation for deportation after he was denied permission to judicially review the deportation proceedings.  Adoboli has appealed, asking the home secretary, Sajid Javid, not to deport him because of his longstanding ties with the UK and the fact that he is working hard to educate people to avoid making the same mistakes he made at UBS.  In June, he\u0026nbsplost an appeals court bid to block his deportation, effectively putting an end to his legal challenge.  Mr Hopewell-Smith said: \u0026ldquoThe Home Secretary has the power to exercise his discretion when there are clear and compelling reasons to do so.  \u0026ldquoIt is still hoped that the secretary of state will have the common sense not to deport an individual that is so obviously an asset to our community.\"  A Home Office spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoAll foreign nationals who are given a custodial sentence will be considered for removal.\"  During his trial at Southwark Crown Court in 2012, he had denied the charges, which related to the period between October 2008 and September 2011.  He argued at his trial nearly six years ago that managers at the bank pushed him to take too many risks. While he admitted causing the loss, he said it wasn\u0026rsquot done dishonestly.  But the jury was told he lost the money in \"unprotected, unhedged, incautious and reckless\" trades.

The equivalent figure for the UK was 74 per cent.  Nearly 70 per cent of Scots also want universities to expand the recruitment of international students in future compared to 58 per cent in the rest of the UK.  When asked how long international students should be allowed to stay, 60 per cent of Scots said it should be at least two years.  The survey by Universities UK comes as the body launches new proposal for a post-study work visa for international students.  The proposed arrangements would allow international students to work in the UK for up to two years after graduating.  Currently, there are strict eligibility rules for post-study work in the UK, involving high costs for both students and employers and ious time restrictions.  Universities are also concerned that the impact of Brexit will see fewer students from EU countries.  Universities UK said the scheme would allow more employers in Scotland to access talented graduates from around the word, addressing workforce shortages and skills gaps in many sectors and industries.  It would also make Scotland a more attractive destination for international students and graduates and allow it to compete with countries who have more attractive post-study work policies, such as the USA and Australia.  This summer, Australia overtook the UK\u0026rsquos market share for international students for the first time pushing the UK into third place for international student recruitment.  Professor Richard Williams, principal of Heriot-Watt University and convener of Universities Scotland\u0026rsquos international committee, said: \"Scotland is a sought after study destination and the country benefits educationally, socially, culturally and economically from talented international students.  \"We could all benefit more if students from overseas were allowed to stay on after they graduate and work for a few years before returning home.  \"As a welcoming and inclusive nation, Scotland has much to gain from international students with high-level skills. We know there is support for this amongst employers as well as the public.\"  Universities UK new policy proposal comes in the same month as the Migration Advisory Committee is expected to publish its recommendations on following a length consultation into the impact of international students in the UK.  The study, conducted by ComRes, interviewed 4,302 adults across the UK and Northern Ireland in August this year.  Other findings included the fact only one quarter of respondents viewed an international student coming to study at a UK university as an \"immigrant\".  The study concluded: \"British adults are more likely to think of people other than students or researchers as immigrants.\"  Some 35 per cent of respondents across the UK said they wanted to see more international students, 40 per cent wanted numbers to stay the same and 13 per cent wanted fewer.  In January a report suggested international students generate nearly \u0026pound2 billion to the Scottish economy in tuition fees and wider spending.  The report by London Economics, on behalf of the Higher Education Policy Institute, found overseas students at Scottish universities generated \u0026pound1.94 billion.  The analysis, compiled to demonstrate the potential loss of tougher Home Office immigration controls on overseas students, found the combined UK benefit of the 231,000 new overseas students recruited each year across the UK was a combined \u0026pound22.6 billion."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-bankroll-kezia-dugdales-defence-in-wings-over-scotland-defamation-case","story":"  The former Scottish Labour leader is being sued by nationalist blogger Stuart Campbell after she accused him of making homophobic remarks, which he strongly denies.  She will face a courtroom cross-examination next year after a sheriff gave the green light for a full hearing.  The row started after Mr Campbell, who runs the controversial Wings Over Scotland website, tweeted about Tory MSP Oliver Mundell. His father, the Tory Scottish Secretary David Mundell, came out as gay in 2016.  Mr Campbell wrote last year: \u0026ldquoOliver Mundell is the sort of public speaker that makes you wish his dad had embraced his homosexuality sooner.\"  In a newspaper column, Ms Dugdale said she was \u0026ldquoshocked and appalled to see a pro-independence blogger\u0027s homophobic tweets.

It is understood the UK Labour Party, which raised a record income of \u0026pound56 million last year, will pay all Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos legal costs in the upcoming court battle.  It has instructed London-based lawyers Steel \u0026amp Shamash, who have in turn enlisted Scottish firm Balfour+Manson.  Mr Campbell said Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos defence costs were being paid by a \"shady\", unidentified backer in an article he published over the weekend.  He wrote: \u0026ldquoNOT by an open public crowdfunder, where thousands of ordinary people kick in a modest few quid of their own free will, not even out of the money she grabbed by leveraging her modest fame and power to abandon her constituents and go on a celebrity TV show, but by a shady backer who hasn\u0026rsquot been officially identified, isn\u0026rsquot answerable to anyone, and isn\u0026rsquot available to ordinary members of the public.  He was condemning opposition attacks on Alex Salmond, who launched a crowdfunding appeal to bankroll his legal battle with the Scottish Government over its handling of sexual harassment allegations.  Responding to Labour paying Ms Dugdale\u0027s court fees, Mr Campbell said: \"After a full week of Scottish Labour bleating loudly about how Alex Salmond should have paid his own legal costs, the hypocrisy of this would be \u0026ndash well, it\u0027d be about what I\u0027d expect, to be honest.\"  Ms Dugdale was criticised earlier this year after it emerged she received more than her annual salary as an MSP for less than two weeks on ITV\u0026rsquos I\u0026rsquom a Celebrity\u0026hellip Get Me Out of Here!

He argued Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos condemnation of the tweet as \u0026ldquohomophobic was fair and honest comment.  A spokesman for Ms Dugdale said: \u0026ldquoMs Dugdale has been made aware of Sheriff McGowan\u0026rsquos judgment on the case and will now take time to discuss the position, and take advice from her legal team.

The Scottish Household Survey 2017 found there here were 98 million passengers carried by ScotRail in 2017-18, an increase on 94 million in the previous year.  Train use was found to be more common in higher income households, with 42% of respondents with a household income of more than \u0026pound40,000 using the train in the past month compared with only 23% of survey respondents with a household income of less than \u0026pound10,000.  It was also found that bus use was most common among younger people, with 68% of 16 to 19-year-olds saying they had used the bus in the past month, compared to 53% of those in their 70s and 43% of people in their 80s.  The annual survey found the majority of travellers in Scotland continue to make most of their journeys by car.  Cars and vans were used for 65% of journeys in 2017 - 52% as driver and 13% as a passenger.  The percentage of people who would consider buying an electric car or van increase to 41% in 2017, up 5% from the previous year.  Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said: \"The figures today highlight the work we must continue in order to develop a greener and more sustainable transport network here in Scotland.  \"I am confident that the policies of this government will bring us closer to that goal than ever before. There is much we can welcome in the areas of rail and aviation - and encouraging signs that perceptions around electric vehicles continue to improve.  \"We are matching increasing rail demand with extra capacity and we are continuing to spend over \u0026pound250 million a year to support our vital bus industry, working with operators to keep fares at affordable levels, and providing free bus travel to older and disabled passengers - where we have recently confirmed there will be no change to the age of eligibility for concessionary travel.\"  Walking accounted for another 21% of journeys, public transport 11% and cycling 1.5%.  Most of the journeys people made were short in duration and distance, with more than half under 5km in distance and over two thirds lasting less than 20 minutes.  The median car journey was 6.8km, and the median walking journey was 0.9km.  The main reasons for travel were commuting and shopping but where people had used online shopping to have goods delivered to their home, they reported a reduction in travel made the next day in 73% of cases.  Mr Matheson added: \"While we are maintaining performance for walking and cycling, we are confident that the doubling of the active travel budget will help our partners deliver impactful infrastructure and behavioural change programmes which will revolutionise how we think about getting around, improving how we feel about our urban environment - benefiting our health, communities and our economy.  \"I have witnessed a great deal of commitment and determination on the part of operators to further improve the services we use every day here in Scotland - and I want to thank the commitment of our public transport workers who strive every day to keep Scotland moving.  \"This government will continue to support our essential public transport network and work to bring about a more sustainable transport system for all.\""},{"url":null,"title":"politics-faces-huge-uncertainty-as-new-divisions-emerge-holyroods-presiding-officer-says","story":"  Ken Macintosh, whose role is similar to that of the Speaker of the House of Commons, said it was not for politicians alone to solve the issues facing Scotland and the UK.

The MP for Na h-Eileanan an Iar added: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos one of the reasons why Scotland will decide on its independence in the next year.  But Mr Raab decried the \u0026ldquoblinkered, narrow political obsession that the SNP has got with a referendum on independence and stressed the UK Government was striving to get the best Brexit deal for all parts of the UK.  The Secretary of State told MPs how UK ministers had had more than 60 meetings with their counterparts in recent weeks, had made good progress and were within sight of a deal.  But he raised laughter from opposition benches when he declared: \u0026ldquoThis House and the British people can rest assured the UK will be ready for Brexit deal or no deal and prepared for whatever the outcome, so that this country goes from strength to strength.  His Labour opposite number, Sir Keir Starmer, replied: \u0026ldquoThere is no hiding the fact the Government is in a real fix. Its ability to get a deal, he argued, \u0026ldquosinks by the day.  Sir Keir denounced the \u0026ldquoChequers fudge, which, he said, was now being attacked from all sides.  Warning the Brexit talks were \u0026ldquoin serious trouble, he added: \u0026ldquoThe Government must change course and put forward a credible plan to break this impasse, one that can command the support of the House and protect jobs, the economy and avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. The Government has got six weeks to get this right more of the same will not do.  Labour\u0026rsquos Hilary Benn, who chairs the Commons Brexit Committee, which on Tuesday in Brussels met Michel Barnier, said the EU\u0026rsquos chief co-ordinator had \u0026ldquoemphatically rejected the Chequers Plan. He asked what the Government\u0026rsquos alternative was.  But Mr Raab highlighted Mr Barnier\u0026rsquos admission last week that the EU27 was prepared to offer the UK a bespoke deal, stressing: \u0026ldquoThis is a negotiation\u0026hellipWe are confident we will make progress.  Former Conservative Culture Secretary John Whittingdale suggested it was time to abandon the Chequers \u0026ldquoflawed proposal and pursue a free trade deal.  Mr Raab again defiantly said the UK would not \u0026ldquoroll over, that the Government was confident its proposals \u0026ldquorespect the key and core principles of the EU and would resolve all the issues around frictionless trade at the border.

But the TUC says its analysis shows that the pressure on household budgets has in fact increased under her government, pushing the JAMs \u0026ldquoeven closer to the financial cliff-edge.  Since Q4 2016 to Q1 2018, the report highlights how families\u0026rsquo outgoings have outstripped incomes in every quarter, resulting in a total household deficit of \u0026pound34 billion.  It notes how in 2017, the Office for National Statistics reported a calendar year shortfall of \u0026pound900 per household the first time in 30 years that the average household spent more than it brought in.  The analysis explains how in the 1980s \u0026ndash the last time families went into the red \u0026ndash household deficits were driven by high spending. However under the current Government, spending has grown by an average of just two per cent a year in the same period, real disposable incomes have declined at an annual rate of -0.4 per cent, driven by falling wages and insecure work.  \u0026ldquoIn other words, families are being forced to borrow simply to maintain a basic standard of living, declared the TUC.  ONS figures showed, it said, that the shortfall was concentrated across the poorest fifth of households with spending outstripping incomes in both the first and second deciles by income.  As a result, debt levels among the poorest households were rising extremely quickly. From 2015 to 2017, the [consumer credit] debt to income ratio for the poorest households rose from around 55 per cent to more than 100 per cent, according to the Centre for Responsible Credit and Jubilee Debt Campaign.  Frances Grady, the TUC General Secretary, said: \u0026ldquoTheresa May has abandoned the promises she made when she moved into Downing Street.  \u0026ldquoTwo years on, working families can\u0026rsquot make ends meet without being forced into the red. And the May Government has done nothing to get wages rising or to crack down on the epidemic of insecure work.  Ms O\u0026rsquoGrady went on: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos time for the Prime Minister to get serious about domestic issues. Families on the edge need more than empty words.  \u0026ldquoFor a start, she must do something to tackle insecure work. More than a year after the Taylor report on modern work was published, it\u0026rsquos still gathering dust, she added.  Ahead of its annual Congress, which starts this coming weekend, the TUC called on Mrs May to:  *crack down on insecure work, ending unfair pay for agency workers and banning zero-hours contracts  *end Universal Credit cuts, which were set to force families further into the red."},{"url":null,"title":"iain-macwhirter-come-what-may-the-snp-stubbornly-refuses-to-split","story":"  I am not and never have been a member of the Scottish National Party, but I\u0026rsquove no difficulty believing it to be the most extraordinary phenomenon in British politics, not least in its preternatural ability to unite in the face of adversity. Other parties are becoming virtuosos in the art of political division. The Conservatives are split at least three ways over Brexit, with their Prime Minister\u0026rsquos authority in ruins and Boris Johnson in open revolt. Labour is bitterly divided over anti-Semitism and Jeremy Corbyn\u0026rsquos leadership. The SNP isn\u0026rsquot: it realises that unity works.  With 125,000 members, the SNP is now the second largest party, not just in Scotland, but in the entire UK. Indeed, if the SNP membership were scaled up to UK level, it would have twice the UK Labour Party membership and 12 times that of the Tories. Such numbers might be expected in a radical opposition party, but not a long-in-the-tooth party of government.  Yesterday, Nicola Sturgeon announced the 12th legislative programme since the SNP entered government in 2007. The SNP is now into its second decade in office, yet support appears actually to be rising again, according to YouGov, and is back to 40 per cent. This despite the widely-publicised problems with NHS waiting lists and poor performance in educational league tables. Nor has support for independence flagged, with one poll this week suggesting that, if Brexit happens, more Scottish voters are minded to support Yes than in 2014.  Ms Sturgeon appears to have seen off the threat from Richard Leonard\u0026rsquos newly-Corbynised Scottish Labour, and we are reliably informed that Ruth Davidson is now looking to a political future in Westminster. Much of this success is down not to the Scottish Government, which has made its share of mistakes, but to the resilience of the party itself. Yesterday\u0026rsquos programme was a workmanlike job with important measures on mental health, animal welfare and children\u0026rsquos rights, but it was essentially an addendum to last year\u0026rsquos offerings on tax and the environment. Everyone says Ms Sturgeon\u0026rsquos administration is looking tired, and in some respects it is. Truth be told, the Scottish Cabinet, Sturgeon aside, has never looked particularly dynamic. But the slide to political disfavour, widely predicted after 2017\u0026rsquos abortive referendum, hasn\u0026rsquot taken place. The party continues to break all the established rules of politics \u0026ndash the pendulum refuses to swing. This is largely because the SNP membership has turned party unity into an article of faith, and turned positive thinking to a potent political weapon.  It\u0026rsquos not as if the SNP lacks issues to split over. There\u0026rsquos Brexit for a start, upon which there are widely differing views. Some back Brexit, some back a People\u0026rsquos Vote against it, most are dismayed at the prospect and feeling powerless.  Ms Sturgeon can\u0026rsquot make up her mind on whether to support a People\u0026rsquos Vote, but unlike in the other main parties, no vociferous factions have emerged to persuade her either way.  Many SNP activists are desperate for an early independence referendum, and believe that if Nicola Sturgeon doesn\u0026rsquot announce one now, the chance might never come again. We have pro-independence marches wending through Scottish cities almost by the week. But Ms Sturgeon has pointedly declined to endorse them, and has given precious little sign of being about to call a referendum. In any normal party, there\u0026rsquod now be two warring camps, like the Leavers and Remainers of Brexit, on this existential question of independence. But not the SNP. You can almost sense it positioning itself for constructive disappointment, not open revolt. The great split over the referendum may never come.  Then there\u0026rsquos the Sustainable Growth Commission Report,with its dismal science of deficit reduction. That caused much dispute on the Scottish left, but the membership has refused to turn it into any recognisable left-right division in the party. There\u0026rsquos no Campaign for SNP Socialism. The will to unity is just too strong \u0026ndash as it has been in the backwash from the resignation of  Alex Salmond \u0026ndash a veritable god in the Nationalist pantheon, who has been cast out of the party after over 40 years.  The row over Mr Salmond\u0026rsquos crowdfunding took place outside the SNP. Faced with the extraordinary prospect of the former First Minister taking the Scottish Government to court, SNP members refused to turn what they see as a personal drama into a political crisis. Many SNP women have concerns about victims of sexual harassment, and Mr Salmond isn\u0026rsquot universally popular, but they chose not to turn this difficult case into an intra-party gender war.  Labour and press commentators often talk about the SNP\u0026rsquos almost unnatural unity as if it is centrally enforced. As if there is some dictatorial party secretariat imposing rigid discipline and suppressing debate. Either that, or the SNP is a \u0026ldquocult, they say, in which star-crossed believers lose their ability to disagree. In truth, it is neither: the SNP is just damned if it will give the hated \u0026ldquomainstream media stories about splits, so it keeps it in the family.  It wasn\u0026rsquot always so. The SNP used to be notorious for its squabbles and divisions. Mr Salmond was expelled from the party in 1979 for leading a left-wing faction. And the party was deeply divided over devolution in the 1990s. It learned the hard way that unity works. Rather like the Tartan Army, the SNP has found a way to insulate itself emotionally from the disillusion and despondency that afflict most political parties once they starts governing in prose. This is what has prevented the Scottish Government from lapsing into mid-term doldrums and disarray. For its many thousands of members, the SNP has become, not so much a political party, more a way of life."},{"url":null,"title":"guide to screen locations marks scots tv pioneer anniversary","story":"        As Scotland marks the 130th anniversary of the birth of the Scottish \u0026#8220pioneer of television\u0026#8221, the national tourism organisation has launched a guide aimed at set-jetting TV fans, including locations in Aberdeenshire.                \u0027TV Set in Scotland\u0027, produced by VisitScotland, contains details of more than 60 television programmes, which have either been filmed in Scotland or have Scottish links.

In agreement with his adviser, Joe felt that getting a Construction Skills Certification Scheme  card and gaining skills in Portable Appliance Testing  would be the best start to his journey to find work.

Launched in April this year, the service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.Fair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is voluntary. This means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose – choosing to participate won’t affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions. The service is based on partnership and joint working between the Scottish Government, and the public, third and private sectors to deliver better outcomes for people seeking employment support. Jamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: “We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential. “As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.”                                                                                                        To find out more and check whether you are eligible, visit www.mygov.scot/fairstart                "},{"url":null,"title":"Bower author helping Norn become the norm","story":"COMMON words and phrases used by Caithnessians may be thought of by locals as slang terms \u0026ndash but, by using them, they may have been reviving a dead language.Bower author Elspeth Grace Hall is doing her bit to revive the language of Norn that was once widely spoken in Caithness.Norn was officially declared a \u0026ldquodead language by world heritage body the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization .However, Grace Hall has been bringing about a revival of the region\u0026rsquos native tongue by writing a series of children\u0026rsquos workbooks to teach kids how to read and write in Norn.If Elspeth is successful in helping to increase the numbers of Norn speakers in Caithness, UNESCO could reverse its death declaration.They had once delivered a similar verdict on Kernowek \u0026ndash the native language of south-west English county, Cornwall.But in 2010, UNESCO announced that its former classification of the language as \u0026ldquoextinct was \u0026ldquono longer accurate.Grace Hall said: \u0026ldquoIf you have ever sat \u0026lsquoO a benk\u0026rsquo, fed the \u0026lsquoscorries\u0026rsquo, told your \u0026lsquomannie\u0026rsquo off for being a \u0026lsquoloon\u0026rsquo or simply popped off \u0026lsquotill\u0026rsquo the shops you have been speaking a second language \u0026ndash one that officially doesn\u0026rsquot even exist.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove always been intrigued by languages and the Caithness dialect is wonderfully rich.\u0026ldquoI started to investigate the etymology of words unique to Caithness and found that they weren\u0026rsquot part of Scots, English or Gaelic, they were in fact Norn.

Some reports suggest it may be more than just a fanciful notion.When first contacted by Wick historian Harry Gray about the recent restoration of the \"Iron Wellie\", we had visions of a giant Wellington boot unearthed from the Caithness moors. That theory was firmly booted into touch after a visit to this unearthed marvel on the northern side of Wick Bay.The Iron Wellie is in fact a spring water well situated down a flight of recently restored Caithness flagstone steps close to the Soldiers\u0027 Tower on the North Head.Charlie Bain of Wick Paths Group explained how together with Denny Swanson, Tommy Munro and others from the Royal British Legion Scotland they recently restored the site of the spring.\"The steps down to it were overgrown and damaged,\" he said. \"We also replaced the pipe the water flows through and there is a marker stone at the top of the steps.\"Denny Swanson said he remembered bringing the water to his mother who suffered from arthritis for most of her life.\"She sent me down every second day for a bottle of \u0027Iron Wellie water\u0027, as she called it. She maintained it helped her arthritis and it certainly seemed to take some of her pain away.\"After Harry symbolically cut a ribbon of barricade tape the group, together with Charlie\u0027s dog Jet, went down for a taste of the water that many in the area depended on in bygone times. It is speculated that the inhabitants of nearby Tinkers\u0027 Cave would have consumed the water. The Wick worthy Tudor James resided close to the site and lived to a ripe old age.Harry said that the Iron Wellie was also known as the Chalybeate Spring and its taste has been described like \"sookin\u0027 pennies\".\"Chalybeate waters, also known as ferruginous waters, are mineral waters containing salts of iron \u0026ndash hence the local name Iron Wellie,\" he said.\"There is no written history of this well but it was certainly known in the 18th century and by the turn of the 20th century it was sometimes referred to as \u0027Jocky Simpson\u0027s Wellie\u0027. Who Jocky Simpson was, is lost in time.\"Harry said that \"generations of Wickers\" out for a walk along the braes or exiles home on holiday would nearly always stop for a drink from the wellie.\"We as youngsters firmly believed that the water did us good despite the taste and it was a welcome drink when playing around the North Head or when fishing or swimming from the rocks,\" he said.\"Young lads get hungry and we would sneak a turnip from Bob Cormack\u0027s field above the wellie, dock it on a stab [for the uninitiated that means removing the ends of the neep by striking it against a fence post] and we then cut off the skin and washed the neep in the Iron Wellie water before sitting on a rock and devouring it.\"Harry laughed at how present-day health and safety regulations would make drinking the water seem like a risky act \"but none of us became ill or died from it, perhaps proving the efficacy of the wellie\u0027s water\".Perhaps in the future Wick will host thousands of pilgrims queuing up for a taste of the rejuvenating powers of the Iron Wellie water.Wednesday 5 Sep 2018 10:49

after Scrabster complaint is rejected by tribunal","story":"A LOCAL advice service is stressing that although a tribunal has rejected a complaint of workplace bullying made by a Scottish Government agency employee, others should not be deterred from launching similar action.DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment while employed as a fisheries officer for Marine Scotland at Scrabster harbour, but a tribunal this week ruled against her in the case.Speaking to the Groat, Iain Gregory, the deputy manager of Caithness Citizens\u0027 Advice Bureau , stressed that bullying regularly takes place in the workplace, and each year he hears numerous complaints.\"Clients feel that they have been the victim of unfair dismissal, discriminatory treatment, bullying or other types of incorrect treatment,\" he said.\"Anyone who feels they have been the victim of such conduct or treatment should never be deterred from reporting the matter.\"DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment after she became a \"whistleblower\" while employed as a fisheries officer at Marine Scotland at Scrabster.The 49-year-old Canadian national told an employment tribunal in Aberdeen recently that she felt intimidated after being sent anonymous cards between 2015 and 2017, and claimed she was targeted with sexual harassment, for being a woman, and because of her age.In a previous hearing, Ms Fitzpatrick had also alleged that she was taped to a chair and gagged by colleagues in 2010.The employment tribunal, however, ruled against Ms Fitzpatrick in its decision on the case.In its judgment, it said it could not agree whether the cards came from current colleagues, and is understood to have been unable to consider the chair allegation as it was said to have taken place more than three years before the complaint was brought.Mr Gregory says that each year CAB deals with a \"substantial number\" of bullying cases, each of which is examined carefully and then detailed evidence is obtained.He says in many cases CAB is able to resolve matters without progression to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service  or to a tribunal \u0026ndash \"perhaps by raising a grievance with the employer or by negotiation\".He added: \"However, there are numerous cases which require referral via ACAS and we can often resolve issues at this point by using the \u0027Early Conciliation\u0027 process.\"He underlined that it is \"comparatively unusual\" for a case to proceed to tribunal, with only a \"small percentage\" going that far.\"While it would be inappropriate to comment on any case in which we were not involved, I would stress that people should not under any circumstances be dissuaded from pursuing their rights,\" Mr Gregory said.\"The system exists to ensure that your case can and will be properly considered and we can advise you and make sure that you understand it.\"Wednesday 5 Sep

QinetiQ employs 6000 staff and has a turnover of around \u0026pound700 million.The deal comes as AMTE Power has invested \u0026pound1.5 million in a new automated production line at its Caithness operation.John Fox, the company\u0026rsquos marketing director, yesterday described the partnership agreement as \u0026ldquoa positive step for AMTE Power and the local economy.He explained the two business will work together to develop battery cells.\u0026ldquoWe will use our manufacturing expertise to utilise QinetiQ\u0026rsquos experience in battery technology and research to deliver new products, manufactured in Thurso to an international customer base, Mr Fox said.He said the companies will concentrate on four key areas: defence, the oil and gas industry, energy storage and electric vehicles. They plan to supply UK and European markets with niche batteries which customers would not be able to get elsewhere.Mr Fox said there is potential and opportunities in these areas and the increase in the Thurso workforce will be largely due to the link-up with QinetiQ.The partnership deal, he stressed, will allow customers to get products which \u0026ldquodon\u0026rsquot rely on standard mass-produced cells from the existing supply chain.The agreement will enable the companies to develop \u0026ldquoa mutually beneficial relationship and lead to advances in batteries and energy storage products.\u0026ldquoOur staff in Thurso are fantastic and we will continue to grow our base there, he said. \u0026ldquoWe have 32 employees in Caithness at present but have plans for that figure to go up to 40 over the next year \u0026ndash that is a 25 per cent increase.\u0026ldquoThis is a great building block for the future development of the organisation.

Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot... Even though I lived on the other side of town, every summer myself and a friend would go \u0026ndash even when it was raining, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a great place as the town didn\u0026rsquot have an indoor swimming pool until 1994. Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to life and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that divides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because if nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Wednesday 5 Sep 2018 10:49 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117256.jpg","title":"Norse era in Caithness was our very own Game of Thrones","story":"He has taken some of the most dramatic events from a time when the county was the southern part of the Orkney earldom and condensed them into a rollicking, fast-moving narrative in The Katanes Saga .It is based on a series of articles published in the John O\u0026rsquoGroat Journal over a decade ago, reinterpreting source material from ious sagas, and follows on from The Raven Banner, published in the mid-1990s and now out of print. Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash if it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him returning to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Asleifarson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being knifed in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Wednesday 5 Sep 2018 10:49 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of life make life-changing decisions that create a difference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people.

Brian, who was awarded a British Empire Medal in June this year in recognition of his services to military history in Orkney said: “Many people have dedicated time and energy to gathering photos over a period of 20 years or more and would like to see the collection completed as far as possible for the centenary of the Armistice on 11 November this year.“Having a nearly complete set of images of all the Orcadians lost would be a most poignant way for our community to mark this anniversary and a wonderful resource for future generations.”It’s believed 578 Orcadians died serving in the Great War and the Legion’s collection, available to view on their website, contains photos of just over half — 297 — of those lost.The council’s call comes as part of Orkney’s First World War commemoration programme, which is being coordinated by the council with invaluable contributions and support from local organisations community groups and individuals.As part of a series of events, on November 11, Orkney will participate in a national commemorative event that involves as many photos of local lives lost in the war as can be found and the participation of their families, a further reason for trying to complete the collection.Lucy Gibbon from the council’s Library and Archive service said there may well be much sought-after photos in people’s attics and family memorabilia collections: “Whilst very few people had a camera during the Great War, nearly all towns had photo studios. Most servicemen visited one of these while training in the UK.”“If you know you lost an Orcadian relative in the war, now is a great time to find out more about them. The Orkney Library \u0026amp Archive might have some items to help shed light on their story.”The Legion’s photo archive has been made possible thanks to the generosity and hard work of many — for example around half of the photos have been sourced from The Orcadian, which has published photos sent in by families in a feature called Our Roll of Honour during the Great War.Other notable contributors and donators over the years include Tom Gibson of Rousay, Beatrice Thomson of North Ronaldsay, Mabel Eunson of Deerness and the late Margaret Watters of Stenness, Bill Miller of Stronsay, Phyllis Gee of Flotta, and George Esson who spent two decades visiting families in South Ronaldsay and Burray seeking photos of loved ones lost in the war, and with the help of and David Mackie and Colin Rendall made copies for the Orkney Library and Archive.These and many more contributors are noted on the project’s website — where people can also view images in the collection by Parish and by significant battles.Anyone with photos they believe are not already included in the Legion’s collection is urged to contact Brian Budge on phone 01856 872225 and email brian.budge@btinternet or to drop into the Orkney Library and Archive in Kirkwall.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It sounds like a long time, but my experience of these things is that it catches up on you very quickly and there’s a lot of work to do between now and then.”Excellent communication and interpersonal skills, in addition to good team-working are vital attributes. However, notably, an interest in sport is not essential.The voluntary services of personnel with experience in event planning, fundraising and sponsorship, business and project management, procurement, marketing and PR, communication and strategic planning, are also being sought.Mr Deans added: “We’re looking for people with the skills, but they really need that long-term commitment and time to devote to this.”Recruitment information and an online application can be found at www.oiga.org.uk/organising-committee-recruitment-statement/For further information, and any queries, email info@oiga.org.uk.The deadline for applications is Saturday, September 29.            \u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This will briefly divert cars onto the adjacent railway track and back again at set windows during the day when trains are not passing by.But motorists who miss one of the windows could face waits of up to two-and-a-half hours for the next one.And this has prompted Highland Council to urge drivers to make sure they plan their journey and allow enough travel time so they are not caught out.A council spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoWe have worked closely with Network Rail and our contractor TRAC Engineering Ltd to keep disruption to road users to a minimum when the road\u0026ldquoBut inevitably there will be times when road users will face longer waits \u0026ndash so we urge people to plan their travel carefully and avoid the periods when the diversion is not going to be available.During the works the road will be closed overnight to all traffic between the two gates between 10pm and 7am.Traffic control measures will operate between 7am and 10pm while the road-to-rail bypass is installed. This could take up to two weeks, but may be finished sooner.Once the temporary bypass is installed, the timetable of opening slots between trains will take effect.Cards showing details of the timetable that will be operating for the road to rail diversion have been distributed among local communities.Copies are also available at the Highland Council website by searching for Stromeferry Bypass at www.highland.gov.ukThe road-to-rail bypass will be available for use between 7am and 10pm, but only by traffic weighing less than seven-and-a-half tonnes .Traffic above those limits will have to divert along the A87, A82, A832 and A890.The council believes the restrictions and roadworks will be finished by November 24, when the A890 will fully reopen.Wednesday 5 Sep 2018 10:51 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The potential overspend is blamed on high cost placements for \u0026lsquolooked-after children\u0026rsquo, lower income from new parking charges and fewer savings from toilet closures because those two policies have not yet taken full effect.Council chiefs insisted no staff jobs were at risk.Finance director Derek Yule, however, warned there were \u0026ldquono more rabbits to be pulled from hats to tackle the problems.Black Isle Liberal Democrat Gordon Adam blamed Scottish Government grant cuts while SNP city councillor Richard Laird said the crisis was \u0026ldquoentirely of this council\u0026rsquos making.Council leader Margaret Davidson claimed local government services were \u0026ldquonot a priority for the Scottish Government.The budget leader angered the SNP benches, accusing group leader Maxine Smith of not fully participating in budget discussions. He said he invited her to meetings but had been turned down \u0026ldquobecause she views her private commitments more important than reorganising her diary.She was not in the chamber to respond. In a later statement she said: \u0026ldquoOn Friday, I received a request to attend a meeting on Monday to discuss the budget. I had commitments but they were pre-arranged meetings with constituents. I\u0026rsquove sent him a meeting request for tomorrow. I\u0026rsquom available any time, so hopefully he\u0026rsquoll re-arrange his diary. On the budget, our job in opposition is to scrutinise.A spokesman for the Scottish Government said: \u0026ldquoHighland Council has had more this year despite UK government cuts to our budget. It will receive over \u0026pound487 million Scottish Government funding in 2018-19.n Support was voiced for a city councillor who has quit as the SNP\u0026rsquos deputy leader on Highland Council.Richard Laird  cited health reasons for his decision. He will remain a Central Ward councillor. He said: \u0026ldquoMy health isn\u0026rsquot good enough. That\u0026rsquos the reason I\u0026rsquom stepping down. For the last year or so, both my physical health and my mental health have been in decline. I\u0026rsquove been told by the doctor to reduce my workload a bit.SNP group leader Maxine Smith said: \u0026ldquoI am saddened that Richard has had to step down as depute group leader, as we have worked well together. His illness has been creeping up on him for some time and he feels he needs time to rest, so removing the huge responsibility of chairing a strategic committee is a sensible thing to do. Richard will continue to be a valued member of our group. He is a highly intelligent man, who has lots more to give.Wednesday 5 Sep 2018 10:51 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The campaign was highlighted earlier this year by the Ross-shire Journal when riders revealed their concerns.After meeting campaigners near Cullicudden, Miss Forbes said: \u0026ldquoIn a rural place like the Black Isle it\u0026rsquos not surprising to see horse riders. Despite that, I was really disappointed to hear that drivers usually drive too close and too fast when passing a horse. There is evidently a lot of work to do in educating drivers about overtaking horses and the serious dangers of scaring horses.\u0026ldquoSadly, horse riders told me that they believe the roads are increasingly dangerous for horse riding, despite horse riders having equal access to the road. I support these horse riders on the Black Isle who want to raise awareness of how to overtake horses and ensure that riders don\u0026rsquot fear for their safety when riding in a rural place like the Black Isle.Since 2010, there have been almost 150 incidents on Scottish roads involving both motorists and horse riders \u0026ndash including two rider fatalities and 50 serious injuries.One local rider earlier told the Ross-shire Journal how she had taken to wearing head-mounted cameras in a bid to protect herself and others. Concern over an increasing number of near misses and alarming incidents has prompted calls to the police to intervene.Nel MacDonald-Rolfe, one of the riders, said: \u0026ldquoRural roads are to be treated with respect even by the locals who become complacent and take chances. You never know what is round the corner nor what can suddenly appear from the side of the roads.\u0026ldquoRural roads are there to be used by all, which includes cycles, walkers and horse riders. Patience and respect for all users and educating is the key. As they say, speed kills.The appeal to drivers to rein in their speed and to be aware of other road users followed near-misses on the B9169 Cullicudden straight. Police say they recognise the vulnerability of horses on roads and encourage motorists and riders to show mutual respect for each other.They say all road users should be able to travel safely and drivers should give horses as much room as possible when passing. They want road users to read the Highway Code for guidance.- Email us at newdesk@spp-groupWednesday 5 Sep 2018 10:51 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

That echoes public concerns which prompted a rethink from Highland Council four years ago.Tarbat Community Council is amongst the latest groups backing Craighill, stating that the TRA site \u0026ldquoshould not feature even as a second choice. It has outlined concerns over the lack of space for future expansion, inadequate room to play and the prospect of \u0026ldquotall and ugly buildings more appropriate to terminals at a second-rate airport.It says that \u0026ldquohuge cost advantages could come from using modular building techniques.The new campus will replace Tain Royal Academy, Craighill Primary, Knockbreck and the St Duthus special school. Parent councils have consistently appealed for improved facilities with the existing Craighill building the lowest scoring in the Highlands for educational suitability and condition.Wendy Hennem, of Tain Royal Academy Parent Council, noted that the Craighill site appeared to be the preferred public choice and that the resounding response from young people is: \u0026ldquoJust get it done.Tain and Easter Ross ward councillor Fiona Robertson told the Journal: \u0026ldquoAs we haven\u0026rsquot reached the deadline yet, I am not privy to the results of the consultation. However, I believe from my work with the stakeholder group and from being amongst the communities, that the Craighill site may be the most popular option. This has always been my preferred option as I believe it is much more suitable for a development of the size of a three to 18 campus.\u0026ldquoWhatever the results, it is important that the community works with Highland Council in order to deliver much-needed new schools for Tain. The extremely poor conditions of our primary and secondary schools in Tain is well known and acknowledged by Highland Council, therefore we all need to work hard to prepare an agreed plan in order to be in a position to apply for government funding later in the year.\u0026ldquoI believe the majority of people in Tain and Easter Ross just want to ensure we get fit for purpose schools in Tain to ensure the best possible educational facilities for our children\u0026rsquos futures.Fellow ward councillor Derek Loudon said: \u0026ldquoStudies by the community council, the Highland Council and the Ross-shire Journal have shown a clear preference for Craighill. There is little public support for the TRA site as all three consultations have shown. I hope we can move on now to get a layout on the Craighill site which is along the lines of the study done by Lachie Stewart [chairman of Tain and Easter Ross Civic Trust] and the community council which takes advantage of the space available to deliver great new buildings for primary, secondary, St Duthus, Gaelic and sports and leisure.\u0026ldquoI believe significant savings on cost, quality and time can be made with new construction techniques which are proven and have worked elsewhere. Let\u0026rsquos work with the Scottish Government and the Scottish Future\u0026rsquos Trust to deliver a great result for the people of Easter Ross.The consultation can be accessed at https:www.highland.gov.uk/downloads/file/19305/proposal_paper_tain_final_240518What do you think?

That headlines about the latter might dampen publicity about a fall in public satisfaction about the state of Scotland’s schools – down from 85 per cent in 2011 to 70 per cent last year – presumably had nothing to do with it.             There was some good news for the SNP. Despite the NHS’s current problems, 82 per cent said they were satisfied with the health service last year, compared to 81 per cent a decade ago. But, the overall picture was a gloomy one with the combined satisfaction rate for the three key public services of education, transport and health falling from a peak of 66 per cent in 2011 to 52 per cent last year.            READ MORE: Growing number of Scots believe climate change is ‘urgent problem’The Conservatives said the figures were a “truly damning indictment of the SNP’s record in Government”, while Deputy First Minister John Swinney sounded a conciliatory note, saying the results of the survey showed that “many people” were “managing well financially” and the “majority” were happy with their services, but also adding “we can see that inequalities remain”. With more than 10,000 respondents, the survey is significantly bigger than most opinion polls, so the Scottish Government – and the opposition parties – will take its findings seriously.For the SNP, halting the slide in dissatisfaction is not simply about staying in power, but its ultimate aspiration of independence. And it could have an effect on Nicola Sturgeon’s thinking about a second independence referendum. If the SNP fears being ousted at the next Holyrood election, it may decide it has nothing much to lose by holding Indyref 2. If it believes Sturgeon will be returned to Bute House, it may conclude it’s wiser to wait for a more opportune moment.READ MORE: PfG: Nicola Sturgeon unveils £250m package to improve mental health servicesAll that makes yesterday’s Programme for Government even more important.

Scotland became a tax haven thanks to 17 words, and one enterprising crook – perhaps in Eastern Europe? – who spotted them. The words were remarkably dull  but important. It was these words that attracted conmen and fraudsters from Russia, Ukraine and elsewhere and helped them hide their theft of billions of pounds.            The discovery of this Victorian law, which defines Scottish partnerships as different to those in the rest of the UK, illustrates the phenomenon that I call Moneyland. The s and servants of the super-rich are constantly scanning the world for legal loopholes like this one, and then exploiting them for the benefit of their clients’ money and the detriment of the rest of us.             If they can’t find a useful legal loophole, they find a friendly jurisdiction happy to create one for them. Places from Jersey to Lichtenstein to the Marshall Islands have long made a happy living by tailoring their laws to the needs of the wealthy. This has created a virtual country in which the planet’s richest residents can choose how they live in a way the rest of us cannot: Moneyland, a place where, whoever you are, wherever your money came from, the laws do not apply to you.The creation of Moneyland has helped the richest people monopolise an ever-greater share of the planet’s resources. According to Oxfam, the planet’s top 42 people own the same amount as the bottom half of the world’s population. Their ability to escape taxation and scrutiny means by next year, they’ll be richer still.Combatting their misuse of the world’s financial architecture is crucial to the defence of democracy. Perhaps 10 percent of all wealth is hidden behind the ramparts of the tax havens, and outside the reach of national exchequers. Its owners escape any form of democratic control as a result, yet can use their money to subvert our politics, just like they do in Russia. Unless we want Britain to become a plutocracy as well, we need to combat Moneyland before it’s too late.READ MORE: Scots firms ‘being used to launder dirty money from Russia’Scottish Limited Partnerships – Scotland’s own secrecy vehicle – appeared in 1907, in an updating of that 1890 law. They were used to secure agricultural tenancies, and remained distinctly unglamorous, until a century after their creation. That was when the enterprising crook spotted them. Within seven years, more SLPs were being created annually than had been created in the whole of their first 100 years, almost all of them linked to just 10 addresses.            Some of these SLPs were legitimate, and used by financiers to structure investment funds. But hundreds of them were dodgy, like the 119 SLPs abused in a scheme to secretly move 20 billion out of Russia in 2010-4. The SLPs were created by lawyers in the former Soviet Union, controlled from secrecy jurisdictions like Nevis or the Seychelles, so no one had any idea who owned them and therefore who was behind the crime that they were committing.Thanks to that wrinkle in the law – the 17 words – the SLPs could enter into contracts on their own account, but hide the identity of their owners as successfully as anything registered in the most notorious tax havens. It took the UK government  a decade to catch up with what the crooks are up to, and only now has Westminster decided to do something about them.READ MORE: ‘Kremlin trolls target Nicola Sturgeon’ after Russia criticismThis highlights the mismatch in resources between Moneylanders and the rest of us. Crooks and tax-dodgers are always keen to keep more of their money, so there is an army of lawyers and accountants perpetually looking for tricks they can use. Governments are far less nimble, and take years to discover what’s happening. By then, the crooks will have already identified new loopholes.            Those loopholes can be anywhere. Switzerland used to be the world’s primary location for stashing money, but the United States cracked open its defences after the financial crisis, and much of the cash fled for safer places. Ironically, the US states of Nevada, South Dakota and Wyoming proved to be popular destinations for it, since they can protect secrets from the US Treasury in ways that foreign countries can’t.If Washington ever gets as strict with its own tax havens as it has been with foreigners, then the money will shift somewhere else: Hong Kong, Singapore, back to Switzerland. There will always be somewhere that has laxer regulations than its peers, and that is why Moneyland will always be with us unless the whole world acts to stop it. This is a result of the fact that money can move freely and seamlessly around the world, while laws stop at national frontiers. The rich live internationally, the rest of us have borders.This is the dark side of globalisation, and is a curiously recent phenomenon, a consequence of the invention of offshore finance in the City of London in the early 1960s. Before that, money was largely penned behind national boundaries, and rich people faced the kind of taxes their modern-day counterparts could never conceive of. There are no pop stars today singing – as The Beatles did – of the taxman taking 95 percent of their earnings. Taxes and regulations are for the little people, without access to Moneyland.So is Scotland still in the offshore game? The UK government has promised to crack down on Scottish Limited Partnerships, but they have already declined in popularity, thanks to being forced to declare their true owners: a step that made them less popular with the kind of crooks who seek anonymity.Curiously, however, Northern Irish Limited Partnerships are now surging in popularity. Just half a decade ago, the province was lucky if it registered five NILPs in a year, but now, there are almost 100 being registered annually. No one has any idea what lies behind this burst in activity or, at least, those that do know aren’t telling the rest of us.             If past experience is any guide, however, the Moneylanders will have made a few billion dollars out of the loophole before the rest of us figure out what it is.Moneyland: Why Thieves and Crooks Now Rule the World and How to Take It Back by Oliver Bullough is published by Profile Books on 6 September at £20 hardback and ebook"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4794964.1536137815!/image/image.jpg","title":"poll tories would lose scotland seat gains in snap brexit vote","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

The poll found three quarters of people are “dissatisfied” with the UK government’s handling of Brexit negotiations.            The poll shows the Ayr majority of six per cent would see a 19 per cent swing away from the Tories, meaning sitting MP Bill Grant would lose out.And the flagship Gordon seat, which Colin Clark took from Alex Salmond last year, would also be lost with a 12 per cent shift wiping out the four per cent majority the party holds in the seat.In Stirling, with a slim majority of just 0.3 per cent, Tory incumbent Stephen Kerr would also lose out with a swing of 18 per cent away from his party.The survey of Tory marginals was commissioned by Global Britain, a pro-Brexit campaign group.Brian Monteith, director of communications at Global Britain, said: “The clear message for any Conservative MP, whether in a Leave or Remain constituency, is ‘back Chequers and pay the price at the ballot box’.             “Chequers will not deliver Brexit, it will deliver Corbyn.”The survey found 45 per cent of voters believe Brexit and the EU is the most important issue, compared to 17 per cent who believe the NHS is the most important and 7 per cent the economy.Overall 73 per cent of voters were dissatisfied with the Government’s handling of Brexit negotiations.The poll found 45 per cent of voters believed Chequers was bad for their family compared to 19 per cent who thought the plan was good."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4795008.1536130988!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon we are building healthier and wealthier scotland","story":"        The Scottish Government\u0026#8217s legislative plans deliver for those who live and work in Scotland today, but also invest heavily in future generations.

But while we will do all we can to protect Scotland from the worst effects of being taken out of the EU, we have built a programme that it is not defined by Brexit.  Instead, it sets out how we intend to deliver on our vision of a healthier, wealthier and fairer Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006. Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed on schedule in late summer.\nLocated at Seafield the new centre is just a short distance from the long-standing Eric Gray Centre. Once opened the centre will provide specialist assistance for adults with complex care needs and learning disabilities.\nThe building has been designed by Richard Gibson Architects and construction is being led by DITT. The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.\nThe centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building. It has taken many years to reach this point  and is much needed.\nI wonder what, if any, proof you have that clients and staff are looking forward to being in the building? If you do have some proof to justify your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in different buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August. It is part of the Year of Young People activities.\nThe youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.\nYear of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to 26 years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call  744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.  Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself ?  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped.

The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame.

Strong views were expressed \u0026ndash for and against \u0026ndash on the inclusion of the belt of trees to the north and west of Inverallan Church.\nThe trees contribute to the setting of the conservation area, forming a backdrop to the B-listed church \"and provide a natural separation with the later development to the north west\", according to the officer\u0027s report to members.\nThose against the proposed extension cited the project to convert the church for \"community use, part funded by developing housing either side of the church\".\nThere was a sense that including the location within the conservation area would be \"a barrier to this development\".\nConversely, there was support for including the trees because they would be better protected from speculative development.\nThe draft proposals will go to the council\u0027s south planning committee for approval. If adopted, all properties within the conservation area will be notified by letter.\nWednesday 5 Sep 2018 10:52 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117085.jpg","title":"Dalwhinnie makeover starts to take shape","story":"Tom Ramage\n\u0026nbsp\nDALWHINNIE is on the verge of a major makeover at its southern entrance.\nFor too long dogged by a disused, overgrown compound and a rusting old water treatment works, villagers are now beginning to hope that things could change dramatically over the next few months.\nAll being well, they heard on Tuesday, a \u0026pound2.3 million upgrade by Scottish Water could get under way in the new year which would leave the village with a new treatment works by this time next year.\n\"There\u0027s a long way to go,\" said the north\u0027s corporate affairs manager Gavin Steel when the Strathy met with an SW team in the village hall, \"but we\u0027re hopeful that all the many stages will be gone through on schedule.\n\"We are having to consult with a lot of different individuals and organisations \u0026ndash not least the national park authority, the Highland Council, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and landowners \u0026ndash but this is work which will have to be done on behalf of the community.\n\"Quite simply the current system has reached its sell-by date.

There is certainly great excitement surrounding them and anticipation is high amongst both band and audience.\n“The Stirling concerts will be celebrations of our long musical journey, albeit tinged with the realisation that these are farewell appearances and so naturally emotions will be high – this is something we experienced recently at the farewell concerts in England and Europe – all spectacular events but nevertheless very moving.\n“We’ve been overwhelmed by the response to the announcement of the Stirling concerts – all the positive comments, the stories about what our music has meant to so many people, the sadness as the end approaches. But overall there will be a huge amount of love and positivity at Stirling and that’s what will carry everyone through these days ahead.\u0026#8221\nJones has been with Runrig all his adult life, having first joined the band on stage as a 17-year old at a dance in Portree’s Skye Gathering Hall in late 1977. He hopes the set list – which will be lengthy – will give a full reflection of the groups’s journey from a three -piece Scottish dance band playing island village halls to one which has sold out major venues across Scotland and Europe.\nHe said: “Compiling a set list is always a dilemma, with such a large back catalogue to choose from. Of course, there are certain songs that have to be included, otherwise we’d be lynched – but it’s also nice to pick some lesser-performed songs, possibly giving them a fresh twist.\n“Our set will be a good bit longer than usual – the problem was trying to keep the length down to sensible proportions – in essence, it will hopefully represent the band’s whole career, a celebration of our music and the unique bond with our audience.”\n century – the history of their native communities has shaped Runrig’s lyrics and songs. Jones believes that staying true to their roots – fusing them with the popular rock and pop influences they listened to in their teenage bedrooms \u0026#8211 has made sure the band’s popularity has endured through the generations.\n“We’ve been fortunate that throughout our long career we’ve continually gained new fans of all ages, at home and abroad, which has sustained us, even as fashions come and go around us,” he adds. “I guess there must be something in the lyrics, the melodies and the ethos of the band that has attracted such loyalty amongst fans, something universal that transcends our shared background in the heartland of the Highlands and connects with the wider world.”\nAuthenticity has been the hallmark of a band which can essentially still trace its origins to the three Portree streets of Fraser Crescent, Kitson Crescent, and Balmoral Road.\nThe original Run-rig dance band was founded by the Skye-raised sons of North Uist Calum and Rory MacDonald, along with Blair Douglas in 1973, and a year later the trio were joined by Donnie Munro, who became the band’s singer for more than two decades.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association  in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary  Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon. The main speaker was Austin Currie MP, later a Fine Gael TD. Also speaking was Gerry Fitt, West Belfast MP. Fitt who, years later, was lifted into the House of Lords by Margaret Thatcher, declared that they would go on until they had “Civil Rights and a 32-County Republic”.\nBut the real leaders of the Civil Rights Movement which began that day were the rank and file, the ordinary people of Tyrone and beyond who marched for justice and freedom. \nThe first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon was held on 24 August 1968, 50 years ago this week.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27459  ","story":"Sinn Féin spokesperson for Business, Innovation and Enterprise Maurice Quinlivan TD\n Callum Smyth\n\n“The government is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming the apprenticeship system.

We aim toexpand the system into these areas to create different opportunities for allyoung people including more females and people with disabilities.”\n Currently,most apprenticeships are aimed towards male participants with just 160 out of13,589 people in apprenticeship programmes across the state being female in2018. In addition, the physically demanding nature of the current availableapprenticeships has resulted in just 1.7% of total apprentices in 2016 beingpeople with disabilities.\n\nSinnFéin aims to increase investment in apprenticeships to over €350 million perannum within five years. \nTheLimerick City TD, Deputy Quinlivan has said that this will “fund the treblingof the number apprenticeship programmes and provide places for 60,000apprentices”.\nDeputy Quinlivan continued: “€5,166,000 of investment will be required overfive years for the development of 63 new apprenticeship programmes, bringingthe total number of craft and new courses to 100.\n“Ireland’sallocation from the EU for training and education of the young is €68 million.Fine Gael was forced to return €19.8 million of this allocation in 2016, asthey failed to submit a payment application.\n“SinnFéin will ensure all EU monies allocated to Ireland would be fully utilised, tobenefit the education and training of our young people.

They were on active service and at Drumnakilly, close to their homes, they were ambushed and shot dead by a unit of the British Army’s SAS regiment. The Volunteers were brothers Gerard and Martin Harte and Brian Mullin.\nThe SAS killings brought to an end a month which had been one of the most intense and tragic of the war in Ireland. It began on 1 August with the IRA bombing of Inglis Barracks in London, close to Margaret Thatcher’s Finchley constituency. It was the first IRA attack in England since the bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the Tory Party conference four years earlier. A British solider was killed in the Inglis Barracks blast. In the following days, the IRA killed three British soldiers and an RUC detective in the North. \n\nOn 8 August, two young nationalist men were murdered by a loyalist death squad in Belfast. There were two more such sectarian killings of young nationalist men in Belfast, on 17 and 18 August. On 20 August, eight British soldiers were killed at Ballygawley, County Tyrone, when the IRA bombed a bus carrying members of the Light Infantry Regiment returning from England. On 31 August, two civilians were killed in Derry after they triggered an IRA booby-trap bomb intended for British forces. \nPolitically this period was dominated by the issue of extradition and, on 27 August, Robert Russell, one of the IRA prisoners who broke out of the H-Blocks in the mass escape of 1983, was handed across the border to the RUC. This was despite widespread protests, including public dissent from within Fianna Fáil.\nIt was on the Long Bog Road at Drumnakilly, four miles outside Omagh, that the three IRA Volunteers met their deaths.\nAt 4pm on 30 August, they were ambushed by British forces who poured a hail of bullets into their car. The RUC and British Army immediately sealed off the area and the bodies of the three men were left at the scene, within the cordon and inaccessible to grieving relatives, until the following afternoon. \n\nGerard Harte  was the eldest of the three Volunteers and was an experienced IRA activist. With his brother, Martin, he was a prominent member of the Loughmacrory St Theresa’s GAA Club, where he organised youth teams. \nMartin Harte was just 21 but had been in the IRA for four years at the time of his death. A talented football player, he had captained the Loughmacrory team. He was the father of a three-month-old son and, to compound the tragedy, his widow was Briege Mullin, sister of his friend and comrade Brian Mullin. \nVolunteer Brian Mullin  had been singled out for particular harassment by British forces. He was arrested and interrogated in Gough Barrack on numerous occasions and a few weeks before his death he and his brothers were beaten by crown forces outside their family home.\n\n\nHundreds of British soldiers and RUC members saturated the Tyrone countryside as the three Volunteers were laid to rest. Speaking at the graveside of the Harte brothers, Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Volunteers were “good, decent, patriotic freedom fighters driven to fight for justice”. \nVolunteers Brian Mullin, Gerard Harte and Martin Harte were killed on 30 August 1988, 30 years ago this week.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27466  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\n“The policy of this government is failing the homeless, failing those renting and those who strive to own a home.

This is the most common form of food poisoning in the UK. \n  \nWe have heavily invested in research throughout the production chain and we have already implemented new ideas such as hot water heating, double barrier changing facilities in each house and other technologies which we firmly believe have had a major impact in reducing the number of our birds which can become infected with Campylobacter. \n  \nFurthermore, we are focusing on excellence in biosecurity and innovative processing technologies.\n  \n\n  \nOngoing challenges\n  \n\n  \nControlling infectious disease in poultry is an ongoing challenge Moy Park face, in particular avian influenza . To address this, they have upgraded their AI contingency planning, rewriting the rulebook in the past year to ensure they have a robust plan in place.\n  \nWe have to think carefully how we would react and prevent spread if AI came in to Northern Ireland and together with agencies and Government departments we exchange views regularly with working groups, in order to remain on top of this key issue, Peter said.\n  \n\n  \nCareer Highlight\n  \n\n  \nOver his 40 years with the company Peter said a key highlight has been promoting ownership and pride with the people he works closely with.\n  \nA back to basics approach is one of my fundamental pillars, and I still firmly believe that bird husbandry and welfare are key to producing a high-quality product.\n  \nThere are endless opportunities for those considering a career in agriculture and food production, and as my wife and son also work in the poultry industry, I can definitely vouch for that!\n  \nAs the world population continues to expand, the demand for goods also increases and food production, and those working in the industry, will have to keep up with this development.\n  \nBy strengthening our production capabilities over the past number of years, we are well placed to meet this demand, with poultry a healthy and versatile source of protein which is also good value for money.\n  \n\n  \nPositive outlook\n  \n\n  \nPeter concluded: As I look back on my time in the industry and at Moy Park, I’ve always started each morning the same way, and I think it has stood me in good stead!\n  \nThe first thing I think of is ‘today will bring a new challenge, a new opportunity and I will most likely learn something new’ as every day is a school day!”\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_995387.jpg--.jpg?1535635242000\n","title":"superb gcse results for dunclug college","story":"  \nDUNCLUG College is celebrating historic levels of achievement at GCSE level. \n  \nAll students, including those with ious learning challenges sat a minimum of 7 GCSE subjects, including the compulsory core of English, Maths and Science and a range of GCSE optional choices in a balance of General and Applied courses.\n  \n Many gifted and competitive students sat 8, 9 or 10 subjects.

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

grateful family of a Ballymoney schoolboy whose life was saved by his older brother\u0027s bone marrow have spoken publicly for the first time.\nA year after seven-year-old Caden Moore received a transplant at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children from his 11-year-old brother Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a difference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such life-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined. Caden is improving every day and Ben has never looked back.

We have come close in the past, making it to the quarter-finals and the semi-finals, so to go one better this season is a great feeling.\n\u0026#8220There is a real buzz and a belief in the team that we can go and win the Irish Cup in our first final.\n\u0026#8220We have gone up against teams from all over the Province this season to get to the final.\n\u0026#8220We didn\u0027t know too much about any of them, they were all an unknown quantity, but we played to our strengths and we have been rewarded.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus      return false     else if        your_email.focus      return false     else if        friends_name.focus      return false     else if        friends_email.focus      return false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random return false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n       .ready .click .hide          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.fadeIn          return false                .click .parents.fadeOut          return false                    */       ]]\n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n                           username.focus            return false           else if              password.focus            return false           else                      ]]\n      \n      \"\n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n               return false\" title=\"View The Leader online!\"\n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n banner\" title=\"Advertise with Us\" /\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n          ?

The Ballymoney man lost his father, Mervyn Robinson, to the\u0026#160 North West 200 in 1980, while in July his cousin, William Dunlop, was killed during free practice at the Skerries 100 near Dublin.\nAll of these setbacks forced a re-think, says Robinson.

After the Act of Remembrance, Bro Ward laid a wreath at the Herron family memorial plaque which was unveiled on the boundary wall of Dromore Orange Hall in April 2016 and is the only tangible memorial in Dromore to the history of the Troubles.  \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nTown draper, William Herron , his wife Elizabeth  and daughter Noeline  died in the blaze after an incendiary device was planted in their Market Square drapery store in April 1976. The fire destroyed much of the shop and the family home above it, where the three victims died from suffocation. Bro William Herron was a member of Closkelt LOL 415 in Rathfriland District LOL No 3.\n\n* A series of commemorative events also took place across Northern Ireland last weekend as the Institution marked its inaugural Orange Victims Day. The Loyal Order formally remember the 335 Orangemen and one Orangewoman murdered by terrorists during the Troubles. The day, which will become an annual event, also highlighted the ongoing plight of the injured and bereaved.\n\n\n   \n                 .

In an interview with Belfast Media Group last November, Munster hinted at remaining in European football.\nHowever, those plans are now on the back burner for the Belfast native as he prepares to take charge of the Indian champions, who will embark on their first AFC Champions League campaign this season and Munster says he is excited by the challenge. \n\n“I have always been going up and achieving more and more each time, even in the coaching courses,” said Munster. \n\n“Everything has been going well and now it’s a great time for some new experience, especially in India. \n\n“Joining a club that has been playing in the highest level, are the current champions and the fact that they are going to play in the AFC Champions League, it’s just perfect. I’m moving in the right direction.” \n\nMunster was also well travelled as a player. Having started his career with Celtic Boys in West Belfast, he played for Cliftonville youths before moving to Canada. Munster later linked up with Slavia Prague and, on his return to Belfast, he signed for Linfield and helped the Blues secure the League and Irish Cup double in 2010 and 2011. \n\nMoving to the north Indian club didn’t phase Munster in the slightest and he is relishing the prospect of helping Minerva Punjab FC secure more silverware in the near future.\n\n“I was looking into Minerva Punjab a few months back, doing research on their scores and social media to see how it is and the first thing that I noticed was Mr Ranjit Bajaj, the owner is very passionate about the club,” added Munster. \n\n“He wants the team to be the best at all levels and that is what I liked a lot.” \n\n“For me, it’s a challenge, a new experience but I am coming here to win. As a player, I’m used to winning leagues, cups, individual awards. Coming here as a coach and working at the highest level in India and also playing in the AFC Champions League, it will be a great experience.”\n\nIn a statement posted on the club’s website, Minerva Punjab FC owner Mr Ranjit Bajaj, added: “We are excited to have Paul on board. He comes in with a lot of experience both as a player and as a coach and we believe that he can contribute a lot to this club. \n\n“We believe that both of us together can achieve great things at this club.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"glider goes live","story":"\n\nTHE\n New Belfast Rapid Transit Glider system has become fully operational today. \n\nThe £90million Glider system will travel the new cross-city routes between West and East Belfast  and from the city centre to the Titanic Quarter .\n\nThe new controversial 12-hour bus lanes built to accommodate the service will operate from 7am and 7pm Monday to Saturday.\n\nLast week, the Department for Infrastructure announced that a 12-month scheme allowing private hire taxis to use the lane has been put on hold.\n\nIn West Belfast some parents have expressed concerns that the bus lane that passes one local school have left them with nowhere to drop off or pick up their children.\n\nDrivers have been warned not to park in the new bus lanes, but at St Kevin’s Primary School on the Falls Road, many parents felt they had no choice but to flout the rules.\n\nSt Kevin\u0026#8217s Primary School Principal Fiona Keegan said: “I don\u0026#8217t think it\u0026#8217s an ideal situation at all. It\u0026#8217s very unfortunate that our parents are now in a position where they have nowhere safe to drop their children off in the mornings and are being forced into the local streets, which is causing congestion. \n\n“Not all of my children come from the local surrounding area and therefore can walk to school. We service families from beyond West Belfast, a lot of parents do have to travel. Also, although we are a mainstream school we have a lot of children who have additional learning needs and any change of their morning routine can be detrimental to them and we have to be very aware of that and for children particularly with any sort of autism diagnosis getting out of a car to walk across a main road is very worrying for a parent.”\n\nSchool caretaker Tony Murphy said: “Many of the parents had no choice but to park in the cemetery this morning which isn\u0026#8217t ideal for anyone, also if you look at the bus lane line, our teachers have to break it to get into the staff car park. The side streets were always busy but now they are going to be ten times worse. We put signs out about parking to stop the parents pulling up and then having to reverse out, in case they hit a child. People are getting picked up in taxis in the outside lane and cars are stopping there and the kids are getting out and crossing the road.”\n\nOne local man who did not wish to be named said: “I\u0026#8217m a taxi man but this morning I decided to get my bike out and see what it would be like in the bus lane. I\u0026#8217ve cycled from the Michael Ferguson roundabout to here, it took me 23 minutes and the Glider has yet to pass me. My intention was to stop it by cycling in front of it, I see some cars parked here in the bus lane and I don\u0026#8217t blame them. People would put up with it if it was for the greater good but it\u0026#8217s not.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"markets residents stress the need for social homes at gates of city hall","story":"\n\nRESIDENTS \nfrom the Markets took to the gates of City Hall last night to reiterate their call that land marked for social housing remains so.\nResidents and campaigners gathered on Monday night to mark the first anniversary of Belfast City Council’s vote to earmark land on the Gasworks site – previously zoned for social housing – available instead for a hotel extension and a multistorey carpark.\nMembers from the Homes Now campaign group handed in a petition to Belfast City Council Chief Executive Suzanne Wylie as Belfast Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey and Deputy Lord Mayor, Alliance’s Emmett McDonough-Brown signed the Homes Now pledge.\nHomes Now campaigner Bernie Dobbin said: “The people of the Markets have waited too long for adequate social housing to be built in the area and we are no longer prepared to take verbal assurances from officials and politicians.\n“Time and again, these officials and politicians have broken their word and left residents high and dry. This is why we are asking councillors and officials to sign the Homes Now pledge – for their commitment to become a matter of public record.\n“Belfast City Council have sent out a lot of positive messages since the disgraceful decision of their Planning Committee last September, but still not a brick for new housing has been laid.

I’m going to the Euro qualifiers in October with the U-17s and won the Milk Cup with County Antrim last year.”\nBarry is usually found either in midfield or playing out on the wing and as a Liverpool fan growing up, looked up to players such as Steven Gerrard and Philippe Coutinho as well as Barcelona legend, Lionel Messi.\nOf course, he has a long way to go to emulate his idols, but he has done everything right so far to have captured the interest of a professional club in England.\n“They saw me playing for Northern Ireland and asked me over for a trial,” explains the Turf Lodge lad.\n“I went over for two weeks and did well, so they brought me back for another two weeks and asked me to sign at the end of it.”\nBeing away from home is not a problem for the rising star as there are some familiar faces also signed to the Lancashire club.\n“There are two boys I would know from the Northern Ireland team living over there already,” he continued.\n“I already knew them before I went over. That makes it far easier for me to settle in.”\nBarry made the journey across to England at the weekend as he begins life at his new club and he is hoping to make his mark early.\nThe hope is to sufficiently impress in the next two years to earn himself another contract when he turns 18.\n “This is a completely new start with a new team and new players,” he acknowledged.\n“The aim is to get offered to stay for longer after these two years and for now I will be playing with the U-18s and hopefully start to climb the ladder.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"alban maginness only aung san suu kyi has the moral authority to bring an end to genocide of the rohingya people","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The event did not draw much media attention, but symbolised the passionate commitment of local people in the search for justice for a helpless, persecuted Muslim minority.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nThis quiet, dignified event, organised by the Peace People, drew attention to the truly awful violence perpetrated by Myanmar government military forces against the civilian Muslim minority of Rohingyas, who live in the state of Rakhine in Myanmar.\n\nThe Rohingyas, who have lived in this area for many generations before and including the British colonisation of India and Burma, are not regarded as Myanmar citizens and have no legal right to citizenship.\n\nThe Myanmar military dictatorship passed laws in 1982, depriving Rohingyas of legal status within Myanmar, or Burma as it was then called.\n\nThis was done despite the fact that the Rohingyas had enjoyed citizenship from independence in 1948 right up until the military takeover in 1962. \n\nThe Myanmar authorities argue that the Rohingyas are merely illegal migrants from Bangladesh.\n\nDealing with the current situation in a detailed and forthright statement, Mairead Maguire said that she had visited Cox\u0027s Bazar, Chittagong, Bangladesh in February, where over a million Rohingya refugees were living in makeshift camps, having fled persecution by Myanmar\u0027s soldiers.\n\nListing in vivid detail many violations of human rights carried out by Myanmar troops, she said that the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights had labelled these atrocities as a \"textbook example of ethnic cleansing\". \n\nSo bad was the situation that Ms Maguire called for those responsible to be made accountable before the International Criminal Court.\n\nShe declared that she was convinced that the attempted annihilation of the Rohingya should be officially declared as an act of genocide.\n\nShe went further and called upon the highly respected and acclaimed Nobel Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi - the de facto head of the Myanmar government - to acknowledge the genocide against the Rohingyas and to take action to stop such barbarity by the military.\n\nShortly after the Belfast event, the United Nations Fact Finding Mission Report was published in summary form. \n\nThe full report will be officially presented on September 18 by the UN.\n\nThe report accuses the Myanmar military and politicians of indiscriminate killings, large-scale gang rapes and the torching of over 400 villages in attacks described as widespread and systematic and which had \"genocidal intent\".\n\nSignificantly, it also calls for the Myanmar\u0027s military top brass, the Tatmadaw, to face the International Criminal Court for genocide, as well as crimes against humanity and war crimes.\n\nThe report also singles out Aung San Suu Kyi for failure to use her position, or her moral authority, to prevent the developments in the Rakhine state. \n\nAs a result, her huge personal reputation hangs in the balance.\n\nWhile the report and its recommendations are clear and recognise that the 40-year-old campaign by the Myanmar armed forces is effectively genocide, it will take a lot of persuasion to make the UN Security Council take action against the Myanmar military, which controls the security policies of the government.\n\nThe military controls the ministries of defence and internal affairs and the vice-presidency. It also has a quarter of the seats in parliament.\n\nProbably more important in all of this is the attitude of the Chinese government, which has invested massive amounts of money in Myanmar and which is presently engaged in huge infrastructure works there.\n\nGiven their own gloomy record on human rights, it is hard to believe that they will do anything other than veto any sanctions, or other actions, by the UN against the Myanmar military establishment.\n\nThe position of Aung San Suu Kyi is pivotal, because she alone could turn the tide against the military by giving an alternative, politically moral position, upholding the inalienable human rights of the Rohingya people to basic citizenship and freedom.\n\nThe recognition of the Rohingya people as a discrete religious and ethnic minority in a country of other religious and ethnic minorities is essential for the future well-being of Myanmar.\n\nBut the reality is that the transition in 2015 from a enclosed military dictatorship to real democracy and freedom has only been partially achieved.\n\nAnd great though that peaceful achievement was by Aung San Suu Kyi, there comes a time to conclude that realpolitik with the Myanmar military can go only so far and that a bold and characteristically courageous stand needs to be taken by the formidable political figure of Aung San Suu Kyi.\n\nNor should we forget the persistent work by our own, courageous Mairead Maguire in bringing such international human rights issues to our attention over many years.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"parents park on bus lanes outside belfast school as glider launches","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

I said I did not accept that view.\"\n\nMr Bell was suspended from the DUP in December 2016 following outspoken comments about party leader Arlene Foster\u0027s handling of the RHI scheme.\n\nMeanwhile, in a text message released as part of the inquiry, Dr McCormick described it as a \"great relief\" that Mr Bell would not be travelling to the USA for a St Patrick\u0027s day event.\n\nThe message, sent by Dr McCormick to the then head of the Civil Service Sir Malcolm McKibbin and to former DUP special adviser Alastair Hamilton, followed a previous decision not to include Mr Bell in a ministerial visit to the US as part of the 2016 St Patrick\u0027s Day celebrations.\n\nIn a witness statement posted online as part of the RHI Inquiry on Monday night, Dr McCormick says he was \"told that at one stage it had been envisaged that the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister would lead one programme and the Deti Minister a separate programme which would be directed to a range of additional locations\".\n\nHowever, he says that a week or two before St Patrick\u0027s Day 2016 he was told by Mr Hamilton that \"plans had been scaled back and that Jonathan Bell would not be required to travel\".\n\nDr McCormick said there were \"indications that Jonathan Bell resented this decision\" and he \"inferred that as a direct consequence\" of this he \"delayed providing routine authorisation of Invest NI briefing and travel in support of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister\".\n\nDr McCormick revealed to Mr McKibbin that he had considered seeking a ministerial direction to avoid cancellation of the trip.\n\nOn March 14, 2016, Dr McCormick texted Mr McKibbin and Mr Hamilton that Mr Bell was \"clearing\" his diary to go to New York after being invited to a St Patrick\u0027s Day breakfast. The message stated: \"For your eyes only: JB has been invited through TIL to ICCUSA breakfast on 17th in NYC and is clearing diary to go. Taking Lisa, home Sunday. Can live with it if he uses BA points to pay for flights!\"\n\nBut the following day, Mr Bell texted Dr McCormick: \"New York off flights gone J.\"\n\nFour minutes later, Dr McCormick texted Mr McKibbin and Mr Hamilton, stating: \"Minister can\u0027t get flights so not travelling. Great relief.\"\n\nThe messages are among a raft of new information which has come to light as the RHI hearing continues, including bullying allegations made against Mr Bell made by his Spad Timothy Cairns, notably that Mr Bell \"tried to break his finger and swung a punch at him\".\n\nDr McCormick said that he was \"not aware of these allegations before seeing the references to them in the inquiry documents\" and \"had absolutely no personal experience of\" Mr Bell \"exerting  untoward pressure or bullying, as others have alleged.\"\n\nElsewhere, Dr McCormick reveals that Deti and Invest NI felt a trip by Mr Bell to the US in January 2016 to lead an Invest NI Trade Mission \"had not gone well\".\n\nThe statement refers to \"several awkward incidents\" which it says \"arose in relation to travel to the USA\", and Dr McCormick noted that \"in a number of subsequent conversations with Invest NI colleagues, they commented on Jonathan Bell\u0027s limited contribution to the projection of Northern Ireland\u0027s interests in relation to Foreign Direct Investment and trade .\"\n\nThe statement says that Mr Bell was \"visibly tired at a key meeting on Friday 28 January 2016\" and Dr McCormick says he was \"told later that Jonathan Bell had had quite a late night\" and it was his \"impression\" that he was consequently \"unable to participate fully in the meeting in a constructive way\".\n\nDr McCormick\u0027s statement also says that there was a \"dispute between Jonathan Bell and Arlene Foster\" relating to an invitation to a Wrightbus event featuring the then-Mayor of London Boris Johnson in February 2016, and to which Mr Bell did not receive an invite.\n\nIn a letter dated March 7, 2016, Mr Bell asked Dr McCormick to \"investigate\" why an invitation had not been received by his department.\n\nIn a further letter on March 10 to the senior civil servant, Mr Bell said Dr McCormick had told him that \"the First Minister had instructed the Head of the NI Civil Service not to proceed with the investigation and you as permanent secretary informed me that it was your advice \u0027not to proceed for my own good.\u0027\"\n\nMr Bell requested that Dr McCormick \"clarify what you meant by \u0027not to proceed for my own good?\" and asked that \"all future advice from you is given in writing to me while I investigate this matter legally.\" \n\nHowever, in an email to Mr Bell\u0027s private secretary Sean Kerr, private secretary to the Secretary of State Fiona McCoy said Mr Bell\u0027s omission seems to have been \"a genuine mistake\". \n\nIn correspondence to Mr Bell, Dr McCormick says he understands that the First Minister and Deputy First Minister had not received invitations, and had contacted organisers to meet Mr Johnson \"in the margins of the announcement event\".\n\nHe wrote that Wrightbus stated it was \"told by NIO that local ministers were not to be invited\" but that the NIO \"have no explanation as to why Wrightbus told me that it had been told not to invite local ministers\".\n\nDr McCormick added that he advised Mr Bell not to pursue to investigation as it would be \"difficult\" to \"see any outcome that would be satisfactory\" to him, and that it \"could do damage\" to Mr Bell\u0027s relationships with Wrightbus and/or Transport for London.\n\nHe said it was his understanding that \"the issue over the invitations has already damaged relationships between Wrightbus and Deti\".\n\nIn a supplementary personal statement dated October 18, 2017, Dr McCormick says he was told by Mr Bell in the course of conversations that the DUP\u0027s most senior Spad Timothy Johnston - now party chief executive - was the \"instigator of the delay\" in introducing a new tariff for RHI, and admits that he also \"voluntarily referred to \u0027TJ\u0027 as the instigator\". \n\nHe stated that these references \"need to be placed in the context\" of \"Jonathan Bell\u0027s clear statements of his prior and independent knowledge that Timothy Johnston had been behind the delay \" and \"a number of clear statements where I say directly that I  had not been aware of, nor had we suspected, involvement by Timothy Johnston in the delay in the tariff reduction\".\n\nHe added he \"accepted and repeated Jonathan Bell\u0027s references to Timothy Johnston as a key advocate for keeping the tariff at the higher level\" because \"not to have done so would have been to imply untruth in what Jonathan Bell had stated very clearly\". \n\nHe said: \"Ultimately, it was only in a phone call on 16 December 2016 that Timothy Cairns directly confirmed to Chris Stewart and me that Andrew Crawford had been the \u0027prime mover\u0027 for the delay. It was only on the evening of the PAC hearing on 18 January 2017  that Timothy Cairns first said to me that Timothy Johnston had also been involved.\"\n\nReferencing the period between the Spotlight programme on December 6, 2016 and the PAC evidence on January 18, 2017, Dr McCormick added: \"This was a period when the DUP was very concerned to deflect or discredit any possible reference to Timothy Johnston, and, ultimately, acquiesced with the necessity  of naming Andrew Crawford as the instigator of the delay . \n\n\"The DUP was clearly unhappy that I appeared to have accepted Jonathan Bell\u0027s premise that Timothy Johnston had been involved.\"\n\nA DUP spokesman said: \"It would not be appropriate to comment on evidence given to the public inquiry, outside of the inquiry process. It is important that the inquiry is allowed to complete its work.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"some of key figures with links to botched rhi green energy scheme","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nThe minister said that “97 weeks ago I was presented with a future for An Post that was uncertain and extremely bleak”.\n\nHe said: “I was determined the company would not go under on my watch because of the failure to act by successive governments.\n\n“I could have sat on my hands and ignored it and let hundreds of post offices continually close.”\n\nThe minister listed declining mail volumes, eSubstitution and the move to online payments and online banking as major impacts on the sector.\n\n\n\nNo minister wants to be in the position I am in today, but I\u0027ve decided we need to have a viable future for the post office network\nDenis Naughten\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Naughten added: “If politically we shirk decision-making, we potentially ultimately will have no post office network at all.\n\n“No minister wants to be in the position I am in today, but I’ve decided we need to have a viable future for the post office network.\n\n“These are not decisions that have been taken lightly or without good reason.\n\n“At the last general election, postmasters came and asked for a modernisation plan for the post office, we’re doing that, and redundancy package, we’re doing that, and a look at new services, which is happening at the moment.”\n\nThe minister added that it is longstanding policy that postal services will not be directly subsidised by Government.\n\nMr Naughten appeared before the meeting of the Communications, Climate Action and Environment Committee to answer questions on the restructuring plan, worked out between An Post and the Irish Postmasters’ Union .\n\nThe plan has been criticised by some over the anticipated impact on rural Ireland, with some saying the Government had failed in its commitment to rural life.\n\nThe minister refuted the idea that the post office was central to rural communities.\n\nHe said: “The post offices were the nucleus of the community in the past but I don’t believe that today.\n\n“We have not seen new innovative services in the post office, we don’t see young people using services in the post office.\n\n“That can only be done by modernising the post office network.”\n\nThe changes will affect post offices in Carlow, Clare, Cork, Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Mayo, Tipperary and Wexford.\n\nThe meeting was attended by representatives from An Post, the Post Office Networks and representatives of An Post mailing centres.\n\nSeamus Maye, chairman of the Public Banking Forum of Ireland, urged the Government to think outside the box in relation to saving the post office network.\n\nHe said: “Ireland’s post office can become a core plank of rebuilding Ireland, but the current narrative is all wrong, we can at the stroke of a pen turn it into a thriving multi-service provider.\n\n“The current An Post proposals are bizarre and ill thought out, and would see the destruction of one of our best institutions.\n\n“Going forward, we need to think outside the box to avoid wanton destruction of our post office network.”\n\nTom O’Callaghan, leader of the forum’s post office unit, said that the Government is attacking its own national asset.\n\nSome of the committee members agreed with the suggestion of a community bank being run by An Post to offer loans to small businesses and low-income households who would be turned away from pillar banks.\n\nThe committee heard the cost of setting up such a bank would be around 160 million euro.\n\n“We have an opportunity to do the right thing for the first time ever,” Mr O’Callaghan added.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rhi rampant jealousies and jockeying at top of dup laid bare for all to see","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n |

They revealed a Stormont soap opera beyond what even the most cynical satirist would have come up with.\n\nRampant jealousies and jockeying for position, and a leading DUP figure taping others.\n\nThen there\u0027s the extraordinary allegation that former Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment  Minister Jonathan Bell tried to punch his special adviser Timothy Cairns and break his finger.\n\nThis is material you would expect on the Jeremy Kyle Show.\n\nBut it\u0027s actually a glimpse into what was going on behind-the-scenes in the DUP, which we have always been told is one big  happy family.\n\nThe Ulster Unionist Party did tear itself apart during David Trimble\u0027s leadership, but at least no accusations of physical violence were ever made.\n\nIn his written witness statement, Dr McCormick referred to the poor relationship between Mr Bell and Mr Cairns. The special adviser made allegations that the minister \"tried to break his finger and swung a punch at him\".\n\nIt is, of course, important to point out that Dr McCormick was not in any shape or form validating the claims made against the minister.\n\nIndeed, he said: \"I think I should emphasise that, for most of the time when Jonathan Bell was Deti Minister, I got on very well with him: both as minister, and at a human level in all the ordinary day to day interactions that are inherent to the job.\n\n\"Jonathan Bell actively sought my advice and involvement... always appeared to respect my role and position, often with relaxed good humour, and I had absolutely no personal experience of his exerting  untoward pressure or bullying, as others have alleged.\"\n\nMr Bell, who is due to appear before the RHI Inquiry tomorrow, will surely address the allegations, and Mr Cairns will have his say when he gives evidence next Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nDr McCormick said Mr Bell had recorded conversations with himself and with DUP Upper Bann MLA Carla Lockhart.\n\nThere were claims that a trip by the former DUP minister to the US in 2016 to lead an Invest NI Trade Mission \"had not gone well\".\n\nMr Bell was \"visibly tired at a key meeting on Friday, January 28, 2016\" and Mr McCormick said it was his \"impression\" that he had been \"unable to participate fully in the meeting in a constructive way\" as he had \"quite a late night\" the previous evening.\n\nThere was friction over Mr Bell\u0027s lack of invitation to a Wrightbus event in Ballymena involving London Mayor Boris Johnson which Arlene Foster and Martin McGuinness attended in February 2016.\n\nMr Bell was clearly very keen to increase his profile and assert his independence as minister. This brought him into direct conflict with the party\u0027s top brass.\n\nThe outcome of that long-running battle will be decided at the RHI Inquiry.\n\nThe former DETI minister\u0027s claims and those of his opponents will be examined in painstaking detail over coming days and weeks.\n\nBoth sides know the stakes couldn\u0027t be any higher.\n\nSome of key figures with links to botched green energy scheme\n\nANDREW McCORMICK\n\nFormer permanent secretary at Deti. In February he moved from leading the Department for the Economy to become director general of International Relations, heading up NI’s preparations for Brexit.\n\nALASTAIR HAMILTON\n\nA former DUP special adviser who has since been appointed to the position of chief executive of Invest NI, which is responsible for growing companies, industry and jobs here.\n\nANDREW CRAWFORD\n\nWas special adviser to then Enterprise Minister Arlene Foster when the RHI scheme was developed and launched in autumn 2012. He has appeared a number of times in front of the RHI Inquiry.\n\nTIMOTHY JOHNSTON\n\nFormer special adviser to three First Ministers: Ian Paisley, Peter Robinson and Arlene Foster.

behind the Royal Mint in Llantrisant, South Wales.\n\nThe UK’s coin manufacturer says the turbine will generate up to 850kW of electricity to help power its 38-acre site and cut down on fuel consumption.\n\nThe 214ft high fixture will be officially unveiled on Wednesday afternoon and will help power the Royal Mint’s factory and visitor attraction.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nDevelopers say the Royal Mint’s wind turbine will become an “iconic landmark” \n\n\n\n\nPictures of the towering “daffodil”, which is the national flower of Wales, were widely shared on social media by bemused onlookers when it was erected last month.\n\nIt has been fully refurbished and painted to give its flower-like appearance after previously being used on a wind farm in the Netherlands.\n\nRoyal Mint chief executive Anne Jessopp said: “The hilly nature of our location gave us the perfect opportunity to install a wind turbine behind the Royal Mint site to help with our energy consumption and enhance our use of natural power.\n\n“I think that it is particularly apt that our daffodil-coloured turbine originally saw service in Holland – the land of flower bulbs.”\n\nAndrew Crossman, of wind and solar energy project developer Infinite Renewables, said: “As renewable energy developers with a wealth of expertise in wind and solar schemes across the UK, the Royal Mint’s ‘daffodil’ wind turbine is certainly one of the more unusual projects we have worked on.\n\n“We are proud of the part we played in creating what is not only a source of low-cost green electricity, but also an iconic landmark for visitors to the Royal Mint Experience and the surrounding region.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"you me and the big c now number one podcast after rachael

So we make plans, knowing it’s not very long.\n\n“I have a Whatsapp group with Steve’s sister where I send her things I want for Freddie and his future. The things that might overwhelm and upset Steve now but she will make sure happens.\n\n“The main thing is that, while he’s so young, I want him to remember me in some way.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"10 things that are technically true but","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Twitter denies that is happening.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nLarry Page \n\n\n\n\nThe panel invited Larry Page, chief executive of Google’s parent company Alphabet, but the company said it would send a lower-ranking executive. The committee rejected that offer, and is expected to have an empty chair at the hearing for Mr Page.\n\nSenate intelligence committee chairman Richard Burr said Google does not “understand the problem” if it does not want to work with the government to find solutions.\n\nThe back-and-forth with Google is the latest in a year’s worth of attempts by Congress to force the companies to focus more sharply on the Russian interference issue. \n\nWhile Mr Burr says he believes Facebook and Twitter understand the problem, it took both companies several months last year to acknowledge they had been manipulated.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nSheryl Sandberg \n\n\n\n\nIn prepared remarks for the hearing, Facebook’s number two executive Sheryl Sandberg details many ways the company is addressing the problem but reiterates that the company was slow to spot it. \n\nThirteen Russians were indicted by special counsel Robert Mueller earlier this year on charges of an elaborate plot to disrupt the 2016 US presidential election by creating fake accounts that pushed divisive issues on social media.\n\nIn her evidence, Ms Sandberg details continuing efforts to take down material linked to the Russian agency, including the removal this year of 270 Facebook pages. \n\nBut she says the company’s overall understanding of the Russian activity in 2016 is limited “because we do not have access to the information or investigative tools” that the US government has.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"derry counselling group host walk hope memory local man","story":"\nA walk aimed at remembering those who have lost their battle with addiction was held in honour of a Derry man who passed away last year.\n\nThe ‘Walk of Hope’, organised by Heal the Hurt, took place on Derry’s Walls on Saturday, in remembrance of Terence ‘Butch’ Crawley, who passed away in December 2017.\n\nHeal the Hurt, which was founded in 2016 by Derry man Liam Stewart, offers free counselling to those suffering from the effects of alcohol and drug abuse.\n\nSpeaking to the Derry News, Mr Stewart said Saturday’s walk was also aimed at sending out a message to those suffering from addiction that Heal the Hurt would ‘stand with them’, and help them in their battle.\n\n“We wanted to remember every single person who has lost their battle with addiction,” he said.\n\n“We also wanted to show families that regardless of the stigma associated with addiction, we will stand with them, and we will be there for them.\n\n“There is an epidemic here locally which is taking the lives of our loved ones, and we believe that our city is dealing with a mental health crisis.”\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nMr Stewart continued that they have moved into a new premise due to increase in demand for their services, which opened its doors on Monday.\n\n“The numbers pf people coming to us reached the point where we could no longer cope – there’s simply wasn’t enough space for everyone to fit into the room,” he added.\n\n“We’ve now secured a room at Northside Shopping Centre and hopefully we can keep that until Christmas.”\n\nHe added that in addition to helping those suffering from addiction, Heal the Hurt also provides support to those helping loves ones deal with the substance and alcohol abuse.\n\n“We host a ‘Friends and Family’ session on a Wednesday, which is continuing to grow,” he said.\n\n“Families are often forgotten about when a loved one has an addiction, and there needs to be a support network there for them too.”\n\nYou can find out more about Heal the Hurt through the group’s Facebook page, or contact them on 07783910072.\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"flybmi supporting derrys halloween festival london derry direct flights","story":"\nFlybmi is delighted to be supporting the world’s premier Halloween festival in Derry from 26th October – 3rd November 2018.\n\nLaunching the flybmi web fares from £99 including broomsticks, 23kg of hold luggage, complimentary drinks/beverages/snacks on-board, the spooky sensational web fares must be booked by 10th September for travel to City of Derry Airport this Halloween or until end of March 2019!

Bird is a moving image work that is as much about observation and environment as education and spectatorship. This exhibition also recognises the history of Brooke Park as the former site of an orphanage financed by John Gwyn.\n\nBird is curated by Alice Butler, a writer, film programmer and curator.

Some are abstract and some are more detailed.\n\n“She goes through different phases, but landscapes are her favourite.\n\n“Tori’s signature style is colour. People always seem to comment on how the colours are so vivid and bold.”\n\nTori and Karen have now set up a Facebook page ‘Art by Tori’ which quickly established a strong online following and she has since sold several paintings and been commissioned to paint several more.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\n“From there we thought that we should do an exhibition,” said Karen.\n\n“The Waterside Theatre are very good at supporting aspiring artists and we now have 50 paintings all ready to go and all framed.”\n\nTori is currently in her second year of a transitional course at the North West Regional College and is also a member of the Foyle Down Syndrome Trust  where she is able to take part in music, art, photography and gardening.\n\n“FDST try to do things that the members are interested in,” said Dara.\n\n“They have been a great support to Tori throughout her life amd I feel like she is living her dream at the minute.”\n\n“Tori can sometimes find social situations difficult, but this has given her so much confidence, through answering people on her Facebook page and talking to people about her art when she is out and about.\n\n“I think it will give other people hope that they can achieve their dreams.\n\nDara added: “All any parent wants for their kids is for them to be happy and she is so happy when she is painting.”\n\nTori\u0027s show will take place at The Waterside Theatre from Friday, September 7 to Friday, September 21.\n\nThere will be an opening night event this Friday, September 7 from 7pm to 9pm.\n\nThe theatre is open from 9.30am to 4.30pm from Monday to Friday and on the evening of theatre performances.\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"new radnor pictures knockout fun at new radnor carnival","story":"\nNew Radnor Carnival Queen, Bethan Evans with Princess, Ella Davies, and King, Jo\u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gtsh Probert, and atte\u0026ltspan class=truncate-full-screen\u0026gtndant Jack Hughes.

Following the failure of management to respond to this offer, the unions have been left with no choice but to proceed to a consultative ballot on industrial action.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoThis is a historic mark of shame for the council as this is the first time that all four unions representing the workforce have jointly balloted for action.\n\nIn a statement issued yesterday the council said that it was disappointed to learn that the trade unions had issued the press statement without giving pre-notice.\n\nIt says: \u0026ldquoThe statement issued by the Joint Trade Union Side came as a surprise, not least because the council had been in discussions with the unions up until Friday, August 24, where it was agreed by both sides that a meeting would take place on September 3, to be chaired by the Labour Relations Agency.\n\n\u0026ldquoWe were disappointed then to see the unions issue a pre-emptive statement on Bank Holiday Monday that we were given no notice of, nor were we contacted to respond to its contents.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoTrade Union representatives have been part of the job matching process for every post, except one where they declined the invitation to take part.

Such was the demand that people were even contacting me on Saturday night to see if we had any spare tickets, he said.\n\nLocal priests who attended the mass were Fr Gerry McCloskey from Ardglass and Fr Brian Brown of St Patrick\u0026rsquos in Ballynahinch.\n\nChurch of Ireland Dean Henry Hull from Down Cathedral travelled on the coaches with the pilgrims and tweeted after his experience \u0026mdash \u0026ldquoSafely home after a very blessed and uplifting day in Dublin #PapalVisit.\n\nDespite the visit being viewed a difficult one as Pope Francis was being called upon to address the many instances of institutional abuse and clerical sexual abuse of children and women in the island\u0026rsquos recent history, parishioners were still excited to see and eager to listen to the words of their spiritual leader.\n\nDownpatrick man Jackie Breen, who attends St Patrick\u0026rsquos Church, says that the experience of seeing his spiritual leader will stay with him for a lifetime.\n\nHe made sure to make the visit special for his family by personally attending the earlier Festival of Families events on Thursday and Friday, attending the Croke Park concert with his wife Tracey and daughter Lucy and then the Phoenix Park mass on Sunday with his son Dylan.\n\n\u0026ldquoPope John Paul gave us the blessing of peace in Ireland when he spoke here and that was also\u0026nbsp seen in Europe a few years later and I believe that Pope Francis has left us with the special blessing of hope and healing in his visit, said Mr Breen.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a message of hope and healing not just for Catholics but for all Christians.\n\nHe added that the entire Festival of Families and the Pope\u0026rsquos words helped to underline how crucial the role that families have in global society.\n\nMcCartan Digney , says that he felt very emotional about the entire experience.\n\nHe travelled with his mother Louise to Phoenix Park and proudly carried the yellow and white Papal flag that she had when she went to see Pope John Paul at the youth Mass in Galway.\n\n\u0026ldquoEver since I watched a TV documentary about nine years on the 30th anniversary of Pope John Paul\u0026rsquos visit, I\u0026rsquove wanted to see our Holy Father myself and kept the flag for my chance and I couldn\u0026rsquot believe that I got the chance to do so, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt was very emotional from all the singing and the long walk there. There were tears of joy and tears of sadness\u0026nbsp when Pope Francis acknowledged for the first time the hurt that has been done, but it really needed to be said and it was good to hear the words from the head of our church.\n\nFor Mark Ferris from Drumaness and his partner Kathleen Oliver, their attendance in Dublin during the entire Papal visit was the highlight of a very religious week.\n\nEarlier in the week while holidaying in Portugal, the couple visited the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima.\n\nMr Ferris was a boy of eight when he last saw a serving pope in Ireland when Pope John Paul II visited in 1979.\n\nHowever, he watched the mass at Drogheda, estimated to have nearly attracted 1.3m people, on the television at home with his family.\n\nFor this visit, Mr Ferris says he was determined not to miss out.\n\n\u0026ldquoMy partner had arranged for us to go to Dublin for the Pope\u0026rsquos visit as a birthday celebration but I would have been there no matter what.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis experience was something that I would never will forget and well worth the blisters I have on my feet in walking the five or six miles to Phoenix Park.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoWhen the Pope did his tour of Dublin, we were really close when he pass by and I believe he looked directly at me.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe concert was absolutely brilliant as was the Mass and we really enjoyed the entire weekend.\n\nSouth Down MLA Colin McGrath also attended Sunday\u0026rsquos Papal Mass.\n\nWhile he represented the SDLP along with deputy Nicola Mallon, he travelled down as part of the Downpatrick and Lecale parish group.\n\nHe said that the event was notable for the number of young people who attended.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe atmosphere was electric and it was a special moment when the Pope arrived.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe overall theme of his visit was obviously \u0026lsquofamilies\u0026rsquo and it was great to see so many families there together too. There was a great connection amongst the Downpatrick Parish group with over 200 travelling together. \n\nHe added: \u0026ldquoPope Francis also sent a special message of forgiveness and healing for the Church\u0026rsquos involvement in difficult matters in the past which was important too.\n\n\u0026ldquoAll together, it was a fabulous event which will be remembered for a generation.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"}]
