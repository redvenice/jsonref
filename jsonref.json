That was not cool at all.’However Netta has previously explained the reasons behind her look and love of Japanese culture – saying she adopted it as a defence mechanism after being bullied at school.Speaking to  in Lisbon ahead of the contest, she explained it ‘took time to find her niche’ after the way she was treated by her peers when she was younger, and that music also helped her overcome difficulties.It’s common knowledge that the star is a huge fan of the Japanese culture, especially the children’s TV series Pokemon, as she previously claimed her favourite Pokemon was Bulbasaur .Talking to the Independent she answered of her favourite: ‘Bulbasaur because he’s sassy and he’s a good friend and his vines would help me reach whatever I want.’Before adding: ‘Also, Jigglypuff as he can sing and that could help me to sleep, as I’m having trouble sleeping because I’m over excited about everything that’s happening.‘Also he paints on peoples faces when they’re asleep which I’ve done too. Finally… Snorlax. He’s fat and amazing.’While there were those who weren’t keen on her outfit, others picked up on her love for the Japanese culture, and showed their support for the star.Someone wrote: ‘Its not cultural appropriation as long as it is done with admiration of the culture. Netta has said that she chose this theme because it is something that she really loves a lot and she wants to promote it. Context matters!’And another user added: ‘I saw Netta’s performance and the cultural appropriation tweets did not disappoint. But appropriation is when a dominant culture adopts traits of a minority culture. I really don’t consider Israeli culture dominant over Japanese or vice versa.’ have reached out to Netta’s reps for comment. If you\u0027ve got a story, video or pictures get in touch with the  Entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page - we\u0027d love to hear from you.MORE: Salvador Sobral hands Netta the 2018 Eurovision trophy after calling Israel’s winning song Toy ‘horrible’MORE: SuRie still has sense of humour as she breaks silence following Eurovision stage crasher ruins performance"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/sec_11988569.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"man ski mask threw acid womans face dated black man","story":"Alma Ponce, 18, was left with burns on her face, neck, arms and chest when she was attacked (Picture: SWNS)A woman has been left scarred for life after a mystery thug wearing a ski mask doused her in acid.Alma Ponce, 18, was attacked with the corrosive liquid during a midnight ambush outside her home on June 18 last year.As Patricia, 45, tried to unlock the front door the attacker raced around the side of the house and hurled acid at Alma before fleeing the scene.Police believe it was a racially motivated attack after her mother found graffiti daubed on the side of the family home which read: ‘Alma n***r loving wh*re.’Alma Ponce, 18, before the attack (Picture: SWNS)Alma, of Oak Cliff in Dallas, Texas, said: ‘I think about this attack every day and it will be something I think about for the rest of my life.‘I wake up every morning and I just hope it was a dream but it never is because then I see my scars in the mirror.‘At night I get scared. I think the could be around that corner waiting for me again.’The sales rep was rushed to hospital with second degree burns on her face, neck and chest, and had to undergo a series of skin grafts.Alma feared for her life when her attacker threw burning acid all over her (Picture: SWNS)Alma said: ‘I just didn’t know what to do, it was just seconds but it felt like a long time. All I could feel instantly was this burning sensation on my neck and face. It was awful.‘It got into my eye so I couldn’t see. It felt like my skin was melting off.

The police never found out who did it,’ she added.Alma now lives in fear the attacker – who has not been caught – will strike again. I’m really not hopeful that they’ll ever catch who did this,’ she said.‘I was unable to tell the police anything about him and it all happened so quickly.

I will not let you down.’Mrs May stressed the UK would be aligned with Brussels on some issues as there had to be ‘compromises’ after withdrawal.‘Of course, the details are incredibly complex, and, as in any negotiation, there will have to be compromises.’Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer branded Cabinet isions over proposals for a customs arrangement farcical.He told the BBC: ‘I think we are in a farcical situation at the moment, nearly two years after the referendum the Cabinet is fighting over (the) two customs options neither of which frankly are workable, neither of which are acceptable to the EU.”He added: ‘What we propose is a combination, on the one hand a comprehensive customs union, nobody credible suggests you can achieve no hard border (in Ireland) without it and also a strong single market relationship that hard wires the benefits of the single market into the future agreement.’MORE: Donald Trump says North Korea is ‘very smart’ for planning to close nuclear site"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/10/16/4C0E4F2300000578-5713953-image-a-6_1525966456420.jpg","title":"Behind scenes footage shows Meghan Markle fits giggles set forgetting lines","story":"    Behind-the-scenes footage of Meghan Markle on the TV drama Suits shows the actress dissolving into fits of giggles, dancing around the set and fluffing her lines          Outtakes from the first six series, show the close friendship between the princess-to-be and her co-stars Patrick J Adams and Sarah Rafferty          The off-cuts of the hit series Suits, which can be found on YouTube , under the titles \u0027Blooper Reel\u0027 or \u0027Gag Reel\u0027 give a fascinating insight into Meghan\u0027s personalityWill Prince Harry shave off his beard in time for the big...The hazard of a dukedom: If Harry and Meghan really want to...Meghan and Harry bring New York to a stand still... sort of:...Share this articleBut she does not appear in as many clips as the rest of the cast, showing how seriously she took her big break in the profession.Meghan, 36, who marries Prince Harry next Saturday, joined Suits in 2011, moving from Los Angeles to Toronto.But she has now admitted that she thought she had blown her audition for the role of paralegal Rachel Zane in the show, originally entitled A Legal Mind.In an interview with listings magazine Fan The Fire, she said: \u0027It was just like any other audition.\u0027I was sent the material and was asked to go and read for the producers.

Prince Albert had projected in 2016 that the restoration project would take at least a year to complete, and he was pretty close on his estimateNow with two children of his own, he told People magazine at the time that he purchased the property that he can\u0027t wait to make new memories there with his own children, twins Prince Jacques and Princess Gabriella.\u0027I\u0027m looking forward to showing the house to the kids, sharing it with them, having them see the garden,\u0027 he said. He projected then that the restoration project would take at least a year to complete, and he was pretty close on his estimate.

They have been published in newspapers, magazines and on websites around the world.          1.

Mr Markle and the photographer book time to use one of the computers, but are secretly planning to choreograph a photoshootIn all of them Mr Markle appears to be unaware they are being taken. But we can today reveal they were in fact contrived and shot with his co-operation. It is not known if he was paid to take part.The faked images include Mr Markle apparently:Being measured for a suit to wear to the wedding – in fact the ‘tailor’ was an assistant at a party goods shop recruited for the job as the suit hire store the photographer planned to use was closed.Being caught browsing a book of British landmarks in a branch of Starbucks – although he actually arrived at the cafe with the photographer, and set up the shot.Working out with weights to get in shape for the big day – but the pictures appear to have been taken on a waste tip, an unlikely place to exercise but away from prying eyes.The revelation that Mr Markle has been co-operating with a paparazzo behind the backs of his daughter, Prince Harry and Kensington Palace officials will cause huge embarrassment to the Royal Family in the run-up to the wedding. It will be galling for Harry who, in a BBC documentary last year, hit out at the paparazzi for the way in which they pursued his mother, Princess Diana. She was killed in Paris in 1997 after being chased by photographers.And shortly after his relationship with Meghan became public in 2016, the Prince made a heartfelt plea for the media to respect the privacy of Meghan and her family.Last night, just hours ahead of our exposé, represenatives of Mr Markle wrote to editors around the world and to British newspaper watchdog the Independent Press Standards Organisation.

branding it \u0027crazy\u0027 and warning it would be a betrayal of the referendum vote.There are claims today that half the full Cabinet roster could also be opposed to the proposal - which would see the UK collect tariffs on behalf of Brussels and then offer businesses rebates.  Mr Coveney appeared to endorse Mrs May\u0027s vision of a partnership in an interview on the BBC\u0027s Andrew Marr show.He said the UK had made a clear commitment in last December\u0027s agreed UK-EU text that there would be no physical infrastructure on the border.Boris Johnson (pictured attending Cabinet last week) launched an extraordinary public attack on Theresa May\u0027s post-Brexit trade plans          Mr Johnson responded to Mrs May\u0027s latest comments about Brexit on Twitter today\u0027That means we are not talking about cameras and scanning systems and drones here - it means we are talking about a political solution that allows for regulatory alignment in a way that prevents the need for border infrastructure,\u0027 he said.\u0027We are simply asking that that commitment be followed through on.\u0027Mr Coveney said: \u0027I\u0027m not flexible when it comes to border infrastructure, I never have been.\u0027 Tanaiste Mr Coveney said: \u0027To be honest we don\u0027t take our lead from Boris Johnson in relation to Brexit, we take our lead from the Prime Minister.\u0027She has signed up to very clear commitments, she has written to Donald Tusk (European Council President) confirming those commitments and I believe her by the way, I believe she made those commitments in good faith and I believe she wants to follow through on them.\u0027He said Brexit negotiations would face a \u0027difficult summer\u0027 if the UK Government failed to honour its commitment to agreeing a \u0027backstop\u0027 in the withdrawal treaty.The backstop would mean regulations between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic would continue to align post-Brexit, even if a broader trading deal between the UK and EU failed to materialise.This concept has alarmed unionists, who believe it would end up creating trading barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, undermining the constitutional integrity of the kingdom.Democratic Unionist MP Sammy Wilson, one of Mr Coveney\u0027s most vocal critics, branded him \u0027belligerent, interfering and Brit bashing\u0027 and accused him of trying to break up the UK.The UK cabinet is currently ided on the issue, with detractors of the partnership concept instead advocating new technology and trusted trader schemes to enable smooth trade with the EU.Mr Johnson has been very critical of the idea of a partnership or shared customs territory, insisting it would prevent the UK taking back control of its trading policies.   What are the options on the table for a customs deal with the EU? With time ticking away on the Brexit negotiations, the Cabinet is still at daggers drawn on the shape for future trade relations with the EU.The government has set out two potential options for a customs system after the UK leaves the bloc.But despite a series of tense showdowns at Theresa May\u0027s Brexit \u0027War Cabinet\u0027 ministers continue to be deadlocked over what to do.Meanwhile, Brussels has dismissed both the ideas - and warned that negotiations could stall altogether unless there is progress by a key summit next month.                  Despite a series of tense showdowns at Theresa May\u0027s \u0027War Cabinet\u0027 (pictured in February) ministers continue to be deadlocked over what to doOPTION 1 - CUSTOMS PARTNERSHIP Under the so-called \u0027hybrid model\u0027, the UK would collect EU import tariffs on behalf of Brussels.Britain would be responsible for tracking the origin and final destination of goods coming into the country from outside the EU. The government would also have to ensure all products meet the bloc\u0027s standards.Firms selling directly into the UK market would pay the tariff levels set by Brussels - but would then get a rebate if Britain\u0027s tariffs are lower. Supporters of the hybrid plan in Cabinet - including Theresa May, Philip Hammond and Greg Clark - say keeping duties aligned up front would avoid the need for physical customs borders between the UK and EU.As a result it could solve the thorny issue over creating a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.Mrs May has been advised by the chief whip that the hybrid option could be the only way of securing a majority in parliament for a Brexit deal. But Brexiteers regard the proposal as unworkable and cumbersome - and they were joined by Sajid Javid and Gavin Williamson in criticising it at a tense \u0027War Cabinet\u0027 meeting last week.There are fears the experimental system will either collapse and cause chaos, or prevent the UK from being able to negotiate free trade deals around the world after Brexit.Mrs May has instructed official to go away and revise the ideas. Eurosceptics are braced for her to bring back the plan with only \u0027cosmetic\u0027 changes, and try to \u0027peel off\u0027 Mr Javid and Mr Williamson from the core group of Brexiteers.They are also ready for Mrs May to attempt to bypass the \u0027War Cabinet\u0027 altogether and put the issue before the whole Cabinet - where she has more allies. OPTION 2 - MAXIMUM FACILITATIONThe \u0027Max Fac\u0027 option accepts that there will be greater friction at Britain\u0027s borders with the EU. But it would aim to minimise the issues using technology and mutual recognition.Goods could be electronically tracked and pre-cleared by tax authorities on each side.Shipping firms could also be given \u0027trusted trader\u0027 status so they can move goods freely, and only pay tariffs when they are delivered to the destination country.Companies would also be trusted to ensure they were meeting the relevant UK and EU standards on products.Senior ministers such as Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and Liam Fox believe this is the only workable option. But Remain minded Tories such as Mr Clark insist it will harm trade and cost jobs in the UK.They also warn that it will require more physical infrastructure on the Irish border - potentially breaching the Good Friday Agreement. It is far from clear whether the government would be able to force anything through parliament that implied a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.  The EU has dismissed the idea that \u0027Max Fac\u0027 could prevent checks on the Irish border as \u0027magical thinking\u0027. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/13/11/1579796F000005DC-0-image-a-2_1526207005085.jpg","title":"Jamie Oliver drops Sunday Times Rich List time debut","story":"    Jamie Oliver has not appeared on The Sunday Times Rich List for the first time since he debuted on it in 2010In January Oliver announced he was closing 12 of his 37 Italian eateries after his food magazine, Jamie, went under last year. The restaurant closures put more than 200 jobs at risk, after creditors pushed through a restructuring plan devised by the chef.Ex-Hilton hotel chef who was on parole for armed robbery is...Share this articleA Company Voluntary Arrangement will allow the Italian chain to secure rent reductions on the remaining estate and exit unprofitable stores.  When he closed six restaurants last year, Oliver blamed a combination of rising Brexit cost pressures and tough trading.

The 50,000-tonne aircraft carrier is the first to be built and designed entirely in China and is set to become the Navy\u0027s seccond carrier by 2020          The runway on the new vessel models the skip slope design of its predecessor. Though China still lags behind the United States in terms of military might, the Communist government is increasing the country\u0027s dominance in Asia, where only Japan seriously rivals it          The vessel - temporarily named Type 001A - was sent out for sea trials at 7am today as President Xi Jinping pushes ahead with modernisation in the country\u0027s Navy. Experts say that it still won\u0027t be enough to seriously challenge the dominance of the USA within the next 12 yearsCurrently the country only has a retrofitted Soviet-era aircraft carrier called the Liaoning, which was launched in 2012. But CNN reports the new vessel still won\u0027t be enough to rival the United States, but will boost the navy\u0027s standing in Asia.  Sam Roggeveen, senior fellow at Sydney\u0027s Lowy Institute, said: \u0027This is, in and of itself, not designed to be some frontal challenge to US power in the Asia Pacific, because it simply isn\u0027t in the class of America\u0027s aircraft carriers.\u0027          China only has one aircraft carrier (pictured, the ship at its 2007 launch), which is called the Liaoning. It is a retrofitted Soviet-era vessel, showing the marked difference between the communist country\u0027s capabilities as compared with that of the US           The new aircraft carrier weighs 50,000 tonnes and analysis of recent satellite images suggest that modifications have been made for the ship to transport an additional eight aircraft. Unlike the nuclear-powered carriers the United States fields, the Chinese rely on less innovative means of propulsion More than 1,000 feet in length and 246 feet wide, the new ship uses conventional propulsion as opposed to nuclear and recent analysis of satellite images suggests modifications have been made to hold up to eight additional aircraft.Its predecessor was intended more as a training base, but the new ship is likely to be deployed for combat, putting China alongside the US, the UK, Russia and France in its global capability.  Trump\u0027s armada: Huge task force of 12 warships sets sail for...Red alert in the English Channel: Royal Navy\u0027s HMS St Albans...Having a BLAST! Booms ring out across London as HMS Belfast...Share this articleBut it is still the US that fields more aircraft carriers than any other country. As of this year it fields 11 nuclear-powered carriers with \u0027catapult\u0027 technology, in which pistons or electromagnetic rails speed aircraft up as they leave the runway. This gives them an advantage over the Chinese planes, which rely on their own power and the ski-jump designs on both carriers.          China has sent its first home-built aircraft carrier for sea trials as the Communist government attempts to assert its military might on the world stage. Unable to use electromagnetic rails to speed aircraft up as they leave the runway, the ship instead relies on a ski-jump design          The ship is China\u0027s latest attempt to assert its military might and follows a surge of investment from 2010 to 2017, when the Navy\u0027s ship complement increased from 210 to 320. The country is fast developing capabilities to maintain presence in distant waters  Once this latest addition passes sea trials, it will need to be further vetted before it is deemed combat-ready. And plenty can still go wrong during the current trial, as the UK\u0027s HMS Queen Elizabeth proved last year when a leak left it in need of repair.And the US Navy\u0027s newest warship - the USS Gerald R Ford - has been blighted by glitches despite it being the world\u0027s most expensive at $13 billion. The 100,000-tonne vessel\u0027s catapult launcher, the equipment for catching planes upon landing and its radar were all found to be faulty.  Although China is far from catching up with the US, its military budget this year rose by eight per cent as the military pushes for modernisation. The Navy\u0027s ship complement increased from 210 to 320 between 2010 and 2017, with 2016 alone seeing an increase of 18.  American sea power is expected to continue dominating over the next 10 years, but China is fast developing capabilities to maintain presence in distant waters.  Last week US intelligence suggested there is a high probability that the Chinese fired missiles to three artificial islands in military drills.    China\u0027s first homegrown aircraft carrier heads out for sea trial - CNN"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/13/01/4C28951B00000578-0-image-a-9_1526171811008.jpg","title":"For Futures Sake FFS university group writes MPs stop Brexit","story":"    For Our Future\u0027s Sake is a new collective that represents 60 student unions from different universities across the country.

He said Kim \u0027understands\u0027 that in order to strike a deal with the U.S. \u0027this is going to have to be different and big and special, and something that has never been undertaken before\u0027Any deal with North Korea will only be possible if the foreign government that has an economy crashing under the weight of international sanctions feels its financially worth it.Pompeo on Friday said Pyongyang could look forward to a \u0027future brimming with peace and prosperity\u0027 if it gives up its pursuit of nuclear weapons.The lifting of sanctions would allow American companies to enter into contracts with North Korea to rebuild the county\u0027s national infrastructure. Once it\u0027s off the blacklist, Pyongyang could also be eligible for international aid.Sen. Lindsey Graham on CBS on Sunday said, \u0027If you could really get North Korea to give up their nuclear program than I think there\u0027d be a lot of support in Congress to give North Korea a better life. \u0027Provide aid, relieve sanctions with one condition: that you give up your nuclear weapons program in a verifiable way. When it comes to North Korea, I think there’d be a lot of congressional support,\u0027 he said.Bolton on CNN\u0027s \u0027State of the Union\u0027 slapped down the idea of aid to North Korea, however. \u0027I wouldn\u0027t look for economic aid from us,\u0027 he asserted. \u0027I think what the prospect for North Korea is to become a normal nation, to behave and interact with the rest of the world the way South Korea does.\u0027Pompeo told Fox that he was talking about private-sector investments when he made the remark. \u0027Not the U.S. taxpayer, private-sector Americans helping build the energy grid,\u0027 he said. \u0027They need enormous amounts of electricity in North Korea, to work with them to develop infrastructure. All the things that the North Korean people need, the capacity for American agriculture to support North Korea so they can eat meat and have healthy lives.\u0027Even if Trump and Kim agree on the contours of a deal during their Singapore summit, it would most likely need the support of Congress. Former President Barack Obama bypassed lawmakers in 2015 when his administration entered into a nuclear agreement with Tehran to the fury of Republicans who said that only Congress has the authority to approve treaty documents.Bolton on Sunday indicated that the Republican administration was considering proceeding the same way now that Trump is the one in office. \u0027Well it’s entirely possible we’d proceed that way, we’re still thinking about the different alternatives, I wouldn’t want to foreclose the president’s options,\u0027 he said of congressional approval. He admitted in the next breath though that \u0027it’s been one of the criticisms of the Iran nuclear deal to be sure...that a deal of that level of consequence was not given to the Senate as many people think the Constitution provided.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/13/17/4C2E79F100000578-0-image-a-41_1526230355849.jpg","title":"Mushroom hunters two headed fawn Minnesota forest","story":"    Wild Images In Motion Taxidermy positioned the conjoined fawns on a bed of greenery \u0027There are a few reported cases of two-headed ungulate fetuses, but nothing delivered to term.

They have been published in newspapers, magazines and on websites around the world.          1. Photographer Jeff Rayner, camera slung over his shoulder, arrives at the Omega internet cafe at 9.50am on March 27 with Thomas Markle          2. The photographer scans the computer booths for the best viewpoint as Mr Markle heads to the front counter to pay to get online  3. Mr Markle and the photographer book time to use one of the computers, but are secretly planning to choreograph a photoshootIn all of them Mr Markle appears to be unaware they are being taken. But we can today reveal they were in fact contrived and shot with his co-operation. It is not known if he was paid to take part.The faked images include Mr Markle apparently:Being measured for a suit to wear to the wedding – in fact the ‘tailor’ was an assistant at a party goods shop recruited for the job as the suit hire store the photographer planned to use was closed.Being caught browsing a book of British landmarks in a branch of Starbucks – although he actually arrived at the cafe with the photographer, and set up the shot.Working out with weights to get in shape for the big day – but the pictures appear to have been taken on a waste tip, an unlikely place to exercise but away from prying eyes.The revelation that Mr Markle has been co-operating with a paparazzo behind the backs of his daughter, Prince Harry and Kensington Palace officials will cause huge embarrassment to the Royal Family in the run-up to the wedding. It will be galling for Harry who, in a BBC documentary last year, hit out at the paparazzi for the way in which they pursued his mother, Princess Diana. She was killed in Paris in 1997 after being chased by photographers.And shortly after his relationship with Meghan became public in 2016, the Prince made a heartfelt plea for the media to respect the privacy of Meghan and her family.Last night, just hours ahead of our exposé, represenatives of Mr Markle wrote to editors around the world and to British newspaper watchdog the Independent Press Standards Organisation. Editors were told that he was suffering as a result of media intrusion and did not want to participate in photocalls or interviews.          4. In this grainy image, the figure of Mr Markle sitting at a desk in front of a computer screen can just about be made out, while behind him Rayner uses his long lens to capture pictures he later sells for sizeable fees          5.

The letter urged editors not to publish pictures of Mr Markle and called on them to stop pursuing him.Mail on Sunday reporters have established that Mr Markle and Rayner, a 44-year-old Los Angeles-based photographer, set up at least four photoshoots.

branding it \u0027crazy\u0027 and warning it would be a betrayal of the referendum vote.There are claims today that half the full Cabinet roster could also be opposed to the proposal - which would see the UK collect tariffs on behalf of Brussels and then offer businesses rebates.  Mr Coveney appeared to endorse Mrs May\u0027s vision of a partnership in an interview on the BBC\u0027s Andrew Marr show.He said the UK had made a clear commitment in last December\u0027s agreed UK-EU text that there would be no physical infrastructure on the border.Boris Johnson (pictured attending Cabinet last week) launched an extraordinary public attack on Theresa May\u0027s post-Brexit trade plans          Mr Johnson responded to Mrs May\u0027s latest comments about Brexit on Twitter today\u0027That means we are not talking about cameras and scanning systems and drones here - it means we are talking about a political solution that allows for regulatory alignment in a way that prevents the need for border infrastructure,\u0027 he said.\u0027We are simply asking that that commitment be followed through on.\u0027Mr Coveney said: \u0027I\u0027m not flexible when it comes to border infrastructure, I never have been.\u0027 Tanaiste Mr Coveney said: \u0027To be honest we don\u0027t take our lead from Boris Johnson in relation to Brexit, we take our lead from the Prime Minister.\u0027She has signed up to very clear commitments, she has written to Donald Tusk (European Council President) confirming those commitments and I believe her by the way, I believe she made those commitments in good faith and I believe she wants to follow through on them.\u0027He said Brexit negotiations would face a \u0027difficult summer\u0027 if the UK Government failed to honour its commitment to agreeing a \u0027backstop\u0027 in the withdrawal treaty.The backstop would mean regulations between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic would continue to align post-Brexit, even if a broader trading deal between the UK and EU failed to materialise.This concept has alarmed unionists, who believe it would end up creating trading barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, undermining the constitutional integrity of the kingdom.Democratic Unionist MP Sammy Wilson, one of Mr Coveney\u0027s most vocal critics, branded him \u0027belligerent, interfering and Brit bashing\u0027 and accused him of trying to break up the UK.The UK cabinet is currently ided on the issue, with detractors of the partnership concept instead advocating new technology and trusted trader schemes to enable smooth trade with the EU.Mr Johnson has been very critical of the idea of a partnership or shared customs territory, insisting it would prevent the UK taking back control of its trading policies.   What are the options on the table for a customs deal with the EU? With time ticking away on the Brexit negotiations, the Cabinet is still at daggers drawn on the shape for future trade relations with the EU.The government has set out two potential options for a customs system after the UK leaves the bloc.But despite a series of tense showdowns at Theresa May\u0027s Brexit \u0027War Cabinet\u0027 ministers continue to be deadlocked over what to do.Meanwhile, Brussels has dismissed both the ideas - and warned that negotiations could stall altogether unless there is progress by a key summit next month.                  Despite a series of tense showdowns at Theresa May\u0027s \u0027War Cabinet\u0027 (pictured in February) ministers continue to be deadlocked over what to doOPTION 1 - CUSTOMS PARTNERSHIP Under the so-called \u0027hybrid model\u0027, the UK would collect EU import tariffs on behalf of Brussels.Britain would be responsible for tracking the origin and final destination of goods coming into the country from outside the EU. The government would also have to ensure all products meet the bloc\u0027s standards.Firms selling directly into the UK market would pay the tariff levels set by Brussels - but would then get a rebate if Britain\u0027s tariffs are lower. Supporters of the hybrid plan in Cabinet - including Theresa May, Philip Hammond and Greg Clark - say keeping duties aligned up front would avoid the need for physical customs borders between the UK and EU.As a result it could solve the thorny issue over creating a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.Mrs May has been advised by the chief whip that the hybrid option could be the only way of securing a majority in parliament for a Brexit deal. But Brexiteers regard the proposal as unworkable and cumbersome - and they were joined by Sajid Javid and Gavin Williamson in criticising it at a tense \u0027War Cabinet\u0027 meeting last week.There are fears the experimental system will either collapse and cause chaos, or prevent the UK from being able to negotiate free trade deals around the world after Brexit.Mrs May has instructed official to go away and revise the ideas. Eurosceptics are braced for her to bring back the plan with only \u0027cosmetic\u0027 changes, and try to \u0027peel off\u0027 Mr Javid and Mr Williamson from the core group of Brexiteers.They are also ready for Mrs May to attempt to bypass the \u0027War Cabinet\u0027 altogether and put the issue before the whole Cabinet - where she has more allies. OPTION 2 - MAXIMUM FACILITATIONThe \u0027Max Fac\u0027 option accepts that there will be greater friction at Britain\u0027s borders with the EU. But it would aim to minimise the issues using technology and mutual recognition.Goods could be electronically tracked and pre-cleared by tax authorities on each side.Shipping firms could also be given \u0027trusted trader\u0027 status so they can move goods freely, and only pay tariffs when they are delivered to the destination country.Companies would also be trusted to ensure they were meeting the relevant UK and EU standards on products.Senior ministers such as Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and Liam Fox believe this is the only workable option. But Remain minded Tories such as Mr Clark insist it will harm trade and cost jobs in the UK.They also warn that it will require more physical infrastructure on the Irish border - potentially breaching the Good Friday Agreement. It is far from clear whether the government would be able to force anything through parliament that implied a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.  The EU has dismissed the idea that \u0027Max Fac\u0027 could prevent checks on the Irish border as \u0027magical thinking\u0027. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/13/13/16F473B8000005DC-5723437-image-a-1_1526214910734.jpg","title":"Religious believers told wear crucifixes","story":"    It comes five years after British Airways employee Nadia Eweida (pictured) won her case against the airline when she was told to hide her cross while at work          A nurse, Shirley Chaplin (pictured), did not win a similar challenge, however.

Pompeo said that Trump and Kim Jong-un would meet in Singapore on June 12 to \u0027see if there is sufficient overlap so that we can achieve the ultimate objective for the American people\u0027 of denuclearization of the Korean PeninsulaThe nation\u0027s top diplomat met with Kim on two occasions over the course of the month, first as CIA director and more recently in his capacity as secretary of state, providing him with greater insight into the 33-year-old head of the hermit nation than any other American, aside from basketball player Dennis Rodman.Pompeo says it is his belief that Kim, who took over from his father in 2011, \u0027understands\u0027 that in order to strike a deal with the U.S. \u0027this is going to have to be different and big and special, and something that has never been undertaken before.\u0027If we are going to get to this historic outcome, both sides have to be prepared to take a truly measures to achieve it,\u0027 he said.As the secretary of state, Pompeo said it\u0027s his job to lay the groundwork for a thawing of tensions.\u0027I think we now understand that there is the potential that there are shared objectives,\u0027 he said.As for his own talks with Kim, Pompeo said, \u0027The conversations are professional...He knows his brief, he knows what he is trying to achieve for the North Korean people. He is able to deal with complexity when the conversation requires it. \u0027He does follow the Western press. He will probably watch the show at some point,\u0027 Pompeo told Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace. \u0027He\u0027s paying attention to things the world is saying. He too is preparing for June 12th. He and his team, we’ll be working with them to put our two leaders in a position where it\u0027s just possible we might pull off an historic undertaking.\u0027          The nation\u0027s top diplomat met with Kim on two occasions over the course of the month. He said Kim \u0027understands\u0027 that in order to strike a deal with the U.S. \u0027this is going to have to be different and big and special, and something that has never been undertaken before\u0027Any deal with North Korea will only be possible if the foreign government that has an economy crashing under the weight of international sanctions feels its financially worth it.Pompeo on Friday said Pyongyang could look forward to a \u0027future brimming with peace and prosperity\u0027 if it gives up its pursuit of nuclear weapons.The lifting of sanctions would allow American companies to enter into contracts with North Korea to rebuild the county\u0027s national infrastructure. Once it\u0027s off the blacklist, Pyongyang could also be eligible for international aid.Sen. Lindsey Graham on CBS on Sunday said, \u0027If you could really get North Korea to give up their nuclear program than I think there\u0027d be a lot of support in Congress to give North Korea a better life. \u0027Provide aid, relieve sanctions with one condition: that you give up your nuclear weapons program in a verifiable way. When it comes to North Korea, I think there’d be a lot of congressional support,\u0027 he said.Bolton on CNN\u0027s \u0027State of the Union\u0027 slapped down the idea of aid to North Korea, however. \u0027I wouldn\u0027t look for economic aid from us,\u0027 he asserted. \u0027I think what the prospect for North Korea is to become a normal nation, to behave and interact with the rest of the world the way South Korea does.\u0027Pompeo told Fox that he was talking about private-sector investments when he made the remark. \u0027Not the U.S. taxpayer, private-sector Americans helping build the energy grid,\u0027 he said. \u0027They need enormous amounts of electricity in North Korea, to work with them to develop infrastructure. All the things that the North Korean people need, the capacity for American agriculture to support North Korea so they can eat meat and have healthy lives.\u0027Even if Trump and Kim agree on the contours of a deal during their Singapore summit, it would most likely need the support of Congress. Former President Barack Obama bypassed lawmakers in 2015 when his administration entered into a nuclear agreement with Tehran to the fury of Republicans who said that only Congress has the authority to approve treaty documents.Bolton on Sunday indicated that the Republican administration was considering proceeding the same way now that Trump is the one in office. \u0027Well it’s entirely possible we’d proceed that way, we’re still thinking about the different alternatives, I wouldn’t want to foreclose the president’s options,\u0027 he said of congressional approval. He admitted in the next breath though that \u0027it’s been one of the criticisms of the Iran nuclear deal to be sure...that a deal of that level of consequence was not given to the Senate as many people think the Constitution provided.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/13/17/4C2B36EF00000578-0-image-a-11_1526230225534.jpg","title":"Adorable puppies litter 15 reunite mother Poppy birthday party","story":"    Poppy\u0027s puppies play together in Galashiels, ScotlandAdorable puppies have been reunited with their mum one year after fifteen of them were born in one litter.Irish Setter Poppy was surrounded by her puppies this weekend after her owner Lisa Wardle managed to set up a reunion with 11 of them.The tiny dogs spent their first birthday with their mother when Lisa, 40, planned a party.The record for the most puppies for a Setter to give birth to is 16.Mother-of-three Lisa, from Galashiels, in the Scottish Borders, said: \u0027We didn\u0027t intend to keep any but we ended up with two.\u0027We kept Patch, the only one with a white flash on his head, and another boy called Negan - who is named after the Walking Dead character.\u0027Our daughter Abi took a girl pup called Letty.\u0027It didn\u0027t work out quite how we planned but I wouldn\u0027t be without them - I would have kept all 15 if I had been allowed.\u0027The owners of Patch, Negan, Letty, Forest, Bracken, Cesar, Cooper, Kerry, Poppy Jn, Effie, Cody, Rosa, Rogan, Mia and Rusy have kept in touch via social media.Lisa set up Poppy\u0027s famous 15 Redheads - a group on Facebook - so the owners of the tiny dogs can stay in touch as they grow.

Unlike the British Museum’s Great Court or Tate Modern’s Switch House, the illustrious Piccadilly pile in central London celebrates its 250th birthday with less of a flashy architectural statement than a series of discrete acts of corrective surgery – which, together, promise to transform the entire institution.“I’m hoping this might take us from one star in the Michelin guide to two or three,” says Charles Saumarez Smith, the RA’s chief executive. “We’ve never really been a destination for cultural tourists before, as there hasn’t been much to see between the big shows.”Ten years in the making, the anniversary project has seen the RA’s historic home of Burlington House linked to its rear neighbour, 6 Burlington Gardens, for the first time. Visitors will be able to walk from Piccadilly to Mayfair, via an atmospheric subterranean vault and an enticing glimpse of the RA Schools’ art studios, to a new suite of galleries, a lecture theatre, cafes and shops.What Chipperfield describes as his “diagnostic, punctual interventions” range from simply stripping back and whitewashing some spaces, to inserting a new bridge between the buildings that punches through one of the school’s studio walls, as if it had been ramraided by a concrete lorry. Before conservationists cry heresy, it is a fitting disruption to the workmanlike studios, themselves housed in a lean-to shed of exposed steel beams and rivets.One of the happiest consequences of the need to link the two buildings is that the messy, energetic life of the RA Schools, the free postgraduate art school, which has always been hidden away beneath the floorboards of the genteel galleries, is now present.From Burlington House, visitors are first taken below stairs into a tall, brick-vaulted corridor, elegantly scrubbed into a ghostly grey pallor and lined with ghoulish casts of flayed corpses, historically used for anatomical drawing.From here, you cross the schools’ corridor, full of more casts and curios, into a former studio now used for changing displays of student work, before heading through Chipperfield’s momentous concrete portal and up into Burlington Gardens beyond.It is an illuminating journey through the bowels of the building that might shift people’s perceptions of the RA, from an ossuary of Academicians to a vital place where contemporary art is being made.Such a brazen move was not straightforward in the byzantine world of this privately funded academy, run by its opinionated artist members. “Knocking a hole through a brick wall is easy,” says Chipperfield, who was elected to the RA in 2007. “Negotiating with an institution like this is very complex. It was a lengthy process of territorial land-swapping between the different tribes.”The politicking was worth it. Once across the bridge, you discover Burlington Gardens has been transformed. Built as the Italianate headquarters of the University of London in 1870, the building was acquired by the RA in 2001 and has been used occasionally for exhibitions, but never much loved. The enormously grand staircase and ceremonial corridors have always outbalanced the rather perfunctory rooms, ided up as offices over the years. There had been previous attempts to unite the two buildings, but both had run aground: the first, by Michael and Patty Hopkins in 2001, was overblown the second, by Colin St John Wilson in 2007, was too subtle.Chipperfield’s approach feels just right: like his celebrated work on the Neues Museum in Berlin, it strikes the balance between deference and forcefulness, knowing when to be bold and when to stay quiet.Former labs and offices have been opened up, their raw stone floors revealed, roof lights reinstated and a new floor inserted in a former void to create a continuous run of three galleries, where Tacita Dean’s powerful opening show on landscape sets the tone.The west wing has been turned into a free gallery for the permanent collection, where a 1506 copy of The Last Supper (a startling record of Leonardo’s now-faded masterpiece) hangs alongside works by Michelangelo, Gainsborough and Constable in a potted history of the RA.Next door, the conservation architect Julian Harrap has been allowed to let rip in the Senate Rooms, returning them to their polychromatic glory as the theatrical setting for a bar. It doubles up as the ripe foyer for a dedicated architecture space, formerly relegated to a dingy corridor on the way to the cafe.Finally, the masterful highlight is the new lecture theatre, excavated out of a double-height volume in the east wing. A modern interpretation of a horseshoe operating theatre, of the kind where gruesome dissections would have taken place, it is surrounded by tall windows on all sides, allowing light to be shed on the RA’s lively programme of discussions and debates – a rare delight compared with most black-box auditoria.When the building opens next week, it seems apt that the first specimen on the operating table will be Chipperfield himself, whose surgical interventions have given this unwieldy place a new lease of life.

It is a startling image, one that depicts Victorian London as a place of mud, corruption and disease.Prehistoric concerns and scientific interests are not normally connected with this author, who is known best for his depictions of social injustice, eccentric characters and occasional bouts of sentimentality. Indeed, Dickens is generally thought today to have been suspicious of science.But experts believe this reputation in undeserved, and argue that Dickens used scientific imagery throughout his writing. He also believed passionately in the use of science to improve child health, sanitation and human understanding. These themes will be outlined in an exhibition, Charles Dickens: Man of Science, opening this month at the Charles Dickens Museum, at his former home on Doughty Street in London.“For 150 years, it has been thought that Dickens was uninterested in or actually hostile to science,” said Frankie Kubicki, a curator at the museum. “That is a misunderstanding, and a travesty. He was one of the most influential scientific communicators of the Victorian age.”Among the exhibits in the forthcoming exhibition will be the travelling bag that Dickens took on foreign trips. These included a visit to Vesuvius from which he returned “burnt from head to foot”, he later wrote. Also on show will be facsimile notes of Michael Faraday’s public lectures at the Royal Institution, which Dickens subsequently edited and published in his weekly magazine Household Words. His aim with the magazine was to provide a blend of fiction, social campaigning and the science – as described by Faraday in his lectures – behind such everyday matters as making tea, fermenting beer and burning candles.The exhibition will also include a recreation of Pepper’s Ghost, a display of optical illusions created by chemist John Pepper. This used angled glass to create transparent ghostly figures, including some from Dickens’s novella The Haunted Man. By showing how easy it was to deceive the senses, Dickens and Pepper wanted to help reveal the fraudulent claims of spiritualists, who used this kind of equipment at seances at the time.For his part, Dickens was much admired by several scientists, and his associates included the palaeontologist Richard Owen, the mathematician Ada Lovelace (who on her deathbed asked Dickens to read to her from Dombey and Son) and Florence Nightingale, who prescribed his novels to wounded soldiers as a form of “treatment-by-reading”.However, the most intriguing display at the exhibition will be that of a small wax figure of Joe, the “fat boy” from The Pickwick Papers. These wax figures were the 19th-century equivalent of the models of the heroes and villains from Star Wars or Harry Potter films – though they have since earned a special scientific significance that his latter-day equivalents lack, according to the exhibition’s curators. Scientists writing in the American Journal of Medicine in 1956 said the “fat boy” character – who is constantly hungry and prone to falling asleep at every opportunity – defines a particular medical syndrome. Severely overweight iniduals can be prone to breathlessness and daytime sleepiness, and the condition has since been given the name Pickwickian Syndrome.Perhaps the most telling example of Dickens’ scientific writing and his interest in social concerns is found in The Uncommercial Traveller, a collection of sketches and reminiscences. In one of these, the author speculates about the inferences scientists make about extinct creatures from the remains they have left behind – and what future generations would deduce about his society. In particular, he speculated whether or not they would be able to use ancient remains to sense “the existence of the polished state of society that bore with the public savagery of neglected children in the streets and never used its power to seize and save them”.The remark underlines Dickens’s belief that, above all, science should serve society, and explains his commitment to the use of medical knowledge to improve lives. For example, the depictions of sick and dying children in his novels helped change attitudes to childhood disease, and led to his campaigning for the building of the world’s first children’s hospital – a few blocks away from his Doughty Street home – at Great Ormond Street.Charles Dickens: Man of Science runs 24 May to 11 November at London’s Charles Dickens Museum"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23bc41799069b529f1684cb5140fe0c59e702bdb/613_778_3691_2214/master/3691.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e11f59b74d589c392b253365300713f8","title":"neighborhood mario vargas llosa digested read","story":"‘Marisa, Chabela and Quique celebrated the end of the bombing with another juddering three-way orgasm’“Please indulge an elderly Nobel laureate,” begged Mario. “Let me start this novel with a cliched lesbian sex scene.”“Oh look,” cried Marisa. “Both our husbands are away and you’ve just missed the curfew. You’d better stay the night in my bed, Chabela.”“Gosh,” replied Chabela. “How time flies! You’re right. I will phone Luciano to let him know I’m staying. Are you sure Quique won’t mind?”Marisa woke up during the night. But was she actually awake – or just dreaming? Her best friend’s hand was pressing against her wetness. It felt so wrong, yet it felt so right. Within seconds they were entwined, their tongues probing one another hungrily. Standing in his office, Enrique knew that Rolando Garro, the tabloid journalist from Exposed!, was trouble the moment he saw this pallid man with rat-like features. “I’ll get straight to the point,” said Garro. “I’ve got some photos of you participating in an orgy with some whores. Either you give me $100K to bankroll Exposed! or I publish the pictures.”“Get out,” yelled Enrique, known as Quique to his wife and friends. “I could tell immediately by your pallor and rat-like features that you were trouble.”In Miami, Marisa and Chabela were now enjoying a three-day break away from their husbands. It felt so wrong, yet it felt so right. At least it did to Mario, who could barely breathe with excitement as the two women pleasured one another for several pages. Enrique was in tears. The photos had been published and he was now the laughing stock of all Peru. “What shall I do?” he begged. “My business will be ruined and Marisa will never make love to me again.”“Try not to worry,” Luciano said evenly. “We just have to make sure this is an end to the matter. And Marisa will be all over you again within minutes.”“Please forgive me, Marisa,” Quique wept. “I can never forgive you,” she replied, taking his stiff cock in her hands and guiding it into her mouth.Back in the Exposed! offices, senior reporter Shorty – so named because she wasn’t very tall – was in a state of shock. Rolando, her boss, had been found brutally murdered in one of the poorest areas of Lima. She quickly packed up her things and went into hiding. Rolando’s death had all the hallmarks of an assassination by the Doctor, the head of the secret police set up by President Alberto Fujimori.“Everyone’s going to think it was me that killed the pallid reporter with rat-like features,” Quique sobbed, unable to stop himself from using the same descriptions over and over again. “Please try to think and write a little more clearly,” Luciano advised. “I’m doing my best,” Mario insisted huffily.Just as they were speaking, the secret police arrested Enrique and took him to prison where he was forced to masturbate several burly inmates. Enrique couldn’t believe what was happening to him. Nor, quite frankly, could the reader. Or that the book was so badly written. “It’s OK,” said a guard, on the third morning. “You can go. You’re innocent.”Marisa and Chabela were once more to be found in bed together. “I do wish you would stop making love to Quique,” said Chabela, her arm draped across Marisa’s breasts. “Then how would you feel if we invited him to join us in a threesome?” said Marisa.“Couldn’t you ask me?” Mario begged eagerly. “I’d be up for it.”“No,” Marisa and Chabela replied firmly, before pleasuring themselves once more. “This is amazing,” said Quique, as all three of them came simultaneously. “I can’t believe my luck. Should we tell Luciano?Shorty found herself bundled into the back of a car and taken to the Doctor’s secret location. “We killed Rolando,” said the Doctor, “because he published the photos of Enrique without permission. But it’s all OK because we’ve pinned the blame on an old poet with dementia. Here’s the deal. You’re going to be the new editor and you will only publish the stories I tell you to.”Hot off the presses! Three months later, Exposed! ran a special edition revealing that the Doctor and Fujimori had killed Rolando and that the Peruvian state was corrupt.“Isn’t it great how Fujimori and the Doctor are in prison and that Shining Path has stopped blowing things up?” agreed Marisa, Chabela and Quique as they celebrated their three-year shagfest with yet another juddering orgasm. “Do you think our threesome might be an allegory for something?”“Who cares as long as Luciano doesn’t find out?” said Chabela.“Can I come to Miami with you next time?” asked Luciano.“If you must.”“Oh goody,” cried Mario. “Does this mean I can join in now, too?”Digested read, digested: Don’t Lima this way"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff729f7fa869f71d25a3776cb557f88793bbd3f2/170_350_5574_3344/master/5574.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ed261a4062812eb1dc9ad2dbeaa31df","title":"from coal to clean uk does not need to turn to gas says wwf","story":"Report suggests renewables, battery storage and flexible technologies can replace coal plantsThe UK has no need to build new large gas-fired power stations to replace the coal plants that the government has pledged to switch off by 2025, the World Wide Fund for Nature has argued.The gap can instead be filled by renewables, battery storage and flexible technologies, allowing the UK to go from “coal to clean” and skip new gas completely, according to a report by the environmental group.The analysis challenges the orthodoxy that phasing out coal will require large new gas plants.Amber Rudd, when energy secretary in 2015, said: “In the next 10 years, it’s imperative that we get new gas-fired power stations built.”Big energy firms including Drax and Germany’s RWE want to build large-scale gas plants on the sites of former power stations in Yorkshire and Essex, respectively.Almost half of the gas industry’s hopes for new power stations for Europe are slated for the UK but developers have failed to win subsidy contracts through the main route to market, the government’s capacity market.The government is planning to launch a review of the scheme later this year, which renewables proponents fear could tilt the balance.Gareth Redmond-King, the WWF’s head of climate and energy, urged ministers to ensure the review does not open the door to gas.He said: “If we don’t need large-scale gas, if it can’t compete with renewables and there’s no need for it, why would you need a route to market for it?“It is essential the government does not substitute one dirty power source for another.”The last large gas plant to be built in the UK was in Carrington in 2016 – the first since 2012.Using official government forecasts, the WWF found that the growth in electricity produced by wind, solar and other renewables would more than replace the lost power from old coal plants.The government has allocated a £557m pot of funding for more renewables subsidies between now and 2025. That should bring forward the remainder of the new capacity needed as coal drops off the grid.WWF also called on the government to reconsider support for solar power and onshore windfarms, both of which have had subsidies axed. He added that he was encouraged by recent comments from the energy minister, Claire Perry, who has said the government is working “really hard” to allow onshore windfarms to be built with public subsidies in Scotland and Wales but not England.A spokesperson for Drax said: “A reliable power system depends on a range of generation technologies to provide crucial system support services.”Tom Glover, the UK country chair for RWE, said: “The exact amount of gas capacity required is extremely uncertain but the vast majority of forecasts anticipate a significantly higher requirement than suggested in this report.”A BEIS spokesperson said:“We are one of the first countries to commit to end unabated coal power and are leading the world in encouraging other countries to make the same commitment. With clean growth a key pillar of our modern industrial strategy, we are growing our economy while cutting emissions.“With up to £557m of investment in new clean energy projects we have a erse energy mix that is secure, affordable and providing more clean power than ever before.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60dfafebcf14d0639d9a5e6ed5c19f7a1b5b8233/0_130_3888_2333/master/3888.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4eca5dea104f74fbd57ffa9a3ec7b11e","title":"choking women me too breath play","story":"Choking seems to be in fashion, and I don’t mean the type where you need the Heimlich maneuverChoking seems to be in fashion, and I don’t mean the type where you need the Heimlich maneuver. Since the #MeToo movement, we’re learning just how many men seem to see choking women as a legitimate form of “sex play,” as it is often euphemistically referred to in porn. Eric Schneiderman, New York State’s Attorney General, who announced he was pursuing a lawsuit against Harvey Weinstein for what he described as “despicable” behavior, was just forced to resign after four women accused him of choking them, as well as other types of physical assault. Schneiderman disputed the allegations, claiming that he had only consensual sexual relations.As more and more stories surface, thanks to the #MeToo movement, women are trying to make sense of why so many men are sexually abusive and get aroused by abusive acts such as choking. For feminists who research porn, this is no surprise. The domestication of the internet and the introduction of the smart phone made porn affordable, anonymous, and accessible, the main drivers of demand. Pornhub, the most traveled porn site in the world, boasts in its annual “Year in Review” that it had approximately 28.5 billion visitors in 2017, which translates into about 81 million per day. Pornhub claims that “a total of 3,732 Petabytes of data was streamed in 2017, which makes for 7,101 GB per minute and 118 GB per second.” To put this in perspective, Pornhub claims that this “is enough data to fill the storage of all of the world’s iPhones currently in use.” When you click on Pornhub, you’ll find at the top a tab marked “Categories.” The user has over 80 of these to choose from, some of the most popular being MILF, Teen, Stepmom, and Step Sister. What you won’t see is a category called “choking,” because this form of sexual violence is one of the most common acts across all categories. Women are choked with anything from a penis to a fist to the point of gagging, and in some cases almost passing out. The victim obviously can’t speak during these acts because she is choking, so it is typically not until the end of the scene that she says, often in a hoarse voice, how much she “loved it.” Meanwhile, she looks exhausted, upset, and—in some cases—distraught. In mainstream media targeted to women, choking, or “breath play,” as it is often referred to, is rebranded as edgy, hot sex that somehow gives the woman power. Women’s Health Magazine recently promoted the act, suggesting it can “be an exhilarating experience for some people.” While the article does admit it could lead to death, it nonetheless provides some handy tips for those women squeamish at the thought of this “hot” sex. (Learning to relax is one recommendation!) The authors quote a sex therapist who manages to flip the power dynamics by arguing that the “turn on” is that he is prepared to do anything to have you, and the result is that “you feel you have an erotic power over him.” Not all batterers got the idea of choking a woman from porn, but over 40 years of research shows a connection between viewing porn and violence against women. A recent meta-analysis of 22 studies between 1978 and 2014 from seven different countries concluded that pornography consumption is associated with an increased likelihood of committing acts of verbal or physical sexual aggression, regardless of age. It is ironic that as women are speaking out loud and clear, the porn industry, together with mainstream pop culture, is promoting choking. In so many ways, choking women is a perfect metaphor for how women have been silenced. Women cannot speak the truth of their lives as long as men have their hands round our necks, or their penises down our throats. As women continue to build this movement, the research and the testimonies of women hurt by porn need to be front and center. A cultural context for understanding why men sexually abuse women, at the levels they do, ironically provides us with hope, because what has been socially constructed can always be socially deconstructed.

It was one of the great privileges of my life to know Tessa Jowell well, and one I shared with so many. At the dinner table, at the tea party to celebrate her introduction to the House of Lords, at book launches, at Labour conferences, she was always surrounded by friends, making new ones, and bringing together previously unconnected members of her prodigious circle of affection and affinity.When Hashi Mohamed, the barrister and broadcaster, and I met at a conference in Warwick last November, our very first instinct was to take a selfie and send it to our mutual friend Tessa. She replied delightedly, promising “to plot and plan” with us when she returned from her next round of cancer treatment in Cologne. Even afflicted by a brain tumour, glioblastoma multiforme, she always looked to the future, to the next, to the possible.Grief breeds aphasia: we cling to platitudes so we can keep talking at all. But we owe it to Tessa to speak of her with precision as well as love to honour the grit and detail of her achievements as much as the luminous decency that underpinned them.I first encountered her as a fellow member of the Millennium Commission, a lottery-distributing fund, and witnessed, in her conduct as chair, the steely pragmatism that coursed through her impeccably amiable manner. She understood the necessity of getting the job done – no small task when the job in question was selling the much-derided Dome. At the time, the task seemed next to impossible. Today, the O2 is one of the most successful entertainment complexes in the country.For Tessa, progress was never an abstraction to be pursued according to an ideological rule-book. As she observed in her speech to mark the 10th anniversary of the 77 attacks: “The danger comes from any belief system which is closed, which provides to its believer the single answer to everything, whose adherents can’t stand outside their system to ask themselves the question, ‘Is what I am doing in the cause I believe in actually right?’”Fastidious in manners, she was resolutely tough in her practicality. In this spirit of dedication, she reminded me of Margaret Atwood’s Nell in the short story Moral Disorder: “She would turn into a woman others came to for advice. She would be called in emergencies. She would roll up her sleeves and dispense with sentimentality …”In the implementation of public health policy, the creation of Sure Start, the establishment of Ofcom, or the coordination of the government’s support for those bereaved or harmed by the 77 bombings, she always grasped that good intentions, though essential, were not enough that the better angels of our nature do not take flight without persistence, collaboration and robust leadership.Nowhere was this more apparent than in her ministerial stewardship of London’s campaign for the 2012 Olympics, of the fiendishly complex preparations and infrastructural work, and of the Games themselves. She was deeply affected by the cruel proximity of the announcement of the London bid’s success in 2005, and the terrorist attack upon the same city the very next day.That juxtaposition exemplified for her the fundamental dichotomy of human behaviour and the obstacles that confront those who believe in the common good and the pursuit of decency. If we shun despair – as we ought to – we must undertake a permanent struggle against entropy, indifference and bigotry. “The decency and civility which normally prevail,” she remarked, “are not a solid impermeable layer.”So, too, she embodied hope rather than naivety. When she phoned friends last year to tell them about her illness, she was full of both optimism and realism, determined to seek whatever treatment she could find, to deploy her voice and political skills to improve the lot of other cancer patients, and, above all, to relish her time with her adored family – not least the grandchild, Ottie, she had helped to deliver weeks before her diagnosis.The notion of cancer as a “battle” is both absurd and morally contemptible, implying, as it does, that the illness is a test of character or virtue. That said, Tessa did declare war upon cancer as a scourge upon humanity, with remarkable consequences. She and her daughter, Jess Mills, founded the organisation Adaptive Collaborative Treatments (ACT), dedicated to more flexible care, greater access to experimental trials and enhanced global cooperation.As she put it in her speech in the House of Lords in January: “For what would every cancer patient want? To know that the best, the latest science was being used – wherever in the world it was developed, whoever began it.” In the same speech – which inspired a standing ovation – she observed that “while doctors look at the big picture, we can all be part of the human-sized picture”.This was not only a statement of fact it was an injunction to action. No politician I have known better understood the relationship between the inidual and society, the connective tissue that binds them, and how remorselessly it must be nurtured.In the case of cancer treatment, we all face a straightforward choice. One of the world’s leading biomedical scientists told me last week that the disease as we presently understand it can be eradicated within 10 or 20 years – if there is the political will to fund the research and, more to the point, the radical new treatments that are already forthcoming. There is astonishing wealth in this country, waiting to be taxed to fund this and other forms of health and social care in our transforming society. The time is coming when we must ask: do we seriously value our property more than our fellow human beings?Such are the tough questions posed by mortality. One of Tessa’s favourite quotations was from Thornton Wilder’s The Bridge of San Luis Rey: “There is a land of the living and a land of the dead and the bridge is love, the only survival, the only meaning.” Now that she has made the crossing, let this be her message of consolation, and her challenge to the rest of us."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a2e097967263355b4c5306f4d3141eebd5132e0/69_58_2588_1553/master/2588.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73e73e216b37bb35eaeea7f32bb05392","title":"the guardian view on brexit and parliament another way is possible","story":"Under normal circumstances, a government with vital laws to pass in a short space of time would get a move\u0026nbspon.\u0026nbspBut not much about Brexit is normal. The clock is ticking, yet the bill to enable an orderly withdrawal next\u0026nbspMarch is marooned.Peers voted for amendments to soften the character of Brexit. Uncertain of how this will play out in the lower chamber, the government last week declined to send the bill straight there as would be usual practice. And it isn’t only the withdrawal bill in limbo. Bills on customs and trade are frozen in early stages of the process. Last year’s Queen’s speech promised bills on fisheries, farming and immigration, of which there is as yet no sign.In the autumn, parliament is supposed to vote on a motion to approve the terms of withdrawal negotiated by Theresa May and a declaration of intent covering the broad framework for post-Brexit trade. The withdrawal deal must also be enacted via an implementation bill, running the full gauntlet of primary legislation.MPs will struggle to get through this logjam in a way that permits due diligence on the most ambitious and dangerous undertaking by any British government since\u0026nbspthe second world war. If Mrs May tries to force Brexit through in this fashion she will be asking MPs for\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspblank political cheque to sign off on a future shrouded in a dense fog of uncertainty.What began as misfortune is evolving into a desperate tactic by the prime minister. By leaving everything to the last minute, she narrows the options, betting that parliament will have to acquiesce since the alternatives would risk political, economic and constitutional meltdown. In a newspaper article on Sunday, Mrs\u0026nbspMay asked for public trust on Brexit, but can’t or won’t explain how she means to break the current deadlock. This is not the way government business of the highest urgency should be conducted. But Mrs May feels trapped. She cannot get her cabinet to agree on technical aspects of Brexit nor even on the fundamental principles that would lead to technical solutions. And she doesn’t have a majority in parliament for the kind of Brexit – outside the customs union, outside the single market – that many of her backbench MPs and key ministers demand.These look like two problems – a split party and a hung parliament – but they are in fact one. Or,\u0026nbsprather,\u0026nbspviewed through a non-party lens, a single solution comes into view. There is an available parliamentary majority for a different Brexit, a much softer model that starts from the economically rational base of customs union and single market membership. The readiness of politicians from across party lines to support such a position will be underlined in a joint intervention on Monday by Nick Clegg, former Liberal Democrat leader, David\u0026nbspMiliband, former Labour foreign secretary, and Nicky Morgan, Tory chair of the Treasury select committee. None of them speaks for the whole of their respective parties, but they do express a view that would win the\u0026nbspsupport of a larger parliamentary caucus than the\u0026nbspone that Mrs May could whip behind a more hardline anti-EU prospectus.If the prime minister were to change course, the hardliners would denounce her for betraying pro-Brexit voters. They would be wrong in law and principle. Anything that ends full UK membership of the EU is a valid Brexit and partial detachment would be a more democratic expression of the close referendum result than total severance. The\u0026nbsp2016 vote does not prohibit a soft Brexit. The 2017 general election result demands one by virtue of parliamentary arithmetic alone. To deliver it, the prime minister would have to relinquish the support of the most fanatical Tory caucus, but she could make up the numbers with support from opposition MPs.There are enough who would see it as their patriotic duty to set aside tribal allegiance and help the prime minister rescue the country from its current destructive trajectory. The question is whether Mrs May has the courage and imagination to broker such a deal. The evidence of her past behaviour suggests not, yet the logic of the current Brexit impasse leaves no better option."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9ad9b3a7c671fbdf58b2419e62b0d2fd426c9dc/2_0_3031_1819/master/3031.jpg?w=685\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4eb7a17bcaa18ba21dbfaa3a179ab4d7 1370w","title":"the divisive issue of grammar schools returns","story":"The government’s decision to expand the provision of grammar schools (Report, 11 May) is consistent with the underlying trend in Britain’s society since the 1970s. British education is not intended to prepare children for life: it is structured to exclude those who don’t really understand what is required of them. The intention is not to reduce inequality, but to reward the existence of inequality. Our economy continues to discard iniduals and groups that fail to generate a sustainable personal income. Benefit payments are being withdrawn to encourage people to work more effectively or, alternatively, to reduce their standard of living to match their work contribution.Two thousand years ago, to quell discontent, the Roman emperor, August, decreed that the recipients of the free monthly dole of grain would increase to one fifth of the population. The Tories are currently implementing cuts in free grain, free education and free healthcare. Brexit will mean a cut in benefits. The conclusion will not be pretty.Martin LondonHenllan, Denbighshire\u0026nbsp• In one sense the proposed expansion of grammar school places represents a failure of nerve. If Damian Hinds really believes in the case he’s presenting (Report, 11 May), he and his government would be seeking to reverse the grammar school ban in the Commons but they know that would be defeated.In a second sense it’s a massive, if misguided, assertion of nerve: how has he the nerve to find extra millions for selective education at a time of a national schools funding crisis.Professor Colin RichardsSpark Bridge, Cumbria• So the government is giving money to expand grammar schools for the benefit of “disadvantaged pupils”. These pupils are 11 years old. This is the government that has spent years pulling the rug out from under these same children – from the closure of Sure Start to the welfare changes – with the consequent rise in the numbers of children living in poverty. No child in wealthy Britain should be “disadvantaged” at 11 years old and addressing that from birth is surely the job of government.Alison PierceBuxted, East Sussex• Keen to highlight that his new policy “provides access to world-class education”, Damian Hinds glosses over the UK’s geography, the many counties with no such provision, the vast majority of schools conveniently concentrated in the most affluent areas of the UK. Only those who indulge in Tory spin would agree this benefits families of all backgrounds and locations. What is apparent is that this government is not living up to Hinds’ promise of “helping all schools grow”. Children in mainstream primary and secondary education have seen £2.8bn of cuts since 2015, with further cuts planned by 2020 – cuts that will have a profound effect on an entire generation. There is nothing world class about that.Bridget JamesSwaffham, NorfolkNo doubt the parties reckon the Church of England and the Roman Catholic church are too powerful to be tangled with. This unlikely victory for cohesion and inclusiveness, following a sustained and widely supported campaign led by Humanists UK, may bring politicians at last to realise that the churches’ historic control of one-third of our schools is not unchallengeable after all. The case against faith schools has been made time and again – they are religiously, socially and ethnically isive, owe their marginally better academic results solely to their selective admissions practices, and too often deny pupils a balanced education in sensitive areas. Yet almost every penny they spend is provided by the public.All the arguments are there for the courageous party that dares to call the churches’ bluff – as the bluff has now been called of a notably deceptive and self-interested campaign by the Catholic Education Service.David PollockLondon• Join the debate – email • Read more  letters – click here to visit guletters"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d06196d1c48096603ef60c2cd64fa5d942839330/0_0_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b71aa569cde407f19426af8fe74ec060","title":"leave no trace review debra granik","story":"Debra Granik’s complex study of an army vet and his daughter living in a vast public park is the film Captain Fantastic should have beenDebra Granik is the exceptional film-maker who directed Winter’s Bone in 2010, launching the career of Jennifer Lawrence, and now she returns with this deeply intelligent, complex, finely tuned and observed movie, adapted by Granik and her screenwriting partner, Anne Rosellini, from the novel My Abandonment by Peter Rock. Their new title alludes the rules of respect and care for the environment promoted by ecological campaigners: to minimise human impact on nature.Weirdly, this film initially reminded me of a fatuous and naive (and bafflingly overpraised) film called Captain Fantastic, which features Viggo Mortensen as a charismatic, disciplinarian dad who has taken his children to live with him in the wilderness. Leave No Trace is everything that that movie should have been: careful, realistic, with a sense of what is possible and what is at stake for those people who really do attempt to turn their backs on conventional living and also reject the stigma of homelessness — but what is also at stake for their children who have had no choice in the matter.Ben Foster and Thomasin McKenzie play Will and Tom, a grizzled army veteran and his 13-year-old daughter. The question of Tom’s mother is not addressed. Will and Tom are living a kind of radical Thoreau-guerrilla existence in a huge public park in Portland, Oregon. They have built a secret camp with tarps and rudimentary cooking implements, making their own fires. They share a tent. They read books. They have military-style drills for staying undercover. Periodically, they amble out of the park and into the city, where Will can pick up his prescription for ovoid painkillers at the vets hospital, which he can discreetly sell for cash on the black market to buy food — and then they return to the jungle. It seems like a perfect, even Edenic setup. But then Tom carelessly allows herself to be spotted by a hiker and things take a wrong turn.The personae of Will and Tom are strikingly restrained, both in their conception and performance: there is an attractive humility and restraint at work, a quietism. No scenery-chewing, no fireworks, no obvious scary-Colonel-Kurtz stuff from Will or obvious teen rebellion histrionics from Tom. Neither appears concerned with what the future holds for them, nor when Tom should really be getting a tent of her own – let alone meet other people her own age.When they are picked up by the authorities, they are subject to very similar psychiatric assessments, in which they have to respond true or false to questions about whether they have dark thoughts, etc. In some ways, these tests are callous, soulless – precisely the kind of bureaucratic intrusion that Will has passionately rejected on his own behalf and that of his daughter. And yet it is clear that this is the first time either of them have considered these questions – the first time they have really thought about themselves. Perhaps not having to think about yourself, not having to shoulder the burden of relentless neurotic self-examination, is part of what their way of life is about.Interestingly, getting picked up and then escaping is also part of their way of life. They have clearly planned for what happens. They have to accept – or pretend to accept – the social services’ remedial plans for them before they can slip away once more. There is a great sequence in which they attend a church service, blandly complaisant, not making a fuss, not standing out, biding their time. Or rather it is Will who is biding his time Tom isn’t so sure. Each time away from the wild brings Tom into contact with a society that she rather likes. Poignantly, she loves the rabbit that a neighbouring farmer’s kid has, and there is a lovely scene where she attends a rabbit-training school. Later, she has the same connection with honeybees. A split is coming. But Granik manages this crisis with cool, unhammy clarity. The intimacy and love between Will and Tom is presented with real delicacy. It’s a movie that will live with me for a long time.

Mohamed Salah began an emphatic defeat of Brighton with a record 32nd goal of the league campaign and another Kop favourite, Andy Robertson, closed it with his first for the club. Anfield absorbed the exhibition in between.“The perfect finale to a very exciting, intense season,” said Jürgen Klopp. “We showed again the kind of football that we couldn’t in the last few games because the boys are human, not machines.”Salah’s contribution this season suggests otherwise. The Egypt international ended the afternoon with the Golden Boot, presented by Kenny Dalglish while his young daughter, Makka, enjoyed a kick-about, and as the most prolific goalscorer in a 38-game Premier League season, eclipsing Luis Suárez, Cristiano Ronaldo and Alan Shearer in the process.Salah has not been the only Liverpool player to consistently deliver when it mattered. Klopp’s team qualified for the Champions League for a second season running with an unbeaten home record. This sunny Sunday-afternoon stroll against Chris Hughton’s side was also the 14th occasion that Liverpool scored four or more goals in a game. Only once, in 1895-96, has that record been bettered.Klopp said of his leading goalscorer: “It’s fantastic what he has done. The last few weeks especially were difficult with every single day someone saying how brilliant you are and giving you an Oscar for this, an award for that, even getting out of the car without having an accident. This gives us a big boost. Imagine if the only chance to get into the Champions League was to win the Champions League final. That’s maybe not the best option to choose, but it’s exciting now.”Brighton, survival ensured and their own season a success, tried to deliver a contest but were outclassed to such an extent that their neat passing game was confined to their own penalty area. They had nowhere else to go. Liverpool laid siege to Matthew Ryan’s goal from the start with Klopp picking Dominic Solanke on top of his imperious front three and seeing his team take complete control. Only poor finishing, overelaboration and Kevin Friend’s aversion to giving penalties delayed the inevitable.The referee was well-placed when Shane Duffy handled a cross and felled Salah but waved away both appeals. When Sadio Mané then shot straight at Ryan having been played clean through by the impressive Solanke it could have been cue for apprehension among the home fans. But they appear immune to that these days. There is a belief in their team’s potency that the unerring accuracy of Salah has helped cement, and the first time he found space inside a crowded Brighton area another record fell at his feet.Salah broke the Premier League scoring record when Trent Alexander-Arnold drove through the Brighton midfield and found Solanke on the edge of the area. The striker turned the ball on to Salah, who needed one touch to create space for a low left-foot finish. It was his 44th goal in total this season. A hat-trick against Real Madrid on 26 May will be required to equal Ian Rush’s all-time Liverpool record.Dejan Lovren delivered the comfort of a two-goal lead with a towering header from Robertson’s inviting cross after Brighton cleared a corner but left the centre-half unmarked for the return ball. The cushion should have arrived earlier but Mané, having found himself through on goal once more, attempted to gift-wrap a second for Salah and enabled Ryan to intercept before Duffy blocked his second attempt on the goalline. Klopp went apoplectic in his technical area at Liverpool’s indulgence. It never seemed likely to cost them.Georginio Wijnaldum and Roberto Firmino wasted excellent chances before the break – several in the Brazilian’s case – but the scoreline offered a more accurate reflection of Liverpool’s dominance when Solanke struck his first league goal for the club. It was an excellent finish too, created by Salah, who took Firmino’s pass and evaded two challenges before releasing Solanke inside the area. The Chelsea graduate gave Ryan no chance with a powerful drive that flew in via the underside of the bar.To cap a perfect afternoon for Klopp’s team the final goal of the home season fell to the popular Robertson, perfectly placed to open his Liverpool account after Danny Ings’ cross deflected into his path. Adding to the manager’s satisfaction was the complete absence of fatigue in his players, something that had slowed their approach to the finishing line, having had a week to prepare for Brighton. A fortnight before Kiev looks ideal.“A few people have asked me whether it’s too long but no, it’s perfect,” said Klopp. “It’s like a little pre-season for us. The boys need a little bit of rest. We will give them two days now and then we will go to a camp. We will not train high intensity, we will do a little tactical stuff, a little fitness work, keep them in shape and then we have five days to prepare for the last game. We are all happy about that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af2b75f1cd45791219238507c4ce30f0226ea17d/0_117_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b4c757165478ec7b1e5cfaceab13fea","title":"newcastle united chelsea premier league match report","story":"Antonio Conte began the afternoon in highly animated form in the technical area and, for a while, became almost hysterical before his mood finally morphed into sulky acceptance.Long before the end Chelsea’s manager had become oddly static as he stood arms folded, expression disconsolate, on the touchline. Maybe they were saving themselves for the FA Cup final but Conte’s players never looked remotely like a side which kicked off harbouring outside hopes of a top-four place.Ultimately Liverpool’s demolition of Brighton ensured Chelsea were always destined to finish fifth but a performance dominated by Newcastle’s outstanding Jonjo Shelvey, Mo Diamé and Ayoze Pérez was hardly what their manager would have wanted on what seems almost certain to have been his final Premier League match in charge of London’s most politicised club.Rafael Benítez and Newcastle are no strangers to playing politics and his future here is far from certain but, as he continues vital contract negotiations with Mike Ashley, the owner, Benítez cannot fail to be swayed by the choruses of “stand up if you love Rafa” and “Rafa Benítez we want you to stay,” which echoed, evocatively, to the rafters.Newcastle ended by securing 10th place but started as if they were the side pursuing Champions League qualification and initially piled on so much pressure that Chelsea could barely escape their own half.As the decibel level heightened and the intensity of the home tempo turned ferocious Thibaut Courtois did well to repel both Shelvey’s vicious 22-yard half volley and a subsequent angle Diamé shot from the edge of the area.Chelsea were in near total disarray with the lesser spotted Ross Barkley – making a rare start – struggling to get anywhere near the ball in midfield. Part of that was down to the reality that, alongside Diamé, Shelvey was proving one of the game’s two most influential figures.As Newcastle’s playmaker revelled in making N’Golo Kanté look thoroughly ordinary he looked every inch an England international. The consensus is that Gareth Southgate has decided against including him in the England squad he is scheduled to name this week but, on Friday, Benítez indicated that Shelvey had not entirely abandoned hope of inclusion. Maybe, just maybe, Southgate has a big decision to make after all.Benítez will determine Dwight Gayle’s future in the next few weeks and it could well be away from Tyneside. If so, Newcastle’s lone striker signed off by giving his side a deserved lead.It originated with a Shelvey pass which picked out Matt Ritchie. Along with Shelvey, Diamé and Pérez, Ritchie was in splendid form pulling Chelsea all over the place and, once again, he confounded Conte’s defence courtesy of a left-footed cross from the right.All that remained was for Jacob Murphy to attempt to, somewhat audaciously, lob Courtois and the goalkeeper to dismissively palm the ball clear – but only as far as Gayle who proceeded to head into the empty net.By now Conte appeared in genuine peril of technical area implosion. In pointed contrast, Benítez seemed an oasis of calm, typically celebrating the goal by giving his glasses a polish before summoning Jamaal Lascelles over for a detailed tactical discussion.Shelvey’s desperation to play for Southgate was perhaps manifested in a glorious advance showcasing his clever, quick feet which should have ended in Newcastle’s second goal but instead highlighted the midfielder’s unfortunate knack of invariably shooting wildly off target.As Shelvey’s shot arced over the bar and he clutched his head in his hands, Conte’s mood darkened. His side had been so appalling that his only consolation was that a subsequently stellar save from Courtois to deny Gayle and a very near miss from Pérez dictated that the score remained 1-0 as Newcastle trooped off to a standing ovation at half-time.Before kick-off the Gallowgate End had unfurled a giant banner declaring: “Where there is unity, there is always victory.” It was intended as both a tribute to Benítez’s achievement in steering what remains an essentially Championship calibre squad to mid-table safety and a warning to Ashley not to risk disrupting harmony by alienating the Spaniard.If Chelsea and Conte are fast approaching a crossroads, Newcastle fans know the ongoing negotiations between Benítez and the board over a prospective extension of a contract which has only a year outstanding remain extremely delicate.Much as the manager genuinely loves his adopted club and city, trust in Ashley is elusive and it is not impossible that, without assurances relating to transfer market budget and infrastructure improvements this summer, Benítez could depart.Aiming to avert that doomsday scenario, the crowd chanted his name incessantly. During a short stint as a Europa League winning Chelsea manager Benítez, rather inexplicably, never felt an iota of such love and will doubtless have enjoyed issuing this latest reminder of his enduring coaching abilities.Not that Chelsea were quite out of it. Presumably adhering to Conte’s half time homily, they livened up in the second half, with Eden Hazard belatedly beginning to impose his talent on proceedings.Martin Dubravka had been outstanding for Newcastle since arriving on loan from Sparta Prague in January and, backpeddling, the goalkeeper performed wonders to claw Olivier Giroud’s highly accomplished, goalbound, backheel,to safety following the striker’s connection with Hazard’s cross.Suitably warned Newcastle responded by scoring a second. Again Shelvey was the creator. Indeed his volleyed connection with a half-cleared cross would probably have flown past Courtois had Pérez not flicked out a boot to apply the final touch to ensure its’ passage into the back of the net.Although Dubravka performed wonders to keep a Barkley shout out with his legs, Pérez soon scored again. This time, Shelvey whipped a free kick in and Florian Lejeune slipped it to the Spaniard to beat Courtois from six yards."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e2080cf0723c2741c0ff673482392a0d4f4f6c0/0_138_4126_2475/master/4126.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d764992ad0fcd55f597400797510d535","title":"southampton manchester city premier league match report","story":"How fitting that Manchester City would finish an extraordinary season with a bang. Gabriel Jesus, a substitute here, hoisted a wonderful dinked effort into the net with only seconds of the Premier League season left after meeting a flighted Kevin De Bruyne ball to earn the champions’ 32nd win of the campaign, attaining a landmark and record-breaking century of points in the process.Jesus ran to the delirious away supporters, mobbed by his team-mates. For so long, it looked as though City would end the season on something of a bum note but this was a timely reminder that Pep Guardiola’s side are no ordinary team. For Southampton, this was the end of an enormous week, in which they secured their league status after victory at Swansea on Tuesday.Mark Hughes said that his staff would keep one eye on events in south Wales but only disaster could have relegated Saints, with Swansea unable to muster up victory or the unimaginable 10-goal swing needed. That mission impossible was over by half-time – and not just because Stoke City were leading at the Liberty Stadium.Southampton were largely at leisure, in control for large spells and the defender Wesley Hoedt, of all people, had twice gone close. Inside eight minutes he rattled Claudio Bravo’s crossbar from Dusan Tadic’s inswinging corner before firing against the side-netting. Charlie Austin also had a sight of goal but his effort was relatively tame while Oriol Romeu shot ambitiously from distance. Manolo Gabbiadini, the hero in midweek, was serenaded as he limbered up on the touchline. It was that kind of afternoon. This was the most relaxed Southampton had felt all season long, finally at ease after a season of misery.As for City, who flew down from Manchester on Sunday morning, they never really got into their stride. They were limited to half-chances. De Bruyne wrapped his right foot around a delicious free-kick a few minutes into the second half, with John Stones inches from connecting at the back post. The returning Raheem Sterling led the line in the continued absence of Sergio Agüero but City never truly possessed that killer instinct. Leroy Sané slid a cross into an empty box before the ball ricocheted towards Fernandino, lurking near the penalty spot, only for the Brazilian to drive harmlessly over. Guardiola, sleeves rolled up, stalking his technical area, acknowledged something had to change and soon after Jesus would enter, in place of Fabian Delph.City had come alive with Sterling striking the post before Stones’ header from De Bruyne’s corner forced another fine save out of the increasingly impressive Alex McCarthy. It was Southampton who perhaps squandered the best chance late on, though, with Fernandinho clearing off the line after Tadic, who had beaten the offside trap, twice skirted around Bravo, the Manchester City goalkeeper frantically scampering around his box. Brahim Díaz and Phil Foden made their fifth league appearances of the season – ensuring them Premier League medals in the process – before Jesus popped up to finish an unforgettable season in considerable style."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00a588640b34dced97789b4d9731c523da3714a9/0_67_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39f15bf992239290cf2d811f2bcc01d8","title":"swansea city stoke city premier league match report","story":"There was a funereal feel about this fixture as Stoke, who were already down, condemned Swansea City to relegation and a place in the Championship alongside them. Swansea, in truth, were resigned to their fate on Wednesday night, after Huddersfield grabbed an unlikely point at Chelsea, meaning that Carlos Carvalhal’s side needed a footballing miracle on the final day of the season.That 10-goal swing across this game and the one taking place between Southampton and Manchester City never looked like happening as Swansea’s seven-year stay in the Premier League ended in defeat and amid no little anger as the supporters left the club’s board in little doubt as to what they think about the way things have imploded over the last few seasons.Swansea had more than enough chances to win the game but for the umpteenth time this season they were toothless in attack. Stoke were not so forgiving and punished some poor Swansea defending, after Andy King had given the home team the lead. Badou Ndiaye beat the offside trap to bring parity and the evergreen Peter Crouch scored what proved to be the winner. Whether only a second win in 15 matches keeps Paul Lambert in a job remains to be seen.This was always going to be a strange occasion. There was less than a minute gone when the home supporters started their calls for Huw Jenkins to leave. “We want Jenkins out” was the chant that reverberated for the first and not the last time on an afternoon when the football felt like a sideshow for long periods. With the Swansea fans going through their full repertoire of less than complimentary songs about the board, a banner was carried along the East stand midway through the first half that read: “No ambition, no investment, sold out”.Events on the pitch were doing nothing to improve the mood among those home fans come the interval. Despite taking the lead in the 14th minute through King, who calmly slotted André Ayew’s cushion header past Jack Butland, and having numerous chances to add to their lead during a bright opening.Wayne Routledge squandered a gilt-edged opportunity to make it 2-0. Swansea found themselves behind at half-time. Ndiaye, running on to Xherdan Shaqiri’s reverse pass, lifted the ball over Lukasz Fabianski to equalise and 10 minutes later Crouch headed in Lasse Sørensen’s free-kick to put Stoke ahead.Stoke should have been 3-1 up early in the second half, when Anthony Taylor pointed to the spot after Martin Olsson handled, but Fabianski made a superb save low to his right to keep out Shaqiri’s penalty. That gave Swansea supporters something to celebrate and there was an even bigger cheer moments later, when Leon Britton came off the bench to replace King and make his 537th and final Swansea appearance in a career ning 16 years.Àngel Rangel, another Swansea stalwart bowing out, started the game.Perhaps it was no coincidence that Swansea improved following Britton’s introduction as Carvalhal’s team carved out chance after chance. Tammy Abraham, farcically, blocked André Ayew’s goalbound shot, Sam Clucas was denied by Butland and Abraham saw his follow up effort cleared off the line by Kurt Zouma."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5566dd0e8e62ccf6c0d2335569b6df2d98d5a7b/0_0_2915_1749/master/2915.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c61883254d18894f8b02a4fe342acda3","title":"tottenham hotspur leicester city premier league match report","story":"The Tottenham Hotspur support chanted that they were going home and there is certainly excitement among their number at the prospect of returning to the rebuilt White Hart Lane next season. Yet what a send-off they gave to Wembley.The merits of the club’s temporary accommodation at the national stadium have been a talking point throughout a season in which they have secured third place in the Premier League and a third consecutive Champions League qualification.Tottenham started badly at Wembley but they grew into the famous old place and they can look back on a clutch of outstanding performances in the victories over Liverpool, Real Madrid, Manchester United and Arsenal. This win over a spirited Leicester City was rather more madcap and of less significance but it provided a richly entertaining finale.On an afternoon when defending was clearly not a part of either team’s plans, Tottenham trailed 3-1 before storming back into a 4-3 lead. Jamie Vardy found an equaliser for Leicester – with his second goal of the game – before Harry Kane – who else? - won it for Tottenham with his second.Tottenham had invited a host of their former players and one of them, Paul Gascoigne, who had been presented on the pitch at half-time, could be seen performing The Floss dance up in the stands when Kane’s winner went in. Around him, Gary Mabbutt smiled, Ossie Ardiles and Ricky Villa applauded and Dimitar Berbatov, well, just looked cool.Kane finished with 30 league goals for the season but it was not enough to overhaul Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah in the race for the Golden Boot. Kane had won the award in the previous two seasons with 25 and 29 goals.Leicester played a full part in a see-saw spectacle and they will wonder how they went home with nothing but a fifth defeat in seven league games. The focus will now turn to the future of the manager, Claude Puel, but it is fair to say that his players performed for him here.The game had the trappings of a meaningless end-of-season rubber and yet there were thrills and spills from the first whistle. Vardy was in the mood, his jet-heeled pace stretching a patched-up Tottenham backline while some of his touches boasted finesse of the highest order.He put Leicester in front with a flicked header from Riyad Mahrez’s free-kick, which had been awarded for a Kyle Walker-Peters nibble on Demarai Gray. Walker-Peters was the nearest marker to Vardy when Mahrez whipped the ball in but he was nowhere near close enough.Tottenham came back straight away and the equaliser was a moment to forget for Danny Simpson. The Leicester defender tried to work a pass out from the back but he hit Lucas Moura with it and the ball broke for Kane, who could see only green grass between himself and Eldin Jakupovic. He motored into it and beat the goalkeeper with a low shot inside the near post. At that point, it felt as though they might still be a race for the Golden Boot.Tottenham had lost Jan Vertonghen to a calf problem in the warm-up and so Mauricio Pochettino had to reshuffle, bringing Victor Wanyama into the starting line-up in midfield and dropping Eric Dier back into central defence, where he partnered Toby Alderweireld. Walker-Peters enjoyed a rare opportunity at right-back in the injury-enforced absences of Kieran Trippier and Serge Aurier. Tottenham’s defenders looked like strangers, at times.Leicester were back in charge with only 16 minutes on the clock. Adrien Silva won the ball off Wanyama and when Kelechi Iheanacho surged inside the area, the alarm bells sounded for Tottenham. Alderweireld jumped into a tackle on him and missed and when Walker-Peters and Vardy challenged for the loose ball, it broke for Mahrez, who banged a low shot past Hugo Lloris.Leicester ought to have been further in front on 26 minutes. It was Vardy’s cushioned pass that set up Gray for a one-on-one with Lloris but his shot was too close to the goalkeeper. Tottenham were booed off by some of their supporters at the interval.It was open, entertaining and the goals continued to flow in the second-half. Iheanacho’s was the pick of the afternoon. Dier’s clearing header was weak and the Leicester forward held off Wanyama – no mean feat – before unfurling a precision left-footed drive that picked out the top corner.Game over? Not at all. Remarkably, Tottenham were in front 13 minutes later. Erik Lamela scored two of the three goals that transformed the afternoon and he was central to the other one. The Argentinian’s first followed a slick move and a low Walker-Peters cross. Amid the suspicion of offside, he turned home.Lamela knew rather less about his role in the equaliser. Lucas flicked towards him and when Harry Maguire jumped into a challenge, the ball ricocheted off Lamela and flew home off Christian Fuchs for an own goal.Leicester were all over the place at the back, the spaces suddenly pronounced and when Lucas tried to play in Walker-Peters, it looked as though Gray would cut it out. But he got himself into a mess and Walker-Peters was in. When he crossed, Lamela was all alone again to finish.Back came Leicester and after Lloris had saved brilliantly to keep out Iheanacho, Mahrez ushered in Vardy, who finished explosively into the near top corner. Kane created the winner for himself with a move that sent the Leicester substitute, Hamza Choudhury, off towards Brent Cross. His shot was curled into the far corner beyond Jakupovic. Vardy fired high when well-placed in stoppage-time but there would be no further twist."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96767909f9700078f17cf4fe21dee3b25fd1343b/106_176_2924_1754/master/2924.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a8354c09e1bb24bf6bc181b62de3c85","title":"liverpool v brighton premier league live","story":"Mo Salah scored his 32nd Premier League goal of the season, breaking the record for a 38-game season, as Liverpool secured a top-four finish with an easy win at AnfieldThat’s it for today’s live blog, and for the Premier League season. Thanks for your company throughout. Goodnight!Jurgen Klopp speaks! “What the boys did is unbelievable. I can’t believe we could achieve this with Adam Lallana injured all season. The players have 9,000 games in their legs. I’m really proud of the boys. A nearly perfect season: we had no chance to challenge Manchester City so the only thing you can go for is a Champions League place.“I said to the boys at half-time: if someone from outside was describing Liverpool they would say, ‘Drama’. We showed we have matured with the way we closed the game out. We will add to the squad in the summer but I’m still a big believer in developing a team. We made a big step this season and I think we can make another next season.”Here’s Andy Hunter’s report from AnfieldThe Liverpool players are back on the field to enjoy a lap of honour. They went unbeaten at home all season in the league and were involved in some immense matches: the 4-3 win over Manchester City, the 2-2 draw with Spurs and that tactically compelling 0-0 draw with Manchester United.Mo Salah’s daughter is having the time of her life, kicking the ball around Anfield to huge cheers. Her dad has long since gone down the tunnel but she’s still going strong. Mo Salah speaks “The Golden Boot is very special. It’s always in my mind to help the team win games, and we will be in the Champions League next season so I’m very proud. It was always in my mind that I wanted to have success in England. I’m always trying to improve every year. It was very special to break the record in front of the Kop. I’ll do my best to win it next season, don’t worry.”Mo Salah is back on the field, receiving about 48 different awards from Kenny Dalglish: Player of the Year, Golden Boot, and the rest. He has his little daughter with him, and is looking left and right to take it all in. He started the season as a Chelsea flop and ended it being routinely compared to Lionel Messi. And he seems a thoroughly nice bloke.This, then, is the final Premier League table for 2017-18. You won’t believe who’s top!A ridiculous match at Wembley has ended Tottenham 5-4 Leicester. That means Liverpool will have to settle for a second consecutive fourth-placed finish. They’ll get over it.“Despite their best efforts to reschedule the show, Liverpool fans Echo \u0026amp the Bunnymen will play a gig in Birmingham on the night of the Champions League final,” says Peter Oh. “That could be the edgiest performance ever by Ian McCulloch and Will Sergeant.”It’s not quite an Agueroooooooooooooooo moment, but Gabriel Jesus’s late winner at Southampton has taken Manchester City to a staggering 100 points. Simon Burnton has more.Peep peep! Liverpool will go to Kiev in good heart after one of their easiest wins of the season. Mo Salah scored a record-breaking 32nd league goal, while Dominic Solanke and Andy Robertson added to the feelgood mood by scoring their first goals for Liverpool. Dejan Lovren was the other scorer with a towering header. Brighton were stuffed but who cares their work for the season was done when they beat Manchester United.90 min You wouldn’t think Jurgen Klopp will have any selection dilemmas for Kiev. Adam Lallana isn’t ready to start, and if everyone is fit the team picks itself. It’ll be today’s starting XI, with James Milner in place of Dominic Solanke.89 min The Liverpool fans are ending the domestic season in good voice. Today couldn’t really have gone any better.Andy Robertson gets his first goal for Liverpool! Lallana gave a reminder of his class with a neat pass down the left to Ings. He battered a cross that was only partially cleared by Dunk, and Robertson backed up the play to ram the ball into the net.84 min Liverpool make a double change: Mo Salah and Roberto Firmino are replaced by Danny Ings and Ben Woodburn.81 min Nothing is happening in this match.80 min Harry Kane, Spurs 5-4 Leicester. He needs two more to share the Golden Boot with Mo Salah.79 min Here’s Simon McMahon, with more on yesterday’s fun and games at Cowdenbeath. “Even the songs were wonderful. Especially the one that references the era of the Cowshed behind the goal at one end. ‘There was a coo, on yonder hill, it’s no’ there noo, it must’ve shifted.’ By the way, there was a West Brom Man United moment up here on the last day of the Scottish Premiership, as it finished Hibs 5 Rangers 5.”77 min Liverpool are back in third place, as things stand, because James Richard Vardy has made it Tottenham 4-4 Leicester at Wembley.75 min The match is petering out. It’s been a pretty perfect day for Liverpool: an easy win, no injuries, and Mo Salah close to his electric best after a few muted performances.73 min A Liverpool change: the popular Adam Lallana replaces Sadio Mane.71 min Another Brighton change: Connor Goldson replaces the injured Shane Duffy.70 min “I’ve been a Liverpool supporter since my dad bought me a shirt with ‘Hitachi’ as the sponsors (so close to 40 years), and I don’t recall enjoying a season as much as this one before,” says David Horn. “We’ll finish fourth (or third) and haven’t won anything (yet), but the joy! It’s been off the charts. From the dugout to the pitch to the stands, it’s been lovely. And to put the whole thing in perspective, it’s less than eight years since Gillett and Hicks appointed Roy Hodgson as manager. That still makes me cringe, but how far we’ve come. It shows that progress can be measured without reference to league tables. Enjoy whatever sort of off-season you’re afforded.”68 min No sign yet of Jurgen Klopp protecting any of his stars ahead of Kiev. Liverpool’s intensity has dropped since they went 3-0 up, though they are still almost embarrassingly dominant.67 min Newcastle now lead Oh, Chelsea 3-0. You can follow that and all the other games with Simon Burnton.65 min “If Big Nev’s inner monologue is anything like his Twitter feed, then it would have been riveting stuff, all political musings and social commentary,” says Matt Loten. “Thoroughly worth a follow.”64 min There’s a proper end-of-term feel now, with Liverpool knowing their domestic work is done. Salah almost makes it 4-0, scooting past Bong before slipping over when through on goal. Kevin Friend turns down yet another penalty appeal, but I think he was right to do so that time. Meanwhile, Spurs now lead Leicester 4-3 so Liverpool are back down to fourth.61 min It’s now Newcastle 2-0 Chelsea and Spurs 3-3 Leicester. As things stand, Liverpool are third.60 min “In pre-season, Solanke looked like a young Alan Shearer* in that he hit the ball early and with extreme prejudice,” says Niall Mullen. “He’s looked nervous in front of goal in competitive games. Glad for him today.“*I may be guilty of a little hyperbole.”Heh. That reminds me of that great Sir Alex Ferguson line about Shearer’s second goal against Poland in 1996: “He hit it as if he wanted to kill it.”58 min The hapless Schelotto allows Salah’s pass to run through to Firmino, whose first-time shot is tipped over by Ryan. Firmino should have scored. 57 min A double change for Brighton: Glenn Murray and Pascal Gross replace Jurgen Locadia and Beram Kayal.56 min You have to feel for Mat Ryan, who has probably been Brighton’s best player today. It reminds me of the time Neville Southall had a blinder for Wales against the Netherlands - and they still lost 7-1. Just imagine Big Nev’s internal monologue during that fiasco.A lovely moment for Dominic Solanke, who gets his first goal for Liverpool. It was made by Salah, who skilfully ignored a challenge from Dunk and then slid a perfectly weighted pass to Solanke in the area. He took the shot first time, battering a rising drive past Ryan at the near post.51 min “Afternoon Rob,” says Matt Loten. “Following up on Hubert’s email, I’d just like to say that, as a Premier League neutral (until Portsmouth’s triumphant return) this season has been a thoroughly enjoyable one which I will be sorry to see go. There may not have been much drama with regards the table, but Klopp, Guardiola and co have ensured that the league has shifted towards full-throttle entertainment and as self-contained 90-minute episodes the big matches have rarely disappointed. The City-Liverpool games in particular were superb, and the only real let-down I can recall off the top of my head was Liverpool-United at Anfield.“Compare this to a decade or so ago, when Mourinho was in his first spell at Chelsea and Rafa was at Liverpool, and 2-1 was considered a veritable goalfest in a big game. I’m sure the current situation won’t last forever, but I’m going to make sure I enjoy it while I can.”The last half hour of Liverpool v Spurs was my favourite, but as you say you could pick any number of them. For sheer drama it’s been a really memorable season in England and Europe. Probably best not to dwell on the quality of the defending or the competitiveness of the leagues, though.50 min A half-cleared corner leads to a bit of pinball in the Brighton area. Eventually the ball comes to Van Dijk, whose shot on the turn is straight at Ryan.49 min Firmino’s unexpected low shot from 25 yards is palmed behind by the ing Ryan. I think it would have hit the post but Ryan made sure.48 min It hasn’t been the liveliest start to the second half.46 min Peep peep! Brighton begin the second half.“Afternoon Rob,” says Simon McMahon. “At the end of another fantastic season for the self-styled richest  best league in the world, how about a half time mention for the other end of the football scale? Was at Cowdenbeath yesterday to see the Blue Brazil extend their 113-year stretch as a Scottish league club (for another year at least) with a crazy 3-2 play off win against Highland League winners Cove Rangers. Let’s just say the Highlanders weren’t best pleased with some of the decisions and ended the game with 8 men after three red cards following a superb, old-fashioned Donnybrook in stoppage time. 1750 fans there too, more than 10 times the Fifers average home gate. To see them celebrating being confirmed as officially the worst team in Scotland for the second year running was a sight to behold. As important to them as top four places, Europe, 17th place and Champions League finals to Premiership clubs.”Oh man, that sounds wonderful in just about every way. Peep peep! Liverpool lead by two, have missed a number of good chances and had three excellent penalty appeals turned down. That aside, it’s been neck and neck.44 min Liverpool have already had 16 attempts at goal.43 min This could be a tennis score. Mane’s shot is superbly blocked by the stretching Dunk, and then Liverpool appeal for a penalty when Propper challenges Solanke. He got the ball but his foot was extremely high. In the modern game, that’s a penalty, which makes it a hat-trick of penalties that Liverpool probably should have had.42 min “Well, there have certainly been more ups than downs, but I’m looking forward to Liverpool’s league campaign being over,” says Matt Dony, stopping just short of asking fans of every other club if they’re up to anything a week Saturday. “The last few weeks have not been too enjoyable, and let’s face it, we’re all pretty much fixated on Kiev. Glad to see Salah break the record, top four should be comfortably secured (other scorelines looking particularly tasty), so should be ending on a high. I’d like to see a goal for Big Dom, Maybe one for Ings off the bench, and a second half cameo full of flicks and spins from Lallana. And then on to two weeks of nervescrippling fear...”Breaking news: Liverpool will play Champions League football next season. A corner is half cleared to Robertson, who stands up a nice cross towards the far post. Lovren has the run on everyone and soars to thump an emphatic header past Ryan. That’s an excellent goal.38 min “Hey Rob,” says Hubert O’Hearn. “Well, another season done. Have to say that even if my first club (Liverpool) and second club (Newcastle) don’t win a thing, it’s been a marvellously enjoyable season for entirely different reasons: Liverpool with its guts n’ glory attacking style, and our old mucker Rafa keeping the Magpies up with a MasterClass in Management. And thanks to you old friend (and shout out to Scott Murray et al) for keeping us informed, entertained and laughing through a season of MBM reports. Cheers and a round of Dodgy Fizz to all the good folks at  Towers.”Yes, I’d also like to thank"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cb4e9bdf102ae28e5a3557abdd95c3c80a9569b/132_0_5368_3221/master/5368.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29190552e1f1f9fd6883bdabcefcb3c0","title":"newcastle v chelsea southampton v manchester city and more premier league clockwatch live","story":"A dramatic final day saw Mo Salah win the golden boot, Swansea’s relegation confirmed, and Manchester City grab a 100th point with the last kick of their campaignAnd with that, I’m gone. It’s been chaotic. Thanks for being there. Bye!And Louise Taylor was at Newcastle to see Chelsea get emphatically beaten:Antonio Conte began the afternoon in highly animated form in the technical area and, for a while, became almost hysterical before his mood finally morphed into sulky acceptance.Long before the end, Chelsea’s manager’s had become oddly static as he stood arms folded, expression disconsolate, on the touchline. Maybe they were saving themselves for the FA Cup final but Conte’s players never looked remotely like a side which kicked off harbouring outside hopes of a top four place.David Hytner was served with a slap-up goal feast at Wembley:The Tottenham Hotspur support chanted that they were going home and there is certainly excitement among their number at the prospect of returning to the rebuilt White Hart Lane next season. Yet what a send-off they gave to Wembley.Here’s a report on Burnley 1-2 Bournemouth:Antonio Conte talks after Chelsea’s dismal performance at Newcastle.We lost the game and I think deserved to have this defeat. I don’t know, for sure Newcastle look more determined than us. I think this. For sure, we didn’t lose a place in the Champions League today, or on the last two games. The chances were zero. But I think to finish the season this way, it’s not good. It’s not good for the team, not good for the players, not good for the fans. Now we have six days to prepare for the FA Cup final, and for sure we have to change. Our start today wasn’t good.When there is this situation, the first person to answer for this must be the coach. Because if in this game we had this spirit, this will, this desire, I think that I’m the first person to answer for this. You’re talking about the other team being more determined. I think today I wasn’t able to transfer that determination to my players.Stuart James watched as Swansea’s far-fetched hopes of salvation came to nought:There was a funereal feel about this fixture as Stoke, who were already down, condemned Swansea City to relegation and a place in the Championship alongside them. Swansea, in truth, were resigned to their fate on Wednesday night, after Huddersfield grabbed an unlikely point at Chelsea, meaning that Carlos Carvalhal’s side needed a footballing miracle on the final day of the season.Dominic Fifield saw Crystal Palace climb to 11th place in the league, and West Brom slip back to the bottom:This game ended up a celebration of Roy Hodgson, with the affection bellowed by both sets of supporters. The home support in the Holmesdale end waited until early in the second half to unfurl their banners of appreciation, with the ground then united in chorusing the former England manager’s name. He looked almost sheepish acknowledging the adulation.At Southampton, Dusan Tadic hasn’t just taken off and given away his shirt – his vest, shorts and socks have gone as well, and he’s walking off the pitch in a jockstrap.Jacob Steinberg was at the London Stadium, where West Ham won and Everton were rubbish:It spoke volumes that the Everton fans did not spring to the defence of their manager when the locals started having fun at Sam Allardyce’s expense. They simply could not be bothered and are unlikely to shed any tears if this limp defeat marks the end of Allardyce’s unhappy tenure.Andy Hunter witnessed Mo Salah’s latest goalscoring exploits at Anfield:Liverpool may have left it typically late to seal Champions League qualification but their farewell to the Premier League season and warm-up for Real Madrid was otherwise faultless. Mohamed Salah began a comprehensive win over Brighton with a record 32nd league goal of the campaign and Kop favourite Andy Robertson capped it with his first for the club. Anfield could only admire the exhibition in between.Michael Carrick’s 464th and final Manchester United appearance featured a vintage moment via a sweet pass that created Marcus Rashford’s first-half winner. The midfielder had walked out to a guard of honour and on 80 minutes strode off the turf for a last time to a standing ovation.Ben Fisher was at St Mary’s to see Manchester City smash another record:How fitting that Manchester City would finish an extraordinary season with a bang. Gabriel Jesus, a substitute here, hoisted a wonderful dinked effort into the net with only seconds of the Premier League season left after meeting a flighted Kevin De Bruyne ball to earn the champions’ 32nd win of the campaign, attaining a landmark and record-breaking century of points in the process.The match reports are trickling in now. This from Paul Doyle at Huddersfield:Arsène Wenger’s powers may have dwindled in recent years but at least his last match at Arsenal ended in the same way his first one did in 1996, with his team taking three points. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, the Frenchman’s last major signing at the north London club, made sure of that detail by stabbing into the net from close range in the 38th minute.I believe I had an impact on the club as a whole, because the club today is in a strong position. A new stadium, a new training ground, they’re all paid basically. We played 48 games unbeaten, it’s difficult to imagine. I’m very proud as well for winning seven FA Cups. I see a bright future for my successor, the team has a good attitude and good quality. We need two or three additions, and after that I believe the club will compete for the championship.On the pitch at Anfield, Mo Salah has brought out all of his inidual awards for this ridiculous, over-achieving season, and is being presented with one more – the golden boot.And here’s the league table:So the scorelines in full, and if nothing much was in the end decided today, at least everyone had fun not doing it. 31 goals! Thirty-one! Unless I’ve miscounted, which I probably have.A ludicrous match comes to an end at Wembley, and the 2017-18 Premier League season is over!Callum Wilson grabs a late winner for Bournemouth at Turf Moor. The only game still in progress is at Wembley – was that the final Premier League goal of the season?Guardiola goes absolutely wild as that goal goes in. Remarkable scenes.The referee indicated three minutes of stoppage time and the game was in the final second of those three minutes when De Bruyne lifted the ball over the Southampton defence, Jesus ran onto it, controlled and lifted over the keeper and into the net! A brilliant goal, and City win their 100th point with the final kick of the season!It’s all over for Swansea, and for Stoke, in a number of ways. Stoke head to the Championship buoyed by their first win in 14.“It’s looking like 42 points for West Ham, same as in 2003 under RoederBrooking,” writes Mark Jelbert. “Relegation that year, looking like 13th this.”“Conte’s team selection had a distinct whiff of a farewell sabotaging of the fourth place jig and now they’re parking the bus and conceding possession at 0-3,” writes Eamonn Maloney. “This is bordering on breach of his contract.” It does appear to have been an abysmal performance.Table movewatch: as it stands, West Ham are going up two places, and Southampton and Stoke are going up one place each. The top 12 places are unchanged.A hard, low cross from the left wing is erted away from goal by a defender but rolls straight to Robertson, who slams it in!Another lovely goal! From the edge of the area Lanzini curls the ball across Pickford, who gets a hand to it but can’t stop it nestling inside the far post!Massive applause at Crystal Palace as Pape Souare comes on for his first appearance since the car crash that nearly ended his career in 2016.Palace have scored some lovely goals in recent weeks, and here’s another. Three players exchange rat-a-tat passes outside the area, bemusing the West Brom defence, and then the ball is played through to Van Aanholt, who takes it past the keeper and scores!Kane has the ball outside the area. Choudhury comes to close him down, and Kane ghosts past him with a nice drop of the shoulder and then curls a lovely shot into the far post from 18 yards! The ball is crossed into the area, there are a succession of largely aimless headers, and then Niasse brings it down, spins beautifully and scores from close range. That is a really classy goal!Vardy is played into the penalty area and crashes a lovely left-footed shot inside the near post!Defoe’s low shot is saved but Burnley don’t clear their lines, Bournemouth get it back into the penalty area and King, from out to the left, cuts onto his right foot and curls into the far corner!Loftus-Cheek brings the ball forward from halfway before finding Van Aanholt to his left, and his cross is well turned in by Zaha with his left foot, a finish which was made to look a lot easier than it was.At Wembley, Lloris saves well to deny Iheanacho. Not a lot of good defending going on there, with Spurs in particular finding all sorts of space in the final third, and surely more goals to come.Arnautovic collects the ball with his back to goal, spins past Keane and lashes a shot goalwards from 20 yards. It’s so hard that Pickford decides not to get his hands in the way of it – or perhaps it moved a lot in the air – and it whistles straight past him!Yeah, 39 minutes. I know.Shelvey’s free kick from the right goes across goal, the ball is volleyed back into the mixer and Perez bundles it in!Walker-Peters presents Lamela with another tap-in at the end of another break. His second goal has been given to Fuchs, so it’s not a hat-trick (yet).Shelvey’s low shot from outside the area goes straight to Perez, who gets a slight touch to send it inside the far post! Chelsea have been awful today, and deservedly trail by two. The visitors have come close to scoring since the break, but Giroud’s header was brilliantly saved by Dubravka.Liverpool should have had a fourth, but Firmino, set up by Salah, shoots too close to Ryan, who saves. They are 3-0 up, but it could have been six.Rose crosses from the left, Lucas Moura backheels the ball to Lamela, and his shot flies off Fuchs and ends up in the top corner!It’s saved! Fabianski es low to his right, and Shaqiri’s shot goes right to him!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15b3b0c787c7a3bcbed77fce1b2591d1ffadf00b/121_164_2997_1799/master/2997.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5895ceb904372062e2d21ffbc23f6134","title":"joan didion john dunne malibu writers food","story":"In her kitchen at home in Malibu, the writer liked an ice-cold Coke for breakfast – and making salads to feed 40 guestsThis kitchen is in the Malibu house where Didion lived for eight years with her husband John Dunne and daughter Quintana – it stood equidistant from Hollywood (where the two wrote films together) and the San Andreas Fault.Every morning, Dunne would rise, make a fire, give Quintana breakfast, and take her to school. “Then I would get up, have a Coca-Cola, and start work,” Didion remembers, in a recent documentary by her nephew, Griffin Dunne. The Coca-Colas were kept ice cold, and appear as essential to her writing routine as quiet and light. Those who pledged $50 or more to the crowdfunding of Griffin’s film received a copy of her personal cookbook. A scrapbook of food clippings from magazines, menus of the meals she served at dinner parties (for Patti Smith she made chicken hash with roasted yellow peppers and baguettes) and food-stained recipes, handwritten, with terse crossing-outs, its most revealing page was the recipe for a parsley salad, less as an illustration of her diet, or even for the way its sparse style reflects her prose, but more as an insight into her social reach: the salad feeds up to 40.It’s not just that her recipes reveal her – reading her work you see Didion discovers herself this way too. In the notes she scribbled when covering the Patty Hearst trial in 1976 she unpicks her privilege through memories of fancy meals, mid-flight, “Lunching Aloft on Beltsville Roast Turkey with Dressing and Giblet Sauce,” then, “Stuffed Celery au Roquefort over the Rockies”.Though she dwindled to 75 pounds, cooking seems to be for Didion, now 83, one of the rituals that helped her keep on living when everything (John died at the dinner table as she mixed a salad Quintana died two years later, at 39) had shattered around her. After Dunne’s death there was a period when all she ate was congee in the documentary she cuts the crusts off a cucumber sandwich while she reads from The Year of Magical Thinking, her report from the frontline of grief. Translating it into a play, David Hare took the opportunity to plump her up. He set up a table in the theatre, and a sign: Cafe Didion. Here he’d insist she ate, croissants and jam in the morning, sandwiches at lunch.It seems reductive to tie Didion so tightly to death, but it’s there even in her recipe book. From the parsley salad for 40, the quantities shrink as time passes, to 12, to 8, to the cucumber sandwich, for one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47da3cbab1a907411e9760f9fe308799cadd666c/2066_1633_1888_1133/master/1888.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=668b897a16a8717aabbfd07eb548c2ab","title":"mary holbrook goat cheese somerset tymsboro","story":"Mary Holbrook went from a PhD in archeology to becoming the Somerset small farmer who transformed British cheeseThere is a bit of a list of things that get Mary Holbrook’s goat: the government, Brexit, country fields full of solar panels, homogenous executive housing estates, people asking about pioneering cheesemaking and her hallowed place in British dairy history.Holbrook knows about history.

She was never your typical cheesemaker, but for my money she is Britain’s best.John came from Somerset farming stock, and Sleight Farm, where she has more than 100 goats and 180 British Lop pigs, belonged to his family, but Holbrook was new to it. “I stopped working in museums because of red tape,” she laughs, “but dairy farming is much worse.” It was the mid-70s, she had two goats and two-and-half gallons of milk a day. “I asked myself, what am I going to do with it? Make some cheese. What am I going to do with that? Sell it.”There wasn’t much of a market for English goat’s cheese then so she sold locally through health-food shops. “My really crappy cheese did OK,” she says. “Then I went to France and came across their cheese moulds.”She wasn’t alone. French farmers were going through an artisan cheese revival and their influence was spreading.“They were all women,” says Neal’s Yard Dairy’s Randolph Hodgson, who was driving around the British Isles at the time looking for good cheese to sell. “There was Mary Holbrook at Sleight Farm, Veronica Steele at Milleens and Giana Ferguson at Gubbeen. They were a new wave and new to it. Mary had lived abroad and knew European cheeses and that is what she brought to it. She didn’t like following or leading a crowd. She is an independent spirit.”Also important was “Mr Taylor”, a former cheese buyer at Harrods. Holbrook had met him when she went into the food halls to check out her continental competition. She was soon supplying him. “I used to phone them in spring,” she says. “I’d speak to Mr Taylor and say, ‘I have cheese again.’ They were very good. He accepted it was seasonal. Now everyone wants it all year round. He was getting fresh cheese, the feta, our Little Rydings and Emlett. He took quite a range.”Emlett was my go-to cheese from when Holbrook also farmed sheep, until she suddenly sold her herd and it stopped, along with Sleight Farm’s Little Ryding. “Sheep need quite a lot of looking after, and they need shearing,” she says. “I couldn’t have been away from the farm if I had them.”Since around the time John died in 2002, Holbrook has spent a few days a week in Bethnal Green, east London. One week she’ll bring up cheese to Neal’s Yard Dairy in Bermondsey (“They get what I give them,” she says), the next she delivers her happily raised pigs and kids to restaurants such as Moro and James Lowe’s Lyle’s. Every Wednesday, she looks after her cheese at Neal’s Yard.Currently Holbrook makes four cheeses: young, fresh Sleightlett, Tymsboro, Cardo and Old Ford, a hard goat’s cheese, made when there’s enough milk and she’s inclined.“She is a one-off,” says Martin Gott who worked at Sleight Farm from 2004 to 2006. “What she has forgotten about cheese is more than most people will ever know. But she told me she was packing it up. She was spending a lot of time in London. She didn’t have anyone to milk her goats. It was all over, she said.”Gott and his partner, Nicola Robinson, moved from Cumbria to Somerset. “We shared the farmhouse and rented a couple of rooms. I thought, this lady isn’t going to be around for ever. I didn’t want to lose her take on cheese.”Gott also started developing his St James cheese at Holbrook’s dairy before taking it back to Cumbria. “We were working on the same farm, living in the same house, eating in the same kitchen, going about our own business.”It was the start of a second wind at Sleight Farm. “We were the first of a wave of people who worked with her,” he says. “Maybe she would have packed up, maybe other cheesemakers wouldn’t have come along after us. When you work with Mary, you see what farming should be. She sets the standard. It is a good academy.“She will work as hard as anyone you have ever met. She throws hay bales around. She is incredible. I call those memories my ‘Mary stories’. Like fairy stories they are unbelievable. She sets the bar really high and expects you to meet them. Don’t expect praise, but you know she is happy when she’s humming. Wandering around her farm, she hums quietly to herself. You can see when she is content. And seeing that is enough.”facebooksleightfarmtimsburyTymsboroHolbrook’s ash-coated pyramid. Firm, fresh, near dry white to soft, tangy, greeny-grey.CardoUses cardoon as a vegetable rennet.

It remains superb.Its streets are wide and nobly lined with mansions and offices that would flatter a capital. It has rich museums, universities, theatres and 50 dance halls. It has well-kept parks and a graceful river. This is a great city with a character as strong and pleasing as its national drink.But it is also a city that considers itself in trouble. It believes itself to be in the grip of a crime wave, not so much of robbery as of a degenerate, mindless, pointless violence. This week, for example, a 16-year-old boy, who could not run away because he had an artificial leg, was stabbed three times by young strangers in a park. They ran away, shouting “Shamrock”. A 12-year-old boy, the son of a policeman, waiting at a bus stop, was slashed down his jaw-line with a razor. And again there was no reason for an attack that was as casual as a smile at a pretty girl. A girl looking into a shop window with friends was stabbed in the back, apparently because she had refused to kiss a strange young man.The worst of Glasgow’s recent experiences came over the Easter weekend. Then there were 21 serious assaults and 25 robberies with violence. Nearly 100 people were injured. A boy coming home from church on Good Friday was stabbed by a youthful gang and died on the pavement in his father’s arms. There were 132 brutal attacks in Glasgow in March. There were 56 in the same time a year ago.It is a mysterious business and it is not clear if the situation is worse than in other comparable cities. Violence and its punishment was a major issue in the recent local elections and the Tories first and then the Labour candidates made it one of their chief claims to authority. There are demands for sterner punishments and for more powers of search and arrest for the police, though they would seem to have all that a civilised policeman could require.There were famous fights in the 1920s and 30s when gangs of up to 300 fought each other on the streets. Now Lord Carmont, a judge who handed down punishment like an outraged god, is remembered with longing. He is accorded the honour of having diminished razor slashing. The knife has taken its place and the convenient broken bottle remains.Extract from an article, published in the Observer on 19 May 1968, entitled ‘Where the violence is as casual as the smile of a pretty girl’, by Patrick O’Donovan"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26ccac0b171430ff2e2820638b10ad7c8aacd770/0_277_4869_2921/master/4869.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7eb8694e7f0fe6b698cc063217cd8202","title":"keeping a free and fair press is one of the defining political issues of our age","story":"Both those who are wronged, and those seeking to expose abuses of power, pay a priceEd Miliband argued it was “a matter of honour and the promises we made” as he argued unsuccessfully for parliament to launch phase two of the Leveson inquiry into press intrusion. For Sir Cliff Richard, the BBC hovering over his home in a helicopter was a “very serious invasion of privacy”, during an investigation that led to no charges. For Kay Kimsong, the editor of the Phnom Penh Post, it was the coverage of his own newspaper’s sale to a public-relations executive with close ties to the government, that cost him his job.How we arbitrate the rights and responsibilities of maintaining a free and fair press function is one of the defining political issues of our age, and we seem to be inadequately prepared for the task.The price of a free press is paid by both those who are wronged and exposed, and by those who are seeking to expose abuses of power and instances of corruption. Outside the shrinking model of western-style democracies, the people who pay most, usually with their freedom and lives, are reporters and editors working against corruption and the abuse of power. When fragile democracies fall, it is often journalists who are the first dominoes to be pushed.The examples are endless, and moving ever closer to home: journalists at the Philippine news site Rappler, who receive sometimes as many as 800 death threats an hour from President Rodrigo Duterte’s online band of fanatical trolls two Reuters journalists who were imprisoned in Myanmar for filming atrocities against the Rohingya Muslims the 10 journalists killed in Kabul in a suicide bombing at the end of April the Maltese investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was killed by a car bomb for digging into stories about corruption in the Maltese government the Russian journalist Maxim Borodin investigating mercenary deaths in Syria, who died after a fall from his apartment.Last year, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, there were 262 journalists imprisoned, the highest number for 30 years. Since 1990, more than 2,500 have been killed, in civil wars, covering conflict or investigating regimes and iniduals of corruption.Squaring this level of personal sacrifice with the actions of empowered and corrupt journalism in more protected environments, leaves not only a bad taste but an open door for intervention. This might come from governments or, more likely and equally worryingly, from the new information gatekeepers, such as social media companies and search engines, who, through their practices and terms of use, are already exercising an opaque control over journalism.Press freedom is still argued for and arbitrated on a set of assumptions that are rapidly becoming outdated. The assumption that there will always be a well-funded commercial press is already shattered. Even where news companies are beating market expectations, as News Corp, Thomson Reuters and Gannett all did last week, the overall revenues accruing to news isions are smaller than in the past and, in some sectors such as local journalism, all but gone. The assumption that there is something easily defined as “the press” is as anachronistic as the printing presses from which it came.While arguably it has never been more important to be able to identify and defend good journalism, the most successful commercial distributors of information – Facebook and Google – have built systems that pay little attention to defining different categories of information. The most difficult and dangerous assumption to tackle within this, is that anything which appears to be journalism ought to be defended as such. The failure of the “marketplace of ideas” in the US has led to an unregulated landscape in which reporting is relying on personal donation or subscription and foundation support. But when everything is speech, and protected by the first amendment, the likelihood increases that voices are drowned out or distorted by those with greater resources, better tactics or worse motives.The results of this folly are being played out in every market in the world, on Capitol Hill and in select committee hearings. The release by Facebook of thousands of Russian-authored ads targeted at US voters in the 2016 election last week underlined the problem, as propagandists in St Petersburg mimicked activists, publishers and citizens across the American political spectrum with absurd ease.Open Democracy recently reported that the Irish referendum on abortion was being subjected to the same tactics, with overseas groups able to buy and target Irish voters in the same way. Regulations to stop campaign spending by overseas parties did not anticipate this sort of interference through social media, despite the fact it is the first tactic in any lobbying groups armoury.Online news properties, which look perfectly normal, are often part of sophisticated political influence campaigns, but it is becoming harder to prove the funding and authorship.In Britain, the charged issue of press regulation grows from a perception that the bad journalism outweighs the good. That the largest and richest denizens of the press have historically been as corrupt as the power they were meant to be holding to account, and often more powerful, too.The relationship between Rupert Murdoch’s News UK executives and David Cameron’s Conservative party was scandalously close and provided the right conditions for the phone-hacking scandal to flourish.The inability of the UK professional press to effectively self-regulate has arisen from the fact that the largest commercial constituents in the UK have been historically the most egregious in terms of practice, and moribund in terms of moral authority.A moment where everything is broken at least offers some hope that we can do better. The first step to this will be an understanding that no one part of the equation can be tackled discretely.Press freedom is a sacrosanct article of the democratic process and, even at its most abusive, it remains better than the alternative. But we have to understand just how much worse those abuses can potentially become. As journalists, we also have to recognise that our future is more in our own hands, and those of our paymasters and owners, than our narrative sometimes suggests.Advocating for strong journalistic protections means agreeing that there are principles that identify good practice, just as there are in medicine and law, and that there are consequences for transgression. If we cannot define and recognise these principles, then it will be difficult to resist government or commercial efforts to define them for us. And for the grandest institutions, such as parliament and the BBC, there is an historic role in redefining not only what the rights of the press might be, but also what the rights of the citizenry are to have access to and receive reliable information."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6eb0ef668d02e0fc036bc4055a6e0fe151c1f162/0_6_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e247479ac6019772d8f64c13682c129","title":"2018 festival anthems","story":"What makes a banging festival anthem, besides a simple chorus that vast crowds can belt out in unison? Here are the tracks you can expect to hear all summerIn 1970, a band called Fairfield Parlour were commissioned to write a “theme tune” for the Isle of Wight festival. They obligingly changed their name to I Luv Wight and devised a charming bit of psych whimsy called Let the World Wash In. The event itself went down in history: the crowd was bigger than at Woodstock, and Jimi Hendrix’s headlining performance turned out to be one of his last. But Let the World Wash In did not: according to legend, the festival DJ played it once, then publicly smashed the record in front of a cheering crowd.It was early evidence that festival anthems are difficult, nebulous things to define. The question of what makes one is as thorny as the hedgerow you find yourself falling into at 3am, while simultaneously trying to urinate alfresco. If there were a formula to it, everyone would knock one out each summer. But clearly there isn’t. If you Google “festival anthem” what you swiftly learn is that if an artist proudly announces they’ve written a festival anthem, it’s Let the World Wash In all over again vanishing into obscurity.Perhaps there are too many variables in a festival to predict entirely accurately what is going to go down well: what sounds life-affirming on a blissfully hot afternoon may well make people want to murder you if they’ve spent the previous 48 hours wading through slurry with carrier bags tied around their feet. The solitary rule is that you want a chorus simplistic enough for vast crowds to be able to bellow along in unison, which is why, whatever their merits as songs, Bon Iver’s 29 #Strafford APTS is never likely to become a festival anthem, but Coldplay’s Fix You has. Indeed, the popularity of 2017’s most ubiquitous festival anthem – the repurposing of the White Stripes’ Seven Nation Army that we may as well call Oh, Jeremy Corbyn – had something to do with a spirit of optimism engendered by the man. But it was doubtless linked to the fact everyone could remember the words to it, even after three days subsisting entirely on a diet of warm cider and chewing gum. That said, this year, any of the following might well be in with a fighting chance … APAny track off last year’s CTRL album would work in an early evening, sun-dappled festival slot, but Drew Barrymore wins because it comes with a perfect in-built checklist of necessities. “Bring the gin, got the juice, bring the sin, got that too,” she sings, while “somebody get the tacos, somebody spark the blunt” is the exact level of slightly-too-aggressive organisational ability any large group of friends needs.Lovebox, LongitudeSelf-proclaimed “best boyband since One Direction”, 14-strong US hip-hop collective Brockhampton’s stage attire is basically the Smurfs doing work experience at the Arches, all blue body paint and overalls.

Afterwards, he said: “This money has sat idly for nearly a century, accumulating in value but contributing nothing to either the national debt or good causes. This money would help charities feed the hungry, house the homeless and care for the sick, as well as supporting other worthy causes.”The delay has ensured that the fund’s coffers have swollen further, from just below £250m in 2009 to £475m, according to the last set of accounts. But the Charity Commission believes that any charity in which “funds appear to be held indefinitely is problematic” and that “the matter of the National Fund has therefore been of concern to us”.The idea that citizens had the will or wherewithal to pay off such vast sums was always optimistic. Nevertheless, it was not for 80 years that the idea of closing the National Fund and donating the proceeds to good causes was mooted.That proposal originally came from its trustees, now represented by Zedra Financial Services. But the National Fund’s most recent accounts say that is not the most likely outcome: that would instead see the endowment “liquidated and payment made to the National Debt commissioners”, which is part of the Treasury.Jeremy Wright, the attorney general, told Reed in a written response this week that he accepted there was no realistic prospect of the fund ever paying off the national debt. He added that “the intentions and wishes of the person who originally set up the fund ... must be respected” and promised to update MPs shortly on what he would do next.To release the funds and close the trust that governs the fund, Wright would have to apply to the courts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8913141b2f5b2d9643aa3a44edd2574734fafcd0/0_212_4272_2564/master/4272.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e01160921a7cea547e66895c6425225e","title":"michael gove irish border technology brexit","story":"Criticism of May’s preferred model brings cabinet customs union breakthrough into questionMichael Gove has cast fresh doubt on the possibility of a breakthrough in the cabinet customs deadlock, saying there were “significant question marks” about proposals for a customs partnership.The environment secretary expressed scepticism about the merits of Theresa May’s preferred customs partnership model, saying the proposal had flaws and needed to be tested.Gove indicated he had some sympathy for the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, who called the proposal “crazy” this week.“Because it’s novel, because no model like this exists there have to be significant questions about the deliverability of it on time,” Gove told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show.Brexiters prefer an alternative model, the so-called “max fac”, which uses technology to do customs checks with limited friction on the Northern Irish border.Gove admitted cabinet ministers remained conflicted about both proposals, saying “there is agreement that neither of these two models is absolutely perfect”.The cabinet’s Brexit subcommittee will meet again on Tuesday but is not expected to emerge with a compromise. A government source suggested the two working groups of cabinet ministers, set up last week to thrash out arguments for both proposals, needed to be given time to work through the two options.Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, expressed some frustration with the deadlock and the counter-briefings. Asked if he was one of the ministers threatening to block the new customs partnership, which appeared to be the prime minister’s preferred model, he said: “I’m backing the prime minister. I think that we have to trust Theresa May.”“You can’t iron out every single detail of a negotiating position in public,” he told LBC. “It’s going to be bumpy of course because it’s a different course to the way we were going to go but we’ve got to have some confidence and trust in her.”The former cabinet minister Stephen Crabb also said MPs were becoming increasingly disturbed by the deadlock. “I am not alone in saying there is a growing concern on the backbenches about how entrenched some of the positions in the cabinet seem to have become,” he told the BBC. “The vast majority of Conservative MPs don’t see this question of a customs union as some kind of ideological cage fight.”He added that cabinet ministers who refused to budge may find that “parliament will be making the decisions for them”.Under the customs partnership model, the UK would collect tariffs on behalf of the EU and its backers believe it would go some way to solving the issue with the Northern Irish border.Brexiters prefer the “maximum facilitation” model that relies on technology to minimise border checks, which critics say cannot resolve the Irish border issue and would require lengthy development of sophisticated new technology.On Sunday, Gove said he would not back any delay to the UK leaving the customs union beyond the transition period to allow new border technology to be developed.“In delay there lies no plenty,” he said. “The critical thing is to meet that deadline. My experience in government reinforces my belief that we need to make sure we deliver things at pace.”EU members (plus Turkey, Andorra, Monaco and San Marino) trade without customs duties, taxes or tariffs between themselves, and charge the same tariffs on imports from outside the EU. Customs union members cannot negotiate their own trade deals outside the EU, which is why leaving it – while hopefully negotiating a bespoke arrangement – has been one of the government’s Brexit goals.\u0026nbspSee our full Brexit phrasebook.Ireland’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister, Simon Coveney, said there had been a clear commitment from May that there would be no border infrastructure. He said any backtracking would mean “a very difficult summer for these negotiations if that happens”. Though the EU has been widely reported to have rejected both of May’s customs options, Coveney indicated a softening of approach to the customs partnership, saying he was open to a solution “as long as it achieves the outcome of there being no physical infrastructure on the island of Ireland and no related checks or controls”.Coveney said the Irish government “don’t take our lead from Boris Johnson in relation to Brexit. We take our lead from the prime minister. She has signed up to very clear commitments.”Johnson has been excluded from the two working groups examining the merits of both options, as has the chancellor, Philip Hammond, who is most in favour of the customs partnership.Gove will examine the customs partnership alongside Liam Fox and David Lidington, while David Davis will examine the “max fac” model with Karen Bradley and Greg Clark, who have expressed scepticism about that model’s negative effects on business and on its workability at the Northern Irish border."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef6aecc43d9498cd5b63fa7c1238ea3191aee50b/0_123_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b83337cf29ba3b7256e0a1dcedd7cb47","title":"simon yates wins ninth stage extend lead giro ditalia","story":"• Briton retains the pink jersey going into rest day• Chris Froome loses ground and slips out of top 10Simon Yates extended his overall lead in the Giro d’Italia to more than half a minute with victory on stage nine at Gran Sasso d’Italia.Yates pounced in the final 100 metres of a climb that finished above the snow line to beat Frenchman Thibaut Pinot (Groupama-FDJ) and his Mitchelton-Scott team-mate Esteban Chaves, putting him 32 seconds clear of Chaves in the standings going into Monday’s rest day.But it was another bad day for Chris Froome, who failed to hang on to a five-strong breakaway group two kilometres from the finish, sliding out of the overall top 10 as a result and losing more than a minute on Yates.Yates has held the race leader’s pink jersey since stage six, when he finished second behind Chaves on the slopes of Mount Etna.Here he timed his run to perfection, forming a four-strong chase when Italian Domenico Pozzovivo (Bahrain-Merida) attempted to break clear towards the end of the 225km stage from Pesco Sannita.Pinot, Chaves and stage eight winner Richard Carapaz (Movistar) went with him, with Yates going around Pinot in the final moments to claim a victory he greeted with evident emotion.As a result of his efforts Chaves moved up to second place in the overall standings, demoting Holland’s defending champion Tom Dumoulin (Team Sunweb) into third, 38 seconds behind."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c47f1d35d405fa726ae3490f1cfa50e1f7ecd247/0_114_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=550280c0fb32843220c1c2d90a50fe62","title":"wasps danny cipriani summer move gloucester","story":"Gloucester hope to win the race to sign Danny Cipriani when the fly‑half leaves Wasps this summer.

He dominated the entire weekend and completed victory with the minimum of fuss. You could see from his reaction that he believes something big is brewing …“It felt really good today. I don’t now how it looked but it felt special. Really strong. Once I got going after a good start no one had the pace to keep up with me. I was pulling away more than a second a lap. There are still areas that weren’t quite perfect but this is the closest it has been to some of the performances last year.”Next up is Monaco, Hamilton’s adopted home town. Thanks for joining and goodbye.Sebastian Vettel cuts a frustrated figure. “We just didn’t have enough pace today,” he says. “At the end I just wasn’t in a healthy place with the tyres even though mine were the freshest. It was a decent weekend but we just need to understand what to do with the tyres.”On the podium Hamilton launches the Spanish Grand Prix trophy six foot in the air and prepares to pop the corks. Verstappen gets an almighty cheer from the abundant Dutch fans and sneakily soaks Hamilton in Champagne while the championship leader sprays the crowd. Verstappen looks delighted with his third place. “It is really hard to pass here but we got the luck with Kimi retiring,” he says. And how was the car after part of the wing fell off? “I had to keep pushing because I had Sebastian behind me” he says. “The car doesn’t look as nice but it doesn’t matter.” Hamilton performs a swallow e on to his team members before describing his race. “Today the car and mysel, I felt that synergy which I hadn’t been feeling for the whole year,” he says. “This is where we start to try and apply the pressure. It’s great to see that true force within the team.” “Awesome race,” Hamilton is told over the radio by a very happy Mercedes team. The world champion is now 17 points ahead in the drivers’ standings, having been 17 behind not so long ago. Ricciardo will be frustrated by his fifth-placed finish.

A first of the season when he really needed it.Lap 6466: Alonso posts his fastest lap. But is 7sec behind Sainz in seventh.Lap 6366: Ricciardo is flying now, but he’s 20 sec behind Vettel in third. Too little too late I’m afraid.Lap 6266: Can Vettel get past Verstapen in this last four laps? He just piut in a fastest lap and the gap is 2sec.Lap 6166: A Mercedes one-two is looking inevitable now. Hamilton and Bottas are a long way clear and only engine failure are likely to stop them.Lap 5866: Kevin Magnussen has quietly gone about his business in his Haas today. He started seventh on the grid and is now sixth, ahead of Sainz, Alonso and Perez, who has just taken Leclerc.Lap 5766: Vettel’s front left tyre doesn’t look quite right, and that could explain why he is struggling to make inroads on Verstappen despite the fresh tyres. Lap 5666: Verstappen is doing a fine job holding off Vettel here, and restoring some credibility. Vettel just cannot get close enough to attempt a pass.Lap 5566: Fernando asks for a weather forecast over the radio. He is desperate for rain. The team say it hasn’t changed.Lap 5366: Hamilton is coasting at the front. His lead over his Mercedes team-mate Bottas is 17sec.

Ericsson holds off the Renault though and keeps his ninth placed position. Great racing2866: Hamilton is flying on his new tyres. He is only two second behind the leader Verstappen, on new tyres.

Whether you fancy paddleboarding around the coast or zipwiring across the treetops, here’s how to unlock a healthier, happier you this spring and summerFrom reducing blood pressure to alleviating symptoms of depression, countless studies have proved that being outdoors and in contact with nature is beneficial for both physical and mental health. In these milder months, there’s no excuse not to be outside as much as possible. Here are nine ideas for inspiration.Ride a waveThe north Cornwall coast, with its big Atlantic seas, is Britain’s premier surf destination, with Fistral beach at Newquay probably the country’s best-known surf beach. But there are great places to learn to surf all around the UK. If you’re after a board experience with a less steep learning curve, stand-up paddleboarding offers the chance to take to the water in an easy-to-learn fashion. As well as the exhilaration of surfing the waves, paddleboarding can be a means of exploring the wonders of Britain’s tranquil inland waterways.Get started: Surfing England (surfingengland.org) has information on surf clubs and learning to surf. The British Stand Up Paddle Association website (bsupa.org.uk) has information on where to learn.See colours in bloomSpring and summer are the best times to explore England’s most glorious gardens. Among the Royal Horticultural Society’s (RHS) stunners is its flagship garden, Wisley in Surrey. Home to one of the world’s largest plant collections, it’s a riot of flowering bulbs and blossoms in spring, with fragrant roses and colourful mixed borders in summer. The RHS also runs summer flower shows around the country, including the world-famous Chelsea flower show. The National Trust is  to more than 200 gardens and landscaped parks, many attached to its historic houses, with Studley Royal water gardens at Fountains Abbey, also a world heritage site, among the best known.Freewheel through forest trailsZip along peaceful country lanes between summer hedgerows, pedal past glowering mountains above Scotland’s Glencoe pass as part of a tour or expedition, race with other cyclists, or even head off-road along forest trails on a mountain bike. Cycling can provide high-adrenaline sport or light, relaxing exercise, but whichever way you ride, getting on a bike gives you an up-close view of the countryside that you’d never get from a car.Get started: Cycling UK (cyclinguk.org) can help you get on the road, with advice on everything from buying a bike to cycling groups and routes.Escape to the countryCity dwellers craving a rural fix should seek out one of the many regional annual outdoor shows, a celebration of farming and rural life, with sheep and cattle competitions, horse and dog shows, sheep-shearing contests and farm machinery displays. These days, though, the events are also packed with family-friendly entertainments, ranging from air displays and carriage-driving races to skateboarding and marching bands. Local producers showcase their food and drink, and makers display arts and crafts.Get started:UK County Shows (ukcountyshows) has countrywide information and links to inidual shows.Swim in scenic surroundingsWhat could be a more perfect summer idyll than plunging into a cool lake or river on a hot, sunny day? Wild swimming – taking a dip in rivers, lakes, streams and waterfalls – has a growing number of fans. Popular spots to swim include Ullswater in the Lake District and lochs throughout Scotland, while rivers in the Brecon Beacons are home to stunning waterfall plunge pools. In the south of England, Pangbourne on the river Thames is one of many popular locations, and there are even urban swims to be had in London’s Serpentine and Highgate ponds.Get started: There’s information on locations throughout the UK and all-important safety tips tips at wildswimming.Soar into the treetopsThere’s a special kind of thrill to hurtling through the treetops suspended on a wire. Locations range from urban parks (such as Heaton Park in Manchester and Battersea Park in London) to mountains and forests. Zip World, with locations in Wales, offers a variety of adventures through forest, over a quarry and even – this one’s for the fitter and more adventurous – underground in caverns. Go Ape has locations throughout England, Scotland and Wales, and a collection of mainly forest-based attractions.Kayak along the waterwaysBritain has thousands of miles of rivers, lakes, reservoirs and canals canoeing (single-ended paddle), or kayaking (double-ended paddle), is a great way to explore them. Assuming you don’t have your own canoe, you’ll need to join a club or go to an activity centre, where staff will generally help new paddlers with an induction session. Sea kayaking is a lot of fun, too, and more experienced paddlers may enjoy canoe polo (just as it sounds) or white-water canoeing. Get started: British Canoeing (britishcanoeing.org.uk) has information on canoe clubs and activity centres around the country, and on canoe hire.Walk this wayWhether it’s a Sunday stroll or a serious hike, there’s no simpler – or cheaper – way to explore Britain’s great outdoors than on foot. The British countryside is laced with public footpaths all you need to get going is a pair of walking boots or sturdy trainers (plus a map and weatherproof gear if you’re going far). Among myriad footpaths, 16 national trails pass through some of the country’s most iconic landscapes. They include the South West Coast Path, with 630 miles of trails snaking around the Dorset, Devon, Cornwall and Somerset coasts, and northern England’s hilly Pennine Way.Get started: National Trails (nationaltrail). In addition, Ramblers (ramblers.org.uk) has suggestions for hiking routes on its website.Combine your love of music with the outdoorsPack your tent and wellington boots and head for one of the country’s iconic music festivals this summer. These days the biggest international names (from Beyoncé to Ed Sheeran) vie to play them: there’s no other way to see so many top artists in a single location. Glastonbury is taking a break in 2018, but there are many others picking up the slack, from Bestival to Latitude, the Isle of Wight festival, V and many more.

A good nosy at their previously unseen personal possessions and artefacts, that’s what. This summer, that’s exactly what London’s V\u0026ampA museum delivers in the much-anticipated Frida Kahlo: Making Her Self Up. The majority of this collection of jewellery, letters, photographs and items from her wardrobe (including hand-painted corsets) was only recently discovered, having been shut away for 50 years since her death. Consider this essential for demystifying the Mexican artist and sartorial icon, and it’s a lot cheaper than going all the way to Mexico. Granted, the exhibition is indoors, but you can combine your visit with a stop-off at the V\u0026ampA’s garden cafe, a hidden oasis in the centre of the museum, where you can sit at one of the courtyard tables or picnic on the lawn.vam.ac.uk from 16 JuneArrange a bouquet of flowersYou don’t have to be embarking on a second career as a florist to appreciate a beautifully arranged bunch of flowers, although a workshop at The Narcissus Flower School in Edinburgh could well send you in that direction. From learning to hand-tie a spring wedding bouquet to perfecting a festival-ready floral crown, this is the place to go this summer for cutting-edge botanical design. The highlight in the programme has to be The Foragers Garden Party workshop, which caters to all al fresco needs, from rustic barbecues to afternoon tea. Bring it on.narcissusflowers 21 June (and various dates)Learn a new craftStep away from the sandy beaches and seafood and head straight to The Studio at Burlingham Hall in Norfolk to get your hands – rather than your toes – dirty this summer.

Not that you’ll have much time to sit with your head in a book at Hay festival Wales, where Margaret Atwood leads a stellar line up of about 800 inspirational, thought-provoking discussions and panels. She’ll speak on The Handmaid’s Tale and beyond, while Philip Pullman, joined by Marina Warner and folklore academic Jack Zipes, promise tales of wonder, magic, and hope. Don’t miss the brilliant Letters Live, which returns for a fifth year.hayfestival 24 May-3 JuneWatch iconic bandsWhen it’s live music you want, settling on which summer festival to go to can be tricky, but this year’s Isle of Wight festival will take that decision out of your hands. It’s a special one, marking 50 years since its inauguration, and as a result, the festival has been appealing for stories from anyone who was there in 1968, watching Jefferson Airplane and T Rex et al.

Will smaller boats, late-night stop-offs and better brunches tempt young people on board?aThink of cruise holidays and a whole host of images spring to mind. Endless buffets. Crushed velvet upholstery. Sex on the beach (the cocktail, obviously). His and hers dressing gowns. Jane McDonald. And, most of all, lots and lots of older people, from well-heeled fiftysomethings to time-rich retirees. Millennials? Not so much.That may be changing, though. Last July, the Cruise Lines International Association revealed that the average age of cruisegoers had fallen to a sprightly 46, its lowest figure in 20 years. (In the UK, the number is a more mature 55.) While those figures may not seem particularly dramatic, they are nevertheless encouraging for an industry that has been largely reliant on the grey pound.A number of cruise companies are working hard to coax younger holidaymakers on board. Last month saw the maiden voyage of what is being referred to as the first line aimed squarely at millennials. U by Uniworld, which offers river cruises through various European cities, including Amsterdam, Budapest and Frankfurt, made headlines when it announced that its ships would only accept 21- to 45-year-olds. That upper age limit has since been removed – Uniworld’s CEO, Ellen Bettridge, suggests the U line is instead for people with an adventurous mindset – but the appeal to youth remains.On board U’s two vessels, you will find silent discos and mixology sessions, while the black-tie meals associated with P\u0026ampO et al have been replaced by a more casual dining experience featuring brunch and small plates. It is practically Dalston on the Danube.Uniworld isn’t the only established cruise brand chasing younger customers. Next year, the German firm Amadeus is launching cruises along the Rhine, the Danube and the Seine with onboard “celebrity influencers”, who will document the trip on social media. The Regent Seas Explorer offers spin classes and designer handbag stores, while MSC’s Seaside class styles itself in the manner of a Miami South Beach condo, and has a teppanyaki grill and the longest zipline of any cruise ship on the planet. Then there are the floating festivals such as Anchored and Groove Cruise, the latter boasting EDM artists including Deadmau5 and Benny Benassi.Those festivals build on another unlikely trend: the theme cruise. A number of these cruises emerged at the beginning of the decade, featuring bands such as Paramore and Weezer, comic book conventions and, bizarrely, the cast of the Saw horror films. Even festival giant Coachella briefly got in on the act, with a lineup that featured Pulp, Hot Chip and LCD Soundsystem’s James Murphy.One lesson learned from these theme events is that the cruising itself isn’t necessarily the main draw. “With something like Anchored, people didn’t necessarily know they were going on a cruise. This just happened to be a floating festival at sea,” explains Adam Coulter, the managing editor of the website Cruise Critic.Uniworld has similarly tried to play down the cruise bit of its millennial-friendly cruises, with Bettridge describing the U instead as a “floating boutique hotel that you can hop on and hop off”. It offers regular stop-offs at European cities, with the boats sitting in dock until the wee small hours for the benefit of late-night revellers. The boats are smaller, encouraging closer contact between passengers. There is also less of an emphasis on the mass group activities – the “herding around”, as Coulter puts it – of traditional cruise lines. Instead, holidaymakers are encouraged to explore, with bicycle tours, trips around food markets and visits to breweries or the beach.Twenty-seven-year-old Nina, from Canada, was on U’s first cruise. “I have done a lot of megaship cruises and this river cruise definitely has a different feel to it,” she says. “There are fewer people and you get to interact more. I am an active person, so I particularly liked how active the excursions were. A lot of biking, for sure.“The age group did play a factor in our decision-making,” she adds, noting that the average age of passengers on her boat was “late 20s and early 30s”.The new style of cruising could compete with more traditional package holidays for younger customers, Coulter believes. “You’ve got a ship that’s going to, say, Mykonos, Kos or Santorini in the middle of high season, when you can’t get a hotel room for love nor money.” A cruise ship, with accommodation, food and even some booze included in the price, might start to look tempting.How tempting remains to be seen. U’s cheapest holiday is £1,469 for eight days – less than many cruises, but still a significant outlay for most younger people. The scrapping of the upper age limit suggests they are not quite ready to throw themselves at this form of package holiday.Yet even if the millennial cruise proves to be little more than a passing fad, it is having an effect on the wider industry. Coulter notes that some features – more time in port, less emphasis on group activities – are being adopted by the bigger lines, which are also racing to include eye-grabbing technology such as indoor skying tunnels and giant HD screens.Perhaps most crucially of all, internet access – formerly one of the most retrograde aspects of the cruise experience, slow and often laughably expensive – has finally sailed into the 21st century, with affordable superfast wifi on many lines. Perfect, Coulter notes, for the “generation that wants to post selfies and put stuff on Instagram. They want their friends to know they are on a cruise.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/490276454c73f4ee0caa6339e1b6659baf25e8cb/0_195_5138_3082/master/5138.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f64154506343076f3a8a5952e5b13e8","title":"eurovision 2018 five things we learned","story":"Politics is out and props are the new pixels in this glorious age for Europe’s music contestThis year’s Eurovision has been an absolute spectacle, with the final broadcast live from Lisbon’s Altice Arena to an audience of more than 200 million fans worldwide.Whether you love or hate the world’s biggest music show, it’s hard to deny that the modern era of Eurovision offers slick production, quality vocals and a musical smorgasbord that has something for everyone – from Hungarian heavy metal to Estonian popera. The event is the ultimate showcase of inclusivity, musical ersity and fun – fans come from all over the world to support their home country or their European favourites. Here’s what we learned from this year’s contest:1 Politics is out, but statement songs are inPolitical songs are frowned upon in Eurovision – Ukrainian 2016 winner Jamala’s lament on the 1944 Soviet Union deportation of Crimean Tatars raised a few eyebrows, particularly in Russia, at a time of heightened tension between the two countries. But that doesn’t mean you can’t make a statement through song. France’s entry Mercy tells the true story of a baby born last year on a ship rescuing migrants from the Mediterranean, while Netta from Israel reignited Girl Power for the #MeToo generation with her song Toy. The biggest surprise and delight was Ireland, whose entry played out a charming gay love story through dance – something which shouldn’t be a statement, but arguably is while LGBT+ rights are still far from assured in a number of Eurovision nations.2 Don’t mess with the European Broadcasting UnionTalking of Ireland, this year the organisers of Eurovision terminated its contract with Chinese broadcaster Mango TV after the nation opted not to broadcast the Irish performance from the first semi-final – showing a gay relationship contravenes Chinese censorship rules. Mango TV also censored the Albanian performance because their performer Eugent Bushpepa had visible tattoos. The EBU stated that censoring content “is not in line with the EBU’s values of universality and inclusivity and our proud tradition of celebrating ersity through music”. Ireland’s entry Ryan O’Shaughnessy approved: “I think it’s a really important decision by the EBU, they haven’t taken it lightly, and I think it’s a move in the right direction. I’m happy about it.” Well played, EBU. 3 Props are the new pixelsIn recent years the LED backdrop has played a big part in Eurovision staging, with increasingly sophisticated graphics bringing a new dimension to performances. Think Måns Zelmerlow’s stickman graphics from his winning song Heroes in 2015, or Sergey Lazarev’s 3D cityscape from 2016. This year Portugal decided to remove the pixel mesh from the stage, prompting participating countries to rethink how they were going to make a splash. Inevitably this resulted in massive props, including a giant pianocoffin from Ukraine, a vast light-up dress for Estonia and a spinning knife-throwing board for Finland. Best of all was Moldova’s Ikea wardrobes, setting the scene for a physical comedy performance that could never have played out in tiny pixels. More of this please.4 Real music is all musicWhen Salvador Sobral won Eurovision last year, he made a victory speech that railed against “disposable, fast-food music without any content”, calling his win “a victory for people who make music that actually means something”. He added: “Music is not fireworks, music is feeling so let’s try to change this and bring music back, which is really what matters.” This year’s Eurovision is a reminder that what constitutes meaning in music is unique to every listener, whether it’s Swedish pop, Hungarian rock, Irish balladeering or quirky sampling from Israel that’s unlike anything we’ve heard before. Eurovision is a variety box of fabulous fireworks, Salvador – it’s ALL real music, and it’s what makes Eurovision so wonderful. The favourite for this year’s Eurovision has been chopping and changing for weeks, and at the start of the evening it was the most open Grand Final in years – any one of six or seven acts could have taken the winner’s trophy. But in the end it was Israel’s Netta who raised the trophy for her Girl Power anthem Toy, with bonus chicken noises, Bjork-esque styling and lyrics like “I’m taking my Pikachu home”. The voting showed the huge disparity between what the juries loved (Austrian and German ballads, mostly), and what the public wanted to win (Cyprus’s Beyonce-style pop banger and Italy’s duet about the effects of war and terrorism). Netta’s win was loved by both – a triumph for something entirely different, which is exactly what Eurovision is all about. Tel Aviv 2019, anyone?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74795350f220fb5a572cb2e63a1de32520ff6192/0_202_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc27dde47fd4946582cbd6de0d5a85f0","title":"saturday night live amy schumer middle aged lesbian sketch mothers day","story":"The cast brought their moms on and did their best to make funny after a quiet week in Trumpworld. It didn’t really workAidy Bryant’s mom, Georgeanne, has joined her onstage. Usually, Bryant says, the cold open is about politics, which is “isive”. Tonight, they’re here to talk about something “we all can celebrate together – moms”.Kenan Thompson’s mom is here too. “You like the show, right Mom?” he says. “We do,” she says, “except for all of the political stuff. We get it.”“Remember when I was in that production of The Crucible in high school?” Mikey Day says to his mother. “Yeah,” she says, “you know The Crucible is a lot like the witch hunt against President Trump.”“I don’t understand why everyone focuses on Trump at all, when you should be focused on Jesus,” says Chris Redd’s mom. “Jesus isn’t president, Mom,” he says. “And that’s the problem,” she replies.“I think Alec Baldwin does a great Trump impression,” says Colin Jost’s mom, “but why does it have to be so mean? Who writes that stuff?”“Yeah, I don’t know,” says Jost. “I guess it’s Michael Che.”Live from New York, the moms and their offspring announce, it’s Saturday night. Your host: Amy Schumer.“Some of you may have heard I got married this year,” she says, “so it’s in lockdown … I’m a little sad, I’m never going to get a ‘U up?’ text again.“The way that my now-husband proposed was so worthless, it was the morning, I was still asleep, he threw the box at me and said, ‘I got you this.’ But that’s a realistic proposal.’She jokes about weddings and periods. She’s a woman, after all! Then she turns to feminism. “Ladies, remember how we were raised with the illusion of equality. Wasn’t that funny?”First sketch: it’s a game show. Mother Knows Best. Schumer is the host, “a YouTube sketch comedian and a serious, genuine singer”, and Day and Kate McKinnon are a teenage son and mother with strong incest vibes.Hulu’s all-new spin-off show: Handmaids in the City, brought to you by the producers of Sex in the City and Margaret Atwood. Schumer as Offred is having breakfast with her pals Cecily Strong and Bryant in what looks like a prison cafeteria. “It’s a show critics are calling ‘so brutal’ and ‘more uplifting than the news’.”“As I was getting tased I was shocked at my lack of rights in this new world, but amazed by how stunning I look in red,” Schumer says, as a guard shoves a taser in her back.Next: Schumer as a mom telling her child his birth story, “the best day of my life”. “I had a big smile on my face the whole time,” she says, before they cut to her screaming in bed while her husband, Day, screams alongside her in scrubs.Thompson and Leslie Jones are soul-singing hosts of Gospel Brunch. Strong is a chef who is making teriyaki chicken wings. “Let’s praise them together!” says Thompson. “Oh, I would,” Jones says, “but I’m an atheist.” Redd sweeps her off with a broom. The next chef is played by Schumer in a brown long-bob wig, in the style of Paula Deen. “A great way to eat healthy is a smoothie,” she says, “if it’s through a straw it’s healthy and that’s a fact … you just blend up some ice, some low-fat milk, banana, cinnamon, and a whole pecan pie.“You’ve got more healthy tips,” says Jones, “but first we’re going to take a moment to remember the friends who’ve passed from heart disease.”Kacey Musgraves is the musical guest, and she sings High Horse under a glittering saddle dangling from the ceiling. I’m curious about the saddle: is it bespoke? Does she travel with it or was it made especially for this moment? Would it be appropriate for using to ride an actual high horse or is it made out of paper mache?Weekend Update! It’s been an OK week for Trump. “I don’t like when Trump is this quiet,” says Michael Che, “it’s like when I’m babysitting my nephew and he’s been quiet for too long.”“It’s really funny to me that all these companies were paying Michael Cohen for intelligence,” says Jost, “he’s like the word ‘durrrr’ became a person.”“Trump is undoing so much of Obama’s work that Obama’s going to start fading away in pictures like in Back to the Future,” says Che.They turn to Melania Trump’s new initiative, Be Best. “As in, ‘it would be best if you got a orce,’” says Che.Heidi Gardner joins them as a teen YouTube movie critic who twirls her hair a lot. “I guess I thought the new Jurassic Park was … fake?’ she says. “All of a sudden dinosaurs are back? That would never happen.”“OK,” she says, “I guess I’ll just shut up.”She doesn’t, it goes on for a while, but it’s not very funny.“Police at Yale University interrogated a black student when she was reported by a white student for sleeping in the common room … so if you’re a black student at Yale, stay woke,” says Che.Melissa McCarthy interrupts the next story in a “World’s Proudest Step-Mom” sweatshirt: she’s bringing Che a Claritin because she thinks his voice is “froggy”. “You may not have grown in my tummy,” she says, “but I love putting you around my tummy,” she says, pointing to the photo of Che on her sweatshirt. “Just keep going … I can’t wait to laugh!”Wake Up Denver: Beck Bennett is the host and Strong is reporting from the field, which is a production of L’il Rent, an “abridged, family-friendly version of the hit musical”. How is it child-appropriate? “HIV-AIDs is changed to diabetes,” director Day explains. “I used the ‘find and replace’ function in Microsoft Word and changed HIV-AIDs to diabetes.”Schumer is a “fiercely conservative” child – kneeling behind a wall like a muppet. He character “got diabetes from sharing an infected heroin needle … I learned some Spanish to play Mimi because she only speaks Spanish and I only speak white.”Musgraves returns for her second song, Slow Burn. The saddle is gone and I miss it, but it’s a nice song.Last call in an Irish bar: Schumer and McKinnon are two middle-aged lesbians holding it up. “You’ve scared all the men away,” Thompson, the bartender, says. Schumer and McKinnon start to flirt and it escalates until they gargle Purell and lick each others faces while Thompson tries to make himself disappear. It’s quite cruel. Is it OK to be this mean and unfunny about middle-aged lesbians? I’m not sure it is.And finally: a high school graduation in the style of a professional wrestling trailer. “Watch your principal confidently mispronounce that Indian kid’s name!” Secrets will be revealed, like when you realize the goth kid’s parents “are … like … normal?”And that’s it! All the moms returns to clap and hug it out and Schumer says “this is the best time in the world”, which I guess maybe it was for her because she didn’t have to watch the Irish bar sketch. Happy Mother’s Day!

Americans could also help, he said, with investment in infrastructure and agriculture to help feed the North Korean people.Appearing on CBS’s Face the Nation, Pompeo floated the possibility of “sanctions relief”, a remark that jarred a little with a comment by Donald Trump’s national security adviser. John Bolton told CNN’s State of the Union: “I wouldn’t look for economic aid from us.”Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina senator, said private investment or sanctions relief for the North would “be the best money we ever spent”. Graham, a member of the Senate armed services committee, told CBS “there’d be a lot of support in Congress to give North Korea a better life. Provide aid, relieve sanctions with one condition: that you give up your nuclear weapons program in a verifiable way.”He also said “the average North Korean is about three inches shorter than … their neighbours in South Korea because of the terrible conditions in North Korea”. Studies have concluded that such a height difference does indeed exist.Pompeo met Kim last week in North Korea, for the second time, helping set the stage for the summit and securing the release of three Americans held in the country. He then travelled to South Korea. Asked if the US was in effect telling Kim “regime change will be off the table” if he meets American demands, Pompeo told Fox: “We will have to provide security assurances, to be sure.”The North has said it needs nuclear weapons to counter a US effort to strangle its economy and overthrow the Kim government. “Make no mistake about it, America’s interest here is preventing the risk that North Korea will launch a nuclear weapon into LA or Denver or to the very place we’re sitting here this morning,” Pompeo said, from Washington. “That’s our objective, that’s the end state the president has laid out and that’s the mission that he sent me on this past week, to put us on the trajectory to go achieve that.”Trump hailed progress with North Korea on Twitter on Saturday, writing: “North Korea has announced that they will dismantle Nuclear Test Site this month, ahead of the big Summit Meeting on June 12th. Thank you, a very smart and gracious gesture!” Pompeo told Fox the North’s promise to destroy the site was “good news. Every single site that the North Koreans have that can inflict risk upon the American people that is destroyed, eliminated, dismantled is good news for the American people and for the world.”The secretary rejected suggestions that Trump’s praise of Kim and claims of success have been made too soon.“The president can have a successful outcome,” Pompeo said, “that the two of them can meet and see if there is sufficient overlap so that we can achieve the ultimate objective for the American people.”Pompeo was asked if in his talks with Kim he had discussed his previous exchange of insults with Trump, in which the US president coined the nickname “Little Rocket Man” for a leader who in return called him a “mentally deranged US dotard”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/967b90df7cb3df01524aa736319714829321f90d/0_0_3947_2368/master/3947.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e539510c67ca164d9d7e2dadc826ff56","title":"pro independence candidate set to become next catalan president","story":"Quim Torra is expected to win second round of votes, giving Catalonia the new government required to end direct rule from MadridCatalan politicians have cleared the way for a pro-independence candidate to be elected regional president and end the emergency direct rule imposed by Madrid during last year’s political crisis.The far-left pro-independence Popular Unity Candidacy (CUP) party said it would abstain from an investiture vote in the regional parliament on Monday.The absence of its votes will leave pro-independence candidate Quim Torra with the simple majority needed to be elected regional president. “The CUP will not block the formation of a new government,” a statement by the party said.The formation of a new regional government is required for Spain to lift the state of direct rule.The Catalan regional assembly failed to elect Torra in an initial vote on Saturday, but at the second round scheduled for Monday, only a simple majority will be required, so he is expected to win.He was handpicked as a candidate by deposed Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont, currently in exile in Germany and facing jail on rebellion charges for last year’s secession bid if he returns to Spain.Torra, 55, gave a combative speech during Saturday’s debate. He told parliament he was “working tirelessly for the Catalan republic” and signalled that the secession crisis is far from over, even if Catalonia does finally get a government.Separatist leaders declared Catalonia independent last October after an outlawed independence referendum. That prompted Madrid to impose direct rule and led to months of political limbo.Torra lambasted European institutions for their “unacceptable silence” over the Catalan crisis. He added he was ready to talk “without conditions” with the government of Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy.Both the Spanish government and the courts have declared the secession illegal and vowed to block it. Rajoy said that constitutional direct rule “could be used again if necessary,” if the next regional leadership did not respect the law.Catalonia is Spain’s richest and most populous region. It has its own distinct language and cultural traditions. Calls have increased in recent years for it to have more control over its finances, with some demanding outright independence.Last year’s secession attempt plunged Spain into its biggest political crisis in decades.Spain’s constitutional court strikes down parts of a 2006 charter on Catalan autonomy that had originally increased the region’s fiscal and judicial powers and described it as a “nation”. The court rules that using the word “nation” has no legal value and also rejects the “preferential” use of Catalan over Spanish in municipal services. Almost two weeks later, hundreds of thousands protest on the streets of Barcelona, chanting “We are a nation! We decide!”At the height of Spain’s economic crisis, more than a million people protest in Barcelona on Catalonia’s national day, demanding independence in what will become a peaceful, annual show of strength.Carles Puigdemont, who has replaced Mas as regional president, announces an independence referendum will be held on 1 October. Spain’s central government says it will block the referendum using all the legal and political means at its disposal.The Catalan parliament approves referendum legislation after a heated, 11-hour session that sees 52 opposition MPs walk out of the chamber in Barcelona in protest at the move. Spain’s constitutional court suspends the legislation the following day, but the Catalan government vows to press ahead with the vote.Police arrest 14 Catalan government officials suspected of organising the referendum and announce they have seized nearly 10 million ballots destined for the vote. Some 40,000 people protest against the police crackdown in Barcelona and Puigdemont accuses the Spanish government of effectively suspending regional autonomy and declaring a de facto state of emergency.Spanish government takes control of\u0026nbspCatalonia\u0026nbspand dissolves its parliament after secessionist Catalan MPs voted to establish an independent republic. Spanish prime minister,\u0026nbspMariano Rajoy, fires regional president, Carles Puigdemont, and orders regional elections to be held on 21 December.Regional elections were held in December, which separatist parties won, but every leadership candidate picked by the separatist camp since has fallen flat.Torra faces isions within the separatist camp, composed of the CUP, the Catalan Republican Left (ERC) party and Puigdemont’s Together for Catalonia grouping, according to Antonio Barroso, deputy research director at Teneo Intelligence.Barroso says the ERC wants a moderate approach to avoid a Madrid clampdown and prefers a longer independence game.“In contrast, Puigdemont’s strategy is to continue using every opportunity... to continue challenging the Spanish authorities and keep the secessionist momentum alive.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/592fd787b3ff54aa51039b42cf05adfbae7dd0e7/0_139_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4919441eedcfc01c3e50aed19c07734","title":"two britons held hostage in democratic republic of congo freed","story":"Boris Johnson pays tribute to DRC authorities after release of pair who went missing in Virunga national parkTwo British men and a local driver who were taken hostage on Friday in one of the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s national parks have been released.The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, paid tribute to the DRC authorities and the Congolese Institute for Nature Conservation for their help in securing the release.A park ranger, Rachel Makissa Baraka, who was travelling with the pair, was fatally injured when the men and their Congolese driver were seized during a visit to the Virunga national park, a renowned gorilla sanctuary in the east of the African country.A number of kidnappings have taken place during the past six weeks in the park, which is home to about one-quarter of the world’s remaining mountain gorillas. They come against the backdrop of rising violence across the province of North Kivu.Johnson said: “I am delighted to announce that two British nationals who were held hostage in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have been released. I pay tribute to the DRC authorities and the Congolese Institute for Nature Conservation for their tireless help during this terrible case.“My thoughts are now with the family of Virunga Park ranger Rachel Makissa Baraka, who was killed during the kidnapping, and with the injured driver and the released British nationals as they recover from this traumatic incident.”A statement issued by the park authorities said the men and their driver were receiving support and medical attention.The park’s director, Emmanuel de Merode, said: “We are deeply saddened by the death of Virunga national park ranger Baraka, whose life was tragically cut short whilst protecting the passengers and driver. We wish to extend our deepest condolences to her family and our sincerest gratitude for her bravery and service to Congo.”Baraka, who was one of the park’s 26 female rangers, died in hospital from injuries sustained on Friday. Eight rangers have died in Virunga since the start of the year, according to the park authorities.No further details were provided about the circumstances in which the men were released. Congolese soldiers and park rangers have been conducting an operation to locate them after unidentified armed men ambushed the group on Friday morning north of Goma, the capital of DRC’s North Kivu province.The Foreign Office advises against all but essential travel to the cities of Goma. The advice adds: “Opportunities for gorilla trekking in the Virunga national park in North Kivu are limited, and armed groups are sometimes active within the park.”Eastern Congo has been the scene of successive waves of violence in the past two-and-a-half decades and was at the epicentre of two wars between 1996 and 2003.Rebel groups and militias still control large swathes of the territory. More than 175 rangers have died protecting Virunga national park, which is located in the rugged mountains and volcanic plains adjacent to neighbouring Rwanda and Uganda.

Irish support for her “customs partnership” proposal will be forthcoming only if she faces down the hard Brexiteers in her cabinet. Photograph: Tolga Akmentolga AkmenAFPGetty ImagesThe Government expects British prime minister Theresa May to push ahead with proposals for a new “customs partnership” which it believes could pave the way for a soft Brexit, and which Dublin will support at next month’s European Union summit.The  understands the British government has told Dublin about the proposals, and the Government is likely to back Ms May at the summit.However, Irish support will be forthcoming only if Ms May faces down the hard Brexiteers in her cabinet and her government shows progress on a common understanding of the border “backstop”, the commitment to maintain an open border even without agreement.Downing Street has told Dublin it has problems with the backstop, but that Ms May’s proposals on a customs partnership would lessen the importance of the arrangement.Government sources agree that the potency of the backstop would be decreased and that it would become “less important” for Ms May if she put forward a customs proposal. It would make it “less offensive” to the DUP, which supports Ms May’s government.While further work would be needed on any customs proposal – even if Ms May gets it through her cabinet – it would “point to a direction of travel” from the UK government of where it wants to go, say sources. It would not be “a solution in itself”.The proposal would see British officials collect tariffs on behalf of the EU for any goods coming to the UK that were subsequently destined for an EU member state. The EU has already rejected this model, and a willingness to look afresh – even if it only “provides the basis” for future talks, according to one source – will be seen as a softening of the Irish and EU position. Earlier this week, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said of Ms May’s customs proposal: “The view of the EU is that it isn’t workable in its current form but it is something that perhaps we could make workable.”The backstop – which would ensure no ergence in customs and trade rules between the Republic and Northern Ireland without agreed solutions on how to avoid a hard border – was agreed in principle in December, although the UK has rejected the EU’s legal interpretation of it.However, in tandem with the customs proposal, the British government must “at a minimum” table its own interpretation of the backstop in the weeks before the June summit.It was further argued that the tabling of a customs proposal would make it easier for the backstop to “go green” – be agreed – and this would “leave space for the legal experts” to iron out the details over the summer.In effect, the mooted move would mean the EU taking Ms May’s proposal seriously in order to help her agree to the backstop. Senior Government figures believe the DUP’s priority is now that the North should be treated no differently to the rest of Britain, even if this means staying in a UK-wide customs partnership which would replicate many of the features of the customs union.DUP leader Arlene Foster has said Northern Ireland must move in “lockstep” with the rest of the UK.Although Ms May has said she could not accept the EU’s interpretation of the backstop, the Government is adamant the fallback option must be included in any Brexit deal. “We still need the backstop,” said a senior Government source."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3490565.1526048208!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit and ireland the border is a sideshow if you re an eel","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAttempts to conserve the Irish branch of the European eel have been complicated by BrexitThe autumn spawning migration of the European eel (s. Anguilla anguilla) to the Sargasso Sea is one of the great animal migrations.It is an arduous 6,500km journey from Europe’s inland waterways for the seriously endangered species which is threatened by historic overfishing and the degradation and loss of its habitats due to land reclamation, the construction of dams and reductions in water quality.And now attempts to conserve the Irish branch of the family have been, at the very least, complicated by, of all things, Brexit, their fate tied to the prospects for maintaining a frictionless border between North and South on the Erne river at Ballyshannon.The decline of eel stocks in Lough Erne, where commercial fishing has been halted, has been attributed in part to the attrition of both elvers entering the river from the Atlantic and of developed silver eels descending from Lough Erne through the turbines of the ESB hydroelectric power station.The EU requires member states to develop eel management plans and to take measures to ensure that at least 40 per cent of adult eels can escape from inland waters to the sea where they spawn. On the Erne that has meant the seasonal deployment of lorries with aerated water tanks to transport trapped live eels around the turbines.The protection of the eel is just one of 142 areas of North-South co-operation that are underpinned by joint obligations to EU regulations and to the Belfast Agreement, and which form a key part of the Irish strand of the Brexit discussions.They are a measure of the complex interdependence of both the cross-Border relationship and the scale and scope of the talks process.For the most part there is no question of the UK wishing to repudiate any of programmes that range from environmental projects to cross-Border hospitals, but EU negotiators and their UK counterparts have to work on legal language to copperfasten their post-Brexit future.The eels – provisions for safeguarding the EU’s management plan and regulating the cross-Border transport of live animals – will have their special place in Annex 2.8 of the Irish protocol to the Brexit orce deal, the Withdrawal Agreement, currently being discussed by the two sides.Discussions about the controversial Border “backstop” – an agreement would fully align Northern Ireland with the rules of the EU to avoid a hard border – have tended to catch the headlines and eclipse what can seem the more humdrum but nevertheless vital issues.As the protocol makes clear, however, the range and detail of the discussions is huge – as well as ensuring free trade in goods, the protocol says it shall also “be implemented and applied so as to maintain the necessary conditions for continued North-South co-operation, including in the areas of environment, health, agriculture, transport, education and tourism, as well as energy, telecommunications, broadcasting, inland fisheries, justice and security, higher education and sport”.Guaranteeing many of these, Irish officials stress, is also dependent on unhindered movement across the Border – the necessity for a Border deal permeates the entire protocol.It also contains provisions to safeguard the Common Travel Area between the Republic of Ireland and the UK, for joint citizenship provisions for Northern Ireland, and to “respect the constitutional status of Northern Ireland and the principle of consent”.It requires the UK to guarantee that there is “no diminution of rights” caused by its departure from the EU, including in the area of protection against forms of discrimination enshrined in EU law.The Irish protocol currently runs to eight pages of the 129-page Withdrawal Agreement, which is now being turned into legal treaty language.The challenge EU leaders have set themselves is to complete broad agreement on the treaty text by June, so that it can be finalised by October and then be put to member states and the European Parliament for ratification ahead of the UK’s departure at the end of March, 2019.The Withdrawal Agreement contains the agreement on transition, or the “implementation period” as the UK calls it, and, like the rest of the text, it stands or falls on agreement on the whole package, including the Irish protocol.The important parallel discussions now under way on the “future relationship” between the EU and UK, essentially the future trading relationship, are also conditional on no “backsliding” on the agreements made in December in the “Joint Report” between the EU and UK which is reflected in the Withdrawal Agreement.Brussels and Dublin are adamant that unless the UK honours its commitment to the “backstop” provision of that December agreement, the future relationship talks will stop and the Withdrawal Agreement and the transition deal will be put in jeopardy.Those talks are set to produce a political outline of a future trading relationship which will be approved with the Withdrawal Agreement, although not having the same legal standing. A trade treaty can be agreed only once the UK is no longer an EU member-state.The Withdrawal Agreement text is colour-coded to reflect different stages of agreement – currently 15 per cent of the protocol is in green, effectively agreed, 37 per cent remains in yellow, on which there is political agreement on objectives but not on drafting, and 47 per cent is white or uncoloured, unagreed. There is much still to do.Most of the protocol white text reflects how the EU sees the operation of the “backstop” arrangement – the Border fallback guarantee should the UK prove unable to come up with and agree with the EU-preferred scenario for preventing a hard border.The Withdrawal Agreement text on safeguarding human rights post-Brexit remains in yellow – the UK is understood to accept in principle that there should be “no diminution of rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity” in the North. However, the language proposed by the commission remains problematic, and the full enumeration of such rights in the annex to the treaty protocol has yet to be agreed.The range of these rights goes well beyond the issues of discrimination, equality and identity that are traditionally seen as central to the conflict – gender rights legislation, for example, or carers’ rights, or family law arrangements, including custody and maintenance issues, may have their roots in EU legislation.Although most of such regulations will be incorporated automatically into UK law by means of the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill, campaigners in the North worry over the abandonment by the UK of obligations under the EU’s Charter of Fundamental Rights.“The EU Charter acts as an important constitutional safeguard underpinning human rights protections in Northern Ireland and its removal weakens the quality and range of human rights protections available here,” the Northern Ireland Human Rights Consortium warns.The EU’s protocol text proposes that “The United Kingdom shall continue to facilitate the related work of the institutions and bodies set up pursuant to the 1998 Agreement, including the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland and the Joint Committee of representatives of the Human Rights Commissions of Northern Ireland and Ireland, in upholding human rights and equality standards.”Irish officials are said to be concerned at the lack of specific commitments to ringfence such funding.Other non-Border issues such as UK adherence to EU “state aid” rules – to prevent unfair competition through state subsidies – and the challenge of customs-free “transit” for Irish lorries and goods across the UK to EU markets also remain unagreed.Although not mentioned in the Irish protocol, and in theory an issue for the post-Brexit future relationship talks, because it is an issue of specific concern to Ireland and not other member-states, Irish officials are keen to see the issue taken up in the Irish talks strand.The UK signalled as far back as last August that it is willing to sign up to membership of the Common Transit Convention to facilitate the transit trade in both directions, and there are precedents using seals on lorries. But there are concerns at how the Irish lorries will be able to bypass potentially long customs queues at ports such as Dover. Transit across Northern Ireland will also require maintaining harmonised transport regulations such as recognition of hauliers’ licences.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"national geographic travel photographer year 2018 pictures","story":"The competition continues in the 2018 National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year contest!

The helicopter will have twin, counter-rotating blades which will power through the thin Martian atmosphere at almost 3,000 rpm – about 10 times the rate of a helicopter on Earth.The helicopter has solar cells to charge its lithium-ion batteries, and a heating mechanism to keep it warm through the cold Martian nights.“The altitude record for a helicopter flying here on Earth is about 40,000 feet. The atmosphere of Mars is only one per cent that of Earth, so when our helicopter is on the Martian surface, it’s already at the Earth equivalent of 100,000 feet up,” said Mimi Aung, Mars Helicopter project manager.“To make it fly at that low atmospheric density, we had to scrutinize everything, make it as light as possible while being as strong and as powerful as it can possibly be.”Controllers on Earth will command the Mars Helicopter, through a system of commands send from the ground, rather than a real-time joystick.The full 30-day flight test campaign will include up to five flights of incrementally farther flight distances, up to a few hundred meters, and longer durations as long as 90 seconds. On its first flight, the helicopter will make a short vertical climb to 10 feet, where it will hover for about 30 seconds.Please review our commenting policyPregnant women who drink three cups of tea a day raise risk of overweight children, study findsBattered vase destined for charity shop sells for £87,000John Bolton says sanctions \u0026#39possible\u0026#39 for European companies operating in IranPoisoned darts, blowguns and the \u0026#39canine KGB death squads\u0026#39 cleaning up Russian cities ahead of the World CupWelsh farmer helping to fight Alzheimer\u0026#39s by growing high-altitude daffodils to combat diseaseComment: Israel at 70 is a better and less corrupt place than almost all of Britain\u0026#39s former coloniesLabour candidate for Lewisham East by-election withdraws as it emerges she compared Israel-Palestine conflict to \u0026#39Nazi persecution\u0026#39Former colleagues react to Dame Tessa Jowell\u0026#39s deathWomen should test wine at dinner as they have better palates, study showsIsrael destroys Gaza tunnel as US prepares to open Jerusalem embassyRailway crossing gate drops on signalman and breaks his neck as Network Rail convicted of safety failingsMeghan Markle profile: The actress, blogger, yoga-lover - and breath of fresh air for the British Royal family How to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding on TV next weekRoyal wedding schedule and timings for the marriage of Harry and MeghanRoyal wedding 2018: All the details, timings and latest newsOn this day in 1373: A dying nun sees a vision of Christ as a mother – and becomes English\u0026#39s first female authorBooming economy and foreign policy win fueling surge in Donald Trump\u0026#39s popularity ahead of midterm electionsDrivers who attend speed awareness courses significantly less likely to reoffend, study findsDame Tessa Jowell died in the arms of her husband and children, her daughter-in-law revealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"battered vase destined charity shop sells 87000","story":"The vase (left) and Anne Beck receiving the good newsA battered vase which was on its way to a charity shop has sold at auction for close to £90,000.Grandmother Anne Beck always considered the chipped old china vase too damaged to display in her Eastbourne home.She inherited the foot-tall oriental decoration from her grandfather, an antique restorer, but neither he nor she ever repaired it, and Mrs Beck, 83, kept it in her garage for 11 years.Eventually she loaded it into her car to take to a charity shop, but on her way dropped in to an auctioneer’s valuation day to show off some glass fingerbowls, and mentioned the vase in passing.An expert at the Eastbourne Auctions house, in East Sussex, convinced her to add it to last week’s sale. It was advertised online with an estimated sale price of between £90 and £120.The vase would have been worth up to £500m if it were undamagedBut knowledgeable bidders spotted the true value of the item and drove the price up to £70,000. Including fees the German-based Chinese buyer paid £87,000 for the vase.Had it been undamaged experts estimate it might have been worth between £250m and £500m.The yellow floral vase has since been confirmed to date to the 18th century and was made for Chinese emperor Qinglong .It depicts a scene from Chinese mythology in which a deity receives birthday gifts.Mrs Beck said: After I consigned it for auction I thought that £100 would be nice.So I was absolutely amazed when I found out what it sold for. I couldn\u0027t quite believe it.I had a sit down and a cup of coffee afterwards but am still in a bit of a daze now.Mrs Beck, a widow, said she intends to spend some of the money on her two children and four grandchildren.Jeanette May of Eastbourne Auctions said: The vendor came in with these glass finger bowls and said she had a broken vase in the back of her car that she was taking to a charity shop.Our assistant went out and saw it rattling around on the back seat and said \u0027oh that\u0027s nice.\u0027 He knew it was good but didn\u0027t realise just how good.We are chuffed to bits for our client.”Please review our commenting policyPregnant women who drink three cups of tea a day raise risk of overweight children, study findsJohn Bolton says sanctions \u0026#39possible\u0026#39 for European companies operating in IranPoisoned darts, blowguns and the \u0026#39canine KGB death squads\u0026#39 cleaning up Russian cities ahead of the World CupWelsh farmer helping to fight Alzheimer\u0026#39s by growing high-altitude daffodils to combat diseaseComment: Israel at 70 is a better and less corrupt place than almost all of Britain\u0026#39s former coloniesLabour candidate for Lewisham East by-election withdraws as it emerges she compared Israel-Palestine conflict to \u0026#39Nazi persecution\u0026#39Former colleagues react to Dame Tessa Jowell\u0026#39s deathWomen should test wine at dinner as they have better palates, study showsIsrael destroys Gaza tunnel as US prepares to open Jerusalem embassyRailway crossing gate drops on signalman and breaks his neck as Network Rail convicted of safety failingsMeghan Markle profile: The actress, blogger, yoga-lover -

We are proud to have now introduced same sex marriage.We will consult before making changes to the law around civil partnerships. The policy paper published this week will inform and shape a future consultation on civil partnerships.Pregnant women who drink three cups of tea a day raise risk of overweight children, study findsBattered vase destined for charity shop sells for £87,000John Bolton says sanctions \u0026#39possible\u0026#39 for European companies operating in IranPoisoned darts, blowguns and the \u0026#39canine KGB death squads\u0026#39 cleaning up Russian cities ahead of the World CupWelsh farmer helping to fight Alzheimer\u0026#39s by growing high-altitude daffodils to combat diseaseComment: Israel at 70 is a better and less corrupt place than almost all of Britain\u0026#39s former coloniesLabour candidate for Lewisham East by-election withdraws as it emerges she compared Israel-Palestine conflict to \u0026#39Nazi persecution\u0026#39Former colleagues react to Dame Tessa Jowell\u0026#39s deathWomen should test wine at dinner as they have better palates, study showsIsrael destroys Gaza tunnel as US prepares to open Jerusalem embassyRailway crossing gate drops on signalman and breaks his neck as Network Rail convicted of safety failingsMeghan Markle profile: The actress, blogger, yoga-lover - and breath of fresh air for the British Royal family How to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding on TV next weekRoyal wedding schedule and timings for the marriage of Harry and MeghanRoyal wedding 2018: All the details, timings and latest newsOn this day in 1373: A dying nun sees a vision of Christ as a mother – and becomes English\u0026#39s first female authorBooming economy and foreign policy win fueling surge in Donald Trump\u0026#39s popularity ahead of midterm electionsDrivers who attend speed awareness courses significantly less likely to reoffend, study findsDame Tessa Jowell died in the arms of her husband and children, her daughter-in-law revealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"eurovision final","story":"Israel\u0027s Netta won Eurovision 2018, with her song Toy.

But everyone is in the dark as the powers-that-be have kept it hush-hush.An ITV News spokesperson said: “Tom’s off sick at the moment. Until his return, regular News at Ten presenters Julie Etchingham and Rageh Omaar will anchor the programme.”The news anchor was last seen in public at a charity lunch in London on March 6.He is understood to be recuperating in the £1m Hampshire home he shares with his wife Claudia, a jewellery designer.He is friendly with the Princes from his time as a Royal correspondent.In 2010 William chose Bradby to conduct his engagement interview and invited him to the wedding the following year. Health permitting he is expected to be a guest at Prince Harry’s wedding this weekend.Battered vase destined for charity shop sells for £87,000John Bolton says sanctions \u0026#39possible\u0026#39 for European companies operating in IranPoisoned darts, blowguns and the \u0026#39canine KGB death squads\u0026#39 cleaning up Russian cities ahead of the World CupWelsh farmer helping to fight Alzheimer\u0026#39s by growing high-altitude daffodils to combat diseaseComment: Israel at 70 is a better and less corrupt place than almost all of Britain\u0026#39s former coloniesLabour candidate for Lewisham East by-election withdraws as it emerges she compared Israel-Palestine conflict to \u0026#39Nazi persecution\u0026#39Former colleagues react to Dame Tessa Jowell\u0026#39s deathWomen should test wine at dinner as they have better palates, study showsIsrael destroys Gaza tunnel as US prepares to open Jerusalem embassyRailway crossing gate drops on signalman and breaks his neck as Network Rail convicted of safety failingsMeghan Markle profile: The actress, blogger, yoga-lover - and breath of fresh air for the British Royal family How to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding on TV next weekRoyal wedding schedule and timings for the marriage of Harry and MeghanRoyal wedding 2018: All the details, timings and latest newsOn this day in 1373: A dying nun sees a vision of Christ as a mother – and becomes English\u0026#39s first female authorBooming economy and foreign policy win fueling surge in Donald Trump\u0026#39s popularity ahead of midterm electionsDrivers who attend speed awareness courses significantly less likely to reoffend, study findsDame Tessa Jowell died in the arms of her husband and children, her daughter-in-law revealsCivil partnerships could be scrapped as numbers plummet following gay marriage law We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/11/TELEMMGLPICT000163054614_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"john bolton says sanctions possible european companies operating","story":"Protesters in Iran burn a US flag after Donald Trump\u0026#39s decision to withdraw from the nuclear dealJohn Bolton, Donald Trump’s hawkish National Security Adviser, on Sunday warned European companies they would face sanctions if they continued working in Iran, raising the prospect of a transatlantic rift over how to handle Tehran.However, at the same time, Mike Pompeo, the Secretary of State, said he was hopeful Washington could still strike a new nuclear deal with Europe.The erging tones suggest splits within the administration about how to work with the international community in reining in Iran’s military and territorial ambitions.For its part, Iran at the weekend launched a diplomatic effort to keep the deal alive.President Hassan Rouhani said: “If the remaining five countries continue to abide by the agreement, Iran will remain in the deal despite the will of America.”The US decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal last week has angered European leaders, risking a transatlantic rift as they consider protecting companies against American sanctions.Mr Bolton said sanctions on European companies were “possible”.“I think the Europeans will see that it\u0027s in their interest ultimately to come along with us,” he told CNN.But speaking on Fox News Sunday, Mr Pompeo offered more conciliatory language and insisted the decision to withdraw had not been aimed at the UK or the European Union.“I\u0027m hopeful in the days and weeks ahead we can come up with a deal that really works, that really protects the world from Iranian bad behaviour, not just their nuclear programme, but their missiles and their malign behaviour as well, he said.In announcing his decision to withdraw, Mr Trump was making good on a campaign promise. He and American officials have long expressed concern that the nuclear deal did nothing to stem Iranian missile tests or thwart its activities supporting militias or proxies throughout the Middle East.Javad Zarif in Beijing as he attempts to shore up what is left of the nuclear dealFor its part, Tehran has launched a diplomatic effort to keep the deal together. Javad Zarif, the foreign minister, has embarked on a tour of signatories aimed at persuading them to help protect Iran from US sanctions.After meeting his counterpart in Beijing, Mr Zarif said on Sunday: “We hope that with this visit to China and other countries we will be able to construct a clear future design for the comprehensive agreement.”Please review our commenting policyPregnant women who drink three cups of tea a day raise risk of overweight children, study findsBattered vase destined for charity shop sells for £87,000Poisoned darts, blowguns and the \u0026#39canine KGB death squads\u0026#39 cleaning up Russian cities ahead of the World CupWelsh farmer helping to fight Alzheimer\u0026#39s by growing high-altitude daffodils to combat diseaseComment: Israel at 70 is a better and less corrupt place than almost all of Britain\u0026#39s former coloniesLabour candidate for Lewisham East by-election withdraws as it emerges she compared Israel-Palestine conflict to \u0026#39Nazi persecution\u0026#39Former colleagues react to Dame Tessa Jowell\u0026#39s deathWomen should test wine at dinner as they have better palates, study showsIsrael destroys Gaza tunnel as US prepares to open Jerusalem embassyRailway crossing gate drops on signalman and breaks his neck as Network Rail convicted of safety failingsMeghan Markle profile: The actress, blogger, yoga-lover - and breath of fresh air for the British Royal family How to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding on TV next weekRoyal wedding schedule and timings for the marriage of Harry and MeghanRoyal wedding 2018: All the details, timings and latest newsOn this day in 1373: A dying nun sees a vision of Christ as a mother – and becomes English\u0026#39s first female authorBooming economy and foreign policy win fueling surge in Donald Trump\u0026#39s popularity ahead of midterm electionsDrivers who attend speed awareness courses significantly less likely to reoffend, study findsDame Tessa Jowell died in the arms of her husband and children, her daughter-in-law revealsCivil partnerships could be scrapped as numbers plummet following gay marriage law We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/11/TELEMMGLPICT000157926101_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqgSVLVhgSoU3NDLwRdi2g0XEPitS7tdTuwuKqeZBIh2o.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"royal wedding 2018 details timings latest news","story":"Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleThere\u0027s just over a week to go until the hotly anticipated Royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. It will be the most important day of their shared lives to date, imbued with centuries-old tradition as they take vows before God, their families and the Queen.But for the couple, it won\u0027t be a day of too much solemnity, as they promise a 2018 wedding focused on fun, joy and a chance to celebrate with the public.The Prince and his fiancee, who announced their engagement in November, are planning their own wedding celebration that “reflects the characters of the bride and groom”.Here\u0027s all the latest news.Days until the Royal WeddingThe wedding is next weekend - Saturday, May 19 - at St George’s Chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle, where Prince Harry was christened. It is said to have become a very special place for the couple in their relationship so far. The Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office at Buckingham Palace is responsible for organising royal weddings, but Harry and Ms Markle are leading the show. However, under the guidance of Harry\u0027s private secretary, Edward Lane Fox, the Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office is dealing with the ceremonial aspects of the day.The service will begin at 12pm.The core aspects of the wedding, including the church service, associated music, flowers, decorations and reception, will be paid for by the Royal Family, with Ms Markle’s parents both set to attend.Copy of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle: The story of their relationship, in picturesFormer Suits star Ms Markle told last year how she could not wait to say yes to the prince when Harry got down on one knee as they cooked a roast chicken dinner at his home, Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace.Indicating the depths of his feeling for his bride-to-be, the prince revealed in a television interview: It was this beautiful woman just sort of literally tripped and fell into my life, I fell into her life.Invitations have been posted to 600 lucky guests, with a select 200 close friends invited to an after party at Frogmore House, Windsor. The couple do not have an official list of political leaders on the guest list which means neither Prime Minister Theresa May or US President Donald Trump will be going, and former US President Barack Obama has also missed out. Royal sources said the guest list will be restricted to those who have a direct relationship with the couple, and was taken both because St George’s Chapel is relatively small, and because the prince is not in the direct line of succession.As well a dress code, the Royal guest list also reportedly includes \u0027critical guidance\u0027for the big day. The instructions ban cameras and bulky bags, adding that guests will be asked to surrender mobile telephones\u0085 and any devices used for image capture.They further specify that guests should not wear medals, in a list of suggestions about accessories that includes: No swords.Some members of the public have received an invitation to wait in the grounds outside the chapel to watch the bride and groom and their wedding guests arrive and leave.Read more about who they are here.Invitations for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s wedding in MayOther guests will include members of Ms Markle\u0027s family - her mother Doria Radlan and father Thomas Markle Snr - and of course many members of the royal family.Tennis star Serena Williams and Ms Markle\u0027s former Suits co-stars Sarah Rafferty, Patrick J Adams and Wendell Pierce could also be on the list.The invitations were produced by Barnard \u0026amp Westwood, which has held the Royal Warrant for Printing \u0026amp Bookbinding by Appointment to Her Majesty The Queen since 1985.Die-stamped in gold and then burnished, the invitation features The Three Feather Badge of The Prince of Wales. They also reveal that the dress code is Uniform, Morning Coat or Lounge Suit, or Day Dress with Hat.Prince William and Prince Harry in borrowed policemen outfitsThe Duke of Cambridge will be Harry\u0027s best man, missing the FA Cup final to be at his brother\u0027s side.The Duke, who has always been the front-runner for the supporting role at the May wedding, is honoured to have been asked, Kensington Palace said.Prince George and Princess Charlotte look almost certain to be page boy and flower girl. The siblings already know the score - they performed those roles at the wedding of Pippa Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s younger sister, to James Matthews in May last year.  Kensington Palace has announced that Ms Markle will have no adult bridesmaids \u0027because she\u0027s unable to choose between her friends\u0027, and will instead be surrounded by children as page boys, bridesmaids and flower girls.Jessica Mulroney and Meghan Markle in 2016Friends including Jessica Mulroney, Misha Noo Lindsay Roth, Benita Litt, Janina Gavankar and Priyanka Chopra are expected to be seen as part of the congregation.Bookmakers suspended betting on the designer of Ms Markle\u0027s wedding dress in March when British couture company Ralph \u0026amp Russo pulled ahead to become 13 favourites.The label, helmed by Australians Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo (a couple in real life) have shot to prominence after a string of celebrity endorsements.In 2014, Angelina Jolie wore the label to Buckingham Palace to receive an honorary damehood, in 2016 Gwyneth Paltrow to the Oscars. Add to that list of fans Beyonce, Rihanna and, finally, Meghan Markle herself, who chose a £56,000 embellished couture gown for the official photos taken to mark her engagement to Prince Harry.Before betting was suspended, London-based designer Erdem was at 31. Ms Markle\u0027s stylist and close friend Ms Mulroney runs a bridal store in Toronto was said to have helped the bride choose her gown.Read more about Ralph and Russo here.The couple will be making their vows at St George\u0027s Chapel, which last hosted a royal wedding in May 2008 when Peter Phillips - son of The Princess Royal - married Autumn Kelly. Prince Edward also wed Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, there in June 1999.  The traditional ceremony will be conducted by The Dean of Windsor, The Rt Revd. David Conner while the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will officiate as the couple make their marriage vows.Miss Markle, who was a UN women\u0027s advocate, is unlikely to opt to obey the prince. They will probably choose the Series One (1966) Book of Common Prayer ceremony, just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did, which allows the bride to drop obey him and serve him from the religious proceedings.Harry also has to decide whether to wear a wedding ring. William does not wear one.The regiments Prince Harry served with in Afghanistan will also have a “special place” during the ceremony. Household Cavalry troopers will line the staircase at St George\u0027s Chapel, while streets within the precincts of the castle will be lined by members of the Windsor Castle Guard from 1st Battalion Irish Guards, and by Armed Forces personnel from the Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving, which has the Prince as Commodore-in-Chief, and the Royal Marines, where he is Captain General.The 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, where Prince Harry served as an Apache Pilot in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, will also be represented, as well as The Royal Gurkha Rifles, his comrades in Afghanistan in 2007, and RAF Honington, where he is Honorary Air Commandant.Read more about St George\u0027s Chapel here.WATCH: How Diana, the in-laws and Prince Louis will fit into the Royal WeddingAfter the ceremony, among the first people to congratulate the couple will be some of the 2,640 charity workers, community champions and local school children who are being invited to watch the wedding from inside the walls of Windsor Castle. Then at 1pm, the newlyweds will then undertake a two mile tour of Windsor greeting well-wishers. They will leave Windsor Castle by carriage via Castle Hill, travelling along the High Street and through Windsor Town before returning along the Long Walk for their reception.Read more about the procession here.Following the carriage ride, the congregation will await the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall, for the first of two receptions.The first, more formal afternoon reception for some 600 guests, will be hosted by the Queen. The 180-ft long room, traditionally used for state banquets, seats up to 162 people and was redesigned in a modern Gothic style – with walls lined with suits of armour – following the fire at the castle in 1992.The second evening reception, for 200 close friends and family, will be thrown at Frogmore House by the Prince of Wales. Standing about half a mile south of Windsor Castle in Windsor Home Park, Frogmore House has been a Royal Residence since 1792. It is where Harry and Ms Markle posed for their official engagement photos in November.The location of the venue - away from the Castle - will offer the pair privacy as they celebrate with friends and family.Scant details have emerged about the receptions so far, but we do know that the couple have asked Claire Ptak, an east London pastry chef, to make an organic lemon and elderflower wedding cake.Kensington Palace said Ms Ptak, owner of the Violet Bakery in Hackney, will create a cake for the Royal wedding incorporating the bright flavours of spring. It will be covered with buttercream and decorated with fresh flowers.Claire Ptak, owner of Violet Bakery in Hackney, east LondonIt is believed to be the first time a Royal couple have eschewed tradition by not serving a fruit cake to their wedding guests.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge chose Fiona Cairns to make their 2011 wedding cake, a traditional multi-layered fruit cake with a floral design.Read more about the wedding cake here.The couple have chosen high society florist Philippa Craddock to design their day, using seasonal plants and flowers from the Crown Estates and Royal Parks chosen particularly for their pollinator-friendly properties.Aisles, pews, tables and halls will be lined with plants from wildflower meadows, picked to “provide a great habitat for bees and help to nurture and sustain entire ecosystems by promoting a healthy and bioerse environment”, Kensington Palace said.Ms Craddock has been named “Queen of London florists” by British Vogue and “a floral mastermind” by Tatler.Peonies are one of Ms Markle\u0027s favourite flowers, so it is likely her floral bouquet will include these fragrant blooms, which are in season in May.Read more about the wedding florist here.The prince will be putting pen to paper to write his speech for their reception. But Ms Markle, who is an accomplished public speaker, is expected to break with tradition and deliver her own as well, offering “affectionate” praise of her new husband, thanks to the Queen and a few suitable jokes.The former actress, is “ready” to speak at the reception, should her father Thomas Markle choose to avoid the limelight, the Sunday Times reported earlier this year.Mr Markle, an award-winning Hollywood writing director who now lives a quiet life in Mexico, is expected to walk Ms Markle down the aisle, but may not make a formal speech.At the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, reception speeches included words from best man Prince Harry, the groom’s father the Prince of Wales and Michael Middleton, who affectionately described how he knew his daughter’s relationship was serious when her boyfriend landed a helicopter in his garden.Meghan Markle and her mother, Doria Radlan at the Invictus GamesIn February, one of the five original Spice Girls Mel B hinted that the Spice Girls were expected to reunite for the Royal wedding. The singer, known to fans as Scary Spice, claimed she had received a proper invitation during an appearance on a television chat show.Fellow Spice Girl Victoria Beckham also appeared to let slip she was attending the big day during an appearance on The Late, Late Show with James Corden earlier in April. Asked if she would be among the guests, she said: I, uh, I, I don\u0027t know...However, it has recently been reported that the Spice Girls have no plans to perform at the wedding, and have not been rehearsing for the event.Victoria and her husband David were invited to the 2011 royal wedding. Prince Harry with the Spice Girls in 1997Ms Markle will become an HRH and a senior royal after marrying Harry. She is also expected to become a duchess, as Kate Middleton did when she became the Duchess of Cambridge after saying her vows in 2011.By tradition, male members of the Royal family receive a title from the monarch on their wedding day, and the vacant title Duke of Sussex is regarded as the most likely choice for the Prince, meaning Ms Markle would become HRH The Duchess of Sussex.Like Prince Harry, the previous Duke of Sussex lived at Kensington Palace, and he also married for love, rather than choosing brides who fitted the traditional royal mould.Read more about royal titles here.Prince William and his wife Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, outside Westminster Abbey on their wedding day in 2011The wedding is on a Saturday, so there will be no new bank holiday declared.Although the public were given a day off to celebrate the weddings of Prince Charles to Diana Spencer in 1981, Prince William to Catherine Middleton in 2011, and Princess Anne to Mark Phillips in 1973, no such national holidays were awarded for Prince Andrew or Prince Edward.However, it\u0027s not all bad news because pubs and bars will be allowed to do away with the usual curbs on opening hours on the wedding weekend. Ministers plan to extend licensing hours across Britain to allow venues to remain open until 1am on the nights of Friday 18 and Saturday 19 May - which is also the day of the FA Cup final.There will also be lots of street parties planned across the UK.

The southern African nation is best known among travellers for the enormous Sossusvlei sand dunes of the the Namib Desert, but reports suggest that the couple are looking instead at a safari trip to Hoanib Valley Camp in the country\u0027s north west.Botswana, where they holidayed in the early days of their whirlwind relationship, is also a good bet, (Ms Markle\u0027s engagement ring features diamonds from Diana\u0027s personal collection, and a stone from Botswana), but wherever they go, the newlyweds will be looking for seclusion away from the limelight as they start their married life together.Other destinations could include Tuscany, Hawaii, Turkey and the Philippines.Read more about the honeymoon options here.Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleRoyal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarklePregnant women who drink three cups of tea a day raise risk of overweight children, study findsBattered vase destined for charity shop sells for £87,000John Bolton says sanctions \u0026#39possible\u0026#39 for European companies operating in IranPoisoned darts, blowguns and the \u0026#39canine KGB death squads\u0026#39 cleaning up Russian cities ahead of the World CupWelsh farmer helping to fight Alzheimer\u0026#39s by growing high-altitude daffodils to combat diseaseComment: Israel at 70 is a better and less corrupt place than almost all of Britain\u0026#39s former coloniesLabour candidate for Lewisham East by-election withdraws as it emerges she compared Israel-Palestine conflict to \u0026#39Nazi persecution\u0026#39Former colleagues react to Dame Tessa Jowell\u0026#39s deathWomen should test wine at dinner as they have better palates, study showsIsrael destroys Gaza tunnel as US prepares to open Jerusalem embassyRailway crossing gate drops on signalman and breaks his neck as Network Rail convicted of safety failingsMeghan Markle profile: The actress, blogger, yoga-lover - and breath of fresh air for the British Royal family How to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding on TV next weekRoyal wedding schedule and timings for the marriage of Harry and MeghanOn this day in 1373: A dying nun sees a vision of Christ as a mother – and becomes English\u0026#39s first female authorBooming economy and foreign policy win fueling surge in Donald Trump\u0026#39s popularity ahead of midterm electionsDrivers who attend speed awareness courses significantly less likely to reoffend, study findsDame Tessa Jowell died in the arms of her husband and children, her daughter-in-law revealsCivil partnerships could be scrapped as numbers plummet following gay marriage law We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"royal wedding schedule timings marriage harry meghan","story":"The Royal wedding of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry is now just over a week away, which means the final preparations for the big day will no doubt be being tweaked and polished as you read. The ceremony, which takes place on Saturday May 19, will be held in Windsor it will include two wedding receptions and a carriage procession, as well as the service.Prince Harry and Ms Markle have broken tradition by choosing to hold their wedding on a Saturday, as royal weddings usually take place during the week. The wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge was held on a Friday and the wedding of the Prince of Wales and Diana, Princess of Wales was held on a Wednesday on both occasions the public were given an extra bank holiday.While Downing Street have said there are no plans to give Britons a day off for this year\u0027s royal nuptials, pubs and bars will be allowed to stay open until 1am on Friday May 18 and the day of the wedding itself.Amber Rudd, the former Home Secretary, opened a consultation on the plans in January. She said: “The Royal wedding will be a time of national celebration, and we want everyone to be able to make the most of such an historic occasion.“I hope that this relaxation of the licensing hours will allow people to extend their festivities and come together to mark what will be a very special moment for the country.”Here is everything you need to know about how the big day will unfold.WATCH:  How Diana, the in-laws and Prince Louis will fit into the Royal WeddingThe service will take place at St George’s Chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle, which last hosted a royal wedding in May 2008 when Peter Phillips - son of The Princess Royal - married Autumn Kelly. Prince Edward also wed Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, there in June 1999 plus Prince Harry was christened there in 1984 by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie.Members of the public who have been invited to watch from the grounds of Windsor Castle will  begin to arrive from 9am.Guests will arrive between 9:30am and 11am by coach. Two driving routes have been suggested, with guests required to meet at the Windsor Farm Shop – founded in 2001 after the Duke of Edinburgh had an idea to support local businesses by selling produce.There, three miles away from the venue, guests will be put through security checks and asked to show identification they will then be ushered onto buses to travel to Windsor Castle, where they will alight at the castle\u0027s Round Tower and enter the chapel through the south door.Instructions reportedly sent to the guests ban cameras and bulky bags, adding that guests will be asked to surrender mobile telephones\u0085 and any devices used for image capture.The rules further specify that guests should not wear medals, in a list of suggestions about accessories that includes: No swords.At 11:20am, members of the Royal Family will arrive and enter the chapel through the Galilee Porch. Some will arrive in state car from the Royal Mews, including Bentleys, Rolls-Royces and Daimlers.A view of the Quire in St George\u0026#39s Chapel at Windsor Castle, where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will have their wedding servicePrince Harry and his brother and best man the Duke of Cambridge are expected to arrive at the chapel\u0027s west steps at 11:45am. It is assumed they will enter the grounds on foot, giving Prince Harry the opportunity to walk past the crowds in the grounds. He will pass 200 representatives from charities he is associated with, who are expected to gather in the horseshoe cloister at the bottom of the steps.The Queen will be the final member of the Royal Family to arrive for the service, and is expected at 11:55am.The service will begin at 12pm, with Ms Markle due to arrive at the chapel\u0027s west steps at 11:59am.She has chosen her mother, Doria, to travel with her to the wedding, travelling from their overnight accommodation to St George’s Chapel by car. The decision breaks with UK tradition, which usually sees the bride travel with her father before he gives her away in the wedding ceremony.Instead, Ms Markle wanted to include both parents in her wedding day. When the car stops at the castle, her mother will exchange places with the bridesmaids and pageboys. Ms Ragland will enter the chapel by the Galilee Porch.The most beautiful royal wedding dresses of all timeMeghan\u0027s father will meet her at the chapel\u0027s west door, before walking her down the aisle.The traditional ceremony will be conducted by the Dean of Windsor, The Rt Revd.

This allows the bride to drop the phrases obey him and serve him from the religious proceedings. Harry must decide whether to wear a wedding ring William does not wear one.The regiments Prince Harry served with in Afghanistan will also have a special place during the ceremony. Household Cavalry troopers will line the staircase at St George\u0027s Chapel, while streets within the precincts of the castle will be lined by members of the Windsor Castle Guard from 1st Battalion Irish Guards, and by Armed Forces personnel from the Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving, which has the Prince as Commodore-in-Chief, and the Royal Marines, where he is Captain General.The 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, where Prince Harry served as an Apache Pilot in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, will also be represented, as well as The Royal Gurkha Rifles, his comrades in Afghanistan in 2007, and RAF Honington, where he is Honorary Air Commandant.The service will end at 1pm and the newlyweds will leave the chapel at the west steps, before leaving the castle by carriage. Prince Harry and Ms Markle will be driven for two miles along Castle Hill, the High Street and into Windsor town centre before returning along the beautiful, tree-lined Long Walk for their reception.Kensington Palace has said: Prince Harry and Ms Markle are very much looking forward to this short journey which they hope will be a memorable moment for everyone who has gathered together in Windsor to enjoy the atmosphere of this special day.While we don\u0027t know for sure how long the procession will take, a similar procession in 1999 by Edward and Sophie took 15 minutes.The best photo opportunity will be the West Steps of St George’s Chapel, when the bride and groom and their families emerge after the service. If you are lucky enough to be in Windsor on the day, head for the grass of the Horseshoe Cloisters opposite those steps for the view.The Ascot Landau open carriage stands in the Royal Mews at Buckingham Palace in LondonThe newlyweds will make their journey through Windsor in an open-topped Ascot Landau carriage, Kensington Palace has confirmed. It is the same carriage Prince Harry used in the procession at the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton, when he was surrounded by small bridesmaids and page boys.Crown Equerry Colonel Toby Browne, who runs the royal mews where the carriage was selected, said: The fair weather option, the Ascot Landau, it was selected because it\u0027s a wonderfully bright, small, lovely carriage. Very easy for people to see, the passengers can sit up quite high - so there\u0027s lots of visibility for everybody.It was built in 1883, it\u0027s one of five that we have, most of them are down in Windsor, we always keep one in London for occasions.If it rains on the wedding day, the wet weather option is the Scottish State Coach. Built in 1830, a new top was created in 1969 with large windows and a partial glass roof, to allow spectators to see the passengers.Six horses, Windsor Greys, will be included the procession ride.A team of four, Milford Haven, Plymouth and father and son Storm and Tyrone, will pull the Landau and two others - Sir Basil and Londonderry - will be outriders.All have been involved in high profile events before, including the Spanish state visit last year, Royal Ascot, Trooping the Colour, the State Opening of Parliament and the Lord Mayor\u0027s Show. They will be waved off by members of both families and the congregation will leave the chapel to see the newlyweds leave, before going to St George\u0027s Hall for the lunchtime reception hosted by the Queen.While Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are touring Windsor, guests from the congregation will wait for the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall to celebrate the first of the day\u0027s two receptions. This will be hosted by the Queen, will take place during the afternoon and will be attended by all guests who were invited to the service.Invitations have been posted to 600 lucky guests royal sources have said the guest list has been restricted to those who have a direct relationship with the couple, both because St George’s Chapel is relatively small and because the prince is not in the direct line of succession.Some members of the public have received an invitation to wait in the grounds outside the chapel to watch the bride and groom and their wedding guests arrive and leave.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle at Frogmore HouseFrom 7pm, a select 200 close friends will attend an after party hosted by the Prince of Wales at Frogmore House, Windsor. Half a mile away from Windsor Castle, the 17th century Grade I country house is owned by the Crown Estate and is part of the Frogmore Estate on the ground of the Home Park.Prince Harry and Ms Markle\u0027s engagement photos were taken in the grounds of Frogmore House. The images were taken by photographer Alexi Lubomirski, who has also been chosen to take the photographs on the wedding day. Lubomirski, the British-born son of Peruvian-English mother and a Polish-French father, also happens to be a Prince himself: his full title is His Serene Highness Prince Alexi Lubomirski.It is expected that member of the Royal family, Ms Markle\u0027s family and intimate friends of both the newlyweds will be at the evening reception – although Princess Charlotte and Prince George will no doubt have been put to bed after their big day in the limelight.It has been announced that Prince William will be Prince Harry\u0027s best man. The decision means the Duke, who is President of the Football Association, will not attend the FA Cup final, which is happening on the same day as the wedding.Scheduled to start at 17:15, the FA Cup final will see Chelsea and Manchester United go head to head for the title. Windsor Castle is about an hour\u0027s drive from Wembley Stadium, which would have taken the Duke of Cambridge away from the proceedings for at least two hours.The Duke’s own stag do is reported to have been held on a Devon estate, Hartland Abbey, where he and close friends indulged in drinking, clay pigeon shooting, surfing and games.Prince Harry went on to tease his brother mercilessly during a none-the-less heartfelt best man’s speech at the wedding reception, allegedly wearing a fez, mimicking the lovestruck conversations between a young Kate and William, and ridiculing his bald spot.Royal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarklePregnant women who drink three cups of tea a day raise risk of overweight children, study findsBattered vase destined for charity shop sells for £87,000John Bolton says sanctions \u0026#39possible\u0026#39 for European companies operating in IranPoisoned darts, blowguns and the \u0026#39canine KGB death squads\u0026#39 cleaning up Russian cities ahead of the World CupWelsh farmer helping to fight Alzheimer\u0026#39s by growing high-altitude daffodils to combat diseaseComment: Israel at 70 is a better and less corrupt place than almost all of Britain\u0026#39s former coloniesLabour candidate for Lewisham East by-election withdraws as it emerges she compared Israel-Palestine conflict to \u0026#39Nazi persecution\u0026#39Former colleagues react to Dame Tessa Jowell\u0026#39s deathWomen should test wine at dinner as they have better palates, study showsIsrael destroys Gaza tunnel as US prepares to open Jerusalem embassyRailway crossing gate drops on signalman and breaks his neck as Network Rail convicted of safety failingsMeghan Markle profile: The actress, blogger, yoga-lover -

If y\u0027all got offended over that girlCan I, however, ask if anyone here has already commented on the quite shocking Japanese cultural bastardisation-appropriation going on in Netta\u0027s song?Others pointed out that appropriation occurs most commonly when a dominant culture lifts elements of a minority culture for its own benefit, and they did not consider Israeli culture dominant over Japanese.I saw Netta\u0027s performance and the cultural appropriation tweets did not disappoint. But appropriation is when a dominant culture adopts traits of a minority culture. I really don\u0027t consider Israeli culture dominant over Japanese or vice versa. 🤷‍♀️Its not cultural appropriation as long as it is done with admiration of the culture. Netta has said that she chose this theme because it is something that she really loves a lot and she wants to promote it. Context matters!Netta has not yet responded to the criticism.

The series follows Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, also known as Osho, and the free-love community which built up around him in Oregon in the 1980s.It’s perhaps the archetypal image of the cult we’ve come to recognise: the followers of Rajneesh, who died in 1990, dressed in orange their leader was a charismatic Indian guru (who relocated to the US after the Indian government frowned upon his activities) the disciples gave huge amounts of cash to their figurehead, lost contact with their families.But cults don’t have to follow the pattern of Rajneeshpuram, as the Oregon ranch was renamed, or the bloodbaths at Jonestown or Waco, where David Koresh’s sect the Branch Davidians was raided by the FBI in 1993. More often than not, they are more mundane than that… but no less damaging.Rajneesh, also known as Osho, with his ‘Orange People’ followers (Netflix)Katy Morgan-Davies last month published a book about her experiences living in Brixton with the cult leader – and her father – Aravindan Balakrishnan, who was jailed on charges of rape and imprisonment in 2015. Morgan-Davies managed to flee the cult in 2013 after 30 years – her entire life.Cults are back in the news again, but for Ian Haworth they never went away. As the head of the UK-based Cult Information Centre, he spends his life collating information on cults, offering advice and help to those who have escaped – or wish to – and campaigns for stricter legislation to control the reach and influence of these malign groups.“I’ve dealt with more than 1,000 different cults,” says Haworth. “That includes the Rajneesh group. The Netflix documentary series has generated a lot of interest internationally, which can’t be a bad thing.”Katy Morgan-Davies, 33, formerly known as Rosie Davies, who was kept as a prisoner by her father Aravindan Balakrishnan (PA)That interest comes in peaks and troughs, naturally, with particular focus at the moment thanks to Wild Wild Country and Morgan-Davies’ memoir. Haworth says: “I suppose the biggest peak we’ve had began on 1 January 1999, when there was a huge amount of cult activity related to the millennium, when all kinds of things were promised or predicted. Of course, mathematically, the millennium ended at the end of the year 2000, not the end of 1999, but cult leaders don’t really care about such things. They care about money, and controlling people, and power.”Born in Lancashire, the son of a farmer, Haworth emigrated to Canada in 1972 while in his twenties. By 1978 he was working as a communications consultant for a large company, and had never given a thought to cults. Aged 31, he happened to be stopped by a woman with a clipboard in a Toronto street.After fleeing a cult in 1978, Ian Haworth has dedicated his life to helping others in the same situation (Cult Information Centre)“She was very attractive and I was very single,” remembers Haworth. “When she asked me if I had time to answer a few questions for what I thought was market research, I said yes.”But after only half a dozen questions, the tone of the exchange altered. The woman told Haworth that his answers indicated he’d fit in very well with a group she was involved with, and that it would enable him to give something back to society rather than just taking. A meeting was taking place the following week and Haworth was invited along.“I turned up and there were about a hundred people there,” he says. “A woman was talking about her addiction to alcohol and drugs, and how this group had helped her. I was planning to sneak away at the end, because I’d been brought up to be polite and didn’t want to just walk out. Then they brought out drinks and cakes, and as I’d paid $2 (£1.50) to attend I decided I might as well get my money’s worth before leaving.”The world of Cults: in picturesThe world of Cults: in picturesAravindan Balakrishnan, known as ‘Comrade Bala’ within the women-only collective he founded 40 years ago, carried out a brutal campaign of sexual degradation against the women over several decades. In this picture, he stands with some of his cult followers including his daughter. Rexwords by Hardeep Matharu Balakrishnan brainwashed the cult into thinking he had God-like powers and that he could read their minds, as a means of subjecting them to years of abuse.politan Policewords by Hardeep Matharu Katy Morgan-Davies, 33, formerly known as Rosie Davies, who was kept as a prisoner by her father Aravindan Balakrishnan. Revealing her real identity, Miss Morgan-Davies said that waiving her anonymity was an important step – “to retrieve the identity the cult tried to steal from me”.\u0026#13PAwords by Hardeep Matharu Evidence picture showing the bedroom of the imprisoned daughter of Aravindan Balakrishnan. She was banned from leaving the house unaccompanied and routinely psychologically and physically abused.\u0026#13Rexwords by Hardeep Matharu Boarded up windows in Peckford Place, Brixton, south London. Aravindan Balakrishnan was jailed for 23 years in 2016. To keep his devotees in check, Balakrishnan invented \u0027Jackie\u0027, which he said could kill or trigger earthquakes if anyone went against his will. He claimed that a challenge to his leadership resulted in the 1986 space shuttle disaster and Jackie, an invisible war machine, was responsible for the election of Jeremy Corbyn as Labour party leader. PAwords by Hardeep Matharu Jim Jones, founder of the Peoples Temple sect in Jonestown, north Guyana, in 1978. Believers of the Peoples Temple of the Disciples of Christ followed Reverend Jones to Guyana in the Seventies, hoping to create a utopia in the jungle. Jonestown was envisaged as a “rainbow family” of all ages and races, the preacher had promised them: “Divine principles. Total equality. A society where people own all things in common, where there is no rich or poor, where there are no races.” APwords by Adam LusherReverend Jones wanted to create a glorious sacrifice, a defiant act of “revolutionary suicide” that would echo through history. Some disciples willingly colluded, cheering as he exhorted them to kill themselves and their children. But the bodies found with bent needles in their arms testified to the fact that some refused and were forcibly injected. Rexwords by Adam LusherWhen they finally counted the bodies after what would become known as the Jonestown massacre of 18 November 1978, the total came to 918, of whom 304 were children. They had been persuaded to “drink the Kool-Aid”, Flavor Aid, used to mask the bitter taste of cyanide, mixed with a dash of Valium.APwords by Adam LusherMaude Julien, now 60, was forced to hold onto an electric fence for without showing feeling as a child. The ritual was considered to be a test of her willpower by her father, who wanted to make her “superhuman”.\u0026#13Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, also known as Osho, and the free-love community which was built up around him in Oregon in the 1980s. Rajneesh, who died in 1990, was a charismatic Indian guru (who relocated to the US after the Indian government frowned upon his activities). His disciples gave huge amounts of cash to their figurehead and lost contact with their families.During a break he went into the corridor for a cigarette, and that’s when the cult members pounced. Haworth had seen his doctor not long before and been told if he carried on smoking like he did he’d be lucky to see 40. The group told him that they would absolutely guarantee he would stop smoking if he attended a further course for $220. He’d already looked into smoking-cessation courses that were of comparable cost, so decided he’d give this one a go.“The course took place in September, 1978,” says Haworth. “By the end of the course I’d given notice at my job, promised to dedicate my life to the cult, and handed over all my savings, which amounted to about $1,500.”Jonestown commune mass suicide in 1978 (AP)Even now, Haworth cannot identify the tipping point that turned him from someone who’d turned up for a meeting at the behest of an attractive woman to someone who gave himself, body and soul, to a cult, other than mid-way through the course when he stopped smoking. “I suppose that was the moment I went over to them – they had done what they said they would do.”Cults often thrive on feeding into people’s desires. Sometimes they will promise success, artistic or creative talent, fulfil a desire in their targets to effect social change or, as with Haworth, to “give something back” to the world. They will promise freedom from addictions or improved physical or mental health. They’re what Haworth calls therapy cults, as opposed to the religious cults that offer more spiritual promises.If you’re born into a cult you don’t have that ‘Real Ian’ vs ‘Cult Ian’ internal battle that I had. You emerge from that and the first question is… who am I? It’s an incredibly difficult and delicate situationOver the next month, Haworth tried to recruit his friends and even neighbours to the group. They were appalled at the change in him, but, he says, “I thought they were wrong, I knew they weren’t part of the elite, like I was.”It was an almost textbook recruitment, and Haworth firmly believes he would have been lost to everyone who knew him but for one error on the part of the cult. “Most cults programme their members against the media very early on. These people didn’t do that,” he says. And that was what saved him.A neighbour gave him a copy of the Toronto Star which had featured a front-page exposé of the group Haworth was involved in, written by the investigative reporter Sidney Katz. Haworth read the piece and contacted Katz immediately to verify his facts. He then, as he describes it, “fell apart at the seams”. Having seen Katz’s research and evidence first hand, at the invitation of the journalist, Haworth angrily confronted the cult’s leaders, and they effectively banished him. He was finally free of them.“That was in October,” he says. “Then, in the November, everything came out about the Jonestown cult. And I knew that could have been me. It took me 11 months to fully recover and get back to myself.”NXIVM (which calls itself a ‘multi-level marketing organisation’) member Allison Mack leaving US District Court after her bail hearing in Brooklyn (Getty)It took that long for the nagging whispers of “Cult Ian”, as Haworth describes the person he was when he was with the group, to be finally silenced, and for “Real Ian” to reassert himself. And good sense would dictate that was the point he turned his back on cults forever and got on with his life.“I come from a farming background in Lancashire,” says Haworth. “People used to say, ‘If there’s summat up, then tha’ does summat about it’. So I did summat about it.”Sidney Katz put Haworth in touch with a TV producer called Peter Scott and together they set up what was first called the Council for Mind Abuse, and which later metamorphosed into the Cult Information Centre in 1987, now run as a charity.I’ve dealt with more than 1,000 different cults. That includes the Rajneesh group. The Netflix documentary series has generated a lot of interest internationally, which can’t be a bad thingHaworth and Scott concentrated on the group he had been involved with, even handing out flyers to a party of new recruits flown into Canada, exhorting them to go back to the airport. Faced with Haworth’s evidence, many of them did. Eventually, the resistance proved too much for the group. “Toronto wasn’t big enough for the both of us,” he smiles. “They got out.”Haworth doesn’t know where they are now, or if they still exist. Cults change their names often, to keep one step ahead of the media or inquisitive minds, and to muddy the paper trail they leave behind. Besides, he soon had more than enough on his plate as more and more people began to get in touch, especially after he had relocated back to the UK.One of the Cult Information Centre’s primary roles is working with ex-cult members. He likens the trauma that recovering cult followers go through to PTSD, and says systems to deal with and help them are variable, if present at all.He would also like to see stronger laws to deal with cults there’s no specific legislation surrounding them, and it’s only when cult leaders are discovered to have committed actual crimes, such as Aravindan Balakrishnan in 2015, that the law can act.Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh surrounded by devotees (Netflix)The Aravindan Balakrishnan case, and the revelations of Katy Morgan-Davies in her new book, add an extra dimension to Haworth’s work. It’s one thing to try to help cult members who have managed to break free return to their old, pre-cult lives, but what of those born into cults?“If you’re born into a cult you don’t have that ‘Real Ian’ vs ‘Cult Ian’ internal battle that I had,” says Haworth. “You emerge from that and the first question is… who am I? It’s an incredibly difficult and delicate situation.”And don’t think it is only stupid people who would fall for a cult. Experts say that cults are most likely to be attractive to intelligent, well-educated people… they have flexible minds can consider and be seduced by the alternative lifestyles offered by cults.Documentary about alleged sex cult NXIVM being producedSmallville actor allegedly tried to recruit Emma Watson to ‘sex cult’Waco: what really happened when David Koresh’s cult faced the FBI?From Jonestown in the Seventies to Rajneeshpuram in the 1980s to Brixton in the 2000s: cults endure, and spring up all across the world. Nothing about modern life and its complexities has inured us against the attractions of a charismatic guru or cult leader.“They start off wanting the usual things,” says Haworth. “Money, sex, power over people.

They did so this year with added piquancy because it was the 50th anniversary of the famous “Mai 68” when, in the Latin Quarter of Paris, the Left Bank, the whole month was devoted to riotous assembly led by students. In contemplating these events, I recall Wordsworth’s often quoted phrase: “Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive” – unless, of course, you were struck by a cobblestone hurled by a student demonstrator or soaked and knocked off balance by a police water cannon.Presumably those who were demonstrating in Paris last Tuesday have now resumed their normal lives. The point about May 1968, however, is that they didn’t go back to college or to work the next day, they carried on, some of them for the whole month. Why was that? After all, economic growth had been unusually strong, the country was calm, both politically and socially, inflation was weak, living standards had been rising and there was little unemployment.Was it in a way a very 1960s thing? That question is prompted by a French historian of the period, Éric Alary, who observes that “May 68 is seen as a period when audacious moves seemed possible and during which society profoundly changed”. For that is an accurate description of the nature of the 1960s, whether in Western Europe or in North America.At the same time, there was a big rise in the sheer number of young people as a result of an increase in the birth rate in the closing stages of the Second World War and for some years afterwards. Thus, in France, the under-20 cohort rose from 30.7 per cent of the population in 1954 to 33.8 per cent in 1968. At the same time in France (1967), the school leaving age was raised from 14 to 16.  Two men take evasive action during a Paris street riot on 30 May (Getty)This required a massive expansion of teaching staff and building. As a result, students often found themselves being taught by hastily trained teachers in hastily built class rooms. In France, as in Britain, this was followed by a big expansion of the university sector. There was inevitably something ramshackle about it all, and students noticed. Yet the command structures of educational establishments remained unchanged. Nonetheless, universities are never just academic establishments full stop. For their campuses and their indoor and outdoor spaces lend themselves to meetings and debates and even to organising mini demonstrations. The intellectual gods of these 1960s students were Marx, Freud and Sartre, the French existentialist philosopher. In a famous passage, Sartre wrote that “God does not exist, and as a result man is forlorn, because neither within himself nor without does he find anything to cling to”. This struck home. For as Bob Dylan sang in 1965 – “How does it feelHow does it feelTo be on your ownWith no direction homeLike a complete unknownLike a rolling stone?”One had either to start things on one’s own without adult backing, or not at all. This was an unprecedented and intoxicating freedom. As the French student leader Dany Cohn-Bendit told the Paris demonstrators in May 1968: “There are no marshals and leaders today. Nobody is responsible for you. You are responsible for yourselves.”In fact, as is the way of things, Mai 68 began not in central Paris, but in Nanterre, a suburb seven miles to the northwest, and not in May but on 22 March. The construction of the university of Nanterre campus in a bleak shanty town had begun in 1962. In the spring of 1968 it was still not finished. The building were exceedingly functional and contained some 12,000 students. They were particularly shocked to find themselves living and doing their studies in what was in effect a building site. They demanded, too, the right to circulate freely between the residences of males and female students, still forbidden in what one might call pre-1960s style. There was a lot of justified discontent.Daniel Cohn-Bendit  was known as ‘Dany le Rouge’ because of his politics as well as the colour of his hair (Getty)Some 150 students, including far-left groups together with a small number of poets and musicians, occupied a building. The police surrounded it. After publication of the students’ wishes, they left the building without any trouble. But then they took their protest movement to the Sorbonne in the very middle of the Latin Quarter. That was how Mai 68 started.In a drastic action, the authorities shut down the University of Nanterre on 2 May. The students who had decamped to the Sorbonne were bound to think that this was a hostile act, an outbreak of war between the university authorities and the student body. It had been natural to head to the Sorbonne, France’s premier university, which had the prestige of its ancient foundation 700 years earlier. This meant nothing to the police, of course, who invaded the Sorbonne the next day.In response, on 6 May the national students’ union and the union of university teachers organised a protest march. It was one of the key events of the month. The head of the Paris police was obsessed by the need to protect the Sorbonne and its surroundings from a massive invasion by the students. He placed 1,500 officers in defence. But then came 6,000 protesters in waves. Overnight the confrontation was particularly violent. Thousands of cobblestones were ripped up and used as projectiles by the demonstrators. The police responded with teargas grenades. Dozens of gendarmes were taken to hospitals. Students were wrenched from the arms of the police by their colleagues.The next day, students, teachers and increasing numbers of young workers gathered at the Arc de Triomphe to demand that all criminal charges against arrested students be dropped, that the police leave the university and that the authorities reopen Nanterre and the Sorbonne. But negotiations broke down. When the students returned to their campuses to find that the police were still in occupation, a near revolutionary fervour began to grip them.The lyrics of Bob Dylan captured the sense of isolation and alienation felt by many young people (Redferns)The events were broadcast on radio as they occurred, and the aftermath was shown on television the following day. This demonstration of heavy handed police brutality brought on a wave of sympathy for the strikers. Moreover, in a highly significant move, the major union federations called a one-day strike and demonstration for Monday, 13 May. The workers were going to march with the students.They had their own grievances. There had been sporadic industrial trouble since the beginning of the year. More than half of them put in a 48-hour week. They feared that their standard of living had ceased to improve. Unemployment, albeit from a low base, was beginning to rise. As a result this was no longer a Paris event, for workers took to the streets throughout France. Their slogan was “Ten years! That’s enough!” referred to Charles de Gaulle’s long period as president.French politicians Michel Debre and Andre Malraux at the tomb of the unknown soldier, demonstrating their support for De Gaulle (Getty)The events the next day, 14 May, were as important. For workers began occupying factories, starting with a sit-down strike at the Sud Aviation plants near the city of Nantes. If students could occupy their universities, then workers could seize control of their factories. By 16 May, workers had occupied roughly 50 factories throughout France and 200,000 were on strike by 17 May. That figure snowballed to two million workers on strike the following day (18 May) and then ten million, or roughly two thirds of the French workforce on strike the following week (23 May).The unions assumed that the workers simply wanted more pay. So, when they were able to negotiate substantial pay increases with employers’ associations, they thought their job was done. But workers had also demanded the ousting of the De Gaulle government and in some cases demanded to run their own factories.The demonstrations and the strikes went on. Meanwhile on the morning of 29 May, De Gaulle suddenly boarded a helicopter and left the country. He went to the headquarters of the French military in Germany and called a meeting of Council of Ministers for 30 May back in Paris. On that same day, the unions led 400,000 to 500,000 protesters through Paris chanting “Adieu, De Gaulle”. The head of the Paris police carefully avoided the use of force.Sensibly De Gaulle responded by dissolving the National Assembly and calling a new election for 23 June. He ordered the workers to return to work immediately, threatening to institute a state of emergency if they did not. The Communist Party agreed to the holding of the election. Immediately revolutionary feelings began to fade away. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. And the Gaullists won the greatest victory in French parliamentary history.The May days of 1968, it turned out, had been a convulsive moment, nothing more enduring than that. Nonetheless in Wordsworth’s words, “to be young was very heaven”.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Fishing accounts for 41 per cent of the islands’ economy and two-thirds of the corporation tax received by its treasury. UK threatens less EU security cooperation if locked out of GalileoAny negative impact from Brexit on the islands’ economy is likely to be a thorny issue for Brexiteers, for many of whom the Falklands is a touchstone issue.Speaking after recent trips to Brussels and London the chair of the islands’ eight-person legislative assembly told The Independent that potential disruption caused by exit from the single market “would put at risk the current profitability of our fishing industry and would impact both the wider economy and government revenue”.The Falkland Islands government also says “any material change that results in less beneficial importexport access could be potentially catastrophic for the Falkland Islands economy and people”, according to a report drawn up by the UK Overseas Territories Association.The British government says it has “prioritised securing the freest and most frictionless trade possible with the EU”, although in fact it has pledged to leave the single market and customs union.Any material change that results in less beneficial importexport access could be potentially catastrophic for the Falkland Islands economyThe islands mostly export loligo squid to Spain, a seafood that accounts for 89 per cent of their exports to the EU. The Falklands provided over a third of the loligo squid imported by Spain last year once it arrives in the port of Vigo it enters the EU supply chain and is distributed around the world.Representatives of the islands’ fishing industry believe that the “worst case scenario” of having to trade on World Trade Organisation rules as advocated by some Brexiteers would cause a £9m hit to revenues because of tariffs – a large sum for the 3,400-population archipelago that would amount to more than £2,600 per person.The islands’ fishing association says cultivating other markets for squid would be “difficult”, especially in Asia, where “demand is highest but competition is strong, and both political and tariff barriers exist”. In the event of a “no deal” Brexit the islanders say they would be left with no choice but to seek support from the British state to prop up their fishing industry.Theresa May has pledged to leave the single market, stating that remaining in it would be incompatible with properly leaving the EU. The British government hopes to secure tariff- and quota-free access to EU markets for fish and seafood through a free trade agreement – but Seafish, a non-departmental public body that supports the British fishing industry, says Brexit has caused “considerable levels of uncertainty” for the sector.While not technically a member of the single market the Falkland Islands currently enjoys preferential access as a result of its status as a self-governing UK overseas territory and Britain’s membership. It pays no tariffs and is exempt from quotas.Teslyn Barkman, one of the eight elected members of the Falkland Islands’ legislative assembly told The Independent: “We have worked hard over many years to establish and grow our fishing industry – it really is a Falkland Islands success story, and one that has allowed us to stand on our own two feet financially.“As a result of our current tariff- and quota-free access to the EU single market, our fishing companies have been able to develop strong markets across Europe for our premium loligo squid, which is our primary export.  Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

Nearly two years after the referendum the Cabinet is fighting over two customs options neither of which frankly is workable, neither of which is acceptable to the EU.”He rejected accusations that Labour’s stance was similarly muddled, arguing it backed a “comprehensive customs union” and a “strong single market relationship that hard wires the benefits”.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But I have also said that the virtue, in excess, fills graveyards.“In this case, not continuing in the EEA would mean endangering – sacrificing – thousands of skilled and decently paid jobs and, with them, the life chances of countless families and communities.”May has found another way to stall making a decision on BrexitThis is the truth about the politics behind EurovisionWill Sainsbury’s-Asda sell 73 stores or more than 200? We can’t let the Home Office threaten migrants’ right to strikePolice look at evidence Brexit campaign chief committed crimesEarlier this week Mr Corbyn’s office reiterated arguments previously set out by the leader that remaining in the single market as it stands would hamper his interventionist industrial agenda if he won power.In particular, Mr Corbyn has concerns about what he sees as restrictive state aid rules and regulations that might interfere with his plans to reverse the privatization of public services.But Lord Kinnock rubbished the claims as being “based on falsehood”, adding: “Neither the EEA nor the EU are part of the socialist superstate of neocon delusion, or of the global capitalist adventure playground of infantile leftist illusion.“The EEA is a mixed-economy agreement of 31 democracies ‘to promote continuous and balanced strengthening of trade and economic relations between the contracting parties with equal conditions of competition and the respect of the same rules’.Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

In many parts of the world, glaciers have been in retreat, creating dangerously large lakes that can cause devastating flooding when the banks break. Climate change can also increase rainfall in some areas, while bringing drought to others.Smoke – filled with the carbon that is driving climate change – drifts across a field in Colombia.A river once flowed along the depression in the dry earth of this part of Bangladesh, but it has disappeared amid rising temperatures.

The World Health Organisation has warned such pollution, much of which is from the fossil fuels that cause climate change, is a “public health emergency”.Water levels in reservoirs, like this one in Gers, France, have been getting perilously low in areas across the world affected by drought, forcing authorities to introduce water restrictions.Mr Van Gendt presented new figures about the Tesla battery’s performance, which also revealed it has now taken over 55 per cent of FCAS in the region.South Australia is now reportedly the only state that has experienced a decline in FCAS costs in recent months.Some estimates suggest the cost savings to consumers as a result of this decline have been up to A$35m (£19.5m) in the first four months of the Tesla battery’s operation.Lara Olsen, Tesla Energy’s regional manager of business development, also spoke at the event and explained that while other FCAS systems rely on volatile fuel costs, the wind power the battery relies on is fixed at a cheap and stable price.While local politicians in South Australia largely welcomed the giant battery as a key component in efforts to make the state more self-sufficient and provide affordable energy, there has been push back from the higher levels of government.Australian resources minister Matt Canavan even compared it to Kim Kardashian, stating that “it’s famous for being famous. It really doesn’t do very much.”Tesla’s new mega-battery in Australia responding in ‘record’ timeHowever, the success of the project has been recognised by the Australian Energy Market Operator, which has noted that it is capable of responding to outages much faster than conventional generators.South Australia has been hailed for the lead it has taken on renewable energy, with state Labour politicians lending their support to large scale developments including the world’s largest solar thermal plant. The Tesla battery is seen by experts as another jewel in the state’s green energy crown. To some extent the system’s efficiency has not been a positive thing for Tesla, which has stated that the speed of the battery is not being accounted for properly, resulting in the company missing out on payments.Nevertheless, its success has led to interest in further Tesla projects, with a solar-powered version set to be built in the Australian state of Victoria.While the Hornsdale Power Reserve battery currently holds the title of the world’s largest, Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently hinted at an even larger project set to be announced soon.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

You still live in a country where crooked, self-serving politicians are scrutinised by journalists without state censorship.Ed Miliband’s “Leveson 2” inquiry would have been a pointless waste of public money motivated by sour grapes.A few Tories supported it out of naked self-interest. Shame on them.More MPs backed away from Tom Watson’s sinister “Section 40” bid to force papers into the death grip of Max Mosley’s Press-hating Impress crew.Watson’s sole aim was revenge against papers critical of Labour. He finally bottled out of a vote he knew he would lose. A malevolent conspiracy theorist, bully and liar . . . now a coward to boot.But the Labour lardbucket ­will not give up. Nor will his orgy-loving benefactor Mosley, nor Miliband, nor Hacked Off Hugh nor their weird, obsessive acolytes.The Tories will have to defend Press freedom again. They can begin by repealing Section 40, as their manifesto pledged.THE Lords’ latest sickening insult to democracy has surely hammered the final nail in the unelected chamber’s coffin.Their vote to stay in the single market is beyond belief in its stupidity, arrogance and insane ­willingness to expose the country to dangerous instability.It would mean surrendering control over immigration for ever — and never actually “leaving” the EU.The Lords’ role is to tweak and advise on laws, not impose entirely contrary policies because they don’t like how the country votes. They are telling 17.4million people: “You don’t count. We do.”How do they imagine Leavers would react if the biggest vote in our history was negated by unelected, ermine-clad party stooges, some on EU pensions?We genuinely fear the consequences.It was the Lords, too, who began the attempt to muzzle the Press. They are rotting our democracy from within.IT is appalling that the Government is ­considering a new witch-hunt into Army veterans of the Troubles.The vast majority of unsolved murders were by terrorists, mostly since given immunity by the Labour Government.Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley has been advised she cannot legally exclude veterans.

Scott might be 26 years her junior but he always strikes me as the “older” one in the relationship.It’s that sheer zest for life that Barbara has, even at 80, that makes this diagnosis so very sad and hard to bear.Scott decided to speak out because he felt he could no longer protect his beloved wife from people outside their close circle of friends and family hearing the truth.He became worried her illness would make her do or say something out of ­character that could upset her and others.He wants to be able to take his wife on ­ outings, and for her to still meet the public who love her and who will now ­hopefully understand if she’s having a “foggy” day.Scott also needs to make sure he takes care of himself and doesn’t get completely worn out looking after his wife.He hasn’t been able to leave her alone in the house recently, but now the truth is out he can let others take over while he at least has half an hour to himself.Anyone who cares for someone with dementia knows it is utterly exhausting, stressful and worrying, no matter how much you love them.I salute everyone who quietly and patiently deals with these day-to-day ­struggles. Scott is now free of the burden of keeping the secret and I hope he is finding strength from all of the messages of support for Barbara.She’s been part of many of our most-loved shows and we’ve grown up with “Our Babs”.I remember watching her wiggle and giggle her way through the Carry On films, where her sheer talent and perfect comic timing marked her out as a little superstar.Who could forget her enthusiastic arm flinging exercise routine in Carry On Camping that ended with her bra pinging off?And that incredible bikini made up of three shiny red hearts in Carry On Again Doctor made my pal Dr Hilary Jones decide to take up a career in medicine.As she more than proved during her reign in EastEnders, Barbara has always been so much more than a bubbly blonde dolly bird.She is one hell of an actress and was in her element behind the bar of The Queen Vic.It was her and Scott’s decision to kill off Peggy Mitchell when her memory began to fade.Barbara was having difficulty ­learning lines so felt she couldn’t give her very best performance.As it so happens, the scenes leading up to her character’s death were some of the best that ­Barbara, or any soap actress, has ever given on the small screen. Quite simply she is the real deal.I’ve been lucky enough to ­interview her many times over the years and it’s like catching up with an old friend.She’s open and honest and has never tried to cover up her ­mistakes or to sugar-coat the ups and downs of her life.When work was thin on the ground she painted on a smile, climbed into her shiny fairy godmother outfit and worked her backside off in provincial pantos.She was always quick to credit EastEnders for giving her a career comeback.I’ve seen her talking to fans outside the ­studio, always happy to pose for pictures, sign autographs and have a chat.She would leave everyone with a smile on their face and some happy memories.Her own powers of recall and her very bright light may be diminishing, but Scott and all her friends and family, and the public who adore her, will ensure she is wrapped in a soft blanket of love.She’s a class act and a very special woman.TAKE a bow Shayne Ward and all concerned with the deeply moving and hugely important storyline of Aidan’s suicide in Coronation Street.The subject was handled with great sensitivity.We saw Aidan feeling isolated and alone in the crowded Rovers, witnessed his fearful despair and heard his father’s anguished screams of grief through the closed bedroom door.There was no need to see his cold, dead body to understand what had happened. This really was Corrie at its finest.Richard Hawley as devastated dad Johnny and Catherine Tyldesley as poor bereaved Eva were exceptional, but what made me really blub was the authentic speech by Gail (Helen Worth) looking out of her window on to the iconic cobbled street, talking about how we all need to look after each other and that no one should suffer in silence.It was beautifully written and impeccably delivered.That’s what Corrie is all about.IT’S the one time of the year when our inevitable failure to win a massive trophy in Europe is a source of fun and amusement rather than humiliation. Because tonight is Eurovision.Our plucky Brit doomed to failure this time is SuRie, above, who is actually a good performer with a perfectly acceptable song, but even if the UK entry was Robbie Williams belting out Angels, we would still be near the bottom of the table or even doomed to the dreaded “nul points”.Many theories are put forward for our dire results over the past two decades.Some believe there are too many countries taking part (Australia and Israel are bizarrely considered part of Europe) which makes for more tactical voting, combined with an anti- British backlash made worse by Brexit.I reckon it’s simply because we don’t take it seriously enough, for which I’m very grateful, because I truly love Eurovision.We know we won’t win so it’s just an excuse for a party, a chance to wallow in the whole wonderful campfest and to chortle at Graham Norton’s snarky comments.My perfect evening.WHEN Kim Kardashian is the most elegant and tastefully dressed woman in the room, you know that something has gone horribly awry.So it was at the ludicrous Met Gala in New York, which saw a procession of show-offs dressing up like extras from the Monty Python sketch about the Spanish Inquisition.Madonna looked like Dracula’s mad old aunty, Sarah Jessica Parker had a nativity scene on her head, and don’t get me started on Rihanna, who came as some sort of sexy bishop mashed up with a pearly queen.It made Kim’s skin-tight gold sheath Versace dress appear to be the epitome of class.We are told the Pope approved this farrago, which was pompously entitled Heavenly Bodies: Fashion And The Catholic Imagination.His endorsement should make you shudder – until you realise that’s how he always dresses.He’s also a man with a passion for red leather Prada slip-ons, so I suppose he is more connected to the weird world of fashion than your average parish priest.A great deal of money is raised for good causes at this tacky celebration of fame and fortune, and that’s all well and good. But maybe next year they should stay at home and write a cheque.One thing is certain. You can be darned sure they won’t follow up the Catholic theme by making a mockery of Islam or Judaism.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Which they are.The Sun is all for more grammar ­places so long as a generous proportion are guaranteed for children from low-income families — as they will be.We back more choice, smaller classes and higher standards. So does the nation.DONALD Trump has been given the usual kicking over Iran — but he may be right.Barack Obama’s dodgy deal freed the mullahs to spend billions spreading war and terrorism throughout Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Lebanon and Gaza.Trump aims to halt that and punish the extremist regime. Who knows . . . maybe Iran’s people will finally revolt.Trump’s aggression and rash tweets have surprising upsides. He has helped propel North Korea towards peace.That’s more than Obama achieved during eight years of sonorous speeches which disguised dithering timidity.WHAT a surprise. A rabidly left-wing UN “racism inspector” sent to “find out” if Britain is more racist since the Brexit vote has decided — wait for it — we ARE!Her bogus “report” is a load of pre-meditated and vacuous bilge designed to bash ­Britain and the Leave vote.It must have irritated Tendayi Achiume to have to leave her home in the Californian sunshine for the charade of a 12-day UK tour amassing “evidence”.Here’s an idea, though.

On Saturday at 11.59am precisely — these royal weddings really do run like Rolex watches — Thomas will meet his daughter at the West Door of St George’s Chapel, Windsor, and escort her to where her ginger Prince Charming is waiting.“Poor Pa Markle!” sighed one pundit. “A total nightmare!”I have a different prediction. This shy man with an allergy to publicity will tug on the heartstrings of the world at Meghan’s wedding to Harry.Because no matter how awkward it feels to be under the pitiless gaze of planet Earth, Thomas Markle is above and beyond all else, a proud and loving father.No matter how bashful his instincts may be, no matter how comfortable he was in obscure retirement in Rosarito, Mexico, I would bet my life that there was never a chance that he would miss his daughter’s wedding. Thomas Markle is clearly — and understandably — apprehensive about the big day.He has been seen in one of his local cafes in Mexico, head buried in a book called Images Of Britain. At an internet cafe, he stares with some bewilderment at the engagement photos of Meghan and Harry. But what father of the bride, any bride, would not feel a giddy cocktail of pride, anxiety and a touch of sadness at the prospect of walking his baby girl down the aisle?I doubt if he is enjoying the big build-up — having a wedding suit made to fit his bear-like frame, contemplating meeting the Queen, Prince Philip and the sprawling royal clan, and, horror of horrors, working out what to say when he rises to his feet to make that wedding speech.But Thomas Markle’s nerves about the big day do not make him a misfit or a freak. They make him gloriously human. Meghan Markle is loved because she brings some Hollywood flash to our staid, stoic, rather fusty Royal Family.But Meghan is also loved because she seems strangely familiar to us — a mixed-race child of divorced parents, divorced herself and a working woman who has fought hard for her success.Beyond the showbiz gloss, we have some understanding of the life of Meghan Markle. Because millions of our own lives are not so different.Because no matter how self-conscious this shy man feels taking to the global stage, his overwhelming emotions on his daughter’s wedding day will be love and pride. As any father of the bride will tell you, love and pride trump everything.IT is exciting news that Major League Baseball is coming to the capital for the first time next year, when the Boston Red Sox meet the New York Yankees at the London Stadium.  Mayor Sadiq Khan has worked hard to make this happen.WITH their fiery eyes and flashing thighs, female cadets in Vladimir Putin’s barmy Red Army look as though they are ready to invade somewhere.Possibly Stringfellows.WHAT makes Brexit inevitable is the total lack of respect shown to this country by Brussels since we decided to leave.German EU commissioner Gunther Oettinger sneers that Theresa May is “weak” and mocks Boris Johnson for having the same hair as Donald Trump.“That says everything,” sneers Herr Oettinger, 64, who once called a group of Chinese ministers “slitty-eyed” and has joked that gay marriage will become compulsory.And that says all you need to know about this buffoon. LABOUR’S Emily Thornberry has called for the Little Miss books to be renamed because they are sexist.“I don’t like this thing about being little,” says Emily. “I think that’s my problem with the Mr Men books.” Funny enough, that’s my problem with the Labour Party. The institutionalised sexism. The casual misogyny. The assumption that men should lead and the little ladies should tiptoe meekly behind.The Labour Party is at least as overtly sexist as the Little Miss books, Emily.The Tories are already on their second female Prime Minister while Labour have never even had a woman as their leader. Why not? It’s not as though the long line of miserable male mediocrities who have led Labour were much cop.It’s hard to believe that Barbara Castle or Yvette Cooper wouldn’t have done a better job of leading Labour than Foot, Kinnock, Brown, Miliband or Corbyn – who didn’t win one General Election between them.If Thornberry truly wants to prove that women can do anything that men can do, she should be demanding to know why no woman has ever led Labour in its 118-year-history.When washing down the next bacon butty, better stick to the decaffeinated coffee, Ed.SIR BOBBY ROBSON inspired the current managers of Manchester United and Manchester City, and inspired love in all who played for him from England to Barcelona, including Paul Gascoigne in his mercurial prime. Sir Bobby remains one of only two England managers to take our national team to a World Cup semi-final.The subject of a new feature film called Bobby Robson: More Than A Manager, Robson was clearly a wise and com-passionate man.In comparison, Sir Alf Ramse was a cold, distant and aloof figure with a robotic voice and a weird accent fabricated by elocution lessons. He went to school with my father – he should have talked like a Cockney, not the Duchess of Devonshire.But Sir Alf did it. He made the dream – that eternal dream of every England football fan – come true.So I have to beg to differ when Gary Lineker says that Sir Bobby Robson is the “best England manager of all time”. There is only one Sir Alf Ramsey.THE Met Gala is the most fashionable party in New York and this year the theme was Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination – inspiring a host of celebrities to bowl up in what looked like deeply religious lingerie. Rihanna was possibly a mini-skirted Pope or perhaps a cleavage-flashing cardinal. Katy Perry was an angel.Rosie Huntington-Whiteley had a golden halo and a neckline that skimmed her navel. Madonna wore a crown made of multiple crucifixes.It is true that these Big Apple fashionistas – the Met Gala is hosted by the editor of American Vogue, Anna Wintour – would not have taken the mick out of any non-Christian religion. But perhaps that is a compliment to Christianity. It can be mocked by empty-headed, attention-seeking celebrities and nobody gets a death threat. Perhaps all religions should be this tolerant.“I no longer want to continue life,” said Dr Goodall before he died. “I’m happy to have the chance to end it.”Every one of us should have that choice. Dr Goodall should never have been compelled to go to Switzerland.IN more than 50 years of going to watch football matches, I have still never had one of those mythical half-time pies. But man and boy, I have collected football programmes. What could be a more evocative memento of a match? An overpriced replica shirt? A polyester team scarf? A football programme is the next best thing to memories.But now, after more than a century of programmes being sold on match days, the English Football League will decide in June if it will continue to make it compulsory for clubs to produce them.In the age of social media, the death of football programmes makes sense, although 600,000 of them are still sold every weekend. But there will be a little less magic in the world if they are allowed to die.I still have my treasured copy of England v West Germany in the World Cup Final of 1966.

On the lower right side of the document is the Commonwealth symbol.The Queens signature, Elizabeth R, is on the top right of the document, which will be presented to Prince Harry and Ms. Markle after the wedding.The Queen formally gave her consent to the marriage in accordance with the 2013 Succession to the Crown Act by making Her Declaration at the meeting of the Privy Council on the 14th March 2018."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000405334988.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"windsor wedding competition pictures revealed","story":"And as the new Mr and Mrs Medd posed for pictures in front of Windsor Castle the onlookers cheered.Rich and Natalie were the lucky couple who won The Sun on Sunday’s Windsor Wedding Competition and after tying the knot Natalie told us: “We felt like Royalty today. If Prince Harry and Meghan’s wedding is anything like our day it will be truly magical.“When we signed the register at The Guildhall we realised that we have become a part of Royal history - in just a few days time Harry and Meghan will sign the same one!“We couldn’t be happier or more grateful to the Sun on Sunday.”Delighted Natalie, a customer services rep, and Rich, who works in asset finance, said ‘I do’ in front of their loved ones on Friday.Their no-expense-spared prize wedding day cost in excess of £25,000 and included a lavish reception, vintage car, flowers, cake, rings, photographer, videographer and all the bridal outfits and suits. Every last detail was meticulously planned to ensure Rich and Natalie felt like a Prince and Princess and were treated to the wedding of their dreams, just eight days before Harry and Meghan marry next Saturday.And their big day meant even more to them, because Rich, 29, is a huge royal fan who met Princess Diana the day he was born.From a young age he would tell how, at less than two hours old, he was chosen for his meeting with Diana when she opened a maternity ward in the hospital where his mum Kath gave birth.He said: “My mum is so proud of meeting Princess Diana and shows that photograph to everyone.There has always been a royal connection for me, so to have been able to wed here in Windsor just a week before Prince Harry is brilliant.“This has been the best day of our lives, without a doubt. I know everyone says that about their wedding day, but this has been incredibly special.“Every detail was perfect and it all went to plan. Natalie looks beautiful and I’m so proud to call her my wife.“We can’t thank the Sun on Sunday enough. You’ve made us feel like royalty on the most important day of our lives.”Natalie, 24, added: “It has been a dream come true. We never would have been able to afford a wedding this beautiful and special. I know Meghan is getting married here next week, but today I feel like the Princess.”Rich and Natalie’s special day began at The Oakley Court Hotel - a stunning Victorian Mansion overlooking the River Thames with stunning grounds - where the bride and her bridesmaids had full hair and make up done.The stunning 1859 hotel, a stone’s throw from the Castle, can boast both King Edward VII and Napoleon IV as guests - and even played host to Harry’s Grandmother, HRH Queen Elizabeth in 2009.Portrait photographer Patrick Balls and videographers from Dom Balls Events were on hand to capture candid shots of the girls as they were pampered.There wasnt a dry eye as Natalies dad Mark, 51, saw her in her stunning wedding dress for the first time and proudly led his daughter to the 1939 Rolls-Royce Wraith called Victoria courtesy of Charismatic Cars that took them to The Guildhall in Royal Windsor town centre.Rich, his two best men and groomsmen - who were all kitted out in blue suits from Cookham Formal Hire and with button holes from Marks and Spencer - took selfies and giggled as they waited for Natalies big arrival.She looked beautiful as she slowly walked towards her happy groom with her attendants - bridesmaid Hannah Cawthray, 24, her nieces and flower girls Martha and India Pickering, aged six and one, and page boy Freddie Adamson, three - who were all dressed in beautiful outfits courtesy of Monsoon and Accessorize and carrying white and green bouquets from Marks and Spencer.The pair giggled before nervously holding hands and saying their vows in the same venue where Prince Charles wed Camilla in April 2005. The pair exchanged platinum wedding bands from Winsor Bishop Jewellers in a room lined with Royal portraits.And as the registrar declared them man and wife, Rich kissed a delighted Natalie and a ripple of applause rang around the room.Outside Royal fans, TV crews - from across the world - and locals applauded the pair and as they headed towards The Long Walk in front of Windsor Castle the couple waved at their new fans before returning to The Oakley Court Hotel as man and wife.The couple had a lavish reception courtesy of the hotel - with a Pimm’s reception and a BBQ feast that included burgers, tuna steaks, pork loin and salads.As the guests ate in the stretch marquee - with more stunning flowers from Marks and Spencer on the tables - singer Kelly Barnes performed.And it was there that the newlyweds met their VIP guests Harry and Meghan - lookalikes Rhys Whittock and Sarah Mhlanga, both 35.Rich laughed: “Now that they’ve been guests on our day we think they’ll return the favour and invite us to their big day!“It was great to meet them. A lot of heads turned to see them there with us. It was the icing on the cake for our day!”In his speech Rich praised his new bride adding: Natalie, you look stunning today, I love you so much and I always will. I know well have an amazing life together.The newlywed husband also took a moment to thank The Sun on Sunday adding: Were eternally grateful for everything thats been done for us.While Prince Harry will remember his mother Princess Diana on his big day this week, Rich also took a moment to remember his brother Barry, who also passed away in a car accident when he was just 23-years-old in 2004. Choking back tears Rich admitted how much he missed his big brother on the most memorable day of his life.He said: Baz was my best friend and I know hed have loved Natalie and looked after her, I know wed all give anything to have him here.The happy couple then cut their amazing cake from Marks and Spencer that included carrot, lemon, fruit and chocolate tiers.With all formalities out of the way, it was time to kick back, relax and let loose – just as Harry and Meghan will at their private reception at Frogmore House.The guests all headed to the hotels Windsor Suite and as the band ‘Get On Up’ started performing Rich and Natalie took to the floor for their first dance.Guests laughed, danced, drank and ate sausage and bacon baps until the early hours before the music wound down.Wedding planner Francesca Cook who organised the day and, together with her team of staff, made sure everything went without a hitch, said: “We were thrilled to plan and host the wedding - it was a truly special day.”Natalie’s mum Bridget, 56, said: “We have been excited ever since Natalie and Rich won the competition. Its been a wonderful day.And Natalie said: “I can’t stop smiling. I don’t want this night to end. I’m worn out but delighted - everything has been perfect.”And it was a perfect day when Rich was born at the Beverley Westwood Hospital, East Yorks, in 1988 and he was chosen to meet Princess Diana who was opening the ward that day.His mum, post lady Kath, now 61 and married to retired businessman Sam, 67, told us: “I instantly said yes! I love the Royals.“So to have my son now marry in a wedding fit for royalty, just before Harry and Meghan, is a dream. It’s been a perfect day.“Meeting Harry’s mother Princess Diana 29 years ago when Richard was less than two hours old is etched in our memories. We are very lucky to have these memories entwined in our lives.“Little did we know the day Richard was born would come full circle nearly 30 years later and now Richard and Natalie will have their own royal story to tell their children and grandchildren like we have. Rich, Natalie and The Sun on Sunday would like to thank:Additional reporting: Kelly Jenkins. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It takes an average of four months to deport each one.The Home Office put the rise down to improvements in identifying foreign criminals.It added: “Those who commit crimes in the UK should be in no doubt of our determination to deport them.“We have removed more than 41,000 since 2010.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Because it is supported by wooden peers.”The second chamber that acts within constitutional conventions is beneficial and helps prevent the “elected dictatorship” that our system of government can create.Asking the Government and the House of Commons to think again is both reasonable and valuable — it also has a distinguished history.As long ago as 1539, when Henry VIII was at his most powerful, the Lords amended his Act of Proclamation, which would have allowed monarchical despotism.This is the first example I know of the Upper House acting successfully as a revising chamber and preserving the nation’s liberties. The legislation was so ineffective that it was repealed eight years later.It is that act which spawned the expression “Henry VIII powers”, now used to describe the ability of ministerial action to amend the law.In the EU Withdrawal Bill, it is wholly unexceptional for the Lords to seek to reduce the number and extent of the Henry VIII powers available to the Government.These are technical issues when it is a matter of judgement as to where the balance between efficiency and process lies. It is not an attack on the democratic process or a power grab by an unelected chamber.This is not true of some of the other amendments passed against the withdrawal bill. There is a rule that the Lords does not oppose manifesto commitments.It was introduced in the 1940s to stop an inbuilt Tory majority blocking the then Labour government’s programme.It has relevance of a particular kind today when a Labour and LibDem majority could vote down any government proposal it dislikes.As was found in the 1940s, the Lords needs to observe this self-denying ordinance if it is to maintain credibility, otherwise it quickly becomes a matter of Peers against the People.In trying to insist on the UK remaining in a customs union, the Lords has overturned a specific manifesto promise by the Conservatives. Removing the date of departure — March 29, 2019 — similarly overturns an implicit guarantee in the same document.These are two of the most egregious breaches of the convention and raise the question: What is the Lords for?Tomorrow, it may be about to get worse. There is an amendment to the Data Protection Bill to require the Government to carry out Part Two of the Leveson Inquiry.This is in the name of Baroness Hollins, who has every right to feel her family was badly treated by the Press. And although I disagree with her, she deserves considerable sympathy because of what happened.Nonetheless, she is on dangerous constitutional ground.Page 80 of the Tory party manifesto says: “Given the comprehensive nature of the first stage of the Leveson Inquiry and the lengthy investigations by the police and Crown Prosecution Service into alleged wrongdoing, we will not proceed with the second stage of the Leveson Inquiry into the culture, practices and ethics of the Press.”This could not be clearer, yet the Lords are contemplating legislating to force this second stage upon the nation. It is a clear and outright tearing up of conventions.Unfortunately, it is even more serious than an arrogant desire to overrule a manifesto commitment — it is a proposal for the Lords to do the opposite of what it is there to do.The Lords ought to protect the liberties of the country against attempts by the government to erode them.It used to do this when it opposed extensions to detention without trial or efforts to reduce freedom of speech.Now it is suggested it will do the reverse to make our media less free and to ignore fundamental rights of justice.In just four years, the UK has already fallen ten places — from 30th to 40th — in the global rankings for free speech.Dozens of journalists have been put on trial and mainly acquitted for the reporting of stories involving the police and other public officials.The Leveson Inquiry was used to put journalists in the public pillory and now it is proposed that this should happen all over again.People who have been acquitted of a crime have nothing further to answer for and to demand they go on oath to rehash issues settled by a jury is the type of bullying of the Press normally seen in totalitarian states.If Lady Hollins’s amendment were passed, it would be giving in to the vested interests of the rich and powerful to punish newspapers which had exposed their peccadilloes.It would deter the Press from such fearless reporting in future and would be an attack on one of our most ancient and precious freedoms, a pillar of our constitution.A free Press must not be bullied or harried by those who do not like what it reports or else self-censorship will be the rule of the day.Fundamental questions will arise about the Lords if it ignores the constitutional conventions, sets Peers against the People and, instead of being the bulwark against an over-mighty Government becomes the cheerleader for censorship.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The highly-addictive drug, also known as ice, and a pipe to smoke it with were discovered by security guards in a disabled loo. It was the third such incident in six months at the Home Office, which is responsible for overseeing the nationwide war on drug abuse. Yet Scotland Yard decided not to mount a full investigation – with Government officials unable to say why. The embarrassing revelation came on the same day Mr Javid, who took over after Amber Rudd resigned a fortnight ago, tweeted a picture of himself with a Border Force officer and a sniffer dog called Trigger at Heathrow Airport. He posted: “We have impressive four-legged friends helping sniff out drugs, cash and illicit goods. Go Trigger!” Crystal meth, which featured in cult US television drama Breaking Bad, carries severe penalties for its use.  The stash of it was found on May 3 at the Home Office’s Marsham Street HQ in London’s Whitehall, where 5,000 staff are employed. An insider said: “Everyone in the building is talking about this. “We’re the lead department in the war against illegal drugs so it’s hugely embarrassing when they’re found under our noses. “Our job is to break the bad guys. not to feature in an episode of Breaking Bad.” In December last year crystal meth and a pipe were also found in a different Home Office disabled toilet. And last month cocaine was discovered elsewhere in the building. Security is tight at the Home Office, which is also responsible for co-ordinating the battle against terrorism. Visitors must go through a rigorous security system which involves body and bag scans and being sniffed by automatic devices for bombs. But staff have passes which allow them entry through automatic gates and their bags are not searched. The Home Office shares the building with Defra and Housing staff but all the drug finds occurred at its end of the premises. Buying drugs from a dealer could lay any user wide open to blackmail.  Tonight the Home Office was unable to say why the police are not investigating further. A spokeswoman told the Sunday Mirror: “We take incidents of this nature extremely seriously.” But Shadow police minister Louise Haigh said: “The Tories can’t even run their own Whitehall departments, let alone the country. With 21,000 fewer police on the beat thanks to Tory cuts, it’s crystal clear it’s time for change.” The discovery came hot on the heels of Ms Rudd quitting as Home Secretary in the Windrush immigration row. Mr Javid, formerly the Communities Secretary, walked into the Home Office on Monday, April 30 and the drugs were found on the following Thursday.

Partly because \u0026shydiagnosis is too slow. Brain tumours grow very quickly and are hard to spot.  “In the end, what gives a life meaning is not only how it is lived, but how it draws to a close. “I hope this debate will give hope to other cancer patients like me, so that we can live well with cancer, not just be dying of it.

Wearing a beanie hat with white wires coming from the back, the former Culture Secretary spoke starkly of her glioblastoma – a rare and aggressive cancer that affects fewer than 3,000 people in England every year. She said: “I was on my way to talk about Sure Start projects. I got into a taxi but couldn’t speak. I had two powerful seizures. I was taken to hospital. “Two days later, I was told that I had a brain tumour, glioblastoma \u0026shymultiforme, or GBM. A week later the tumour was removed by an outstanding surgeon at the National Hospital in Queen Square. I then had radio and chemotherapy.” But Dame Tessa grimly declared the disease has “a very poor prognosis”.   \u0027I\u0027m going to Germany for my treatment\u0027: Former cabinet minister Tessa Jowell on brain cancer battle  She told how she believes the \u0026shyEliminate Cancer Initiative, which allows patients to take experimental risks with their treatment, could mark a \u0026shybreakthrough in the fight against the disease – if ministers support it. Dame Tessa spoke of Irish poet Seamus Heaney , saying: “[His] last words were, ‘Do not be afraid.’ I am not afraid, but I’m fearful this new and important approach may be put into the ‘too difficult’ box. But I also have such great hope. So many cancer patients collaborate and support each other. “They create that community of love and determination. “All we ask is that doctors do the same… learn from each other.  “ECI will focus initially on GBM because it is so tough to beat, so it’s all about sharing knowledge at every level. “If we achieve this we will go a long way to crack GBM and other cancers. For what would every cancer patient want? To know that the best, the latest science was being used. What else do they want? “They need to know they have a \u0026shycommunity around them supporting and caring, being practical and kind.” She said: On May 24 last year, I was on my way to talk about new Sure Start projects in East London. I got into a taxi but couldn\u0027t speak, I had two powerful seizures. I was taken to hospital. Two days later, I was told that I had a brain tumour, glioblastoma multiforme, or GBM.  A week later the tumour was removed by an outstanding surgeon at the National Hospital in Queen Square. The tribute was thought to be the first of its kind in the House of Lords. The Brain Tumour Charity praised her inspirational speech. Chief executive Sarah Lindsell said: “Tessa Jowell’s passion and dedication to public service has touched countless lives over more than four decades. This afternoon, she showed that she has lost none of her \u0026shydetermination to help others even in the most difficult personal circumstances.” Mr Hunt tweeted: “Just been privileged to listen to incredible powerful and moving speech by Tessa Jowell on the need to speed up clinical trials process for brain cancer patients. She is of course right and we look carefully at her sensible suggestions.”  Tessa Jowell\u0027s speech in full I would like to thank all those noble lords, and friends and colleagues who have shown me such support since I learned I had a brain tumour. Today is not about politics but patients: patients and the community of carers who love and support them. What is it that patients and carers feel that they need? It is, of course, about the NHS. But it is not just about money. But also about the power of kindness. It is about support for carers.

If followed through, the move would abolish civil partnerships for gay couples instead of extending them to everyone - as campaigners are demanding at the Supreme Court. Activists have been locked in a stand-off with the government since gay marriage became legal in 2014. At the moment, same-sex couples can choose between having a civil partnership - which pre-date gay marriage - or a wedding. But opposite-sex couples can only have marriage, which campaigners say is a loaded institution that not everyone wants. Tomorrow Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan will bring their fight to have a civil partnership to the Supreme Court.  Now, however, it has emerged the government is looking at the possibility of scrapping partnerships altogether. A paper slipped onto the government website last week warns civil partnerships have seen a significant decline from 6,305 a year to just 890 in 2016. The paper says officials will undertake research with current civil partners to better understand their views. Officials will also analyse more up-to-date data next summer to decide whether to phase out or abolish civil partnerships.  Any decision would not happen before 2020. The paper says: We want to understand why some same-sex couples continue to opt for civil partnership instead of marriage.

Mr Livingstone was suspended after a discipline probe found his remarks brought Labour into disrepute. He now faces possible further action by July this year over further comments he made defending himself.  Shadow Attorney General Ms Chakrabarti told the BBC: I don\u0027t believe that Ken Livingstone can any longer be in the Labour Party .  We can\u0027t run away from the fact that he has repeated really, really incendiary remarks.  To compare somebody who was trying to escape Nazis with Nazis themselves, and to do so again, and again, and again and again, even when you know that this has caused the deepest hurt and upset and embarrassment to the party, is completely unacceptable in my view. Mr Livingstone infamously claimed in 2016 that Hitler was supporting Zionism by moving Jews to Israel in 1933, before he went mad and ended up killing six million Jews. But he insists he is the victim of a big smear because he never said, or implied, that Hitler was a Zionist. He has repeatedly said his comments were historically accurate and signalled he will resist any move to expel him.

Temperatures in the UK have dipped below average in places this weekend. However, there\u0027s a mini-heatwave forecast tomorrow and Tuesday, with highs of up to 25C, before things stay cooler and dry for the rest of next week.  Next weekend, however, forecasters said temperatures will start to pick up again as heat blows in from France. The Met Office predicts the warmth will last through the following week and until the end of May in the South and East, with “very warm” bursts. MeteoGroup predicted highs in the mid-20s or even 27C, close to the 29.1C hottest day of the year on April 19. The North and West are also due warm conditions, although with some showery days.  Met Office forecaster Alex Burkill said: “It looks like turning warmer from the weekend of the royal wedding onwards. “Warm air is expected to come up from the near continent, with warmer-than-average conditions likely for the UK as a whole. “Saturday looks pleasant for the wedding, with dry and bright conditions most likely.” A Met Office forecaster said: “A dry and warm theme is likely to continue into the weekend for much of England and Wales, and through the following week the South and East, though some rain is possible. “The last few days of May could well stay dry and relatively warm in the South and East, with the potential for some very warm spells.”  MeteoGroup forecaster Mario Cuellar said: “Air will probably start coming to the UK from France, with 24C shown on forecast models by May 21 as temperatures increase. “The weather for the royal wedding looks good for people enjoying time outdoors.” American Ms Markle will be relieved after her reported worries about Britain’s weather disrupting her wedding.  The couple will travel in an open-topped carriage if dry, but a covered carriage if wet. The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: “It looks like sunblock not brollies for Harry and Meghan’s big day. “And with a warm-up following the wedding, the royal couple could do well going on honeymoon near home.”  "},{"url":null,"title":"brit dad sues nokia up","story":"NewsBrit dad sues Nokia for up to £1million claiming using his mobile phone caused his brain tumourNeil Whitfield, 60, says he developed an acoustic neuroma tumour due to heavy phone use for his job in the late 1990s\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByGrace Macaskill 22:40, 12 MAY 2018Updated17:49, 13 MAY 2018NewsNeil Whitfield, 60, and his family believe his cancer was caused by his Nokia phone (Image: Peter Powell / Sunday Mirror)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A salesman who suffered a brain tumour is suing Nokia for \u0026shy“significant” compensation which could hit \u0026pound1million – in a case that could cost mobile phone firms a fortune.   Father-of-six Neil Whitfield, 60, claims heavy mobile phone use in the late 1990s caused a deadly growth.  His job meant using a phone for long spells – and in the days before it was illegal he had the gadget pressed to his ear while driving. Neil developed an acoustic neuroma tumour on a nerve between his inner ear and brain. He was left deaf in one ear after surgery in 2001 to remove a growth the size of a golf ball. He also suffers with balance problems.  Neil said: “I have no doubt my tumour was caused by mobile phones. “I spent almost five years glued to my phone hours at a time until I was diagnosed. I could feel the heat coming off it. “I know this is going to be a real David and Goliath battle. It might take a while before it’s settled but I won’t give up. “This is for the future of my children and kids everywhere.” Neil is the first Brit to sue a mobile phone company on these grounds and the case – six years in the making – could trigger hundreds of similar claims.  His battle for “significant” \u0026shycompensation comes as a controversial report alleges cell phones could be behind a surge in certain tumours. Solicitor Katrina Pope, of London Corporate Legal, in Mayfair, expects to make a “strong claim” by the end of 2018. Katrina, who has been working unpaid on the case since 2012, said: “A win in the High Court could set a legal precedent for other cases which we are aware of and that are watching our progress. “It is ultimately about justice for many people who have, akin to Neil, been victims of what some experts describe as the ‘smoking gun of the 21st century’.  “Neil’s personal injury claim is outside the legal time frame of three years. We argue it’s only now that the technology exists for radiation testing to allow us to bring the case – the first in Britain.” Millions of Brits used Nokia phones in the 1990s. In 1995 just seven per cent of Brits had a cell phone but by 1999 one was sold every four seconds – and Nokia was the biggest manufacturer of mobiles. Figures published last week show cases of a brain tumour called glioblastoma in England rose from 983 to 2,531 between 1995 and 2015. It is found in the forehead and side regions of the brain. And a study in the Journal of Public Health and Environment found higher rates of tumours in the frontal \u0026shytem-poral lobe which “raises the suspicion mobile and cordless phone use may be promoting gliomas”.  Neil, from Wigan, Gtr Manchester, had to give up his job as a construction material salesman because he refused to carry on using mobiles. His claim centres around years of lost income and reduced \u0026shyretirement payments after a \u0026pound20,000-a-year drop in pay to become a college lecturer. Katrina added: “It is quite possible that a claim for life-changing damages such as Neil’s could achieve a compensation award in the region of \u0026pound1million.” The law firm has commissioned experts to carry out radiation tests on Nokia phones used by Neil, including the 5510. Katrina said: “The evidence is being collated.”  The surgeon who removed Neil’s tumour at Manchester’s Royal \u0026shyInfirmary, Professor Shakeel Saeed, said of the case: “At a personal level one cannot rule out the risk based on the current evidence.” The debate over possible hazards has raged for 20 years. Scientific studies have mostly concluded they pose no peril at the level of most people’s use. One expert backing Neil, Dr Erica Mallery-Blythe, specialises in conditions related to radio frequency \u0026shyradiation and other \u0026shyelectromagnetic fields. She cited a study by the American National Toxicology Program, which she said demonstrated “clear evidence” of \u0026shyschwannoma – tumours of nerve sheath – after testing mobile phone radiation on rats. Occupational and environmental consultant Colin Purnell said older phones held a greater risk because there were fewer masts in the 1990s and mobiles had to emit greater radiation levels to pick up signals.  Cancer Research moved to quell panic, saying there is no conclusive evidence that mobiles cause problems. Dr Lion Shahab, senior lecturer in \u0026shyepidemiology and public health at \u0026shyUniversity College London, said: “Many environmental and lifestyle factors have changed. While there has been a rise in this type of tumour, it would be premature to conclude this is due to mobile phones.” While experts are divided on the risks, Neil, meanwhile, told how his life has been greatly affected. He said: “I can’t even wear a hearing aid because all my inner ear organs had to be removed. “If I go swimming and close my eyes I go round in circles. I loved music but I’ve been robbed of that too because the stereo element has been taken away.  “My youngest son Harry, 13, is desperate for a mobile but I worry about giving him one. Companies should at least put \u0026shywarnings on packaging so people can make informed choices. I just hope the legal action makes a change for the good.” Last night Nokia said safety “has always been a key consideration”. A spokesman said: “All products comply with \u0026shyinternational exposure guidelines and limits that are set by public health \u0026shyauthorities. “The World Health \u0026shyOrganisation factsheet states that ‘A large number of studies have been performed over the last two decades to assess whether mobile phones pose a potential health risk. To date, no adverse health effects have been \u0026shyestablished for mobile phone use’.”  More radiation as old phones found a signal Experts claim old mobile phones carried a greater health risk than modern units as they produced greater radiation to receive signals. Colin Purnell, an environmental consultant, says early models had to emit more radiofrequency to connect with fewer masts available in the 1990s. He said: “If you are looking at something in the distance and you can’t see it you might want to use a pair of binoculars to improve the power of your eyes. “Well, it’s the same with mobile phones. In the old days there weren’t as many masts as now and if you operated your phone in a bad signal area it chucked out more radiation to find the power base. The risk associated with mobile phone use now is probably less then in the ’90s. “There are more masts and the technology is better to detect signals without a lot of radiation.” He said the way people use their phones today – using texts or Skype – also reduces the risk because it keeps phones away from the face.

The Queen signed the Instrument of Consent - an elaborate notice of approval, transcribed in calligraphy - in March, paving the way for her “dearly beloved grandson” to marry the former actress. Harry took Meghan to meet the Queen for afternoon tea at Buckingham Palace in October last year to introduce her to the woman he wanted to wed. Although the monarch was unlikely to have withheld her blessing, she would only have said no on the advice of the Prime Minister, whom she will have informed.  The official document states: Now know ye that we have consented and do by these presents signify our consent to the contracting of matrimony between our most dearly beloved grandson Prince Henry Charles Albert David of Wales KCVO and Rachel Meghan Markle. The wording differs from the instrument signed to give consent to the marriage of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2011 when Kate was described as our trusty and well-beloved Catherine. For hundreds of years, the Royal Marriages Act 1772 required descendants of George II to seek the sovereign\u0027s consent before they wed, otherwise their marriages were deemed invalid.  But this law was repealed through the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, which came into effect in 2015 when all the Commonwealth countries, where the Queen is head of state, passed any necessary legislation. The new Act still requires the first six people in the line of succession to obtain the Queen\u0027s permission.  Harry was fifth in line when he got engaged, but is now sixth with the birth of Prince Louis. If Harry failed to get the Queen\u0027s approval, he and his future descendants would be disqualified from succeeding to the Crown. The Act was a radical shake-up of the rules of royal succession, removing male bias. Thanks to the new law, a member of the royal family can now also marry a Roman Catholic and not lose their place in the line of succession.  But a Roman Catholic royal still cannot be king or queen.

Jim Ratcliffe, 65, chief executive of Ineos, topped the Sunday Times Rich List with a fortune of \u0026pound21.05 billion, leapfrogging his way from 18th place year.  Mr Ratcliffe, whose firm is currently locked in a legal battle with the Scottish government over its moratorium on fracking, emerged in pole position after additional details led to a substantial revaluation of his assets. The Sunday Times has previously described him as publicity shy.  Ineos\u0027s director Andy Currie and finance director John Reece shared in his fortunes, joining Ratcliffe in the top 20, taking joint 16th place with fortunes of \u0026pound7 billion each. At second place were the Hinduja brothers, Sri and Gopi, worth \u0026pound20.64 billion.  Their fortune jumped by \u0026pound4.44 billion on 2017, with their India-based car manufacturer Ashok Leyland and Mumbai-based IndusInd Bank having a particularly successful year. British-American industrialist-turned-media mogul Sir Len Blavatnik came in third place with \u0026pound15.26 billion to his name.  The 60-year-old was knighted this year for services to philanthropy - recent donations include \u0026pound50 million to fund the Tate Modern\u0027s new wing, and \u0026pound5 million towards the Victoria and Albert Museum\u0027s new entrance, as well as funding the Blavatnik School of Government at Oxford University. This year is the 30th anniversary of the Rich List, with the top 20 now worth a combined \u0026pound218.6 billion - increasing their cumulative wealth by \u0026pound33. 5 billion in the last year. Of the 1,000 people on the list, 145 are billionaires. There are now 141 women on the list, with Charlene de Carvalho-Heineken of the brewing dynasty ranked highest at number six.  She and her financier husband Michel de Carvalho - vice chairman of Citigroup - increased their wealth by almost 20% over the past year to \u0026pound11.1 billion. Elsewhere, Arcadia boss Sir Philip Green\u0027s fortune took a tumble - his reputation was dragged through the mud following the collapse of BHS after he sold it to a man twice declared bankrupt for just \u0026pound1.  It later emerged that the department store\u0027s two pension schemes had a combined shortfall of \u0026pound571 million, risking the future of their 19,000 members and prompting MPs to call Sir Philip to give evidence in front of a parliamentary select committee. Falling sales at his flagship brands Topshop and Miss Selfridge as well as his promise to contribute \u0026pound363 million towards the pension deficit led to Sir Philip\u0027s fortune dropping by \u0026pound787 million to \u0026pound2 billion. Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver exited the list completely following a rocky year for his eponymous restaurant empire - it is still undergoing restructuring after racking up debts of more than \u0026pound70 million.  In January the chain announced 12 of its 37 branches were to close. Financier Ernesto Bertarelli and his wife Kirsty saw the biggest decrease in wealth, losing \u0026pound1.48 billion due to falls in Ernesto\u0027s pharmaceutical company stakes, the list\u0027s author said. The couple are now 11th on the list.  Aristocrat Hugh Grosvenor is still the UK\u0027s youngest billionaire at the age of 27 having inherited his fortune and his title - 7th duke of Westminster - following the death of his father two years ago. His property empire includes 300 acres in Mayfair and Belgravia, as well as properties in Oxford, Cheshire, Scotland and Spain. His wealth grew by \u0026pound444 million in the last year to \u0026pound9.96 billion.

A female shopper was also reportedly knocked unconscious as one of the males involved tried to flee the violence. The pregnant shop worker, who did not want to be named, said she saw the alleged victim run into a queue for Burger King, at the Eat Central food court at around 1pm.  She told Birmingham Live : It was just awful and it all happened so quickly.  I was on my lunch break at work and I was in Eat Central when I suddenly saw a boy run into the Burger King queue. The lad shoved his way through the customers and it seemed as if he was trying to get away from someone.  Did you see the the incident? Email webnews@trinitymirror       I remember feeling a bit uneasy at that point because I am pregnant. Then another lad appeared, who seemed to have been chasing him, with a hammer in his hand. The lad with the hammer then hit the lad who ran into the queue, in the face. By this time, there was a lady unconscious on the floor, after she had been knocked over in the queue. People were trying to help this lady and there was so much going on. It was hard to see how many people were involved in this because the food court was so busy with customers but it seemed to me as if there were two gangs. The guy who had been hit in the face ran off towards the cash machines but was being chased and was hit by a guy with the hammer, again in the face.

None of Meghan’s exes will be going to the wedding, according to reports.  Harry and Markle have invited 600 guests to the ceremony at St George’s Chapel and to a reception at Windsor Castle, but a much smaller group will attend the evening party which is being hosted by the Prince of Wales.

A source told Mailonline : Chelsy is the queen of night-time parties. She\u0027s wild and fun, and no evening bash is really complete without her, so friends are surprised she hasn\u0027t been invited.  Chelsy is surprised too, shocked in fact, and a little hurt. A source also told Vanity Fair that she was still holding out hope that she may get an invite at a later date. They said: Chelsy has been telling everyone she has been invited to the wedding and she is shopping for the perfect gown. “She wants to look her very best and has been given a plus-one, but she has said she has not been invited to the evening party.

Criminologists have long known that many murderers share the same personality characteristics. But do those murderers also share the same star sign? David Jester, the British author, spent two years researching the zodiac signs of some of the most prolific or notorious serial killers on both sides of the pond to find out.  Jester, whose new thriller The Clinic hits the shelves this week, found that more killers on his list were Taureans - born between April 20 and May 20 - than any other star sign.  He also discovered that April 24 and February 18 stand out as two of the days on which the most killers were born. We’ll leave it to you to decide if there really is a connection or if birthdays and star signs are just a co-incidence. But if you have a Taurean friend acting a little suspiciously…keep an eye on them. Serial killers, broken down by birthdays, are: Aquarius (born January 20 to February 18)  Aquarians don’t like broken promises. It can anger them when someone promises one thing and delivers another. They have a severe distaste for people who are boring and they are always looking for excitement. Might this explain those killers who lash out and kill for fun? Aquarian serial killers include:  Gary Ridgway (Born February 18, 1949): One of the most notorious serial killers in the United States, with a kill count that is said to be the country’s highest. Also known as the Green River Killer.  Lee Boyd Malvo (Born February 18, 1985)  David Birnie (Born February 16, 1951)  Joel Rifkin (Born January 20, 1959)  John Bodkin Adams (Born January 21, 1899)  Luis Alfredo Garavito (Born January 25, 1957): Known as “The Beast”, Garavito is one of the most prolific serial killers in history, admitting to the rare, torture and murder of nearly 150 boys and suspected of killing over 400.  Pisces (born February 19 to March 20)  Pisceans don’t like being alone and hate being criticised. They are compassionate and artistic, but the same has been said for many serial killers. So, which serial killers have the Pisces zodiac sign? Let’s take a look:  Aileen Wuornos (Born February 29, 1956): An angry woman who had many issues in her past. She killed several men, seemingly without remorse.  John Wayne Gacy (Born March 17, 1942): A killer who dressed as a clown. He certainly seemed to be artistic, but compassionate he was not.  Dennis Radar (Born March 9, 1945): A family man who got away with his crimes for many years. He was caught because of his desire to be infamous and to toy with police. Also known as BTK, or “Bind. Torture. Kill.”  Stephen Port (Born February 22, 1975)  Robert Napper (Born February 25, 1966)  Colin Ireland (Born March 16, 1954) Peter Manuel (Born March 13, 1927): A Scottish serial killer.  Doug Clark (Born March 10, 1948)  Aries (born March 21 to April 19)  They are determined and confident, but they can also be short-temper and impulsive. They are leaders who enjoy challenges and may see themselves as the strongest, best and most capable, traits that can be very useful and can lead to success in all walks of life, but ones that can also have a dark side. Arians on this list include:  Alexander Pichushkin (Born April 9, 1974): A Russian serial killer who is said to have killed as many as 60 people.  John Reginald Christie (Born April 8, 1899): An infamous serial killer who was active during the 1940s and 1950s.  Herbert Mullin (Born April 18, 1947)  Henri Desire Landru (Born April 12, 1869)  Judy Buenoana (Born April 4, 1943)  Taurus (born April 20 to May 20)  Although reliable, Taureans can also be stubborn and possessive. They don’t like anything too complicated, they despise insecurities and they don’t do well with changes. They are devoted, patient and hard-working, traits which can make for a great personality in someone who is stable and good-natured, and an evil manipulator in someone who is not.  H. H. Holmes (Born May 16, 1861): Said to be America’s first modern serial killer, Holmes created a murder castle and was almost ingenious in his unspeakable evil. An intelligent, devious man who chased money more than anything else.  Michael Ryan (Born May 18, 1960): The man behind The Hungerford Massacre. He armed himself with assault rifles and launched an attack on his sleepy, suburban community, before killing himself.  David Copeland (Born May 15, 1976): Known as the London Nail Bomber, Copeland was your average Neo-Nazi scum who made it his mission to kill and maim anyone who wasn’t as white and as crazy as he was.  Karla Homolka (Born May 4, 1970): A Canadian serial killer who raped and murdered several children along with her husband.  Albert Fish (Born May 19, 1870): One of the most well-known serial killers in the US, his nicknames included The Gray Man and Werewolf of Wysteria. A real-life Bogey Man, Fish was a child rapist and a cannibal. If this serial killer birthday matches yours, then you’re entitled to feel a little sick right now.  Levi Bellfield (Born May 17, 1968): A child killer and rapist in the United Kingdom.  Orville Lynn Majors (Born April 24 1961):  Robert Black (Born April 21, 1947): A Scottish serial killer and paedophile.  Steve Wright (Born April 24 1958): An English serial killer who raped and murdered several women.  Martha Beck (Born, May 6, 1920)  Gemini (born May 21 to June 20)  The Gemini is thought to be nervous and gentle, traits you wouldn’t expect to see in a serial killer. Far from being loners, they tend not to like being alone. They also hate being confined and don’t work well with routine, always seeking something different. Their adaptability can help them to fit into any new environment and social circle, which means they can hide any dark side better than most.  David Berkowitz (Born June 1, 1953): Also known as the Son of Sam. A loner who shot multiple people, apparently because he worshipped Satan, but mainly because he had a few screws loose.  Jeffrey Dahmer (Born May 21, 1960): The stereotypical serial killer. He was a loner, he abused animals as a child, and he performed unspeakable acts on living and dead victims.  Peter Sutcliffe (Born June 2, 1946): Better known as The Yorkshire Ripper. He killed prostitutes in 1970s England because of what was described as a “severe distaste for women”.  Richard Chase (Born May 23, 1950)  Ted Kaczynski (Born May 22, 1942): Also known as the Unabomber, an American terrorist.  Trevor Hardy (Born June 11, 1945)  Cancer (born June 21 to July 22)  Cancerians do not like it when someone criticizes them or the ones they love. They can also be very moody and tenacious. This makes them more prone to lashing out. If you believe in astrology then you might expect this to be one of the main zodiac signs for serial killers. However, we could find very few that serial killers with Cancer as a zodiac sign, none of which were particularly infamous or well known.  Robert Maudsley (Born June 26, 1953): Responsible for the death of 4 people, three of which he killed while he was in prison for the first murder.  Leo (born July 23 to August 22)  We often see serial killers as arrogant, struggling to grasp reality. They don’t like being treated like they are not the most important person in the room. Well, these are also traits that you will find associated with Leo. So, does that mean this is a zodiac sign that many serial killers have?  Myra Hindley (Born July 23, 1942): One of the most infamous female serial killers in the history of the UK.  Raymond Morris (Born August 13, 1929)  John George Haigh (Born July 24, 1909)  Anatoly Onoprienko (Born July 25, 1959): Active in Ukraine and known as Citizen O. One of the world’s worst serial killers based on the number of victims he claimed.  Virgo (born August 23 to September 22)  Many serial killers begin by torturing animals, but one of the traits of Virgo is a love of animals. However, they are also known to be rude and they dislike asking for help, believing that they can go it alone. There is a certain perfectionism associated with them as well, which is something that we often see portrayed in serial killers on the silver screen and in books. But what about real life? Is this one of the main zodiac signs of serial killers?  Ed Gein (Born August 26, 1906): A loner who the Psycho film was based on. He kept skin from his victims and used it to adorn his home and create a suit of skin.  Henry Lee Lucas (Born August 23, 1936): Convicted of around a dozen, confessed to many more, but is known to have lied about the majority of these.  Peter Tobin (Born August 27, 1946): A convicted serial killer and sex offender who was active between 1991 and 2006. He was born in Johnstone, Scotland, and was imprisoned in Edinburgh.  Rodney Alcala (Born August 23, 1943): Was convicted of killing five people in California during the 1970s.  Albert DeSalvo (Born September 3, 1931): Better known as the Boston Strangler, he is one of the better-known serial killers in the United States. Hs confession was disputed, and many believed he didn’t do it, but a DNA test performed in 2013 found that there was a 99.9% chance he did. DeSalvo escaped prison the first time and after being caught and taken to a maximum-security prison, he was murdered by another inmate.  Libra (born September 23 to October 22)  Often considered gentle and caring, with a severe distaste for violence, the Libra does not look like someone who would kill, let alone kill multiple times. So, if there was any connection between zodiac signs and serial killers then this would be a good astrological sign to research.  Fred West (Born September 29, 1941): A man who murdered alongside his wife and was known to torture and kill young girls, including his own children. One of the worst serial killers, ever.  Beverley Allitt (Born October 4, 1968)  Scorpio (born October 23 to November 21)  Seen as truthful but stubborn, Scorpios can also get very jealous. They are brave, but they can be violent, resourceful and secretive, which are traits you wouldn’t be surprised to find in serial killers.  Moses Sithole (Born November 17, 1964): A deranged serial killer, he was definitely violent and secretive.  Robert Pickton (Born October 24, 1949)  Fritz Haarman (Born October 25, 1879)  Sagittarius (born November 22 to December 21)  Sagittarians like to be free. They love to travel, see the world. But the same could be said for many killers who have done their bidding in far off corners of the globe. Their love of outdoors can make them strong and independent, while their distaste for clingy people could make them a little less compassionate and empathetic.  Dennis Nilsen (Born November 23, 1945): A British serial killer who targeted young gay men he knew no one would miss, before burning or flushing his victims.  Ted Bundy (Born November 24, 1946): A charismatic serial killer who killed many young women and then defended himself in court. He was sentenced to death for his crimes.  Rose West (Born November 29, 1953): The wife of Fred West, a woman who mirrored his sickening evil and helped him to kill young girls.  Derrick Bird (Born November 27, 1957)  Edward Kemper (Born December 18, 1948)  Ray Fernandez (Born December 17, 1914)  Capricorn (born December 22 to January 19) "},{"url":null,"title":"monster energy drink cleans mechanics","story":"NewsMonster Energy drink \u0027cleans mechanic\u0027s filthy workbench better than industrial brake fluid\u0027 in worrying footageSocial media has been sent into meltdown after a video emerged highlighting just how destructive energy drinks can be\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByBradley Jolly15:58, 13 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA video has emerged on social media appearing to demonstrate how useful energy beverages can be — and not just for drinking.

We were both only 18 and we didn’t have the money for that.“The ceremony took place at 8.30am because it was the day of the students’ charity event when they would decorate floats and parade them around the city so all the streets were closing.“After the wedding ceremony, we went back to my mum and dad’s house for a small wedding breakfast before heading to the Palace Theatre and then the carnival.“On our wedding night we went home and our best man, my cousin David Cunningham, made us stovies.“It wasn’t a grand day and we definitely couldn’t afford a honeymoon but it was fantastic.“Although all the pictures are black and white, I remember John’s suit being a powder blue colour.”In the image seen here, the young girl gifting the happy couple a traditional horseshoe is Mary’s cousin June Kay, who is now 66 herself.Mary, a retired teacher, and John, a retired roofer, have two sons, Stephen and John, as well as six grandchildren and one great-granddaughter.It was one of their grandchildren who inspired Mary’s gift to John for their diamond anniversary.Mary said: “My granddaughter had asked why John never wore a wedding ring and the answer was he never had one to wear!“We were lucky to have been able to buy my wedding ring but John never got one.“For my gift to him this year, I bought him a gold wedding band which he now wears.“He bought me a dozen yellow roses but was shocked at the price of 12 flowers!”During their anniversary celebrations, the couple were visited at their Broughty Ferry home by Lord Provost Ian Borthwick who presented them with a bouquet of flowers and they also received a card of congratulation from the Queen.John said: “It has been 60 good years of happiness, laughter and banter.

That will rise to \u0026pound42.5 million next year and \u0026pound45.3 million in 2020-21.It is desperately needed, according to those in the front line facing daily calls from struggling Highlanders.Alasdair Christie, manager of the Citizens Advice Bureau in Inverness, Badenoch and Strathspey, said: \u0026ldquoWe see more and more people struggling to be able to afford a home or maintain tenancies.\u0026ldquoA lot of it is down to the fact that they simply don\u0026rsquot have the income to cover the cost of rent and associated living expenses, and the demand greatly outweighs the supply of housing available.\u0026ldquoThe emphasis has to be on more council and housing association rented properties being available.According to Scottish Government statistics, almost 72,500 affordable homes have been added since 2007.Housing Minister Kevin Stewart said affordability was \u0026ldquoabout more than just bricks and mortar, by providing \u0026ldquosafe, warm homes.He said the government was on target to deliver at least 50,000 homes during this parliament through \u0026pound3 billion of investment, of which 35 percent would be for social rent.He is working with councils and housing associations \u0026ldquoto deliver quality homes to meet local needs.Labour regional MSP David Stewart welcomed the extra funding but wants an assurance that the right kind of property is being built.He said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquod invest more in good quality council and social housing, with a mixture of home types, ensuring these options were attractive and available to help relieve the pressure so many young people feel about home ownership.Sunday 13 May 2018 7:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04092000/04092368.jpg","title":"Demand for tougher A82 safety measures","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCampaigners have warned that pedestrians or cyclists could die unnecessarily because there is currently only one set of traffic lights on the entire, busy stretch between the West Link and the Ness Bridge \u0026ndash at the Kenneth Street junction.Despite years of community pressure for safer crossings, a lengthy review by roads agency Transport Scotland has concluded that cosmetic change is ample.It has pinpointed several locations for more prominent road islands, road redesign and new signposts. The details were aired at a meeting with ward councillors.Inverness West SNP councillor Bill Boyd, Ballifeary Community Council chairwoman Zosia Fraser and Murdo Campbell, who owns Loanfern Guest House in Glenurquhart Road, consider the response inadequate.The agency was praised by Cllr Boyd and ward colleague Graham Ross for listening and a public consultation will follow in the next few months.But Mrs Fraser said: \u0026ldquoFrankly, are we waiting for someone to be killed or seriously injured on Glenurqhart Road?\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove seen kids trying to get across the road to the Co-op, to stock up for the day, and they\u0026rsquore taking their life in their hands to get across that road.
