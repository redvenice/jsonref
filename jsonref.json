[{"url":null,"title":"Prince Harry receives backlash social media telling people meditate day","story":"  \u0027I love this convo about coaching\u0027: Harry\u0027s woke guidance to businessAlexi Robichaux, CEO of BetterUp: \u0027As I mentioned before I couldn\u0027t be more excited to host this first ever public Inner Work day with Prince Harry.... \u0027Harry I\u0027d love to start with your journey in mental fitness, you\u0027ve been with BetterUp for a little over a year now, and you\u0027ve been even before your time here one of the loudest and bravest advocates for mental fitness around the world. \u0027Can you talk about investing in yourself not just on the outside with your physical fitness but actually relate it to your own resilience and these internal strengths and resources?\u0027Prince Harry:  \u0027Thanks Alexi I\u0027d love to start by saying the intro you had there was amazing. I think what most people watching or listening to this will question is \u0027\u0027what about my time?\u0027\u0027\u0027\u0027\u0027Those are all amazing things, I would simply love to do them but I don\u0027t have enough time in the day\u0027\u0027. \u0027The distractions of life, whether you\u0027ve got work complications or every element of our life becomes busier and busier and busier. Then add on top of that, the attention economy of media, social media, pulling you in all sorts of different directions as well, again it goes back to everything you said. \u0027Most people will sit there and listen and think that\u0027s fantastic but I don\u0027t have the time. Well the good thing is, you can make time. \u0027And if you don\u0027t have time then you probably need to make time even more. I, similar to you Alexi, experienced burnout and throughout that burnout literally getting to the very end of everything I had. \u0027I was burning the candle at both ends. And just went boom. And that is when you are forced to look inside yourself. Because with everything else around you you feel as though it\u0027s working against you but the only way you can really combat it, the only way you can build resilience for the outside world and your entire environment is the inner work. \u0027Because if you work out how and why you react to certain people, certain situations you can gain control of those situations. Doesn\u0027t mean they\u0027re not gonna happen, it means that your reaction to them is more in your control.Mr Robichaux: \u0027I think that\u0027s so profound Harry, and I\u0027m glad you mention this point of time. Could you share a little bit more about what that experience and journey has been like for you and what are some ways you\u0027ve seen success in investing in your mental fitness?\u0027Prince Harry: \u0027It has to start from yourself. This idea that you can somehow find mental fitness from other people. Yes, as a team you can certainly encourage each other but it starts at home and it starts internally. \u0027And the effect that has for yourself and reaching your own peak performance but also the people around you and if you\u0027re a business leader then also your employees as well, to go \u0027\u0027you know what everyone\u0027s gonna have today focusing on themselves\u0027\u0027. \u0027That doesn\u0027t mean that necessarily everyone\u0027s going to take them up on that offer but as I said at the beginning everyone has such busy days anyway that even if you do have that 15 min slate of white space...\u0027By the way I now put in about half an hour or 45 minutes in the morning when it\u0027s like \u0027\u0027okay one of the kids has gone to school the other one\u0027s taking a nap right there\u0027s a break in our programme\u0027\u0027.  \u0027It\u0027s either for workout, to take the dog for a walk - get out in nature. Maybe meditate, I know that I need to mediate every single day. I would hope that everybody would be able to do that but the reality is that once your time starts slipping away and once you have other commitments in your day or you need to be there to show up for other people, guess what, the self care is the first thing that drops away. \u0027And I\u0027m happy to admit that as a husband, dad, someone\u0027s who\u0027s starting up a business but then think about the single dads, single mums you just don\u0027t have the time to be able to do that. \u0027So yes I think the point here is that when it comes to mental fitness it\u0027s the pinnacle, it\u0027s what you\u0027re aiming for and the road towards that can be really bumpy, it\u0027s called inner work for a reason. \u0027And I think that immediately might put some people off. Going \u0027\u0027more work?\u0027\u0027 But the outer work becomes so much easier once you get to grips with the inner work and then everything starts to fall into place.\u0027\u0027Serena Williams: \u0027Do you find that that work that you do on yourself, because you know I\u0027m still learning, is that like an everyday thing or is this like a few times a week? \u0027I know how much nervous system is gonna react to certain situations that are out of my control. What can I do, what have I got in my toolbox that I know works for me? \u0027What is readily available and it\u0027s different for every single person...\u0027You\u0027ve got to put it in like just as much as brushing your teeth every morning it\u0027s got to be straight after something that\u0027s already in your day diary of this is a habit, I need to make it a habit. \u0027If it\u0027s not a habit then it\u0027s the first thing that drops away from your busy day.\u0027 \u0027Life is about learning, right. If you\u0027re in your 20s, your 30s, your 40s and even your 50s and you think that you\u0027ve got it sorted, then bad stuff\u0027s gonna happen. \u0027There\u0027s a lesson here, there\u0027s a lesson. I\u0027m being schooled by the universe. There\u0027s something in this for me to learn so that next time this happens I become more resilient or being able to see a way around it to be able to achieve the ultimate goal. \u0027And if you have that perspective then every single bad thing that happens, actually can be good.\u0027 Mr Robichaux: \u0027You know one reason we\u0027re doing this with companies is around this matter of what we were talking about is we need to reframe inner work as part of the job. Harry I\u0027m curious, what does that bring up to you? You\u0027re building a business, you\u0027re an entrepreneur, how do you think about this?\u0027Prince Harry: \u0027From an employer perspective you can\u0027t expect in today\u0027s world your people to put in the work on themselves when you\u0027re not giving them the time to be able to do that. \u0027Which is why I think it\u0027s so important as employers going \u0027\u0027you know what, if you wanna be able to do, if you have the chance to be able to do it in your own spare time, that\u0027s fantastic we fully support you. But we are going to factor that in to your routine at work\u0027\u0027. \u0027If everybody was doing that, the shift in global consciousness and awareness and self awareness would be enormous, would be vast. Again, the proof is in the pudding. \u0027Look at these companies that signed up or that had a BetterUp coaches for the last however many years and the numbers speak for themselves. The employees their potential their performance at work but also at home has increased tenfold in some cases. \u0027So not only are they better at work, therefore as an employer \u0027\u0027you\u0027re welcome, you\u0027re getting more out of me than you thought you would\u0027\u0027 but also you\u0027re creating more capacity and more ability for those iniduals when they go home to show up and be the person they need to be for their friends and their community. \u0027To be the parent they need to be for their kids. So it is one whole cycle of connectivity that ultimately means everybody around you starts to benefit. That\u0027s the way I see it.\u0027Mr Robichaux: \u0027I think that\u0027s so well said. What\u0027s your experience been with coaching?\u0027Prince Harry: \u0027To have someone there who\u0027s not only coaching you through life but as part of that is challenging your perspective. \u0027That\u0027s what I ask from my BetterUp coach on a weekly basis. I can\u0027t wait for BetterUp to be in that position to be able to make it even more accessible for people so that every single person anywhere around the world had access to a BetterUp coach and you know the biggest challenge we\u0027re gonna have is finding enough coaches. \u0027Because the demand is there, the need is there. The need\u0027s not gonna go away guys, we know that. The world\u0027s becoming harder and harder and more complicated and that\u0027s just an observation. \u0027I think people are gonna need to rely on each other and on professional help but also friends, family, maybe complete strangers. Anyone can actually help you in that coaching process. \u0027To be able to have different points of view in your life and friends who will not worry about pushing back on things that you say or things that you feel to be able to make you, well not make, encourage you to be able to see it more clearly, I view that as trying to surround myself with people who I would happily have washing the windscreen and clearing those filters so that you can be able to see your own life and the reality of that life more clearly rather than this endless filter system of what you think is happening.Mr Robichaux: \u0027I love this conversation about coaching. Before we wrap is there any final advice or coaching you would share in relation to practicing mental fitness or investing in inner work?\u0027Prince Harry: \u0027Life is about discovery. In that discovery you\u0027re gonna find things that you don\u0027t like, that make you uncomfortable. \u0027You\u0027re gonna find things that are constantly pushing back on you but as you work your way around those things, all of a sudden all of the stresses and chaos and all the things that were working against you in your life. \u0027Be it private life, work life, whatever it is that work life balance, all of the things getting in your way either fall away or you visualise them and are able to turn a negative into a positive and therefore make those things work for you.\u0027And when you get to that point, from my perspective is feels like a superpower, but it takes time. It\u0027s constant, it\u0027s a work in progress. \u0027For me personally it\u0027s like constantly buffering. It\u0027s a work in progress, some days are great some days are really hard. \u0027And no matter what I put into it I am always kicking myself going \u0027\u0027if you\u0027d done this this this which you know works for you, then you wouldn\u0027t be in this state now\u0027\u0027. \u0027So again it\u0027s work but out of all the work we do and all the things we work towards, it is the most fulfilling work apart from being a dad.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Boris appoints Steve Barclay Chief Staff ex GB News journo Guto Harri director comms","story":"Share this article In his intervention, Mr Gibb said Mr Bell had been \u0027brave\u0027 and \u0027struck a chord\u0027.He wrote: \u0027He expressed the anger and frustration of millions at rule-breaking by those most responsible for making the rules.\u0027He was not a fool for sticking by those rules. But, whether inadvertently or not, behaviour by people at the heart of government suggests that they think he was - or worse still, that the rules don\u0027t apply to them.\u0027He said his constituents were \u0027furious about the double standards\u0027.Mr Gibb said: \u0027The Prime Minister accepted the resignation of Allegra Stratton for joking about a Christmas party that she hadn\u0027t attended, but he won\u0027t take responsibility for those that he did attend.\u0027I am sorry to say that it is hard to see how it can be the case that the Prime Minister told the truth.\u0027Other Tory MPs are expected to consider over the weekend whether to write to the chairman of the 1922 Committee Sir Graham in an attempt to force a leadership contest.In an apparent move to head off further dissent, Mr Johnson has written to Tory MPs promising them a greater role in policymaking with a \u0027direct line\u0027 into No 10.The latest turmoil was triggered by the shock resignation on Thursday of Mr Johnson\u0027s long-standing policy chief Munira Mirza over his refusal to withdraw his \u0027scurrilous\u0027 accusation about Sir Keir.Speaking on Friday, Mr Javid indicated that he agreed with Chancellor Rishi Sunak, who said he would not have made those remarks.\u0027Keir Starmer, when he was running the DPP, did a good job and he should be respected for it. It is a tough job and he deserved absolute respect for that,\u0027 he told reporters.Mr Javid acknowledged Mr Johnson had subsequently \u0027clarified\u0027 his comments and insisted the Prime Minister still had his full support.However, his intervention will only fuel speculation over how much support the Prime Minister really enjoys from members of his top team.Ms Mirza\u0027s resignation was followed by the announcement that three more of the most senior figures in No 10 - chief of staff Dan Rosenfield, principal private secretary Martin Reynolds and director of communications Jack Doyle - were also leaving.The Prime Minister\u0027s official spokesperson said the departures had all been agreed before Ms Mirza tendered her resignation and that they were leaving by mutual consent.All three were to some extent implicated in the controversy over parties during lockdown.Mr Reynolds organised the notorious \u0027bring your own booze\u0027 event in the Downing Street garden while Mr Doyle was reportedly at at least one of the gatherings now under investigation by the police.While Mr Rosenfield did not join until after most of the events had taken place, he has been criticised over the Government\u0027s initial response to the report that there had been no breach of the rules.Boris Johnson\u0027s foes aim to bring him down with brutal weekend of \u0027deeply unpleasant\u0027 personal attacks on wife Carrie"},{"url":null,"title":"Whistleblowers accuse Instagram putting astronomical profits people","story":"Share this article \u0027I remember when people started getting paid to post,\u0027 recalls Cole Rise, who designed the original Instagram icon and seven of its filters.\u0027That idea quickly makes what you post a bit artificial. Where some people were doing full-on BMW ads - and it\u0027s not genuine to who they are as a person because I know that person, they don\u0027t drive a BMW.\u0027The core of Instagram, as I remember, it was just: Here\u0027s what\u0027s happening. But if what\u0027s happening is an ad, then there\u0027s an artificiality to it.\u0027 The following year, Facebook changed the chronological feed to an algorithmic one, enabling Instagram to target users with subjects in which they had shown an interest.By 2018, they had introduced tools to mute and filter followers, as well as notify them of bullying content. But the patch did not get to the root of the problem.\u0027If you want to understand why Instagram is the way it is, you have to understand how the algorithms have shaped it to be that way, said former Facebook responsible AI researcher Manish Raghavan.\u0027They are the result of people\u0027s choices. What Instagram is looking to do is keep you engaged in some way. This is slightly different from asking: What do you actually want to see?\u0027The human brain is not evolved to deal with social media. It isn\u0027t evolved to look at a screen all day and understand let\u0027s say that the thing that you\u0027re seeing on the other side of the screen isn\u0027t someone\u0027s real life.\u0027\u0027The algorithms are the most-opaque part of this whole system,\u0027 adds Messina. \u0027You can see the user behaviour, you can see sort of like the consequences of what happens as a result of being exposed to certain content, especially over and over again.\u0027But we don\u0027t necessarily understand - and some of the companies don\u0027t even understand - how content is targeted to different iniduals, what choices they made to go down certain paths. And that lack of awareness is where we\u0027re the most vulnerable.\u0027Hannah Ray, who worked at Instagram as a community manager for Europe, Middle East and Africa, recalls: \u0027There were things that we were aware of that we would feed back. Like, you know, the hashtag tag, #thinspo has just popped up and it should probably be banned.\u0027So those things would come up and then we\u0027d kind of jump on them and quickly figure out, like the best policy to do that. But you have to remember, that\u0027s alongside, loads of other firefighting issues that were popping up.\u0027I mean, daily, there were like new things coming up that I think are just part of like just how huge the platform was growing so quickly. It has gone from photography and art …to money…\u0027Facebook\u0027s struggle to improve its image was dealt a blow last year when American data analyst Frances Haugen, a former Facebook product manager, leaked thousands of the company\u0027s internal documents, revealing \u0027the conflicts of interest between what was good for the public and what was good for Facebook\u0027 and claiming the social media platform \u0027chose to optimise for its own interests, like making more money\u0027.Zuckerberg denied the allegations.Then, in October, she warned Parliament that Instagram may never be safe for schoolchildren the company\u0027s own research revealed that it turned them into addicts.The company allowed \u0027bullying to follow children home\u0027 to their bedrooms because they wanted them to get \u0027hooked\u0027 for the future of the platform,\u0027 she explained.Now, as the online safety bill, nicknamed the Nick Clegg law, after its vice-president for global affairs and communications, chugs slowly through Parliament – Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries is expected to outline shortly draconian penalties for tech firm bosses – Haugen, who worked for Facebook for two years, has warned that the App is \u0027one of the fundamental conflicts of our civilisation\u0027.\u0027The company\u0027s leadership knows how to make Facebook and Instagram safer,\u0027 she told BBC3. \u0027They have put their astronomical profits before people. We\u0027re facing one of the fundamental conflicts of our civilisation. Which is are we going to let algorithms rule us, or will people rule algorithms?\u0027This is just the beginning. And the thing that I think young people see is how intense the problems are because teenagers are killing themselves because of Instagram.\u0027I think the thing that\u0027s really important for people to understand is how Instagram differs from other social media platforms. Tik Tok is about performance. It\u0027s about doing fun things with your friends. Snapchat is about faces and augmented reality.\u0027You know, it\u0027s not actually you. It\u0027s you with a mask on. Facebook\u0027s internal research says that Instagram is about bodies and about social comparison. You know, it\u0027s seen as a little window into other people\u0027s lives and comparing like, what is your life like to theirs?\u0027According to Facebook\u0027s own research, 13 per cent of British teenagers, who thought about suicide, were driven by Instagram and one in three teenage girls think that the social media App gives them body image issues.Teenager Abby, 17, who lives in Newcastle with her mother Alyson and twin sister Jessica and is training to be a nurse, joined Instagram in 2016 and blames the App for her deteriorating mental health. She was hospitalised for self-harm in May 2021 and remains under supervised care.\u0027I probably wouldn\u0027t know what self-harm was if I didn\u0027t look on them accounts,\u0027 she said.\u0027I knew how long I had to stay under water to drown myself. I knew how many Paracetamol to take to kill myself. I knew how many minutes you\u0027d have to have something around your neck like a ligature.\u0027You\u0027d get added into groups and people would tell us to go kill myself and they\u0027d want to do it together. And they\u0027d want to video call together to self-harm together, which is just corrupt.\u0027Influencer Lauren Black blames the platform for her eating disorder. \u0027I was on Instagram like all the time,\u0027 she says. \u0027My screen time was like 13 hours a day. It was ridiculous. From the moment I woke up, to when I went to sleep, I\u0027d literally be scrolling….\u0027It\u0027s kind of no wonder that it had a negative effect on my mental health... All the images would be quite highly edited. I was comparing myself to this false person I was looking at and not really realising that that\u0027s what I was doing.\u0027I always used to use filters on Instagram, and I didn\u0027t realise how damaging they were and I always used to put like my pictures in Facetune and make my waist smaller than what it was.During Covid, I made friends with a neighbour and she\u0027d been through eating disorder recovery before she\u0027d been an inpatient. And she said: You\u0027re actually ill, you need to get help. Something clicked and I thought, you\u0027re right and I got help from there.\u0027I\u0027m literally a completely different person. Every single thing is different about me now because I\u0027ve been through so much therapy. My whole life has changed. I\u0027ve decided more recently to not edit any of my content.\u0027So, I just have it straight from my iPhone camera to Instagram not being touched. I don\u0027t want to add to the problem that is probably never going to go away by showing people this false image of myself.\u0027I feel a lot happier and healthier. I literally always smile, which I never really did before.\u0027 A Meta spokesperson said: \u0027People come to Instagram to express themselves, explore and connect. We spent approximately $5 billion on safety and security last year alone, and it continues to be our top priority.\u0027We work with experts to develop our rules, and to build features that help protect people and give them more control over their experience. We care deeply about this, and about making sure people feel good about the time they spent on Instagram.\u0027While we do, on the advice of experts, allow people to talk about their own experiences, we\u0027ve never allowed people to promote or glorify suicide or self-harm.\u0027We\u0027ve built sophisticated technology make it difficult for people to come across potentially harmful content, and to help us find and remove this content more quickly, and we\u0027re in discussions with regulators about bringing this technology to the UK.\u0027We do research so we can find problems and make changes. Our findings inform the changes we make. We want to be more open about the research we do.\u0027The research showed that on 11 of 12 wellbeing issues, teenage girls who said they struggled with the issues also said that Instagram had made them better than worse.\u0027Our policies are designed to help reduce societal pressure. We remove content that promotes miraculous claims about a diet or weight loss product, and we restrict content and ads promoting weight loss products or cosmetic procedures to people over 18.\u0027We\u0027ll also reject ads completely if they show unrealistic results, or encourage negative self-image to sell a product.\u0027The Instagram Effect airs on BBC3 Monday, February 7."},{"url":null,"title":"Boss gives 800 staff day International Womens Day","story":"Share this article Its UK boss, Simon Nicholson, said male employees were being encouraged to ‘support the women in their lives’ on the day. Mr Nicholson, a father of three, will walk with his wife as she completes a challenge to walk the equivalent of Land’s End to John O’Groats.He told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Women often put themselves at the back of the queue when it comes to looking after their health.

According to a statement posted on the website of the PNG’s National Control Centre for COVID-19, Marape received his booster vaccination against the coronavirus on Jan. 24th. On Saturday, while in Beijing Marape held a virtual meeting with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang to discuss strengthening economic cooperation, Marape’s office said. A joint statement published on China’s embassy in the United States after the meeting stated that the two sides agreed to strengthen cooperation in trade, investment, energy, resources and infrastructure, among others. Marape was to travel from Beijing to the Feb. 9-11 One Ocean Summit in the northwest of France on 9-11, held in the context of the French Presidency of the Council of the European Union, with the support of the United Nations. Marape was also scheduled to meet France’s President Emmanuel Macron, Marape’s office said earlier in the week.

He uses the quiet time to get some study done before starting on a two-hour and 40-minute journey by bus to college. Originally from Kenya, Wafula is one of some 21,000 international students studying in Ireland, many of whom are struggling.He was elated when he won a scholarship to research a PhD in finance at University College Dublin (UCD) in September 2020. Looking back, he wasn’t prepared for the challenges that lay ahead. Every day is a struggle to make ends meet, he says.His first year of study was online due to Covid restrictions. After securing temporary housing, it took Wafula more than 10 months to find suitable accommodation for his family to come to Ireland. He now lives with his wife – who is not permitted to work under her visa – and one of his children in Rathangan, Co Kildare, while the other child stays in Kenya.Wafula gets a monthly €1,500 scholarship stipend. He has worked as a tutor at the university, but his Stamp 2 visa limits him to work no more than 20 hours each week. His hours are precarious and he does not know if he will get any in the current semester.Meanwhile, his income is quickly swallowed up by his monthly rent (€1,100), electricity (€200) and daily commute (€18 a day).“It is practically impossible to live any life,” he says. “It becomes really hard to say you’re enjoying it.”Wafula admits experiencing mental health difficulties throughout his time here. “You have to put on a bold face, so your wife and kids don’t see that... I’m not enjoying the process, but maybe the outcome, which is getting a PhD and hopefully getting a job,” he says.Wafula wrote to UCD president Andrew Deeks in August, claiming international PhD students were “suffering in silence” and facing “systematic” discrimination during their time in Ireland.In a statement, UCD said international students receive an offer pack that references accommodation, the cost of living and visa advice. While the college generally has sufficient on-campus places for international students, it said that it does not currently have family accommodation.The university said PhD candidates have a student status and are deemed to be under full-time instruction, while scholarship holders are exempt from tax on their scholarship income.They are not normally employees, a spokesman said, and issues around employment are controlled by the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment.AbroadThe experiences of international students is raising wider questions around Ireland’s policy of attracting more and more students from abroad.While their higher fees are helping to plug holes in third-level funding, many international students argue that they are not being treating fairly and are not adequately warned about the cost of living or scarcity of accommodation.In Ireland, about 17,000 students from outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) are paying €10,000-€20,000 for their courses, though in some cases fees can be as high as €55,000.Most non-EEA students come from the US, China, India, Brazil, Canada and Saudi Arabia. Irish students pay a student contribution charge capped at €3,000.Bukky Adebowale, vice-president for equality and citizenship at the Union of Students in Ireland, says many international students feel they are treated as if they are cash-cows to prop up an under-funded third-level system. “They don’t feel heard,” says Adebowale.Bhumi Mehda, who is studying for a master’s in computer science, is one of them. She was required to have €40,000 in her bank account before being accepted into the State. On top of needing €25,600 for tuition fees at UCD, and after receiving some financial help from her parents, she took out a loan to finance the high cost of living in Ireland – but it still wasn’t enough.After arriving from India with her sister Jill at the end of the summer, she was met with the stark reality of Ireland’s housing crisis. Although they contacted 20-30 places a day, they struggled to find permanent accommodation. The sisters spent a month in temporary accommodation and were “freaking out” in fear of having no place to go.Less than 48 hours before they were due to leave their temporary accommodation, with no place to go, they finally secured a year-long tenancy agreement – but it didn’t come cheap. Bhumi, Jill and two friends now live close to Belfield campus in Dublin 4 and pay €2,500 a month for the two-bedroom house or €625 to share a bedroom far more than they budgeted.The  contacted all Irish universities to ask if they provide warnings to internationals regarding Ireland’s housing crisis prior to arrival. Many give general advice such as “book early” or tell students about “high demand” in the rental market. NUI Galway seems to go further than most by offering virtual “meet and greets” and information sessions for international students. The university also said it invites housing charity Threshold to provide accommodation guidance to incoming internationals.Bukky Adebowale of USI says the “honest truth” must be presented to internationals before coming to Ireland.Laura Harmon, executive director of the Irish Council for International Students, whose members include 30 higher-education institutions, says she does not think colleges are exploiting students. She argues that universities are following the national strategy on internationalising education in Ireland.But why aren’t students allowed to work more than 20 hours each week to cover their high costs? The Department of Justice, which issues their visas, maintains the sole reason for students being in the State is to study. The department said it must ensure students can survive on their own resources without relying on work.Plugging the gapThe move to “internationalise” higher education is Government policy. The Department of Education’s strategy in this area, due an update since 2020, aims to increase the economic output of these students from €819 million in 2014 to €1.15 billion by 2020 and increase the output of the English-language education sector by €200 million. The policy has been bearing fruit non-EEA students have more than doubled since 2011.The supply of lucrative international students has helped plug university finances in the years following the recession and, more recently, during the pandemic.Latest figures show Ireland’s main universities increased their student fee income in the first year of the pandemic at a time when most were confined to remote learning. No refunds were provided to international students neither were they entitled to the once-off €250 payment from the Government.“Maybe universities should not make so much money at the expense of people paying,” says Wafula.Minister for Higher Education Simon Harris is shortly expected to begin long-awaited action on the 2016 Cassells report, which aims to address key funding issues in the sector. International students like Wafula and Bhumi hope they won’t be left behind in the new vision for the sector.International students: in numbers17,000Estimated number of students from outside the European Economic Area studying in IrelandEstimated economic output generated from international studentsTuition fees for most international students"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord and just like that golfgate is brought to a swift and sudden end","story":"Is that it?Eighteen months of “Golfgate” madness dismissed in four minutes by a no-nonsense judge in a Galway courtroom.Donie Cassidy, Noel Grealish and hoteliers John and James Sweeney must have been as surprised as everyone else at the speed with which the verdict was produced. As day three of holding forth in never-ending circles around the banqueting tables of a golf society dinner drew to a close, most observers expected proceedings to spill over into another day.Senator Michael McDowell SC had just completed an excruciatingly long closing argument (at one point we noted two people asleep in his vicinity) explaining why his client, TD Noel Grealish, had absolutely no case to answer.There were three other senior counsel ready and waiting to do the same.And then suddenly, after months and months of fury and fulmination and acres of newsprint and countless hours of angry back-and-forth across the airwaves, Judge Mary Fahy dismissed the case against Grealish in a few pithy sentences.“Absolutely no evidence to show he was one of the organisers” of the infamous Golfgate dinner in Connemara. “This is a criminal prosecution. I have a reasonable doubt.”It’s a pity judges don’t bang gavels in Irish courts because this would have been the perfect time for some legal percussion. Perhaps they’ll have a gavel in the movie.“So I have to dismiss the charges.”But she wasn’t finished yet.There would be no impassioned closing addresses from Colm Smyth, Eddie Walsh and Constance Cassidy, and all three of them imported at considerable expense from the Inner Bar in Dublin. There would be no grand stand to make on behalf of their clients, because Mary Fahy was in no mood to hang around. She had heard enough.“We have to admit – anyone listening to the case – that the evidence was most impressive,” she declared, singling out witnesses John Flaherty, former captain of the guard in Leinster House, and none other than Mr Justice Séamus Woulfe as being particularly impressive.“Responsible people” who wouldn’t have gone to a dinner if they didn’t feel comfortable or safe.Judge Fahy had no doubt that the defendants did everything they thought they could do to comply with the Covid restrictions.“And in my view they did comply – not in the court of public opinion but in the court of law, in my view, they did.”This was only going one way.“So I am dismissing the charges against all the defendants.”There were no cheers. No high-fiving.Misty-eyedNoel Grealish, who was captain of the Oireachtas Golf Society, was the first politician to emerge. He looked a little flushed and misty-eyed as he stood beside his solicitor and let him do the talking. His lawyer and Oireachtas colleague McDowell, who had just triumphantly talked the case to a conclusion, was beaming.Donie Cassidy (75), who had taken the whole episode very badly, was last to leave the courthouse, flanked by the members of the Westmeath legal massive who handled his case: his senior counsel Colm Smyth, junior counsel and former Labour TD Willie Penrose and solicitor JJ Mannion.In some ways, and after hearing three days of evidence, there was a certain inevitability to this whole sorry saga ending with an emotional Donie standing on the courthouse steps in the drizzle, quoting the words of his late, beloved mother: “The truth always wins in the end.”You knew he was upset because he forgot to thank the Minister for Justice for the use of the hall.A weight was gone off his shoulders and he was mightily relieved, but the strain was etched on his face as he remembered all the people who were lost to Covid and the “friends who lost their position in life” as a result of the controversy.Should he have held the dinner at all? “In hindsight, everyone would do something maybe differently.”A few hours earlier, he was in bits with worry.“What do you think? I don’t know what to think. The last two years, oh, I couldn’t begin to tell ya. There was no talking to them. No talking to them . . . How do you think it will go?”Donie the defendant, disconsolate at lunchtime and thinking he was facing into a fourth day in court. For somebody who had been living with the aftermath of the “Golfgate” furore for 18 months, he still seemed shocked by it all.ConsideredAfter the charges were dismissed, questions were asked about whether he should have organised the dinner. The Westmeath legal massive was having none of it as former Senator Cassidy considered his reply.“The court has ruled,” they muttered behind him. “The court has ruled.” And then they gently nudged their client towards the car.All the talk, all the legal argument forgotten in the shock delivery of the verdicts.Eoghan Cole BL, who argued the case for the DPP and the State, looked disconsolate as he left the building. He had put forward a spirited fight against a star team of legal big guns (and a Supreme Court judge who attended the golf beano giving the benefit of his wisdom on the matter from the witness box). And superb he was too, noted the judge on Thursday.Inspector Peter Conlon – he was the main Garda witness – was given a torrid time in the witness box. He stuck to his view that sticking a temporary partition wall down a room of over 80 people to ide them into two legally acceptable groups did not mean they were attending separate events, or in different rooms.“It’s my assertion that it is one room by virtue of two openings made in the partition,” he said in reply to Eddie Walsh’s cultured bellowing.There were discussions on what constitutes a multiple gathering and what is the definition of an organiser. Does a moveable partition make a moveable feast? How big a gap in the partition is acceptable? Is there a difference between mingling and intermingling? Why did nearly all the witnesses seem to be seated with their backs to the action?What exactly is a “three-shot fourball single stableford Champagne scramble competition”? Inspector Conlon was able to explain that to the court. Guards like playing golf. Barristers like boasting that they know nothing about it, as they did again on Thursday.MeanderingFor all his meandering, McDowell made some excellent points in his closing argument. Not least on the intriguing question of “someone in Dublin”, maybe in the DPP’s office, keen to prosecute some of the main movers in the golf outing because of the public outcry over it?“Doubtless somebody somewhere in Dublin decided that there was a public interest in showing the public that heads would roll . . . Doubtless somebody did that in order to assuage public opinion and anger.”This anger was compounded by people “thinking that 80 people had assembled in secret, more or less, abusing their status as members of the Oireachtas” in contravention of the rules. “That was the source of all that anger and recrimination and all the disastrous consequences that followed.”He reminded the court of the atmosphere at the time.The country nearly melted down with anger, quivered McDowell.It didn’t sound like a great night anyway. Former minister Dara Calleary, who had to resign over his attendance at the function, told how he was escorted to a table and told to stay there unless he needed to go to the toilet.After the decision, some of the victorious lawyers gathered in the opulent bar of the Hardiman Hotel on Eyre Square to have a celebratory drink, watch the six o’clock news and toast the partition.Is this the end of Golfgate?The ranks of The Vindicated may now be seeking reinstatement. RTÉ’s Sean O’Rourke has already expressed a desire “to be back on air”. Big Phil Hogan will be like a Cheshire Cat. And Dara Calleary will be eyeing a ministerial return when the next reshuffle happens.As for everyone else, you’ll have to ask all the people who cancelled weddings and other events at the time. If they had known they could have had all their guests in attendance if only they had thought of getting partitions. They won’t be too happy, even if they did the right thing.Judge Fahy may have closed her case, but the court of public opinion is still in session."},{"url":null,"title":"south africa hails covid milestone as vaccine factory set for fit out","story":"The NantSA facility, the future vaccine manufacturing campus in Brackengate, Cape Town: unless there is more equity in vaccination distribution, it could take years to inoculate enough Africans to bring the pandemic under control. Photograph: Gianluigi Guercia The large empty factory on Cape Town’s outskirts did not appear like a game-changer in Africa’s bid to overcome the unequal distribution of Covid-19 vaccines globally when unveiled by president Cyril Ramaphosa last month.Devoid of equipment and employees, the building located in the northern suburb of Brackenfell resembled a vacant warehouse rather than a state-of-the-art pharmaceutical production facility, which it will become by the end of 2022.Yet South Africa’s president assured reporters its development was “a milestone” in Africa’s ambitious drive to improve vaccine equity for its 54 countries, as it aims to make – from start to finish – second-generation Covid-19 shots for distribution across the continent by the end of this year.South Africa’s leader has been highly critical of the global rollout of Covid-19 vaccines to date, saying poorer nations are last in line while rich ones get preferential treatment from vaccine producers.Official World Health Organisation (WHO) statistics show that only about 8 per cent of Africa’s 1.3 billion population had been vaccinated against Covid-19 by the end of 2021, while many developed nations have inoculated more than 60 per cent of theirs.This has prompted many healthcare experts to warn that unless there is more equity in vaccination distribution, it could take years to inoculate enough Africans to bring the pandemic under control in a region where the current dominant Covid-19 variant – Omicron – was first identified. A billion dosesFive African nations have full, albeit small, vaccine manufacturing capabilities, according to the WHO. Other vaccine facilities across the continent primarily carry out a “fill and finish” role – meaning they load and package vaccines developed and mixed elsewhere. South Africa’s new vaccine production plant, which is being developed by the US-based biotech billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong, aims to address this situation.Born and raised in South Africa, Soon-Shiong has established the company NantSA to work with the newly-launched Africa’s Access to Advanced Healthcare Coalition to produce a billion doses a year of his Covid-19 vaccine by 2025 in Brackenfell.The doctor-turned-entrepreneur’s new T-cell vaccine for Covid-19, which is being developed by his US-based company ImmunityBio Inc, is undergoing clinical trials in South Africa, Botswana, Australia and the US.There are high hopes for it, Soon-Shiong said at the Brackenfell launch, as it is designed to not only target the virus’s spike protein, like mRNA vaccines do. It also activates “killer” T-cells, a type of white blood cell that is an essential part of the immune system, to attack a nucleocapsid protein at the virus core that is crucial to its structural integrity.“An infected cell is the factory for Covid and killing these cells is the only way to get rid of this pandemic,” he said, adding: “We have developed this T-cell vaccine and we want to manufacture it in Africa, for Africa and export it to the world.”Knowledge transferThe goal is to use the ImmunityBio vaccine as a universal booster shot if it is approved by regulators in the US, EU and other countries, Soon-Shiong said.Last May, Soon-Shiong also committed an initial three billion rand (€175 million) to help facilitate the knowledge-transfer process and local capacity building in South Africa around the T-cell vaccine for Covid.Furthermore, ImmunityBio in collaboration with NantSA will provide the technology and expertise needed to manufacture this vaccine and others, as well as their ingredients. The production plant also aims to develop treatments for cancer, tuberculosis and HIVAids in the coming years.Safura Abdool Karim, a South African public health lawyer, believes that once the Brackenfell plant is up and running, it holds great potential to develop Africa’s pharmaceutical sector.“Building the capacity of local scientists is at this project’s core, so it bodes well for developing expertise here and facilitating vaccine equity for Africans. But the challenge is we are not privy to the nature of the technology and intellectual property transfer, so we will have to wait and see,” she said.However, Abdool Karim maintained Africa still faces a massive challenge in the next six to 12 months to get sufficient Covid-19 vaccines for its people.“Vaccine producers and developed countries need to provide more Covid-19 shots to Africa than they currently are. Vaccines are often shipped here close to their expiry dates even though they need to have at least a six-week shelf life.“They are also sent to African countries on very short notice with little detail of their storage needs provided in advance. So, although rich countries are not monopolising Covid-19 vaccines as much anymore, their approach to sharing with Africa still has the same effect,” she said.Stay on top of the latest news with our

digitally created home interiors to prove that antique furniture can work across modern and traditional interiors and draw in buyers.The computer-generated images, prepared as part of the twice-yearly The Collector sale, show auction lots in stylish homes with floral arrangements and a mixture of traditional and more modern design touches.Rather than simply recreate existing interiors, the creative director behind the project told The  that they wanted to create “surreal” images that would make viewers look closer.“There\u0027s a slightly surreal element in the imagery,” said Leon St-Amour, adding: “the way we\u0027ve used the colour palette, and the floral sculptures, they just push it a little bit further than what you would expect to view if we\u0027d taken a more traditional approach.”Instead of fighting against the artificial look of the images, Mr St-Amour said the team wanted to make use of them to “capture people’s imaginations”.“I was very interested in creating this feeling in the viewer where they\u0027re not quite sure what they\u0027re looking at, whether it\u0027s a real space,” he said.Antique furniture, in particular so-called brown furniture, had fallen out of fashion among middle-class families, although a revival is said to be underway thanks to millennials’ predilections for sustainability.The practical idea behind the Christie’s project is to illustrate how what are often very traditional pieces of furniture can still work in a variety of settings.“Ultimately, what the main goal is to celebrate the beauty and the uniqueness and the relevance of the works being offered in the sale and how we could highlight how they can work within different types of interiors, be they more traditional or a little bit more contemporary,” said Mr St-Amour.“The interiors that we created with this are inspired by quite traditional spaces, but they have this slightly contemporary element to them as well. It\u0027s traditional in terms of the wall mouldings, in the height of the ceiling, etc and the flooring, but then there are these slightly more contemporary touches that we\u0027ve, we\u0027ve added with the colour palette, and these amazing floral sculptures,” he added.The auction, which runs until Feb 10, includes important European and English furniture, silver, ceramics, glass, clocks and gold boxes from the 16th to the 20th century.Mr St-Amour collaborated with stylist Olly Mason, interior designer Charlotte Taylor and architectural designer Alin T. Stoica to create the three digital environments.This is the first time Christie’s has used digitally created environments to display its objects.Despite embracing state-of-the-art technology, the group started their work using traditional methods.“Before the digital renders, were created, we actually created architectural sketches, pencil drawings of the spaces and we drew on lots of inspiration as well before we\u0027d be created them so the digital layer is actually just the final part of the process,” said Mr St-Amour. More from NewsThe WHO is complicit in China’s Winter Olympics smokescreenRepublicans attack GoFundMe over block on funds to Canada\u0026#39s Covid protestersThe BBC has lost the ear of Middle EnglandNHS patients needing operations will be able to \u0026#39shop\u0026#39 online for hospitals with shortest waiting listsA Conservative free-market approach is the solution to our energy woesIcon of American West risks being cancelled after damning lost map emergesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dame helen mirren responds utterly legitimate criticism role","story":"Dame Helen Mirren has broken her silence after outcry over her casting as Golda Meir by questioning whether this means Jewish actors cannot play non-Jewish roles. The Academy award-winning actress was criticised for accepting the lead role in the upcoming biopic about Israel\u0027s first female prime minister due to the fact that she is not Jewish.Fellow actress, Dame Maureen Lipman, said last month that “ethnicity should be prioritised” in the casting for Golda, directed by Guy Nattiv, because the “ethnicity or gender of the character drives the role”. Dame Helen responded to the criticism on Friday night and told the Daily Mail that the question of her appropriateness for the role had occurred to her too, prior to accepting it.The 76-year-old told the newspaper that there was a discussion to be had about the suitability of certain actors for certain roles.It was certainly a question that I had, before I accepted the role. (Meir) is a very important person in Israeli history, she said.I said, \u0027Look Guy, I\u0027m not Jewish, and if you want to think about that, and decide to go in a different direction, no hard feelings. I will absolutely understand\u0027.However, she also added that this approach to casting raises other questions too, saying: You know, if someone who\u0027s not Jewish can\u0027t play Jewish, does someone who\u0027s Jewish play someone who\u0027s not Jewish?Dame Maureen has previously claimed that the challenge of acting was to become the character you are playing regardless of background.But Speaking on ITV\u0027s Good Morning Britain she said that actors who shared the background of their character should be looked at first.On the portrayal of Meir specifically she highlighted that the Jewishness of the character is so integral and added that if the religion fires the character, then actors from that religious group should be considered first.Responding to Dame Maureen\u0027s criticism, Mirren said: \u0027I do believe it is a discussion that has to be had - it\u0027s utterly legitimate.I very much respect Maureen. And I love her as an actress, absolutely.I\u0027d love to bump into her and sit and have a cup of tea and talk about it,\u0027 she added. Dame to dame, I suggest.She added: \u0027My only real fear is if I\u0027m really bad as Golda...in which case, I\u0027ll be toast.More from NewsThe WHO is complicit in China’s Winter Olympics smokescreenRepublicans attack GoFundMe over block on funds to Canada\u0026#39s Covid protestersThe BBC has lost the ear of Middle EnglandNHS patients needing operations will be able to \u0026#39shop\u0026#39 online for hospitals with shortest waiting listsA Conservative free-market approach is the solution to our energy woesIcon of American West risks being cancelled after damning lost map emergesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bbc has lost ear middle england","story":"Following Nadine Dorries’s coarse attack on the BBC, in which she threatened to abolish the licence fee, the Corporation placed a two-minute video on social media proclaiming it “belongs to all of us”. Insofar as it is a public service, that is true though more accurately, the BBC belongs to all who pay the £159 annual fee to consume its output legally.However, if the contention is true, an important consideration follows. If the Corporation belongs to us all then it has an obligation to make a range of programmes for us all: and it doesn’t. Many educated, middle class people of a conservative disposition find little or nothing in the BBC’s output that appeals to them. Its television programmes are formulaic, patronising and make assumptions about viewers’ values and interests that seldom coincide with reality. Its drama output portrays an urban, erse, socially liberal Britain that is not everyone’s experience, or everyone’s desire.BBC2, launched in 1964 for more sophisticated viewers, teems with programmes about homes and gardens, cooking and antiques, and the odd woke comedy show. It used to be fascinating for its nature programmes, but now outrageously provides the main public showcase for the class warrior Chris Packham, a man destined to be unhappy until human beings are wiped out and the world is run by wildlife.BBC4, designed to fill the intellectual void left by BBC2’s departure into drivel, is stocked with repeats considered too highbrow for BBC2, and focusing on ‘accessible’ documentaries presented by personalities such as Dr Lucy Worsley, whom the BBC regard as an expert on almost every aspect of world history from the Romanovs to the American Civil War (a series dressed up as a collection of ‘fibs’, which tells one all one needs to know).I would happily pay my licence fee simply to listen to Radio 3: sadly, I suspect most wouldn’t, but would like a little more before splashing their cash. If BBC2 and BBC4 no longer provide high quality television, most radio is little better. Cricket lovers are grateful to hear Test Match Special, even if the quality of its commentators has noseed, with most sounding like moonlighting soccer pundits. Radio 5 is a capable news station but lacks the punch and variety of LBC. And Radio 4, that former stalwart of middle Britain, has become a travesty.Its own pursuit of ersity creates the impression that it is on a permanent box-ticking mission. Its documentaries seem all to follow the same template, are dull and often about people wronged or oppressed in some way: in our household it is known as “Grievance FM”. The issues raised in these programmes are rarely the preoccupations of the intelligent middle-Englander for whom Radio 4 was for decades the default station.Two decades-old daily programmes, Woman’s Hour and You and Yours, tend to be epics of complaint. The four big news programmes – Today, The World at One, PM and The World Tonight are of varying quality and for the most part rooted in presumptions that are far from universally shared.This is the BBC’s centenary year. Its first General Manager – later Director General – John Reith would be horrified by the tone and quality of much of what his institution now produces. I don’t doubt his present successor, Tim Davie, is sincere when he says that there must be changes. The changes required are to end internal groupthink, develop a genuine ersity that represents conservative-minded people as well as urban hipsters, and to start to make alienated millions believe the BBC really might belong to them. Because, at the moment, it seems to belong to Islington.     More from NewsThe WHO is complicit in China’s Winter Olympics smokescreenRepublicans attack GoFundMe over block on funds to Canada\u0026#39s Covid protestersNHS patients needing operations will be able to \u0026#39shop\u0026#39 online for hospitals with shortest waiting listsA Conservative free-market approach is the solution to our energy woesIcon of American West risks being cancelled after damning lost map emergesMale, female, feline...

GoFundMe later said it would refund all donations to the Freedom Convoy 2022 fundraiser.Texas Attorney General Ken Paxon tweeted: “Patriotic Texans donated to Canadian truckers\u0027 worthy cause.”The site\u0027s refusal to host a fundraiser for Covid protests comes as US companies are under increasing pressure to curtail freedom of speech with regards to coronavirus \u0027misinformation\u0027. Spotify last week distanced itself from Joe Rogan - but said it would not remove his shows despite calls from Neil Young and other artists to drop the star podcaster over interviews with vaccine sceptics. Barack Obama\u0027s former ambassador to Canada. Bruce Heyman, said late on Saturday night appeared to weigh in behind GoFundMe, tweeting under no circumstances should any group in the USA fund disruptive activities in Canada. Period. Full stop. Truckers angry with vaccine requirements when crossing the US-Canadian border have been gathering for weeks in the capital Ottawa, but protests spread across the country yesterday with rallies in almost every major city. Police were out in force and put up barriers to limit vehicle access to Ottawa city center, as thousands of protestors - including two on horseback - joined the trucks already jamming the capital\u0027s streets.In Winnipeg, a driver was arrested for slamming his SUV into demonstrators. Four people were treated for minor injuries, police said.And in southern Alberta province, truckers continued to block a major border crossing to the US state of Montana.At an emergency meeting late Saturday, Ottawa police chief Peter Sloly requested an additional surge of resources to bring an end to what police board chair Diane Deans described as a siege of the capital.This group is a threat to our democracy, Deans said. What we\u0027re seeing is bigger than just a city of Ottawa problem, this is a nationwide insurrection. This is madness.The protesters have received support from tech magnate Elon Musk and former US president Donald Trump, who in a statement Friday called Prime Minister Justin Trudeau a far left lunatic for imposing insane Covid mandates.Texas Attorney General Ken Paxon tweeted: “Patriotic Texans donated to Canadian truckers\u0027 worthy cause.”Protesters roasted hotdogs and doled out baked goods under tarps in Ottawa on Saturday, while two men on horseback traipsed through the town, one carrying a flag in support of former U.S. President Donald Trump. In Toronto a couple of hundred health-care workers and supporters marched from the University of Toronto to Hospital Row just south of the legislature. They held placards reading, “free-dumb” and “N95 masks for all.”Demonstrators also gathered in Quebec City, Fredericton and Winnipeg, with rallies also planned for Regina, Edmonton, Vancouver,  and Victoria. Police forces in those cities say they have learned lessons from Ottawa\u0027s predicament and have developed strategies designed to protect key infrastructure, such as vital traffic corridors and hospitals, and also to prevent possible violence.Police in Winnipeg, Manitoba laid charges against a 42-year-old Manitoba man who allegedly drove his vehicle into the group of “freedom convoy” protesters gathered in that city. They said the incident took place late Friday and resulted in three men being treated at the scene for minor injuries, while a fourth man was taken to a hospital and released. The accused faces multiple charges including assault with a weapon and dangerous operation of a conveyance.“He wasn\u0027t really for or against either of the general views,” said Winnipeg Police Service spokesperson Const. Rob Carver.Many Canadians have been outraged over the crude behavior. Some protesters set fireworks on the grounds of the National War Memorial late Friday. A number carried signs and flags with swastikas last weekend and compared vaccine mandates to fascism.Protesters have said they won\u0027t leave until all mandates and Covid-19 restrictions are gone. They are also calling for the removal of Mr Trudeau\u0027s government, though it is responsible for few of the measures, most of which were put in place by provincial governments.More from NewsThe WHO is complicit in China’s Winter Olympics smokescreenThe BBC has lost the ear of Middle EnglandNHS patients needing operations will be able to \u0026#39shop\u0026#39 online for hospitals with shortest waiting listsA Conservative free-market approach is the solution to our energy woesIcon of American West risks being cancelled after damning lost map emergesMale, female, feline...

Now, more and more people are turning to itMembers of the Sheppey Support Bus Image: Adam Gerrard   Daily MirrorByEmily RetterSenior Feature Writer:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |commentsIn the snaking queue for the Sheppey Support Bus people raise their hoods against the wind screaming off the Thames Estuary. Harsh winter sun throws tired under-eye shadows into sharp relief. These folk in Minster-on-Sea, on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, are here to ask for help and that’s hard to stomach for many, embarrassing.Chantelle Stroud, , is out of electricity today. The stay-at-home mum of two under-fives and a teenager thankfully has £ on her gas meter due to a cold weather payment, administered when temperatures drop below  degrees.But without electricity, cooking is an issue. She’ll go to her mum’s. Her “big, old house”, a private rental, is “impossible to keep warm” anyway when you eke out gas. “I go to bed at six with the kids to keep warm,” she admits. “We have been ill for weeks and weeks, my eldest since before Christmas, the doctor says she has a problem with her lung. Her bedroom is freezing.” The innovative double decker bus, brainchild of Sheppey Community Development Forum, was launched in November to offer food support - a social supermarket on the lower deck - and fuel poverty support - offices on the upper deck - to the people of this deprived area. Up top sits Stevie Pettitt, a fuel and water adviser for Seashells, a local family charity, whose job is to arrange emergency fuel vouchers, supplied by Fuel Bank Foundation, to people unable to top up their gas and electricity prepayment meters. With an energy price cap rise of % in April announced by Ofgem this week, this is the frontline of Britain’s fuel poverty war.Here, Stevie stares desperation full in the face while multi-millionaire chancellor Rishi Sunak just tells us higher energy prices “are something we will have to adjust to.”He’ll have no idea what that truly means. The people here know full well about ‘adjusting’ following energy hikes last autumn - they are already skipping showers, turning off the gas so they can cook their children’s tea on electric cookers, going to bed early. And yet most say they still have either run out of electricity or gas, or have only a pound or two left. Stevie says: “I feel I am putting a sticking plaster over a gaping wound. It is heartbreaking, you can hear the devastation in their voices saying ‘I’m cold’.  “People will ask for food they don’t need to cook, they wear dressing gowns over their clothes, they make tea in flasks so they don’t use the kettle. “It’s got to the point where this is all I’m doing and nothing .” A commonplace message pings on her phone. It reads: “I’m so sorry to ask, but how many fuel vouchers are people entitled to  I’m really struggling with topping up my gas, we have been wanting to keep the three kiddies warm. I have been advised it will be switched off at am today. Could you help me please ” The limit is theoretically three a year - but Fuel Bank Foundation can’t be strict. Stevie will rush, but can only get her a voucher by tomorrow.  Ofgem’s announcement for most households means an annual bill increase of £ to £, a year. For those using prepayment meters, many in private rentals and social housing, that rise will be £ to £, on average. Sunak has offered a £ loan to families via energy companies, but this will need to be paid back over time. Also £ council tax rebates to those in bands A-D, but the Resolution Foundation has said one in  of the poorest th of families do not live in properties of these bands. This is also not due until October, when experts predict further energy cost rises.  It’s hard to comprehend what this will mean for folk on the bus, of whom all I meet rely on benefits and do not work, either due to ill-health, caring responsibilities, or struggle to find employment. The vouchers are worth £, originally designed to last ten days on average, but now barely scrape a week for many. From mid-November Stevie’s given out .

Fuel Bank Foundation has  centres across Britain handing out around  vouchers a day compared to - a year ago. Deborah Clay, , from Sheerness-on-Sea, the bus’s next stop, has been without gas since Christmas Eve. A former baker and confectioner battling bad health and living alone, she racked up energy debts so agreed to switch to a prepayment meter, paying off that debt incrementally from each top up. But on Christmas Eve when she put on £ for gas, there was a fault and it didn’t register. She had no more to add. Struggling to get hold of her energy supplier, out of minutes on her phone, she battled on with only electricity and then developed pneumonia. She’s been scared to put more money on and lose it.  Raspy with a chest infection, she begs for Stevie’s help. Her voucher will clear her debt and standing charge, which has been mounting even though she hasn’t been using gas. And the energy company, finally reached, knocks off the lost £. Today is a good day, but it’s firefighting. She calculates energy costs her around £ a fortnight, even scrimping, and without her debt.“I borrowed an electric one-bar fire and have slept on the settee,” she admits. “I’ve boiled the kettle to wash up, I shower maybe once a week, it sounds skanky. For cooking I’ve used the microwave and one ring on the cooker.” William and Susan Bunce resort to sitting in the dark. Susan, , cares for William, , who has had a mini stroke, angina, and recently suffered pleurisy twice. He feels the cold painfully. Diligent Susan puts £ on electricity and £ on gas each fortnight. It won’t reach the end of that time. An extra tenner from her carer’s allowance will usually be needed to carry them through. The heating comes on for half an hour in the morning and one hour at night in the living room only - “and some days not at all.”“We don’t sit with the lights on now,” she says. “There is street light outside.“We used to shower every day, now it’s twice a week. It does get me down sometimes.” The visitor that leaves us silent, is a mum in her twenties who asks not to be named because she fears judgement.She regularly chooses electricity over gas so she can feed her two children.Today she has around £ left on gas, £ on electricity. She is searching for work, her Universal Credit is not due until later this month.“I borrow from friends, it’s a constant loop of asking,” she says, eyes glassy with tears she won’t let fall. “I go for electric so we can eat, I have been without gas for a week. “As soon as the kids come home from school they put their dressing gowns on and sit with duvets. If it’s sunny I keep them outside running around, it’s warmer.”  Stevie is despairing. A voucher only gives “breathing space”. Matthew Cole, head of Fuel Bank Foundation, says Sunak’s measures “don’t go far enough for those who need them the most”, and wants additional targeted support. Before a pm deadline Stevie must rush to process the vouchers, responsibility weighing heavy. “The problems feel so huge, I can’t think of anything ,” she says.

How was this creature ever our Prime Minister  We will ask this in the same way someone might ponder “Why did I ever marry that Satanist  I should have had second thoughts when he gave me a birthday cake made out of a sacriced llama.” This week Boris Johnson answered a question about his illegal parties by accusing Keir Starmer of “failing to prosecute Jimmy Savile”. Next week he’ll say: “Furthermore Mr Speaker, Keir Starmer also failed to prosecute Osama bin Laden, Jack the Ripper, William the Conqueror, The Riddler, the shark in Jaws and The Daleks.”  That will be in answer to a question about photos of him at a Downing Street party, riding a pig naked with Vladimir Putin. His other strategy when he’s been caught at something is to announce a new project, to try to change the subject. In a few days he’ll tell us he’s going to build a bridge to the lost underwater city of Atlantis, and he’s changed the route of the HS railway to go there. He’ll add: “We have also set up an excellent trade deal with Basilea, Queen of the mermaids, which wouldn’t have been possiblewe were still in the European Union.” But this time it isn’t working.  One by one, his old colleagues are resigning, and making statements that go: “I cannot believe that the man who always lies has told a lie.” As his support disappears, everyone associated with him will leave. Eventually even the wallpaper he bought for £ a roll will peel itself off the wall and roll back to the interior designer, saying: “I can no longer have it on my conscience that I am decorating a wall looked at by this man.” Laura Kuenssberg will appear on the news saying: “This is a massive blow for the Prime Minister. Now the worry for Downing Street is that other furnishings may follow. There are rumours that one of the curtains is on the verge of resigning and two of his taps were seen leaving in a taxi this afternoon.”ClearoutEven now, Johnson tries to claim the staff who resigned didn’t resign – it was him who “cleared them out”. He’ll explain further: “They’ve left because they’re dead. They all exploded, so everything’s going to plan.” And he makes comments such as: “The British people are sick of hearing about how we lied and cheated about the parties we had through the ­lockdown. They want us to move on to lying and cheating about more important issues such as energy prices and Ukraine instead.” Now we’re in the crazy final days of a filthy empire, so anything can happen. There will be an interview with Nadine Dorries for BBC news, in which she writhes naked on the floor talking in tongues, which Jacob Rees-Mogg translates as “Boris is the truth, the light, praise be upon him.” In  years, children will read of these times and ask how they happened, and the finest minds of the day will answer: “I really have no idea.”Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonKeir StarmerHouse of CommonsConservative PartyEuropean UnionJimmy SavileJacob Rees-MoggWilliam the conquerorVladimir PutinOsama bin LadenPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Chancellor’s aides blamed a “typo” in a national newspaper column he wrote saying a colder than usual winter was one cause of imminent bill hikes. In fact this winter is warmer than usual.Mr Sunak, the wealthiest member of Boris Johnson ’s Cabinet, used his self-penned article to try to distance the Tories from the power crisis.He wrote: “There are a few factors causing energy prices to rise so dramatically and unfortunately they are mostly out of the Government’s control. One is the steep rise in demand for gas in places such as China, which has pushed up global prices. “Another is the fact that we have had a colder than usual winter so we have used up more of our own stores of gas here at home.” His team claim the typo was on the “colder winter” phrase. A web version of the column was changed after weather experts rubbished the claim. The Met Office said this winter’s temperature averages .C so far – .C warmer than over the three decades to .And Aurora Energy Research commodities head Anise Ganbold said: “On average, gas demand is % below the past four winters.”The GMB union’s national secretary Andy Prendergast last night said: “ Rishi Sunak is either hopelessly out of touch or deliberately misleading people.“We all know it’s a mild winter. The Chancellor needs to spend more time worrying about gas and less time gaslighting the nation.” Mr Sunak also wrote in his article that the factors he listed meant “on average, people will be seeing their energy bills rise by £”. The increase will start in April after the cap on energy prices was raised % by regulator Ofgem. Mr Sunak this week offered consumers £ off their bills from October in what was touted as a Government goodwill gesture. But it emerged the deal is simply a “buy now pay later” style loan that hard-pressed families must pay back over two years. Households in council tax bands A to D will get a one-off £ rebate in April. Charities say it is not enough and is not targeted at those who need it most. A Treasury spokesman said: “As the Chancellor set out, the reasons gas prices are soaring are global. “No country in western Europe has been unaffected by the unprecedented wholesale gas volatility. It is incorrect to suggest the UK is uniquely exposed to it.” Ex-Labour leader Ed Miliband branded Mr Sunak’s response to the energy price crisis “inadequate”. He said: “The Chancel-lor should have adopted Labour ’s plan for a windfall tax on oil and gas producers to help fund a support package for families.“Instead he chose to side with those companies making billions, not the millions facing hardship this winter.” Annual profits at energy giant Shell rose to £.billion. BP is expected next week to report a profit of almost £. billion. In  the Rough gas storage facility in the North Sea – Britain’s biggest – was shut because the Conservatives refused to subsidise repairs. Now the nation has storage for only % of need, leaving us reliant on supplies from Europe and Russia. Mr Sunak did not mention that the Tories were alerted at the time that closing Rough could lead to a power crisis.  Amid rising fears over energy, the Bank of England has warned of a dramatic fall in living standards – with take-home pay suffering the biggest hit on record and inflation expected to top % in April. The gap between pay and living costs is growing due to soaring prices for energy, food and petrol, TUC analysis shows. Pay growth is down to .% on average, it found – with key workers who kept the UK going in the pandemic, such as transport and retail staff, even worse off. It said low pay will reduce consumer spending and further weaken the fragile economy, adding: “Britain needs a pay rise.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Labour PartyConservative PartyThe TreasuryEnergyEnergy billsGas pricesLiving standardsPoliticsSunday Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

And as more British troops are sent to square up against Vladimir Putin’s forces on Ukraine’s borders, shadow Foreign Secretary David Lammy and shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves say that cash must be ed.They say in their letter: “It is shameful that Britain is repeatedly described as the money-laundering capital of the world. “It is in our national and economic interests to address the challenges of hostile influence and interference which the Government’s inaction and behaviour have regrettably permitted.” And Mr Lammy told the Sunday Mirror: “The cosy links between the Conservative Party and Russian-linked donors raise serious questions about our national security at a time when tensions with Russia are on the rise. “While Boris Johnson tries to talk tough with Vladimir Putin, his own party has been raking in millions from donors with links to Russia.” President Joe Biden has been warned by US diplomats that Russian money swilling around the UK may hamper Britain’s response to the Ukraine crisis. And London mayor Sadiq Khan is calling for a register of overseas property ownership to combat money laundering and stop the capital being dubbed “Londongrad”.Mr Khan said: “Ministers have turned a blind eye to the use of our capital city as a safe harbour for corrupt funds. Sunlight is the best disinfectant.” Nearly , properties in England and Wales are now owned by overseas-based buyers, up from , in . London now has , of these properties, with the highest concentration in Westminster where , neighbour Parliament.  Some are owned by allies of Vladimir Putin while many are left empty denying homes to Brits who need them. The lack of transparency means that many of these flats and houses could dodge sanctions the PM may slap on RussiansUkraine is invaded. Mr Khan added: ”Property in London plays a central role in harbouring illicit funds from around the world. That results in many properties being left empty when many Londoners are struggling to afford a home to buy or rent. “It will prevent the government acting on their tough talk about further sanctionsthey are imposed on Putin’s regime” The last estimate of corrupt money flowing into Britain put the figure at £billion a year. Labour now says recommendations from Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee report in  into Russian cash must be implemented in full.  The Lammy Reeves letter says: “There is much more we must do irrespective of the decisions made by President Putin, measures it should not have taken an army threatening Ukraine to put in place. “The government has been asleep at the wheel and needlessly left our defences down at home.” The pair want to see Companies House reformed to stop fraud, a registration scheme for foreign agents, new laws on computer misuse and a tightening of the rules on political donations. They also want an end to so-called “golden visas” which allow rich Russians to set up shop here.An analysis of Tory funding by Labour chair Anneliese Dodds shows that by last year Tory coffers had been swelled by a total of £,,. from Russian linked donors.Russian oligarchs flooded into Britain after Labour PM Gordon Brown decided any foreigner with a spare £million to invest could settle in the UK, few questions asked. It was such a successful fund raiser that in  Tory Chancellor George Osborne doubled the cost of investor visas to £million in exchange for full residency rights within five years. For £million the paperwork would be completed in two. A Conservative Party spokesman said: “The Conservative Party only accepts donations from permissible sources, namely iniduals registered on the UK’s electoral roll or U.K. registered companies. “Donations are transparently declared to the Electoral Commission and openly published by them.

And she blamed the Prime Ministeraposs researchers and advisers for hoods Boris Johnson has said in Parliament, insisting he tells the truth to the best of his knowledge.The Culture Secretary appeared affronted when she was asked by host Charlie Stayt when she last spoke to Boris Johnson, whom sheaposd been sent on TV to defend. Asked when sheaposd last spoken to the Prime Minister, Ms Dorries shrugged, looked quizzically into her webcam, and replied: Why  During the exchange, Stayt said he was really confused, asking Ms Dorrieshis question was a dficult one. The presenter asked: Have you spoken to the Prime Minister recently, in the last  hours  After a brief pause, a smiling Ms Dorries replied: Why  Why are you asking me that question  Stayt replied: Iaposd like to know. Dorries simply said: Weaposve communicated.  Appearing perplexed, Stayt went on to say: Iaposm really confused. Is that a dficult question  Iaposm just askingyouaposve spoken to the Prime Minister, in the last  hours. Dorries repeated: We have communicated. Stayt went on to ask what Mr Johnson had communicated to her, but Ms Dorries declined to go into detail. She said: Iaposm not going to tell you the extent of my communications with the Prime Minister. I mean, Iaposve answered your question. We have communicated. What is your next question  When Stayt asked about the PMaposs mood, Dorries described it as very positive, extremely positive. Elsewhere in her media round, she mixed up two Tory MPs with the same surname, claimed % of Tory MPs back the PM and blamed remainer enemies for plotting against him. She admitted there are a number of reasons actually, itaposs not just one, but she said: That certainly is at play with a group.  However, out of the  Tory MPs who have so far publicly called on Boris Johnson to go, just seven of those had publicly backed remaining in the EU in the  referendum.One of those who has said the Prime Minister should go is David Davis, who served as Brexit Secretary, and another is strident Brexiteer Andrew Bridgen.But Ms Dorries told Times Radio: There are a small number of voices, whether they are people who were ardent supporters of Remain, who see this as their last opportunity to reverse Brexit. Ms Dorries was also forced to insist Mr Johnson tells the truth as the PM came under sustained pressure over the future of his premiership. She said Mr Johnson told the truth to the best of his knowledge based on what he was told by his aides. Challenged about a claim made by Mr Johnson in the Commons about the number of people in work before and after the pandemic, Ms Dorries told BBC Breakfast: He will have been given by advisers and researchers the fact that there were more people in work than there were at the beginning of the pandemic, not on the payroll. She said: So did he tell the truth when he quoted that  Yes, he told the truth as it was given to him. I can personally tell you that the Prime Minister, when he stands at the despatch box and makes quotes like the one you just quoted, is because the researchers and his advisers will have given him that quote, and thataposs... and he was truthful, to the best of his knowledge, when he made that quote, she said. She added: The Prime Minister does tell the truth.  Honesty was one of the key reasons former minister Nick Gibb said on Friday that he could no longer support the PM, and had submitted a letter of no confidence to Sir Graham Brady. Writing in The , Mr Gibb, MP for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, said his constituents were furious about the double standards and he said the Prime Minister had been inaccurate in statements to the Commons. He said: The Prime Minister accepted the resignation of Allegra Stratton for joking about a Christmas party that she hadnapost attended, but he wonapost take responsibility for those that he did attend. I am sorry to say that it is hard to see how it can be the case that the Prime Minister told the truth. The MP said: To restore trust, we need to change the Prime Minister. Backbencher Aaron Bellalso declared publicly he had submitted a letter calling for a vote of no confidence in his leader. John Glen, a Treasury minister and Salisbury MP, said the situation with No  was deeply uncomfortable, disappointing, and embarrassing. Writing in his local newspaper The Salisbury Journal, he did not call for the Prime Minister to resign but said: The culture in Number  fell short of what the country had a right to expect, and responsibility must be taken for the mistakes that were made. The interventions brought the number of Tory MPs who have now publicly called for Mr Johnson to resign to . Privately, the number is expected to be higher.  Mr Johnson also lost five No  aides in  hours on Thursday and Friday. But Ms Dorries insisted % of Conservative MPs were behind the Prime Minister.This included, she said, the Health Secretary following comments over the Prime Ministeraposs allegation that Sir Keir Starmer failed to prosecute Jimmy Savile. She said: I spoke to Sajid Javid last night and he reassured me that he is % behind the Prime Minister.In fact, I think heaposs quite shocked at how his comments have been interpreted.  Mr Javid said Sir Keir deserved absolute respect for the job he did as director of public prosecutions and that it was important that the Prime Minister claried his earlier accusation that Sir Keir had failed to prosecute Savile.Earlier, Chancellor Rishi Sunak had said he would not have made the comments.Ms Dorries said her Cabinet colleague was entitled to his views. Ms Dorries told BBC Radio aposs Today programme that anybody who leads an organisation, like the Prime Minister leads the Government or Keir Starmer led the Crown Prosecution Service, when something goes wrong, you take responsibility and you apologise. She said: Rishi Sunak is entitled to his views and you know, heaposs entitled to say... make any comments that he wants to. Ms Dorries was defending the Prime Minister as other Tory MPs are expected to consider over the weekend whether to write to the chairman of the  Committee Sir Graham in an attempt to force a leadership contest.Former minister Dr Liam Fox has said he is waiting to see what comes out of the full Sue Gray report into the partygate saga.Mr Johnson was facing fresh accusations on Saturday after The Mirror reported that the politan Police had been handed a photograph of Mr Johnson holding a beer at an alleged gathering in June  to mark the Prime Ministeraposs birthday.

Image: Getty ImagesByMikey SmithWhitehall Correspondent:,  Feb |comments Tens of thousands of pounds have been spent on Sue Gray’s party inquiry, the People has been told - as Boris Johnson scrambles to cling on to Downing Street.Some sources estimate the cost of the Partygate probe could be as high as £,. And up to £, more could be being splashed on the Met’s investigation into lockdown-busting parties in Downing Street, as police officers st through hundreds of photographs, CCTV images and other evidence. A senior former officer told the People last nightthe police have been left in a “no-win situation” over the politically-charged probe - and are “not the appropriate agency to deal with this.” A Cabinet Office source said no aposadditional public moneyapos had been spent on the Sue Gray inquiry. But several senior civil servants from the Propriety and Ethics unit have been devoting their working time to the probe for weeks.Asked by Deputy Labour Leader Angela Rayner to officially confirm the cost of the Sue Gray inquiry, Tory Cabinet Office Minister Michael Ellis refused.He said: The Government does not comment on internal resourcing matters.  Ms Rayner told the People: Time after time, taxpayers are paying the price for the Prime Ministeraposs personal failures. Boris Johnson could have saved so much time and expense by simply telling the truth in the first place, and now heaposs adding insult to injury by refusing to come clean on the costs. It would be an utter insultthis time and money was spent on an investigation that didnapost see the light of day. The Prime Minister cannot be allowed to break his promise to publish the report in full. Lib Dem Treasury Spokesperson Christine Jardine MP added: If Boris Johnson had just come clean and answered a simple question, taxpayeraposs cash could have been saved. Instead money that could have been spent helping people with their energy bills is being used to find out which Downing Street parties Boris Johnson attended. The whole situation is absurd. Ministers must publish the full Sue Gray report including any photos to prevent an expensive Whitehall whitewash. Tory MPs faced a weekend of soul-searching over whether to send letters of no-confidence in Boris Johnson’s leadership, following a chaotic “clear-out” of senior Downing Street staff and advisors. As many as  backbenchers from all wings of the party have publicly urged Mr Johnson to call time on his premiership. And sources suggested the total number of no-confidence letters sent to backbench chief Sir Graham Brady could be in the forties - just a handful away from triggering a vote. And the PM came under more pressure yesterdayas the Daily Mirror revealed police had been given a photograph of Mr Johnson holding a beer at a birthday party in Number , allegedly against lockdown rules. The birthday snap, taken by Andrew Parsons, one of Mr Johnson’s tax-funded vanity photographers, is understood to be among  photographs handed to the police by Sue Gray’s team. Peter Kirkham, a former Detective Chief Inspector with Scotland Yard, said a team of five to  officers sting through vast swathes of evidence over a period of weeks could cost in excess of £,.  He said the Met Police would be “torn” between carrying out a throrough investigation to avoid any “unexploded bombs”, while keeping the costs as low as possible. But he also said the scandal had left police chiefs in a dficult position because they faced being criticised for failing to investigate, while also being hammered for spending taxpayersapos cash. Mr Kirkham said: “This is why the police do not do reactive investigations of minor offences that are only going to lead to a fine. “Eventhese people get the full £, ticket, although most of them will not, the question is aposWhy are we spending all this money to achieve this apos “With other minor offences like speeding, we ask what are the justications for spending a shedload of money  Normally there isnapost one, to spend vast amounts of money like this. This isnapost murder, itaposs not got le imprisonment attached to it.” More than , violent crime offences were recorded in London in - - an increase of , in five years. Meanwhile, despite a promised £.bn increase in force budgets next year, police forces in England and Wales have struggled to cope with overall budget cuts of around % over the previous decade. “This is almost a political decision, the decision to investigate it is unusual, Mr Kirkham added. “Itaposs politically skewed because this is the Prime Minister, itaposs the heart of Government and it raises public interest issues.” Referring to the dficulties facing investigating officers and Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick, Mr Kirkham said: “The police didnapost want this investigation in the first place but the Commissioner is in a no-win situation. “If she doesnapost spend the money she would be criticised for going at it half-cocked and aposhelping Boris off the hookapos, thataposs how it would be portrayed. “If she does spend the money and someone adds the costs up retrospectively, theyaposll say it cost us huge sums to achieve fines of a few hundred quid. She loses every time. “Thataposs why the police are not the appropriate agency to deal with this.” A Whitehall insider claimed Mr Johnson was “totally consumed with saving himself” - having spoken with  MPs one-to-one in recent weeks, yet only had calls with six world leaders. “He even missed a call with Putin because heaposs too busy trying to save himself,” the source said. But they said Mr Johnson would “welcome” a no-confidence vote being held by the party, and believes he would win it easily. “When that stuff lands thereaposs no way weaposre not going to go over the tipping point,” the source said. “The vote is % coming. But he doesnapost mind. The earlier the better.” They added: “Once he wins the confidence vote - and he will win the confidence vote - heaposs got a year.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyLiberal DemocratsScotland Yardpolitan PoliceNadine DorriesAndrew ParsonsBoris JohnsonCressida DickGraham BradyCCTVBirthday partyCCTV footageCivil servantsEnergy billsPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Mr Johnson has been calling Conservative MPs as he bids to shore up his embattled leadership. The PM dialled up former Defence Minister Johnny Mercer - a prominent critic - but Mr Mercer soon forgot what the conversation was about.The MP’s we Felicity Cornelius-Mercer tweeted at .pm on Saturday: “So..funny story…the Prime Minister rang tonight directly after an afternoon of FA Cup football and England rugby.“Andwas so p***** he can’t remember what was said. “Thinking of winding him up tomorrow…I heard Johnny Boris say………suggestions please.”  Mr Mercer posted this morning: “In other breaking news, wives have a mind and a le of their own. “She’s on this nuts journey with me - the highs and many lows. “She is more than entitled to take the p**s out of me the PM whoever she likes.”It comes as embattled Boris Johnson faces a crunch week for his crisis-hit premiership as Tory MPs hold his fate in their hands.The beleaguered Prime Minister reportedly hopes to limp through to Friday when the Commons goes into recess for February half-term. But he could be just days away from a vote to oust him as rattled backbenchers continue to send Tory  Committee chairman Sir Graham Brady letters demanding a no-confidence ballot. Even the PM’s we Carrie has reportedly told friends it might be preferable for her husband to quit No. “She was saying she had had enough a couple of weeks ago. “She was telling friends the pressure on her was too much and sheaposd be happierhe left,” a source told the Sunday Times.But the PM - who vowed this week he would be re-elected in  and said Iaposve got a lot more to do - claimed tanks would be needed to force him from Downing Street.“He’s making very clear that they’ll have to send a Panzer ision to get him out of there,” a source told the paper.Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng admitted there was “fevered speculation” about how many letters Sir Graham has received, saying no-one really knew how many had been signed.Some claims suggest the PM’s critics could be just a handful of letters away from securing a confidence ballot. Mr Johnson spent the weekend building a new inner circle after five aides walked out in  hours last week.The PM appointed former BBC journalist Guto Harri as his top spin doctor, and parachuted in Cabinet Office Minister Steve Barclay to be his chief of staff.But three previous Chiefs of Staff voiced doubts over whether itaposll be possible. Mr Barclay is already the £, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the £, MP for North East Cambridgeshire Labour ’s deputy leader Angela Rayner said: The Prime Minister has clearly run out of serious people willing to serve under his chaotic and incompetent leadership so now expects a Cabinet Minister to be his chief of staff.“This is a farce.

Young prisoners are being entertained with bingo to stop them from misbehaving. Inmates at a young offender institution compete for prizes like chocolate, sweets and extra phone credit. Staff hand each lag a bingo card and read out the numbers using the in-cell communication system. When they get a line of five, they press their bell.

The Independent Monitoring Board jail watchdog said: “Imaginative innovations by officers helped build relationships and lessened prisoners’ boredom.

At first Amelie thought it was a friend until she “looked down and saw the crocodile ”.She she saw the beast swim under and around her to “measure the size of me”, before it snapped and dragged her underwater.  Although she couldn’t breathe, her pal held on to her le jacket by the shoulders as she desperately kicked the creature. She said: “You just think how do I get out  How do we escape this  At that point, I was just so ridiculously grateful that my friend was in the water.”After being saved, she had to wait  minutes for a rescue helicopter with no pain relief. As they waited, her friend told her not to look at her legs - but she replied: “It’s okay, tell them to amputate both my legs.” She added she looked down and I “knew in my head” there was no saving them. “I nearly lost my le, losing my legs compared to that is nothing,” she said. After having seven operations, she can now walk on crutches and hopes to go to university in September.Despite her terrying ordeal, she says she now intends toto the country to help build a school.

Millions face being dragged down into fuel poverty from April when typical energy bills will rocket by up to £, to £, a year. Yet Britain’s biggest energy firms still raked in £billion of profit in  – with their bosses listed among the UK’s top earners. And today, the Sunday People reveals the huge pay and perks they hand out, which a union has branded “repugnant bandit capitalism”.Chancellor Rishi Sunak has offered customers £ off their bills from October in a buy-now-pay-later-style loan. But the scheme has been attacked for failing to target those most in need. High bills for customers will last at least two years Chris O’Shea, chief executive of British Gas owner Centrica, warned last month. He is among five execs paid almost £m last year, taking home £, in pay and benefits. The average full-time weekly wage in the UK is £.Centrica’s most recent accounts showed operating profits of £m and at least four board members are multi-millionaires. Its non-executive directors were paid almost £m. SSE, which recorded profits of £.bn in , gave £.m to its chief Alistair Phillips-Davies. It paid its directors almost £.m in . The OVO Energy-owned company was slammed last month for advising customers to keep their heating bills low by cuddling pets, eating porridge and “doing a few star jumps”. Analysis of E.On, EDF and Scottish Power’s most recent accounts showed they paid their top brass £.m between them. E.On, which had to apologise for sending socks to customers branded with advice to turn down heating, made £m in profits in . Chief executive Michael Lewis was rewarded with an estimated £m. EDF boss Simone Rossi earned a similar amount, despite the French-owned company recording a £m loss in the UK.And Scottish Power paid £.m to three directors, with chief Keith Anderson believed to be on £.m and a £, pension benefit. NPower – one of the “Big Six” ­energy firms until it was taken over by E.On – handed £.m to its directors in , ­company accounts show. Critics want a windfall tax on the energy giants, plus oil and gas ­producers whose annual profits have quadrupled as barrel prices rocket. Shell’s earnings quadrupled to £.bn for the year. BP is expected to next week report bumper annual profits of almost £.bn. Its chief executive Bernard Looney ­described BP in November as “a cash machine at these types of prices”.GMB union national secretary Andy Prendergast said: “Energy bosses are trousering eye-watering sums while bumping up bills so much that working people have to choose between eating and heating. It’s bandit capitalism and it’s repugnant. “Until we fix the UK’s broken ­energy policy, tens of millions will continue to suffer – while these fatcats get the cream.” Former Labour leader Ed Miliband said: “The Chancellor should have adopted Labour’s plan for a windfall tax on the oil and producers to help fund a fair package of support of around £ for families and up to £ for those in the greatest need. “Instead he chose to side with the oil and gas companies making billions, not the millions facing hardship this winter.” Newcastle Labour MP Chi Onwurah added: “The Tories are once again making the wrong choices, we need a cut in VAT paid for by a windfall tax on the excess profits of the big gas companies.”Mr Sunak said help of £ per household – including a £ council tax rebate in bands A-D – would “ease” people’s anxiety over the increase. He told the Commons: “It is not sustainable to keep holding the price of energy articially low. For me to stand here and pretend we don’t have to adjust to paying higher prices would be wrong and dishonest.”But the Bank of England warned Mr Sunak’s measures would do little to avert a dramatic fall in living standards. It warned households to brace for the biggest hit to take-home pay since records began. Yesterday, it emerged the average household water bill in England and Wales is set to rise by about £ to £. Emma Pinchbeck, chief exec of Energy UK, representing the Big Six, said: “The record international wholesale gas price rises seen since the last price cap has led to  suppliers exiting the market since August – with those remaining losing up to hundreds of pounds per customer.“Suppliers need to be able to recoup these costs but we do not expect customers to shoulder the burden from this exceptional and unprecedented ­period. Suppliers will continue to do all they can to help and support customers, especially the most vulnerable, but a rise of this scale needs the Government to step in.” Low-paid workers who kept the country going through the pandemic have been hit hardest by the squeeze on living standards. With inflation expected to rise above % in April, analysis shows the gap between pay, which grew by just .% on average, and living costs is getting wider. The findings come after the Bank of England’s £,-a-year governor Andrew Bailey sparked anger by saying workers should not demand higher pay because this could lead to price rises becoming “ingrained”. The TUC warns low pay will reduce consumer spending and further hit the economy.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON British GasEnergy billsPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

And as he does, the reckless rider is also seen pulling out in front of a black taxi and almost knocking over another cyclist.He then continues to show flagrant disregard for other road users - making it impossible for any to overtake him.Then, with motorists backed up behind him, he even slowed down to take a selfie before whizzing off and almost crashing into a commuter as he ran a red light.  The driver who filmed the incident told The Sun: Cyclist riding the middle of the road despite having a cycle lane by him, making it impossible to overtake. At the same time taking advantage of the no punishment on riding without any hands on the handlebars to steer the bicycle as his hands busy on his mobile phone taking selfies and with the other hand holding what appears to be a takeaway.The major Highway Code revamp came into effect last Saturday and is aimed to boost protection for cyclists and pedestrians. But motorists have been fighting back and calling for the new laws, which they say are unfair, to be scrapped. The new guidance means traffic should give way when pedestrians are crossing or waiting to cross at junctions. Cyclists are advised to ride in the centre of lanes on quieter roads, in slower-moving traffic, and when approaching junctions, to make themselves as visible as possible.A hierarchy of road users has also been introduced, meaning someone driving will have more responsibility to watch out for people cycling, walking, or riding a horse, and cyclists will have more responsibility to be aware of pedestrians.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON SelfiesDangerous drivingCyclistsCars\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Now, in the Queen’s historic address, she has received the ultimate accolade. Elizabeth II has reigned for  years and been an exemplary monarch. Her calm demeanour, sense of duty and loyalty to her country have made her beloved here and around the world. Now, on this most special of days, she has set out part of the country’s future: Camilla. The grand gesture of announcing that Charles’s we will become Queen Consort is the very highest mark of respect. It shows her trust and admiration for a woman she believes will continue the tradition of service she has worked hard to uphold.  It has not been easy for Camilla to follow Diana, so loved by so many. Yet she has risen to the challenge with quiet dignity and been a steady presence in tumultuous times that have engulfed the family. For the Queen to call on us to give Camilla our support when she takes her place is a typically wondrous gesture. It forms the centre of a special message from a special monarch, so adept at finding the right words at the right time. Another mark of Her Majesty’s great sense of respect and loyalty is that she should take time to mention how she can still recall her father’s death. And there is no mistaking her palpable excitement for the momentous Jubilee. As she declares, just like with all her service over  years, she will continue to lead “with all my heart”.

The average UK household wastes around £ a year by throwing away food. The total amount of produce wasted is around . million tons. But food apps such as OLIO and Too Good To Go help prevent waste by connecting people to bargain bags of surplus supplies from supermarkets and other firms. Tom Church, co-founder of LatestDeals, says: “The huge benefit of these apps, as well as being budget-friendly, is that it’s much better for the environment. Less wasting food and less wasting money means everyone’s a winner.” Here, some savvy shoppers who explain how the apps have made a huge dference to their lives. Knowing you’re helping people in need is greatAlex Bak managed to eat for free for the first six months of the pandemic.The NHS worker has been a regular user of the OLIO app since March  – and now uses it to get bargain groceries two to three times a week. Every penny the -year-old saves is being put towards a deposit for a house.Alex says: “To know you are helping reduce waste by using food that would otherwise be thrown out, and to know you could be helping someone  who really needs it, is a great feeling. “I wanted to see how far I could go with it. For the first six months of the pandemic, I didn’t spend any money on food. Every single thing was from the app.” Among the items Alex collected from other people’s homes were sandwiches and salads from Pret A Manger, and fresh fruit, vegetables and bread from Tesco. During the first lockdown, Alex, who works as a clinical research practitioner, told how going to collect food was a great way of combining her daily exercise with reducing waste and saving money. Alex, who lives with three flatmates in Bethnal Green, East London, says: “I used to spend £ to £ a week on food. That’s now more like £ to £ a week, so I’m saving on average £ – and helping reduce waste.” The apps mean there’s no need for food waste Kind-hearted Kathryn Neale not only uses OLIO and Too Good To Go to save money, but she shares fresh produce with local foodbanks and care homes, too. The -year-old single mum, who has four children, works as a volunteer food collector. She says: “I get milk vouchers for my little two and have been getting the government vouchers for the big two but it’s not been quite enough. I still need to get fresh fruit and veg and keep a good supply of full-fat milk in the fridge for the little ones so getting a Morrisons box once a week has been a great help. “It’s £. and although it is meant to be a veg box, it can consist of anything that is reduced or damaged but is always edible and should be up to the value of £.” As well as picking up cut-price food for herself, Kathryn also delivers reduced produce to other people, including shielding pensioners and her parents. She believes thatyou don’t want or need certain food, there is no excuse for binning it as almost everything can be frozen or given to people who can use it via apps like OLIO. It’s encouraged me to be creative in the kitchen Last year, Julia Wilson’s -year-old husband Peter had a stroke so she gave up her job as a carer to look after him full-time. She discovered food-saving app Too Good To Go while browsing the internet three years ago and says it has been “a leline” for them. Julia, , says: “You don’t get paid much for being a carer, but Too Good To Go has been brilliant. We used to spend a horrendous amount on food – about £ a week. Now we spend around £. It’s been a real leline for us.” Julia uses the app to buy hugely discounted bags from Morrisons the most. But she also gets cakes from Greggs and other local shops like Hobbs House Bakery. She reserves magic bags via the site around three times a week. Julia, of Coalpit Heath, South Glos, said: “They are only a few pounds, most often for produce worth well over £. “Christmas was just overwhelming. We had mince pies, chocolate cake… so many things. And it’s really inspired me to come up with dferent dishes in the kitchen, which has just been so enjoyable.” We’re using the £, I’ve saved on trip to Florida Going out at pm to pick up a “magic bag” of food from her nearest One Stop shop has become a ritual for savvy mum Sarah Colley. The  year-old, the head of finance for an online menswear retailer, has shaved thousands of pounds off her weekly food shop thanks to the Too Good To Go app. Sarah, who lives with her solicitor husband Andy, , and son Joseph, six, says: “We’ve been saving an average of about £ a week so over  months, it’s been a saving of about £,. “The money we’ve saved is in a holiday fund. We’ve rebooked a trip to Florida that we were hoping to do before the pandemic and we’re using the money to go for longer.” Sarah, of Scarborough, North Yorks, says: “Each retailer sets the price of the bags. They’ll say how many they have at the end of the day on the app and you go and pick one up. “You spend around £. for a magic bag and it’s like a lottery because you have no idea what you’re getting. “One of my colleagues jokes, ‘You’re an accountant from Yorkshire so you’re going to be a bit tight’, which is probably true. But I don’t like seeing food go to wasteI can either use it myself or give it to people at work.” I was impressed with the boxes... they helped a lot Widow Shelly Kelly, , is a carer with an eye for a bargain. The mum of four swears by the Too Good To Go app after she once managed to get £ worth of groceries for just £. Shelly says: “I picked up two Morrisons boxes using the app and was very impressed. It helped me out a lot. And by paying £. for  bags of fruit and veg, I essentially only paid p for each item.” Fruit and veg are key items in the boxes – and Shelly told how you can make huge savings.  She says: “The best bargain was  punnets of strawberries. The total price originally would have been £. using the offers in store. “Ten punnets were £. each or two for £ making the total price £ with the offer, and the remaining three were £. each or two for £, so the original price would have been £.. However I only paid £. for these, saving £. in the process.” Shelly, from Leamington Spa, Warks, adds: “I froze a lot of it… the kids made a lot of smoothies and milkshakes with it. Frozen strawberries were also great in my gin!” How the free food apps work The apps involve picking up perfectly good food from cafes, restaurants, bakeries and shops near you, so you have to be willing to collect it. Too Good To Go has more than  million users worldwide and says it saves more than , meals each day. Users simply register for free and can pick up “magic bags”, which contain ious items from big-brand chains such as Greggs, Costa and Waitrose. OLIO is also free to download with an optional supporter donation of £. a month. It allows people to fetch food from all the usual sources, as well as from neighbours, who might be throwing away good food because they are moving home or going on holiday.  The app also includes a goodwill scheme in which you can sign up to be a volunteer, picking up food for others. Other popular food apps include Karma, which works similarly to Too Good To Go but focuses on local outlets. The food offered on the app is sold as inidual discounted meals so you know what you’re getting – handyyou’re a vegetarian or have food allergies, for example. NoWaste also helps you manage your own food waste. The free app allows you to log your weekly shop and sets up reminders so you will know when it is going out of date. Another app called Nosh, developed by the University of Essex, works in a similar way – as does Kitche, which has more than , recipe ideas to help you use up leftovers.

The Grade II listed property is hidden away in a wooded hillside and comes with . acres of land, a cottage, an outbuilding and even a mobile classroom. The Georgian pile in in north Wales also boasts fine views of the countryside which can be enjoyed from one of its  bedrooms Would-be buyers have the chance to owning the three-storey property when it goes up for auction in March.Marle Hall stands out from its surroundings and has been used for a range of purposes, from a luxury country home to a convalescent home, WalesOnline reports.The property has been put up for auction with an astonishing guide price of just £,.In London this amount would only buy a four-bedroom house in London such as one being sold by Foxtons in Docklands.It was hit by a fire in the mid th century which destroyed the main house, according to Cadw.The only section that remained habitable was the east wing. The house that once stood on the plot is said to have been built in  for Sir Hugh Williams, th Baronet of Penrhyn, dated by a beam in the hall that survived the fire. With views over the beautul Conwy Valley from its elevated position, near Snowdonia National Park and the coastline at Llandudno, itaposs not a surprise the spot was chosen by Williams for his striking mansion. The mansion gained its Grade II listing in , amended in , for its aposspecial architectural interest as primarily an early th century convalescent home of definite character, with signicant earlier origin as a country house.  It was then opened as a convalescent home in  and became a nursing home from . In  it was bought by Warwickshire County Council who operated it as an outdoor learning centre providing residential trips and courses for schoolchildren from that English county. However, the centre closed in October  and has now been put up for auction with a guide price of just £,. From  Cadw states Marle Hall was rented by the Birmingham Saturday Club, who later purchased, refurbished and rebuilt the house, with extensions at the rear.  The imposing mansion greets you with an impressive, symmetrical Georgian façade with a delightful glass covered front veranda surely the most pleasing place to gather and socialise whilst admiring the views. And although the interior is set up as the outdoor centre, plenty of period features survive, with a few in the core of the house dating back to its Tudor beginnings. Arguably the most glorious of the features is the entrance hall and staircase, boasting wood wall ling, intricate carved newel posts, Jacobean-style balusters and stained glass window . Exposed ceiling beams, a stone fireplace and fancy wooden double doors are extra features that instantly impress once you walk through the carved stone archway dating back to Tudor times, from the front door into the main reception hall.  Thereaposs multi-layered cornicing to reward youyou look up and either tiles, wood floorboards or beautully sanded parquet flooringyou look down within some of the main ground floor reception rooms. The huge, classic Georgian windows in the main rooms ensure each space is bursting with light and the abundance of wood in the primary rooms add visually warmth to the white and pale blue colour palette. Thereaposs a fancy metal and tiled fireplace in one of the reception rooms but the decor is, of course, set up to be operational as an outdoor education centre, so the interior design is minimal and simple to be ideal for its past commercial usage. Thereaposs a large, commercial kitchen, a large dining room with long tables and multiple chairs, carpeted classrooms, offices and lounges.  The house has a large boot room and changing room, and a space allocated to drying out wet kit. The remaining two floors above are mainly dedicated to dormitories and washing facilities, as well as a few more classrooms and break-out rooms. The accommodation in the main house is completed by a basement.  Outside, as well as woodland to explore, there are outbuildings to have a rummage around too. The main property within the grounds is a Grade II listed cottage, with a charming ceiling beamed kitchen, fireplace in the living room and three bedrooms and a bathroom upstairs. This property proposition overlooking Llandudno in Conwy, can offer a new owner plenty to consider. The dream home scenario is an amazing and super posh country pad once the house has been ed to a residential dwelling, as it currently has C use. This classication is for the provision of residential accommodation as use as a hospital or nursing home, residential school or college, or training centre.  Any changes to the house will need planning consent, with the Grade II listing as an important element. But the agent selling the house suggests a number of uses for Marle Hall, such as a boutique hotel with its location so close to the coast and Snowdonia, with ownersapos accommodation in the onsite cottage. Conversion into a complex of apartments might be an option to investigate too, but who wouldnapost want to dream about owning this country pile all for themselves, as Sir Hugh Williams did all those centuries ago  Marle Hall is going to auction with a guide price of £, on March , but is likely to sell for more, with Savills.

Nestle’s UK CEO Stefano Agostini, a member of the UK Investment Council who also advises on levelling up, is overseeing the closure of its northern confectionery factory in Newcastle. The move will cost the UK  jobs. Production of treats such as Fruit Pastilles and Toffee Crisps will sht to the Czech Republic, Poland and Bulgaria, where labour is cheaper. A further  staff will go at Nestle’s KitKat plant in York. The GMB union’s northern senior organiser Chris Jukes said: “It’s staggering hypocrisy from the Government. “Levelling up is not what Agostini is doing in Newcastle. “Yes, they’re putting some investment in places like Halax. “But in terms of Newcastle, you couldn’t pick a worse example of levelling up. They’re off-shoring jobs and profit. If the Investment Council is about bringing jobs, he’s getting rid of jobs. “For the Government to put this guy from Nestle on the Council when they’re a perfect example of achieving the opposite, beggars belief.”  Last month the North East was named Britain’s jobs blackspot as unemployment hit .%. Nestle said: “Investments made by Nestle in the UK signicantly outweigh changes in production.” Its investments include a £million distribution centre, a £m upgrade to its Buxton Water factory in Derbyshire and a £m facelt of its York office plus recycling and green projects.

It will cost us, the taxpayer, £,. That’s the price of the civil service and police time spent probing No parties that should never have happened. The nation is rightly furious that the Prime Minister cared so little for the Covid rules he himself imposed that he put living it up before his duty to protect lives and livelihoods. Our PM gave not one jot about those who were forbidden from saying a final face-to-face goodbye to a dying loved one – or the family get-togethers we all did without because we were obeying his rules. Patsy Stevenson is angry too. She was fined £ for breaking lockdown restrictions to honour the memory of murdered Sarah Everard.  There was no cheese and wine at the vigil Patsy attended on London’s Clapham Common. Yet police pinned her down to arrest her, while ignoring food and booze pouring into No. The cost of the Partygate inquiry would be better spent on shielding women and girls from the kind of predator who snatched Sarah’s le away. And this investigation would not be needed had Mr Johnson and his staff accepted that rules also apply to them. This PM is on borrowed time. We will party – legally – when it finally runs out. A great honour for Camilla Camilla Parker Bowles may have been a skilled horsewoman, but she had a rough ride of it when she became Duchess of Cornwall. Many people could not forgive her for the part she played in the break-up of Prince Charles and Princess Diana’s marriage. But that was nothing compared to the fences the Queen had to jump within her own family while trying to maintain the dignity of royalty and respect for the monarchy. Both were tarnished when grandson Prince Harry turned his back on royal duties and skipped off to America to give a toe-curling interview to Oprah Winfrey, and strike ­embarrassing deals with Netflix.  It pained the Queen greatly when she had to strip her favourite son, Prince Andrew, of his titles as he faces accusations of sexual assault in a US court. But her duty to the nation demanded it, and the Queen has always put that before personal feelings. Throughout, Camilla has been steadfastly by the Queen’s side, her support in times of trouble. And just like the Sovereign, she negotiates the pathways of public le without putting a foot wrong – a ready smile and a kind word are always on her lips. The Queen is not one to ignore such loyalty and dedication. And today, as she becomes the first British monarch to reign for  years, she wants the world to know that when the time comes, Camilla will be called Queen Consort. We are delighted Camilla is to receive the honour. As they say in royal circles, she’s a jolly good fellow. And so say all of us.

On February , , her father George VI died aged  and the then -year-old Elizabeth ascended to the throne. The Queen was in Kenya with her husband Prince Philip, at the beginning of a huge royal tour of the Commonwealth. Technology at the time meant it took a long while for the sad news of the Kingaposs death to reach the royal party.The Queenaposs aides first learnt of the news and grappled with how to tell their boss about her fatheraposs passing - which also meant that the throne was now heraposs. In the end, they told Prince Philip, who then had the tough task of delivering the news to his we. And according to Lady Pamela Hicks, the Queenaposs lady-in-waiting, Philip knew the Queen would be heartbroken on hearing the news.In her book Daughter of Empire, Lady Pamela says that Martin Charteris, the Queenaposs private secretary “went in to tell Philip, who lted his newspaper to cover his face in a gesture of despair, saying ‘This will be such a blow’.”Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up .  Philip then went to tell the Queen and aides watched as the couple walked back and forth through the garden. What was said is a mystery but Pamela tells how afterwards the Queen “remained completely calm and said simply: ‘I am so sorry. This means we all have to go home.’” The group began their hasty journey back to Britain on the royal BOAC Argonaut, refuelling in Libya where a black coat, handbag and shoes were delivered. The Queen arrived back in mourning garb to meet dignitaries including Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Since then, Her Majesty usually marks February , the day of her ascension, in private at Sandringham, where her father died. Tomorrow will be especially poignant as it marks  years since that fateful day - but it will also be the first one without her husband Philip by her side who died aged  last April.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON The QueenPrince Philip, Duke of EdinburghKing George VIRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

India Hicks, the second cousin and goddaughter of Prince Charles, was  years old when she served as a bridesmaid for Princess Diana when the pair tied the knot in July . Being in the royal fold, Hicks knew what was expected of her on the big day, but was nonetheless alarmed when the self-dubbed tomboy was asked to put on a frilly dress. Speaking to Insider, she said: It was a time and place and a moment in fashion in the s. So it was voluptuous and over the top, and drama everywhere.So I understand that those dresses were so befitting to the era. However,you were a tomboy like me... when you are asked to be a bridesmaid, you are proud and delighted, but you are a little alarmed at being asked to wear a frilly dress, as you can imagine.  Hicks - whose mum was one of Her Majestyaposs Ladies in Waiting - has spoken of the wedding day in the past, describing it as one of my worst hair days ever. Looking back, itaposs incredible to think of how historical that wedding was, she told Insider. I think at the time, everybody thought it was this fairytale — nobody understood what was to come. She added: I felt hugely proud that I was part of it, but you know, afterwards my mother said to me, aposRight, that is that, and now itaposs back to your normal le. Hicks and her mum Lady Pamela held an online conversation yesterday in honour of the Queenaposs Platinum Jubilee milestone.  The event was titled  Years of Duty and Friendship, with a portion of the proceeds going to The Princeaposs Trust. Sunday, February  is the day that the Queen became Queen. My mom was with her, Hicks said. Last September, Hicks finally married her long term partner David Flint Wood, with whom she had been in a relationship for  years. Some  years ago Hicks, the granddaughter of Earl Mountbatten of Burma, had walked down the aisle with the late princess when she was aged . Despite swearing she herself would never marry she surprised the nation the year before by declaring her looming nuptials.

The monarch, , said her reign has been a time of extraordinary progress socially, technologically and culturally, and said she feels a sense of hope and optimism ahead of her Platinum Jubilee. The longest-serving monarch in British history said she will be eternally grateful for, and humbled by, the loyalty and affection that you continue to give me. She also voiced her confidence that her son Charles and his we Camilla would be given the same support you have given me.She paid an emotional tribute to Prince Philip, saying he was a partner willing to carry out the role of consort and unselfishly make the sacrices that go with it. Here is the Queenaposs statement in full Tomorrow, th February, marks the th anniversary of my Accession in . It is a day that, even after  years, I still remember as much for the death of my father, King George VI, as for the start of my reign. As we mark this anniversary, it gives me pleasure to renew to you the pledge I gave in  that my le will always be devoted to your service. As I look ahead with a sense of hope and optimism to the year of my Platinum Jubilee, I am reminded of how much we can be thankful for. These last seven decades have seen extraordinary progress socially, technologically and culturally that have benefitted us all and I am confident that the future will offer similar opportunities to us and especially to the younger generations in the United Kingdom and throughout the Commonwealth. I am fortunate to have had the steadfast and loving support of my family. I was blessed that in Prince Philip I had a partner willing to carry out the role of consort and unselfishly make the sacrices that go with it. It is a role I saw my own mother perform during my fatheraposs reign. This anniversary also affords me a time to reflect on the goodwill shown to me by people of all nationalities, faiths and ages in this country and around the world over these years.  I would like to express my thanks to you all for your support. I remain eternally grateful for, and humbled by, the loyalty and affection that you continue to give me. And when, in the fullness of time, my son Charles becomes King, I know you will give him and his we Camilla the same support that you have given me and it is my sincere wish that, when that time comes, Camilla will be known as Queen Consort as she continues her own loyal service. And so as I look forward to continuing to serve you with all my heart, I hope this Jubilee will bring together families and friends, neighbours and communities - after some dficult times for so many of us - in order to enjoy the celebrations and to reflect on the positive developments in our day-to-day lives that have so happily coincided with my reign.

The monarch, just hours away from becoming the first British sovereign to reach a historic  years on the throne, joined members of the local community in the ballroom of Sandringham House to mark her milestone.Yvonne Browne, vice-president and chairman of the Sandringham WI, described the Queen as being on sparkling form. The event was the largest in-person public engagement the Queen had attended since before her recent health scare in mid October. The -year-old head of state arrived at the event with a wooden walking stick she rested on sagely as she leant forward to chat to the visitors. The guests were seated around tables waiting for a tea to be served but stood up respectfully to chat to the Queen. Wearing an Angela Kelly wedgwood blue crepe with white brocade dress, the Queen, who beamed with delight throughout, also carried her trademark black handbag. She cut a cake decorated with the Jubilee emblem to begin her Platinum year. Among the guests were members of the Sandringham branch of the Womenaposs Institute, Sandringham Estate pensioners and representatives from two local charities West Norfolk Befriending and Little Discoverers. The Queen also met former cookery school student Angela Wood who helped to perfect the famous dish coronation chicken served to guests after the Queenaposs  Coronation ceremony. Mrs Wood made the Queen laugh when she told the monarch she spent days and days altering it for Constance Spry and Rosemary Hume.  Commenting on how the recipe for coronation chicken has likely developed over the years the Queen told Angela Wood: Itaposs probably changed because in those days we did some things quite dferently. Shaun Mason, a junior sous chef, had created tiny bite size morsels of the coronation chicken, chicken with curry spices, apricot in a savoury tartlet, and he carried a tray of his creations into the ballroom and announced they were available to sample. As the morsels were placed between the Queen and Mrs Wood to try, the room erupted with laughter when the Queen quipped Iaposll go away, she turned to add: You can tell mewhen I come back. On October , the Queen held a Windsor Castle evening reception for delegates for the Global Investment Summit. But the next day she cancelled a two day trip to Northern Ireland, was secretly admitted to hospital for preliminary tests, before being put under doctorsapos orders to rest and only carry out light duties.  Before the pandemic the Queen would visit her WI colleagues at West Newton village hall every year as part of her winter stay on her Sandringham estate in Norfolk. The Queenaposs Platinum Jubilee will be celebrated across the country during an extended June Bank Holiday in honour of a monarch who has left an indelible mark on the le of the nation. But February , the date of the Queenaposs accession to the throne, is a poignant period for the Queen, as it is the day her father King George VI died in . She is already the nationaposs longest reigning monarch, and the longest still-serving sovereign in the world. During the reception the Queen also met representatives from West Norfolk Befriending a charity which aims to reduce the social isolation experienced by the elderly by matching them with trained volunteer befrienders who visit on a regular basis.  And she spoke to members of Little Discoverers which provides early education for pre-school children with movement dficulties and delayed development. When the Queen was presented with a copy of a Loyal Address written by primary schoolchildren from West Norfolk the head of state gave a frank opinion on public proclamations she has heard during her long reign. The Queen seemed to approve of the words from the younger generation who said about the Queen: You have shown a caring manner, determination, and dedication to help other people. We think youaposre doing a great job! We are very lucky to have had you as our Queen for so long. We are proud of you for helping us through this pandemic with your inspirational words, and by your actions setting a good example, especially as the last year has been so hard for you. After reading the address, on display in the ballroom, the Queen said to laughter from the guests: Most addresses are usually pompous...this is so much nicer.  The afternoon reception which the Queen clearly enjoyed ended with the cutting of an iced Victoria Sponge with the Platinum Jubilee logo as its decoration. Lady Dannatt, the Lord-Lieutenant of Norfolk, told the Queen the cake was turned upside for the benefit of the press photographs and the quipped to laughter I donapost matter  When it came to cutting the large cake the Queen thinking aloud said: Iaposll put the kne in, seeit works and she drove the kne in vertically and left it place adding somebody  can finish it off.

The -year-old decided to make a dramatic change, by undergoing a surgical procedure - known as a vertical sleeve gastrectomy - which removes up to  per cent of a person’s stomach to limit their food intake. “I knew I needed to lose several stone, and it seemed impossible on all the fad diets I had tried,” said Harriet. “In lockdown I couldn’t cope with what I saw facing me in the mirror. This girl was lost. “I had always been confident, but would easily feel hurt insidepeople looked at me or were whispering around me, assuming it was about me.”  The makeup artist recalled one incident when she confronted a family who laughed at her for wearing a bikini in the Dominican Republic and another, when she was called a “fat c***” by a drunk stranger while queuing for Britain’s Got Talent. She said she was determined to make a change, to silence the people who were cruel to her and become more comfortable and confident. “I knew I had to do something about it, lockdown was here, and I couldn’t stand how I looked, she added. “I wanted to wear pretty clothes, and was fed up with wearing a pair of my  pairs of black leggings. “I wanted to wear jeans, I wanted my feet to not hurt so much when I went out in heels because of my weight.  “I wanted to feel better, look better. I would get out of breath, hated stairs, would get hot and bothered especially in summer.” Harriet now weighs st lb and she has dropped from a dress size  to . But while the operation was a success, and she has also adopted a healthy diet and rigorous exercise programme, some of her friends have questioned her decision to get surgery. “Some friends told me I could do it myself and I didn’t need an operation,” she said. “Funnily enough these are the friends who never comment on my new appearance, never tell me how proud they are of me, or ever tell me I look great. “I didn’t make the fact I had my surgery public, but I often get asked at school on the playground at pick-up time how I’ve done it and I never know what to say - I think I just freeze.” She added: “It’s the best thing I’ve ever done. I wish I had known more about it in my twenties as I probably would have taken the plunge sooner. “I am so much more confident, content and happy in le. I’ve decreased my antidepressants dosage as I don’t need to depend on them now. “I can run around with my energetic six year old who has ADHD. I can fit into small clothes, and have started sharing my friendsapos clothes - it’s such a lovely feeling.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON FitnessWeight loss success stories\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The pong has also hit A-list neighbours Oprah Winfrey, Ellen DeGeneres, Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom. A local in Montecito, Calornia, said: “It smells like offal that has been rotting in the sun. It makes my stomach churn. “I’ve seen lots of homeowners closing their windows when it wafts over.” The stench is coming from the Andrée Clark Bird Refuge, a -acre saltwater marsh.  Local officials say the problem is likely to go on until improvement works this autumn. Cameron Benson, clean water manager for the City of Santa Barbara, said: “Water can become stagnant there. “The odour issues are sporadic and sometimes they are worse in some conditions.” MockedThe bird smell is the latest reason for Prince Harry, , and Meghan, , to complain about the home they share with kids Archie, two, and Lilibet, seven months.We told how they have had to put up with smells from a nearby cannabis farm. And we revealed they are not “over the moon” with the £million property and are enquiring about other houses.  Speaking about the bird refuge, Mr Benson added: “Our goal is to improve water quality and wildle habitat there.” On Thursday Harry was mocked over his web lecture for corporate coaching firm BetterUp on how to avoid burnout.

Billed as a aposcomforting pasta dish with seared chicken, smoky pork strips, mushroom and spinach in a white sauceapos it did not look all that inspiring or comforting when I poured it into my dish. There were around eight pieces of chicken and a few strips of pork, and my first thought was that it seemed to taste very salty and the consistency was a bit gloopy. For me, I think Iaposd rather stick with making my own carbonara - as the Slimming World versionis a fairly simple and much cheaper recipe to make from scratch. Rating:    Day  Caullower and chick pea dahl - £. Dianne said: This can be eaten on its own or as a side dish. It probably would have been better as a side dishIaposm honest as I found it a bit unfulfilling as a lunch dish. It had a pleasant curry hit though and I like the crunch of the caullower with the chickpeas. Rating:   Chilli Con Carne - £.  Dianne said: A really hearty dish with large chunks of meat in a rich sauce and the rice was nicely herbed up. If you werenapost doing Slimming World youaposd think this was just a regular chilli ready meal, which is probably the best compliment I can give it. Indeed, my friendaposs strapping -year-old lad aposaccidentallyapos microwaved himself one of these and gave it a big thumbs up as well, so itaposs definitely good in the aposgenerous portionapos stakes. Rating:   Day  Cowboy hotpot - £.  Dianne said: Itaposs safe to say this was the dish I was most looking forward to. I mean, it has cowboy in its title and sausages and potato in it so whataposs not to love  Well, unfortunately the dish itself was what I could not learn to love. It said on the packet it was best cooked in the oven and I followed the cooking times to the tee, but it came out very dry and stodgy. It just did nothing for me at all - the sausages were firm and dry and the potatoes also had a powdery consistency on top. So disappointed with this one, definitely not a yee-ha moment from me. Rating:   Beef vindaloo - £.  Dianne said: However, tea time well and truly gave me one of the highlights of the week - in the new beef vindaloo dish. This was a real treat. A really brilliant hit of spices in a rich tomato sauce with flavoursome lumps of beef. Rating:   Day  Moroccan style chicken soup - £. Dianne said: Again, a very off-putting smell from the microwave, but once cooked this one was pretty delicious. A really interesting spice mix with a decent amount of heat, and lots of pulled chicken which made this one a warming and filling soup dish that I would definitely buy again. Rating:   Beef Lasagne - £.  Dianne said: This one has been a favourite of many SW-ers for a while now, but theyaposve just introduced a new recipe. So it is as good as the old one  Well, I was pretty excited about this one - because itaposs even better. The new recipe has finally nailed the elusive creamy cheesy aspect of the lasagne that is not easy to do.  Taking a nosy at the recipe card on the inside, it appears to be a mixture of butternut squash, potato and the magic Quark that has created the delightful crispy cheesy topping here. A word of warning on this one though - while it can be cooked in the microwave, it does say for best results stick in the oven. And, while it does take a mammoth  minutes, it tastes sooo much better this way to get that cheesy crunch. Rating:    Day  Naked beef burrito - £. Dianne said: A good amount of spice kick in this one, and itaposs quite a satisfying lunch pot. If you have your HEA of cheese available I feel like it would be nicer with this mixed in - I added some peppers and salad on the side. Rating:   Hunteraposs chicken - £.  Dianne said: This one has to be cooked in the oven and is a large portion for two, so my other half got roped into eating this one with me. It had a long cooking time of over an hour this one - and Iaposm not surethataposs why the chicken was a bit dry and chewy. And oneaposs thing for sure, it looked absolutely nothing like the glossy image on the packaging when it came out of my oven. But the overall flavour was ok - although the barbecue sauce was a tad on the watery side. My feeling is this one would be much easier and better to simply recreate yourself at home - itaposs just a rasher of bacon plonked on some chicken really. Rating:    Day  Colcannon Mash - £ Dianne said: Running a bit out of options at this stage, I decide to try the colcannon mash which I team with steamed broccoli and salmon. The mash is, like a lot of the meals, a tad on the salty side but teams well with salmon and I like that you can taste the cabbage in the mash mix. This is a convenient one to have in the freezer for those moments you canapost be bothered making your own mash. Rating:   Smoky meatball tray bake with potato wedges - £  Dianne said: The meatballs were on the dry side, but had a decent flavour punch, and were extremely pleasant when mushed together with all the smoky tomato and chickpea sauce. There was a decent size portion for two of us, although we did add lots of vegetables for speed. This was a really tasty one - but Iaposm afraid it canapost get full marks this one for the sheer faff factor. It took hr and mins to cook in the oven which comes in very low on the convenience factor - as does the vast size of the packet that I needed to try and wodge in my not very sizeable freezer. Itaposs also pretty expensive for this style of dish. Rating:   Day  Slimming World chips - £. Dianne said: Itaposs the last day, so Iaposm going all out with the curry and chips on the menu. And thereaposs literally nothing  left to eat. So I bung some of the frozen chips in the oven and serve them with some baked beans. Now with these frozen chips, people either love them or hate them from my experience at Slimming World group.  I have personally perfected a good flavour by sprinkling some syn-free spice on them and then spraying them with low-calorie spray. They do have a slightly strange consistency, but they are a convenient option to have ready-made in the freezer when you canapost face peeling and chopping up potatoes and cooking from scratch. Rating:   Chicken tikka rogan josh - £.  Dianne said: Ending the week on a high with this classic curry. The Slimming World chicken tikka masala has been a bit of a staple since the Iceland range was first launched, but this new rogan josh version might even trump it for me. Loved the spice on this one, and the added lumps of tomato and pepper. You could almost be eating a aposrealapos takeaway curry. Rating:   Did it work  Dianne said: Well, this is the big question isnapost it  After a whole week of eating the ready meals, and sticking  per cent to the Slimming World plan throughout the rest of the day, Iaposd have been guttedI didnapost lose any weight. But guess what  I did. I lost a whopping lbs. Which just goes to show sticking to aposfree foodsapos and the rest of the rules of the Slimming World plan does do the trick.Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

Moore, founder of womenaposs blouse brand Elizabeth  Clarke, has a dferent theory and thinks she may have unearthed the reason once and for all. Why do you think womenaposs blouses button on the opposite side to menaposs shirts  Let us know in the comments...One thoery is that menaposs shirts had buttons on the right side because most men held their swords in their right hand. This meant they needed to be able to unbutton their shirt quickly to duel and unbuttoning using their left hand was faster. As to why womenaposs buttons are on the left, many believe itaposs because women tend to carry their babies in their left arms.  Itaposs possible that womenaposs shirts were designed to be opened or closed with the free right hand to make breastfeeding easier, so they were buttoned on the left and open on the right. It also may be because way back when women were expected to ride horses sidesaddle. Buttoning up on the left may have kept the breeze from blowing up their shirts as they galloped across fields.  Another possible explanation for the iation in button placement could be traced back to the rise of emancipation when women began to abandon their girdles in favour of pants and other traditionally male clothes. As a practical technique of distinguishing between menaposs and womenaposs clothing, manufacturers placed buttons on the left side of womenaposs clothing. Melanie M. Moore, founder of womenaposs blouse brand Elizabeth  Clarke, has a dferent theory. When buttons were invented in the th century they were, like most new technology, very expensive, she told Today. Wealthy women back then did not dress themselves — their ladyaposs maid did. Since most people were right-handed, this made it easier for someone standing across from you to button your dress. There are a iety of possible reasons as to why menaposs and womenaposs shirts are buttoned dferently. At this point though, it all comes down to good old-fashioned tradition.Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

Thereaposs truly nothing more comforting than a big bowl of pasta and tomato sauce, and the good news is, you can make it when youaposre on a budget or your cupboards are bare and you havenapost had chance to get to the supermarket.Due to the fast-paced nature of modern le, itaposs no surprise that many people opt for sauces out of a jar to save on time and effort, but the truth is many of these jars are jam-packed with sugar and additives and can cost more than the ingredients themselves. According to Italian American food writer Marcella Hazan, a good pasta sauce is remarkably simple and economical, too, meaning itaposs far cheaper and healthy than any store bought products.  Marcella, who died in , was born in Cesenatico, Italy, in  and went on to open a New York cookery school and write hugely respected cookbooks, so what she says goes when it comes to a good old pasta sauce. In one of her books, Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking, Marcella advises using only three ingredients in tomato sauce: tinned tomatoes, an onion and a generous knob butter. We told you it was simple. The  recipe is still revered by food writers and cooks alike. No chopping is required. And pasta and tomato sauce is always a hit round the family dining table. Marcellaaposs precise instructions are to put half a peeled onion into a pot with butter and tinned tomatoes and to leave it all to simmer for  minutes. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Food publication Delish dubbed the sauce the best in the world. Her husband Victor talked to Epicurious about her efficient methods: Marcella was a genius when it came to taste. She had an immediate understanding about how flavour affects a dish.She asked herself, aposWhy chop an onion  Why saute  Iaposm going to put the onion, tomato, and butter together and forget about itapos. Is it really the best in the world  Itaposs a bold claim and a subjective one. But Italians are famous for their simplicity in cooking. Itaposs all about the produce – tomatoes being one of the most important. No other preparation is more successful in delivering the prodigious satisfactions of Italian cooking than a competently executed sauce with tomatoes, Marcella says in her book.  Her sauce is very rich. Others favour dferent techniques. Jamie Oliver adds four cloves of garlic and garnishes with fresh basil.BBC Good Food recommends starting with a classic mirepoix base , and scores of top chefs use ious herbs and oils and other trickery to elevate their dishes. Anchovies are good. Food writer Felicity Cloake suggests the more classic use of olive oil in tomato sauce. She also puts in a pinch of sugar and some red wine vinegar.The thing to do is experiment. Garlic or no garlic, parsley or thyme or basil or rosemary, as long as the tinned tomatoes are good and thereaposs parmesan on the table, we imagine people will be well fed.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

We donapost really give it much thought. But, it turns out the simple act of brushing our hair is a lot more complex than we first thought - and, as with many things the internet tells us these days, weaposre probably doing it wrong. In fact, millions of people with long hair are risking long-term damage by brushing their hair with the wrong hairbrush, combing too hard or aposripping outapos knots. Who knew  As many as four in  women involved in a survey by Tangle Teezer confessed they were aware some of their actions can be bad for their hair, with almost one in four worrying about the damage they are doing to their locks.  Meanwhile, more than one in twenty even admitted to still living by the old phrase brush your hair  times before bed. A fth believe itaposs fine to aposroughlyapos brush their hair to tear through the knots and tangles, while more than a fth share their hairbrush with others. Half of those polled, by the haircare brand, also wrongly brush their hair from their scalp downwards, which is considered to be a no-no. Tangle Teezer founder Shaun Pulfrey, known as Shaun P, who launched the successful business after being rejected on Dragonaposs Den, said: Itaposs worrying to see just how many women are brushing their hair incorrectly and causing unnecessary damage to their hair. No matter what the hair texture, itaposs important to use an intelligent hairbrush which is gentle. Itaposs also concerning that women are using one brush for all tasks, a good way to look at this is you wouldnapost use a foundation brush to apply blusher, so why use a detangling brush to blow dry hair  No matter how tempting it is to pull or cut knots, itaposs always best to use a detangling hairbrush. The study also found that three quarters of women admitted to using the same hairbrush for all aspects of their hair care - despite advice to use dferent tools for tasks such as combing wet hair, detangling or blow drying. And while  per cent of women only own one or two hairbrushes, a sixth have more than seven make-up brushes. But although  per cent of women have a specic routine for their locks, more than half admitted they do not knowthey are using the right brush for their hair type. It also emerged more than half of those polled have even cut their hair in a bid to make it easier to care for. When it comes to products, less than a quarter of those polled, via OnePoll, regularly use hair masques, while  per cent do use heat protection spray and more than a fth apply oils. And the biggest concerns for UK women were found to be split ends , frizzand thinning . Shaun P added: We have created dferent brushes and adapted the teeth to suit all hair types, to give the perfect brush for all hair textures - be it afro hair, thick and curly or fine, thinning, fragile and straight. And also for dferent needs, such as The Wet Detangler that can help prevent breakage on wet hair as the teeth flex over the tangles rather than dragging through them. Using the right hairbrush for your hair type, will help limit hair damage or loss through mechanical trauma. This is caused by such aggressors as straightening irons, curling tongs and frequent colouring.To help people identythey are brushing their hair correctly, Tangle Teezer has created a short quiz, which you can try here.

Cleo was abducted in the early hours of October  from the Blowholes campsite, km north of Carnarvon, Australia, where she was on holiday with her family. The four-year-old was later found alive and well by officers who raided her abductoraposs home in a case that became recognised internationally. In an interview with minutes, Cleo’s mum said as a family they are still recovering and learning how to navigate through their days, but said her daughter is okay.  The mother relived the agonising moment they realised their little daughter was gone.My heart told me she’s not here, she’s not going to run into my arms today, mum Ellie Smith said to minutes.She was basically no where near me and that was the moment I realised someone has her, and both my head and my heart connected that someone has her, someone has my baby.  It was the same tent, and he’s taken a step in there, grabbed our child and we’re sleeping right next to it all. Discussing the agonising wait for answers, Cleo’s mum said: I was basically on the floor crying.” In the interview it was also revealed that there was a footprint found inside the tent. A team of  people had been working on the case with police fielding more than , tips from the public.  The conditions with remote terrain meant it was dficult to search the area with some people using quad bikes and even a drone. More than  people at the site were interviewed, and police carried out extensive searches by land and air. Police carried out a raid on a house  days after she went missing and found the tot who told police My name is Cleo.  Terence Darrell Kelly, , was charged with forcibly taking a child under  and pleaded guilty last month. His guilty plea means he will avoid a y trial for which detectives have been preparing for months. He is yet to enter a plea to other charges he faces. Kelly will be sentenced at a later date when he again appears in court.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Missing personsPoliceCleo Smith\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Crack troops from the SAS, the SBS, the Special Reconnaissance Regiment and the Special Forces Support group are understood to be working in the country as military advisers. They are believed to be helping train Ukrainian special forces in counter-insurgency tactics, sniping and sabotage. British special forces have been able to deploy such a large number to the region as they are no longer operating in Afghanistan. Although the SAS and SBS are still in Syria and Iraq, the numbers of troops there are believed to be relatively small.  A source said: “UK special forces have been deployed to the region to help and advise the Ukrainian military. They have a wide skill set which will no doubt be very useful to the Ukrainian forces.” At least , winter-trained British troops are also now based in Estonia, which borders Russia.Meanwhile, Russia has started equipping dozens of military field hospitals close to its border with Ukraine, fuelling fears of an imminent invasionIntelligence sources say doctors, nurses and medical supplies – including thousands of litres of blood and plasma – have arrived in the region, where fighting would be the most intense.

I had actually played with Scotty when he was on loan at Brechin City from Dunfermline, so I knew what he was capable of. I knew he would fit into our philosophy and how we want to play the game.“My intention was to give him - minutes, but he came on early and worked his socks off and got his reward with the goal and then we had to being him back off because his legs had just went at that point.“He probably needs a bit more game time in terms of match fitness and sharpness but when he gets up to full speed, he will be a real asset for us.“We went short-term and this gives him a chance to get back playing and enjoying his football. And it gives us the opportunity to let him see what we are about and come the end of the season we will probably assess that again.“Everyone knows Gala is a great club. I think that little bit of professionalism and trying to do things in the right manner will help bring him on. He came down and trained with us and as soon as he met the chairman and the boys make everyone feel welcome when they come to the club .“There is a real togetherness there so I think it will suit Scotty going forward so it’s up to him what he does from here until the end of the season. I told him that he will get an opportunity to play but he needs to show me that he’s here to contribute.“He has a good pedigree at Dunfermline and Celtic as a kid and he’s got a good attitude but has just lost his way a bit in terms of going on loan to Brechin City when they were in League Two. It was a tough ask to come in and play men’s football when they were just desperate for results. So it probably wasn’t the ideal fit for him.

This sparked a furious debate in the House of Commons.No guarantee was given by the Prime Minister that an unredacted report would be made available to MPs.In response Borders MP John Lamont said: “It is deeply frustrating that Sue Gray has been unable to release her full report so that we can see the full facts of what has gone on. The country has a right to see the evidence for themselves and it must be published in full when the police investigation concludes.”MP for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale David Mundell said: “The document which has been presented by Sue Gray is an update on her investigation into alleged gatherings on Government premises during Covid restrictions. It details a number of alleged gatherings, all but four of which are now subject to a separate investigation by the politan Police and, as a result, details of those events have not been reported in the update in order not to prejudice the police investigations.“My strong view is that, when it is possible, the report in its entirety should be published, as I believe everyone has a right to see what has been established.”Both also insisted that anyone found to have broken the lawshould be held accountable.Mr Lamont added: “No one is above the law.

We need to get charging points into the right places.“My aspiration would be to see charging points outside every village hall right across the Borders.”SBC’s regime will see the introduction of an overstay charge, a minimum charge of £ per session and a p connection surcharge between pm-pm to ease demand on the electricity grid at peak times.An SBC report states: “Based on usage figures for  this gives a potential income in the region of £, a year, creating a surplus of around £, a year to contribute towards maintaining the current infrastructure.“This excludes overstay charges which would also generate additional surplus and would also allow scope to absorb any small increases in energy prices without the need to constantly alter the tarf.”A feasibility study has been commissioned, funded through the Community Renewal Fund, to undertake “a region-wide, cross-sector assessment of supply, demand and commercial opportunities to create a strategic delivery model for EV charging infrastructure”.At the meeting, Tweeddale West councillor Heather Anderson, of the SNP, said: “It’s great news there’s going to be an electric vehicle feasibility study to look at how we get private sector investment equitably across the region despite the disperse nature of our rural population.“It’s absolutely essential that the private sector don’t cherry pick the most financially viable sites and leave the other sites without any sort of provision.”.removeSBC’s current EV infrastructure consists of  chargers across  dferent towns and villages, according to the report.A November meeting was told that the total cost to the council for the charging points last year was £,.Supporting the proposed tarf rates, Galashiels councillor Harry Scott said it was “a nonsense” that the council provides the service for free and that the local authority should “benefit commercially from the use of these machines”.He added: “There has to be a certain amount of caution before we go down this road because the tech seems to gallop on quite signicantly and what we don’t want to be doing is spending £-, installing a machine that might be redundant in a year’s time, so it’s right that the officers keep an eye on this.”"},{"url":null,"title":"music-peebles-marks-75th-year-popular-quartet","story":"is a big milestone in the history of Music in Peebles.The group is marking its th season since its formationin .It is also a big year for their very special guests in February, the Brodsky Quartet.An appearance by the group is always an eagerly-awaited highlight, but this appearance is all the more special for being part of the quartets th anniversary celebrations.Coincidentally, the Brodsky Quartet last came to Peebles in , while marking their th anniversary.The programme for the night starts with Borodin Scherzo in D for String Quartet, followed by Schubert String Quartet No. in A minor, D. , James MacMillan “For Sonny” and “Memento” and Shostakovich String Quartet No. in E flat, Op..The concert culminates in the enigmatic th Quartet by Shostakovich, a composer with whose music the Brodsky Quartet is particularly associated.Paul Cassidy, the groups violist, describes the th as “one of the most exhilarating of the whole cycle” ending with “one of the greatest finales of the string quartet literature.

By closing them off, you will cut out the draught and also ensure that any heat in your property isn’t escaping into that room.Get draught excludersA big reason why your home may not be retaining heat very well is because of draughts.Allowing cold air to get into the home will bring the overall temperature down.If you can stop these draughts from getting in, it will make a huge dference to the temperature in your home.Get cookingEating hot food will help to warm you up and the process of cooking the food will throw heat out into the kitchen and surrounding areas, meaning your home will warm up as a result.Consider getting rugsIf your house is fully carpeted, then you needn’t worry about this option, as that will help insulate your home.However, you can lose a considerable amount of heat through floorboards or tiles, so putting a rug over the top can make all the dference in your home’s heat retention.Put tin foil behind your radiatorIf on the occasion you do have the heating on, which you should because it is good for home’s condition, then you should put foil behind your radiators to make sure the heat is forced into the room, rather than getting lost in the wall."},{"url":null,"title":"royal-mint-reveals-10-rarest-50p-coins-circulation","story":"The Royal Mint has revealed its top ten rarest  pence coins in circulation.The move to \"new money\" pounds and pence, happened  years ago this month, with the anniversary on  February .Since then, over  iations of the p coin have been circulating and several rare designs have been distributed.The famous Kew Gardens p remains the most coveted coin in circulation, with a mintage of just ,, the Mint said.Other rare designs include Olympic-themed ps minted in .Here, we look at the rarest p coins and how many of each have been made - and how much they could be worth.What makes a coin valuable The  pence piece has become the most valued and collected coin in the UK, with many collectable designs appearing on its heptagonal canvas.Its .mm diameter makes it the largest of any British coin, and allows space for decorative pictures.

and had a good chance to score when Robertson freed John McCallum to play in Andrew Renton.Renton advanced on the left side of the box, but the youngster#s touch when bearing down on goal was just on the heavy side, and allowed the keeper to lunge at his feet and collect the ball at the last moment.Kilsyth made it -

It was the Pupils who would concede it.In another move tinged with disappointment # the match referee failing to spot another offside in the build-up # a ball from the right flank was swung in to a player in an offside position, who held the ball up and worked it back to a central area where Finnart’s captain unleashed a strong strike high into the Pupils’ net.And while the Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils continued to work hard to claw their way back into the match they were undone with only a few minutes remaining by a smart counter-attack at the other end, which allowed Finnart’s number  to score from close range with a low, side-footed effort.On reflection, the Pupils were undone by moments of business-like quality – certainly for goals two and four from their hosts # and perhaps their own naivety against a canny and disciplined side who are challenging to win the WoSFL’s Division Four.Nevertheless, the Pupils can reflect on a decent, determined performance for much of this match.

By closing them off, you will cut out the draught and also ensure that any heat in your property isn’t escaping into that room.A big reason why your home may not be retaining heat very well is because of draughts.Allowing cold air to get into the home will bring the overall temperature down.If you can stop these draughts from getting in, it will make a huge dference to the temperature in your home.Eating hot food will help to warm you up and the process of cooking the food will throw heat out into the kitchen and surrounding areas, meaning your home will warm up as a result.If your house is fully carpeted, then you needn’t worry about this option, as that will help insulate your home.However, you can lose a considerable amount of heat through floorboards or tiles, so putting a rug over the top can make all the dference in your home’s heat retention.If on the occasion you do have the heating on, which you should because it is good for home’s condition, then you should put foil behind your radiators to make sure the heat is forced into the room, rather than getting lost in the wall."},{"url":null,"title":"royal-mint-reveals-10-rarest-50p-coins-circulation","story":"The move to \"new money\" pounds and pence, happened  years ago this month, with the anniversary on  February .Since then, over  iations of the p coin have been circulating and several rare designs have been distributed.The famous Kew Gardens p remains the most coveted coin in circulation, with a mintage of just ,, the Mint said.Other rare designs include Olympic-themed ps minted in .Here, we look at the rarest p coins and how many of each have been made - and how much they could be worth.The  pence piece has become the most valued and collected coin in the UK, with many collectable designs appearing on its heptagonal canvas.Its .mm diameter makes it the largest of any British coin, and allows space for decorative pictures.

He was a poet and painter, the founder of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, the group of young artists who so dazzled Victorian culture. Siddal had ambitions to be a poet and painter but she was best known as an artist’s model, adored for her pale beauty and blazing red hair by the Pre-Raphaelites. Famously, she endured freezing cold water to pose as Ophelia for John Everett Millais.Siddal was the daughter of an ironmonger. “Middle-class gentlemen like Rossetti didn’t marry girls from Lizzie’s station,” writes Deborah Lutz in Pleasure Bound, her  book about the Pre-Raphaelites. When they married her health was failing. She was prescribed laudanum and soon developed an addiction .In May  Siddal gave birth to a stillborn child, and she struggled with grief and postpartum depression. On February  the following year Rossetti ed to their home in Blackfriars to find Siddal unconscious, an empty laudanum bottle beside her. All efforts to save her failed. Rossetti placed the only copy of the manuscript of his poems beside her in her coffin.After her death Rossetti himself suffered from depression and insomnia and would dose himself with laudanum and chloral hydrate. He worked for years on a painting of Siddal as Dante’s Beatrice and attended seances where he believed his lost we spoke to him. “For two years he saw her ghost every night,” his friend John Marshall reported.In the summer of  Rossetti was in Scotland, invited by the poet and painter William Bell Scott. They stayed in Penkill Castle in Ayrshire, home to fellow artist Alice Boyd. Bell Scott and Boyd were in a relationship, although Bell Scott was also married.Rossetti’s hosts were alarmed by their guest’s obsession with the idea of suicide. One day they journeyed to Lambdoughty Glen, near Straiton. On the rocks above a drop named The Devil’s Punchbowl, Rossetti gazed into the depths below.“Never shall I forget the expression of Gabriel’s face when he bent over the precipice, peering into the unfathomed water dark as ink, in which sundry was flew round and round like lost souls in hell ...” Bell Scott recorded later.“One step forward, and I am free!” Rossetti told Bell Scott and Boyd.He didn’t take that step thankfully . Now the waterfall he stood on top of that day is known as Rossetti Linn, accessible via a path known as Lady Hunter Blair’s Walk.The same year he stood on top of the waterfall gazing into the depths, Rossetti had his late we’s coffin exhumed so he could reclaim his manuscript of poems.As for Siddal, she is still with us in the paintings she posed for. “Today, as Lutz notes, “ her face is famous.”"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13443354.jpg?type=article-full","title":"platinum-jubilee-tom-devine-future-monarchy-scotland","story":"To mark this date, we invited historians and commentators to peer into the monarchys future in Scotland. Here, historian Tom Devine contemplates the big questions that hover around it.Professor Emeritus Sir Tom Devine, University of Edinburgh, historian, as told in interview with Vicky Allan\"There are many Scottish blood connections between the current British monarchy and Scotland. If you look, for example, at the Queen’s mother and father, both could trace their lineage right back to Robert II of Scotland in the Medieval period. Her father is a direct descendant of James VI of Scotland and her mother was a Scottish aristocrat.There’s also the famous statement she made in the Scottish parliament of her enduring affection and that of her late husband for Scotland. That’s not a myth. In other words, in relation to Scotland there are positives, but there are also threats and negatives and dficulties for the monarchy going on into the future.Amongst the positives for their future in Scotland is that Scots are aware that there is no evidence whatsoever of the royal family marginalising Scotland of the sort we do see from the current prime minister and his government. Their behaviour to some extent has highlighted the interest and concern and affection that the royal family have for Scotland.The Queen’s position is armour-plated, and perhaps particularly so because she is a hereditary monarch. People look around at governments around the world, elected governments and elected presidents, such as Trump and Putin, and they think well maybe a blood inheritance, though it seems odd in the modern world, might have something for it. The constitutional monarch cannot have any particular political axe to grind, must stay above the fray, and, of course, everyone has been so impressed by the way the current Queen has comported herself throughout her long reign. There has hardly been one occasion when she has not behaved impeccably.Compare the current prime minister and the current head of state – you couldn’t think of two dferent people in terms of what I might call the decency league.Regarding the future of the Royal family, much of this is a personal view because this is always the case when we try to speculate on the future and the future, as I’ve often said, is not my period.It’s going to be dficult for Charles who is due to succeed her. There’s a lot of regard for the monarchy but much of it is founded in the persona of the Queen. How well will Charles perform the role  I’m certain he will try to do his best and again keep above politics, but he has form as an inidual, for example the Diana situation, which is still remembered. Also,you look at opinion polling over the last - years, two thirds of English and Welsh people support the monarchy. In Scotland it’s down to just over  percent [YouGov, March ]. That’s not necessarily a decline. There’s always been less support for the monarchy in these polls in Scotland.The other thing, in terms of polling evidence, is that when you look at the age group -, the age group overwhelming supportive in Scotland of Scottish independence, there is a clear majority among them who want an elected head of state.I don’t think the Andrew situation helps. But let’s remember, no judicial process has yet considered his case, far less found him guilty. That said, the British people may already consider that the press have already found him guilty and that’s not going to help the monarchy. But I don’t think what’s happening with Andrew is a death blow.Clearly when the Queen dies there will be considerable closing of ranks around the monarchy in the UK and it will be up to the heir to the throne to demonstrate very quickly that he is a man up to the job as it were.The SNP still supports the idea of the House of Windsor as providing the headship of state. Remember the Union of the Crowns of  will not be affected in any way by the breaking of the treaty of , the parliamentary union.: Who should succeed the Queen  William or CharlesWhat the monarchy has going for them are two things. First of all, supposing there was an independent Scotland, or a campaign for it, I don’t believe that the SNP will want to create too much discontinuity in the search for an overall majority, and one way of preserving continuity is the maintenance of the monarchy. I think that’s one of the main reasons why although there may be strong republican feelings in parts of the SNP, one of the things the party will try to do is maintain as much continuity before and after independence in the medium term., as she attends the opening of the fth session of the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh.

The highest scores go to those who display precise control, inidual style and, importantly nail the landing.It is not a sport for the faint of heart – big air comes with the possibility of big falls.The risks – and the emotional rollercoaster of having seen Kirsty juggle training, school, Covid restrictions and injury – means her parents plan to watch the qualication round and, hopefully, her appearance in the final quietly, at home together.A few days later, they’ll tune in again to see Kirsty, the youngest member of Team GB, compete against the world’s best in the Games slopestyle event. Another highly risky event, it combines speed and tricks performed over a man-made downhill terrain where even successfully completing a run is no guarantee of success – that’s down to the judges and how impressed they are by the twists, turns and tricks.While Kirsty has been tipped as having a good chance of a podium place, there are no parties or celebrations planned back home in Aberdeen.“We will keep it low key, we’ll be watching but it will be just us, going ‘yahoo!’ together,” adds Jim.There is, however, already cause for celebration: the organisers of the Fort William Mountain Festival today named Kirsty as the eighth recipient of The Scottish Youth Award for Excellence in Mountain Culture.The award, sponsored by West Highland College UHI, celebrates adventurous young people, the landscapes they choose to explore and the outdoor pursuits in which they excel. The Festival organisers have already confirmed Paralympic hand cyclist Karen Darke will receive its main honour, the Scottish Award for Excellence in Mountain Cultures.The awards are the highlight of the Festival programme, which runs over five days from Wednesday  February at venues in and around Fort William.Included in this year’s Festival are live talks and presentations by snow patch expert Iain Cameron, and filmmaker, wild swimmer and camper, Calum Maclean.Described as a \"one in a generation athlete\" by former Olympic snowboarder Lesley McKenna, Kirsty learned to ski when she was just four years old but quickly found traditional Alpine skiing too boring.Instead, she had her eye on the ramps and jumps, and by seven was honing her freestyle craft.It led her to multiple youth competition podiums and a maiden slopestyle World Cup medal in Aspen, Colorado, when she was still just .Since then, she’s successfully combined training at home and at training camps abroad with studying at Bucksburn Academy in Aberdeen, where she’s a straight A student.When the pandemic hit, she switched her training arrangements from the slopes to Banchory Trampoline Club, where she had to first convince officials that she had the acrobatic and gymnastic skills to use the equipment.Jim adds: “She’s come a long way in the past year despite all the obstacles of Covid and even Brexit which made it a bit harder to travel.“She just adapts and gets on with things.“The last pre-season training camp was meant to give her two weeks of training but Kirsty tested positive for Covid as soon as she arrived in Switzerland.“She was isolating alone, while outside there was beautul blue skies and perfect conditions.“She takes these things in her stride.”Her schedule can be exhausting: recently she arrived home in Aberdeen after competing in the USA, completed her university applications, completed a series of media interviews and set off for another event within the space of just  hours.While in Beijing she will compete against athletes who have grown up close to some of the world’s top ski resorts, or have parents who have also taken part in elite snowsports.With no spectators allowed at the Games, Jim and Kim will have to follow events from their livingroom.He added: “It’s easier for uswe can be there when she’s competing, sosomething happens, we’re there.“However, we’ve been told about the protocols, andshe is injured or has Covid, she’ll go to Chinese facilities.“We take our lead from Kirsty. She needs to know we are confident in her ability, and that we’ve got her back.“She trains as hard as she can, she does all the strength and conditioning exercises and she is dedicated. She wears her safety gear, and this is the sport she’s chosen.“But my heart is in my mouth when she’s competing.“It’s her against the mountain.”The Fort William Mountain Festival  begins on Wednesday, February .

There will also be an opportunity for the SWPL  clubs to join the new organisation as a two tier structure is now the preferred option.All the clubs have to do to implement the change is tell SWF they wont be affiliating next season. No vote is required, and the Scottish FA will recognise the new top league as being the one which qualies teams for the Champions League.For all the reservations about the SPFL – and there are many – the organisation run by Neil Doncaster has been very proactive in the discussions over a new direction. SWF, by contrast, have come across as being reactive and seemed not to recognise that a majority of clubs wanted to know what alternative structure was on offer sooner rather than later.My understanding is that the clubs most likely to give SWF every opportunity to retain control, including Spartans, Aberdeen and Partick Thistle, contrasted the two approaches and concluded the SPFL was the better future option. Glasgow City, the only stand-alone womens club in the top ten, will go with the flow.The clubs will have representatives on the new board and the priority in the short term will be to ensure the subsidiary company is going to operate entirely in the interests of all concerned. Clubs will have representatives on the board and it is essential a culture is established which is very dferent to the toxic tribalism which will always hold back Scottish mens professional football.PEDRO Martinez Losa will name his squad for the Pinatar Cup on Tuesday, but the head coach has lost out on the opportunity to look at a Scottish-qualied goalkeeper. Washington Spirit No  Devon Kerr has instead opted to stay with her native Canada.Kerr is ft in tall and Everton goalkeeping coach Ian McCaldon is a huge fan. “She has all the qualities you want for an international goalkeeper,” McCaldon, who worked with the player during his three year spell at the top American club, said.“Devon would walk into any FA WSL side. She has excellent movement and athleticism, kicks the ball with both feet, and dominates the goal area with her presence.”The -year-old is club deputy to Aubrey Bledsoe, who McCaldon also coached. Bledsoe, who is six years older, is an outstanding goalkeeper who has been voted best in the NWSL for the last two full seasons.Martinez Losa had hoped to see Kerr train at close quarters in Murcia but the player – who has a Scottish grandfather – has now declined. Whether by coincidence or not, it appears she will be called up by Olympic champions Canada for the first time when their squad is announced for this months Arnold Clark Cup in England.WOMEN played a huge part in Raith Rovers humiliating climbdown on Thursday morning.

It is more important than ever we all get vaccinated to protect ourselves, our family and friends. Boosters increase our protection against the virus up to more than  per cent.We talk to myth-busting medical experts who answer your most frequently asked questions about these essential jabs. vw, px\"  What protection does a booster jab give Dr Emeka Okorocha, who works in AE in London and South East, said: “As a doctor, I have seen first-hand the effect COVID- can have on people. I want to remind everyone you can still get seriously ill with the virus, so it is so important to get the jab to keep ourselves, your friends and loved ones safe. COVID- is highly infectious. The vaccine remains our best line of defence against it. Omicron is highly transmissible and still has the potential to lead to signicant numbers of people in hospital, so it’s so important your immunity is topped up, and to come forward for your first or second doseyou haven’t already. We don’t know what threat any future iants may pose, soyou haven’t come forward for any jabs, it is absolutely essential you do so.”When can you have a booster jab Yorkshire-based Professor Mahendra G Patel OBE, Pharmacy and Inclusion and Diversity Lead, said: “You can get a COVID- booster three months after your second dose and  days after positive COVID test. It’s also not too late to get a first or second dose. Getting the vaccine has never been easier. Everybody aged  and over have now been offered two doses of a COVID- vaccine. If you are  years old or above on the day the vaccinations are taking place in school, you will be able to access a vaccine.If you have not yet had a COVID- vaccine, it’s not too late. Appointments for first doses of COVID- vaccines are still available for anyone unvaccinated.”Is it safe to have a booster jabI’m pregnant London-based Dr Jenny Jardine from Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, who is also seven months pregnant and has had her COVID- booster jab, said: “Both as a doctor and pregnant mother myself, we can now be very confident the COVID- vaccinations provide the best possible protection for you and your unborn child against this virus. I would strongly call on all pregnant women like me,you haven’t had the vaccine yet, to either speak to your GP or midweyou still have questions and then book right away today.”Does a booster jab carry side effects Dr Okorocha said: “The COVID- vaccine is quick, easy and free. Don’t worry about the side effects. Like all medicines, the COVID- vaccines may cause some side effects, but most of these are mild and short-term, lasting no longer than a week, and not everyone gets them. Also,you weren’t able to get your booster dose because you had COVID-, remember to book your jab  days after you no longer have the virus.”How easy is it to get a booster jab Bradford-based NHS Dr Amir Khan said: “We know many people are juggling busy lives, which is exactly why the NHS is making it as easy as possible for you to get your booster. New walkin vaccination sites have been set up across the country, and existing sites have extended their opening hours, so as many people as possible can get jabbed as soon as possible. And, once you’ve had your vaccine, then why not encourage your friends and family to book as well, so we all have the best protection possible.”How effective is a booster jab Prof Patel said: “New analysis of vaccine efficacy by UKHSA has found protection against hospitalisation from vaccines is good against the Omicron iant. When the reduced risk of hospitalisation was combined with vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease, the vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation was estimated as  per cent two weeks after a booster dose. One dose of any vaccine was associated with a  per cent reduced risk of hospitalisation among symptomatic cases with the Omicron iant, two doses with a  per cent reduction up to  weeks after the second dose and a  per cent reduced risk  or more weeks after the second dose.”Your booster jab is vital vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Even so, there still seems to be some uncertainty about whether or not this date is set in stone. Meanwhile, there are many questions that remain unanswered about how the scheme will work in practice. #That is particular the case in our islands, where national schemes often fail to recognise local circumstances. That is why I felt it was important to bring together local stakeholders in Orkney and provide them with an opportunity to raise any questions or concerns with Circularity Scotland, the body responsible for overseeing the rollout of DRS.#I would also encourage any local business or community group with an interest in this issue to get in touch with me.#We have seen from the experience of other countries how such schemes can deliver real benefits in terms of reducing waste, litter and emissions. The success of DRS in Scotland, however, will depend on ensuring we get the details right, not just in our cities but in rural and island settings as well.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Does the minister agree with me that the UK Shared Prosperity Fund should be the source of replacement funding for organisations like EMEC, that no longer have access to Interreg funding  And what#s the Scotland Office doing to make that case within Government ”Responding for the government, Iain Stewart MP, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Scotland said:“I#m very pleased to say that I had the pleasure of visiting Stromness last summer, and saw for myself the huge potential that Orkney has to lead the country in renewable energy. I continue to speak with the Leader of Orkney Islands Council, to explore all the ways we can help fund these exciting projects.”Reacting after the exchange, Mr Carmichael said:“After years of success putting the Northern Isles on the map for green energy innovation, it could be easy to forget that the success of EMEC did not come out of nowhere. Consistent support through EU funding has reaped idends for our community and for the country as a whole. It is simply a no-brainer for the government to commit to continuing that backing in full – and I shall be making the case to the minister on this matter again.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I’m feeling pretty amazing, to be honest.”Speaking of advice received from Farrell, Hansen added: “He said: ‘ you can’t be yourself, there’s no point putting on the jersey’.“When Andy says something like that it sticks with you. Just go out there and enjoy yourself, that’s all you do at the end of the day.”Dominant Ireland cruised to victory over the depleted Welsh, with Andrew Conway’s second-half brace and a solo score from Garry Ringrose sealing a deserved bonus-point victory.The perfect start! ✅#TeamOfUs | #IREvWAL pic luwgyfXE— Irish RugbyFebruary , Hansen’s elevation to international level came on the back of some scintillating displays at provincial level since moving to Galway from Canberra-based club Brumbies last year.The United Rugby Championship’s leading try scorer, who filled the void left by the injured James Lowe, was able to savour the moment he was named star man on the public address system and promptly made an emotional phone call home at full-time.“It was in a breakso I did hear it,” he said of being picked as man of the match.“I think I did a little smile here or there. It was a special moment. I did get to enjoy it a little bit.“I gave my parents a call. It was good to talk to mum and dad and my brother Jake to enjoy this experience with them.“They were just stoked for me, they were proud. They were a bit the same as me, speechless.“They couldn’t make the trip over, unfortunately, but they definitively did all they could to make this is a special week for me.”Hansen, who has scored six tries in nine appearances for Connacht, was presented with his green jersey by club-mates Aki and Jack Carty. vw,vw,px, px\"Ireland head coach Andy Farrell, pictured, was impressed by Mack Hansen The former Australia Under- player is well placed to retain his spot away to France next weekend after impressing coach Farrell.“We’re not surprised – he’s got the temperament for handling debuts,” Farrell said of Hansen’s maiden display.“He’s very cool, calm and collected in how he plays the game and it suits how we play as well.“We want to be nice and controlled in how we make decisions and I thought he was pretty smooth at times.”Respect after battle, always. #GuinnessSixNations pic DFgkiRsh— Guinness Six NationsFebruary , Captain Johnny Sexton, who kicked Ireland’s other nine points, said of Hansen: “He’s a good guy, which is the most important thing.“He’s bedded in really well into the group and his performance speaks for itself.“He’s got a game which is made for international rugby, so hopefully he continues to grow with us.

North Korea also demonstrated “increased capabilities for rapid deployment, wide mobility , and improved resilience of its missile forces”.The experts said North Korea “continued to seek material, technology and know-how for these programmes overseas, including through cyber means and joint scientic research.”A year ago, the  said North Korea had modernised its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles by flaunting United Nations sanctions, using cyberattacks to help finance its programmes and continuing to seek material and technology overseas for its arsenal including in Iran.“Cyberattacks, particularly on cryptocurrency assets, remain an important revenue source” for Kim Jong Un’s government, the experts monitoring the implementation of sanctions against the North said in the new report.In recent months, North Korea has launched a iety of weapons systems and threatened to lt the four-year moratorium on more serious weapons tests such as nuclear explosions and ICBM launches.January saw a record nine missile launches, and other weapons it recently tested include a developmental hypersonic missile and a submarine-launched missile.The Security Council initially imposed sanctions on North Korea after its first nuclear test explosion in  and made them tougher in response to further nuclear tests and the country’s increasingly sophisticated nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.The  of experts said North Korea’s blockade aimed at preventing Covid- resulted in “historically low levels” of people and goods entering and leaving the country.The  has previously made clear that North Korea remains able to evade sanctions and to illicitly import refined petroleum, access international banking channels and carry out “malicious cyber activities”.UN sanctions ban North Korean coal exports and the experts said in the new report that although coal exports by sea increased in the second half of , “they were still at relatively low levels”.“The quantity of illicit imports of refined petroleum increased sharply in the same period, but at a much lower level than in previous years,” the  said.The experts said North Korea also continues to evade maritime sanctions “by deliberately obfuscated financial and ownership networks”.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

So I think we’re concerned particularly about what can we do to try to protect those who are hardest up, who are going to suffer most from that “And in some ways, the worst is still to come because although food price inflation in Tesco over the last quarter was only %, we are impacted by rising energy prices our suppliers are impacted by rising energy prices.“So the likelihood is that that inflation trigger will rise but we’re doing all we can to offset it.”The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, has warned that inflation could hit .% by April and is unlikely to fall back to normal levels for two years.The Bank raised interest rates to .% on Thursday with further rises expected.It comes as the Government said it has not ruled out stepping in with more supportenergy bills rise again as expected in October.Mr Allan added: “I predicted last autumn that food prices by the spring might be rising about %.“I sincerely believe that it’s not going to be any more than that, it might even be slightly less, but that’s the sort of number we’re talking about.“But of course %,you’re spending – as some of the least well-off families are spending – % of your household income, is signicant.“It troubles us and I’m sure troubles many people that people may have to struggle to choose between heating their homes and feeding their families and that’s clearly not a situation that any of us should tolerate.”He added that fuel prices are “unlikely to come down very quickly”.“There has been a huge surge in fuel prices in the last year. And I think our hope is that they will now stabilised and ultimately come down but they’re unlikely to come down very quickly, I think.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

So I am very happy for him he could save us from a penalty shoot-out.”A good old fashioned #EmiratesFACup tie! 💪More from Marcos. ⤵️— Cha FCFebruary , Macaulay Gillesphey’s header handed Plymouth a shock early lead at Stamford Bridge on Saturday, with the Blues striking the woodwork three times in chasing a riposte.Captain Cesar Azpilicueta backheeled home the equaliser with a well-worked effort, but the Blues could not kill the tie in regulation time.Alonso thought he had settled the argument by sweeping into the net, only for that late penalty drama where Kepa ensured the Blues could avoid a shoot-out.Cha jetted out to Abu Dhabi on Saturday night for their Club World Cup campaign, which gets underway on Wednesday.Boss Thomas Tuchel was missing however, after testing positive for Covid- and starting self-isolation.First team coaches Michels and Zsolt Low will take charge in Tuchel’s absence, with the German boss still hoping to be able to head to Abu Dhabi later in the coming week.Hello round five! 👋#EmiratesFACup pic jnTKWXtNLZ— Cha FCFebruary , Cha’s extra-time exploits could leave the Blues heavy-legged on arrival in the United Arab Emirates, but Michels hopes otherwise.“Hopefully the extra-time will not have too much effect,” said Michels.“We had to accept that after our break it was tough to play against an opponent who was very well organised.“To play  minutes was not the target, I have to say, but we will see.“It isn’t easy to come into a game like this after a break.”Plymouth boss Steven Schumacher hopes the Pilgrims can harness their Stamford Bridge experience to boost their League One campaign.“There’s plenty of things we can learn from this experience,” said Schumacher.“But also we must take a lot of pride and encouragement.“Cha players like Mason Mount were very gracious and gave us praise for how organised we were.“That’s a big boost to the players and hopefully can give us a positive lt going back into the league schedule.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

It is hugely disappointing.“If we look back at the game, we let them score seven points in the first couple of minutes, and then seven points again in the first couple minutes of the second-half.“There were patches when we showed good physicality, but at international level you have got to be showing that physicality and the consistency of that for the  minutes.“Look, we will recover now, assess everything on Monday and be honest with each other.“I think it is important that we are honest with each other and we work on those things we need to work on, and we will definitely have a good training week ahead of Scotland.”Wales went into the game without a number of injured British and Irish Lions, including Alun Wyn Jones, George North, Ken Owens, Justin Tipuric and Josh Navidi.Ireland open their campaign with a fantastic performance! ☘️#IREvWAL #GuinnessSixNations pic IMTKoOzxQ— Guinness Six NationsFebruary , But Beard added: “”You could look at it and say we are losing a lot of caps, but then it is for boys to step in, put their hands up and give a good account of themselves.“We didn’t lose because we were missing how many caps, it was because we didn’t perform on the day. That’s the brutal, honest truth about it.“We have got to pick ourselves up, we can’t be down. There are four games left – we are only game one into the campaign.“We will be honest with each other, come Monday, and look to improve on the stuff we need to work on. It is just about building that atmosphere and getting round each other.” vw,vw,px, px\"Wales head coach Wayne Pivac saw his team well-beaten by Ireland Wales’ scrum – an area where Ireland were tipped to dominate – held up well as one of the few positive outcomes for them.A much-vaunted back ision was unable to fire, and it remains to be seen whether head coach Wayne Pivac retains prolic try-scoring wing Josh Adams as a rookie outside centre, or moves him back to his strongest position.There will be concern, too, about wing Louis Rees-Zammit, who had his right ankle strapped during the Aviva Stadium warm-up and did not appear to be at full throttle after that.“We probably didn’t get enough ball, to start with,” Beard said. vw,vw,px, px\"Taine Basham, pictured centre being tackled by Ireland’s Josh Van Der Flier, scored Wales’ only try in the - defeat against Ireland .“It felt like we defended most of that game, andyou defend for most of the game it is obviously going to be hard to put points on the board and get a foothold.“Probably, our set-piece percentages weren’t where we would like to be to fire real shots. Even when we did have ball in hand, probably our intent, our go-forward wasn’t where we like to be.“You look at the players we have got in that back-line, there is a lot of firepower, a lot of speed and a lot of quality players.“We will look to improve that aspect, come next week, and then hopefully we can get these players ball in hand and they can cause real damage to the opposition.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Populations became more economically resilient, he said.The cost of using the Faroese tunnels was at first around the same as a ferry journey but over time as usage increased, tolls were slashed to less than a fth of that.Now, Mr Lamhauge said the debate was about whether to cut the tolls altogether.The meeting also heard questions from pupils at Mid Yell and Whalsay schools as well as input from some of the  or so people viewing the debate.Among the biggest subjects for debate was where would the first tunnel be builtMr Lamhauge said it took around  years to get such projects going.The Shetland Times...Ive been a reporter since  at newspapers in Lincolnshire and East Anglia.

They prefer instead to view Gaelic as a natural medium for their music # a not atypical outlook for their island generation raised with the language as part of their education during the s.And this should be encouraging, for the key to the future survival of the language will lie not in its exceptionalism, but in its ordinariness.While Gaelic may be natural to Niteworks, what sets them apart is how they use it. Their trademark sound is forged from the rich Hebridean song tradition of their native communities, and the dance music they listened to in their bedrooms, and later in Glasgow nightclubs.They have just released their third album # A’ Ghrian,– which follows the eponymous debut album of  and Air Fàir An Làwhich came out in .In what should have been one of the marquee events of Glasgow’s Celtic Connections festival, last Friday Niteworks should have been on stage with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. But to immense frustration and disappointment, Covid restrictions were not been lted in time and the concert has been rescheduled for the summer.Unsurprisingly, lockdown and the pandemic are themes that have influenced the new album, says band member Allan MacDonald.. “It has been over two years since I have been to a club as a punter.“That was a huge part of our lives. I wouldn’t say it has changed our musical tastes, but what we listen to at home now is dferent to what we would listen to in a club.“That has influenced us and the direction we are going as a band. We’re also getting a bit older, there’s two in the band that have young families now and this album is perhaps a bit more reflective than the others.”It is approaching  years since the quartet put on their first gig – at Braes Hall as part of the year of Highland culture celebrations in . Their first EP followed in , and Niteworks have since become regulars on the festival circuit # including annual appearances at SkyeLive in Portree.They aren’t full time as a band, however, and online rehearsing was a familiar process to them long before the outset of the pandemic.Allan, who is from Braes and from a family of pipers, works in renewable energy and is based in London. Synth and keyboard player Innes Strachan from Breakish works in sound production in Glasgow drummer Ruaraidh Graham, also from Breakish, works in Edinburgh for Historic Environment Scotland and bass player Chris Nicolson, from Braes, is with the BBC in Inverness.One of their ‘lockdown projects’ included writing the music to mark Edinburgh’s Hogmanay, and in turn this led to the orchestral collaboration and the more ‘expansive and cinematic’ sound of the new album, says Ruairidh Graham.“We were partly inspired by our work writing the music for Edinburgh’s Hogmanay Fare Well film that reflected on what  had been like for many during the pandemic,” he adds. “The nature of the project required broad expansive sounds, and that led to us going further in that direction through the writing and recording of the album.“Our upcoming orchestral concert for Celtic Connections further reinforced our desire to keep down that path.”There is an abundance of vocal talent to be found on A’ Ghrian, including from long-time collaborators Sian . Celebrated Scottish singers Kathleen MacInnes, Beth Malcolm, Hannah Rarity and Alasdair Whyte also feature, and Niteworks have incorporated English folk and Scots songs into their repertoire for the first time.The album, which was funded by Creative Scotland and recorded in autumn , also features Fiona MacAskill, Aileen Reid and Laura Wilkie of Kinnaris Quintet alongside Susan Appelbe on strings.A’ Ghrian is available to buy on CD and stream and download on all digital s, and the band will tour the until the end of .

This falls in with ‘Candlemas’ on nd February as a Christian festival and a traditional end of the Christmas season. Candlemas commemorates the presentation of the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem as described in St Luke’s Gospel and when some denominations bring candles to their church. Candlemas is also one of the so-called ‘Quarter-days’ marking the changing seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn. It is followed by Whitsun, Lammas Day and Martinmas as the term-days with their administrative and legal implications for the payment of rents and flittings. Saint Bride or Saint Bridget has been one of the most popular of the saints of the celtic church. Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD . Bridget was one of the patron saints of Ireland and is remembered in the tradition of plaiting rush crosses around st February to set over doors and windows to protect the home from fire and other danger.   or the endearing ‘Bride’s little fosterling’.’ . ‘Bride’s Day, the birthday of spring’. century, traditions of Saint Bride were collected by Alexander Carmichael among his prayers, hymns, blessings and charms from the Hebrides. He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first. It dfers in dferent localities: [Early on Bride’s mornThe serpent shall come from the hole, I shall not molest the serpent, Nor will the serpent molest me.’ The snake is a powerful element in mythology and religion and a creature to be respected as the ‘hymn’ makes clear. Familiar in the snake coiled round the rod, it is a symbol of medicine and healing, and the appearance of the adder or snake on Saint Bride’s Day offers a feeling of hope and transformation, and of turning the corner with the ening of the days. . century. .!... !"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Donnie-Munro-picture-scaled.jpg","title":"special donnie munro concert to bring skye live back with a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe island#s premier music festival is set toin style on Thursday th May # following a two-year break due to the pandemic # with an opening night extravaganza # ‘Coming Home: An Evening with Donnie Munro and friends’ and featuring special guests in the form of multi-award-winning Gaelic supergroup Mànran.The show will be Donnie’s first in his hometown since  and will see him perform with a full eight-piece band line-up on the spectacular Skye Live Festival site at Am Meall in Portree. The singer said: #This offers me a fantastic opportunity to bring this amazing line-up, featuring some of Scotland’s top musicians together, for an exclusive performance to open this year’s Skye Live Festival.He added: #It has been fantastic to watch the festival grow in strength, year on year, in what must be one of the most special and unique festival locations anywhere in the world, and to see it become internationally recognised as, ‘one of the best boutique festivals in the country’, is just fantastic for the island, and it is such a great honour for me to be invited to be a part of it all and to be bringing the music back home here to where it all began.#Joining Donnie Munro on the night will be Mànran, internationally recognised as one of the most iconic and respected Scottish bands on the road today.

They all have had their own personalities and have brought dferent qualities to the job and I’ve enjoyed working alongside each one.”Another positive change Muriel witnessed was the reduction of the speed limit outside the school to mph.“This really helps,” explains Muriel. “It’s such a busy road, especially with all the lorries coming from Larne so mph at arriving and leaving times is vital.“I’ve had a few near misses with speeding vehicles over the years soeveryone sticks to the mph limit it makes it alot safer for the children.”Although looking forward to her retirement, there are aspects of the job Muriel says she will greatly miss.“I’ll miss everyone I work with and of course the children! “I’ll also miss waving at everyone in the mornings and afternoons because I’ve built up alot of friendships over the years and got to know alot of the parents. I made a great friend through the school, Stella Rea who has sadly passed away, but she was something  and a great lady!“I’ll also miss the children and hearing all their stories and woes! I’ve seen many a fall and tumble and witnessed many games in the playground over the years and can truthfully say I’ve enjoyed every minute.”Chairman of the school’s Board of Governors, Mr Jim Allister paid tribute to Muriel’s years of service. He said: “Often schools are valued and judged on the quality of their teaching etc, but equally often the role played by the support staff is taken for granted.“In Muriel we had for decades that invaluable asset of a dedicated partner in delivering the pastoral care and support to our pupils for which Moorfields is renowned.“Not only has she kept generations of children safe in crossing the very busy main road, but she has been that reliable, compassionate point of contact for so many. Through all weathers, Muriel was there to do her remarkable job with the understatement that betokens her caring commitment.“The school is immensely grateful for her decades of service and wish her well in her retirement.”As Mrs Cupples embarks on this next phase of her le away from Moorfields Primary School she was keen to thank all the staff, pupils and parents for their support over the years.“I just want to say thank you to every single one of you who have made my time here so pleasant.

He joined the firm  years ago as an apprentice before working his way up through the ranks.“We’re proud to say our apprentices are playing a key part in driving the business forward,” said Mr McLeister. “We eventually want to have up to  per cent of our workforce on an apprenticeship, via our ious Engineering  Technology Higher Apprenticeship programmes and our general Apprenticeship NI scheme, and this latest recruitment drive will help with that ambition.“They bring ersity, bags of enthusiasm and a fresh approach to problem-solving.”Wrightbus apprentices receive on the job training, working alongside a highly skilled workforce who often act as coaches mentors, along with a college day release programme to back up what they’re learning.Former apprentice Karsten Hall, who started as a design apprentice and now works as a manufacturing engineer, chose a Wrightbus apprenticeship because he wanted to make a start in the world of work.“I wanted a job that provided training and opportunities for progression. I was interested in engineering, so I decided to apply for a Wrightbus apprenticeship,” said Karsten.“From my time on the shopfloor, I gained a lot of hands-on experience with most parts of the build process and a better perspective of how parts are actually assembled and how they can be improved, which helps me in my current role as a manufacturing engineer.”Wrightbus employee Hannah Currie said: “Learning with hands-on experience made a big dference for me, helping with the progression of my career. ‘The experience working with the time-served tradesmen and women, and having such a iety of technology and buses can help you develop so much more knowledge and skills to help you along the way. There are a multitude of opportunities for furthering your career with an apprenticeship.”Sean McAleese, Work Based Learning Managing at Northern Regional College, which works with Wrightbus apprentices, said: “Wrightbus has always been a reliable and trusted employer that has worked closely with the College to develop and implement our apprenticeship programmes at Level , Level  and Higher Level Apprenticeships.“It is great to see the opportunities that have been provided to young people and existing employees who have undertaken an apprenticeship with Wrightbus as well as the high level skills, experience and qualications that they gain. We will continue to partner with the company to identy their training requirements and look forward to strengthening the College’s partnership with Wrightbus in the future.”The National Campaign celebrates the contribution that hundreds of thousands of apprentices make every year to the UK’s economy and encourages more businesses to look to apprenticeships as a solution for recruitment, training, and workforce development. Wrightbus HR Director, Nicola McCloskey, said: “Our apprentices are an invaluable part of our business and we would like to recognise them and thank them for the hard work and effort they put in. They often bring with them new skills and energy, and we’re looking forward to adding to the ranks with this latest round of recruitment.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1643983884189.jpg--covid_19___fri_4th_february_figures.jpg?1643983884000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220204newscovid 19 fri 4th february figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows one further coronavirus related death and , new positive test results.

Credit: Kelvin Boyes   Press Eye. FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueProfessor Mike TildesleyLisa SmythTwitterFebruary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailTake a quick glance at the Department of Health’s Covid- dashboard, and it is obvious that cases of the virus are surging in young people.There have been , positive cases in children aged five to nine over the past seven days. A further , youngsters in the  to -year-old bracket tested positive over the same period.If the figures don’t convince you, speak to any parent. Families that have managed to steer clear of Covid since it arrived almost two years ago are now being struck down by the virus.First, a classmate who is a close contact of a parent with Covid comes to school. Under the rules, they’re allowed to attend as long as they have a negative lateral flow test for  days, but many are going on to develop a Covid infection they then pass on to classmates.It doesn’t help that a child can spend all day sitting next to a friend who later tests positive for Covid — and they are not even considered a close contact.Then, the virus ripples out through year groups. Siblings become infected and, very quickly, large swathes of multiple year groups are unwell and isolating.Professor Ian Young, the chief scientic adviser, said that the highly infectious nature of Omicron meant most schools would be hit by an outbreak,they had not been already.The situation is further exacerbated by the fact that most children are not vaccinated, and there is evidence that previous Delta and Alpha infections do not protect against Omicron.“There is quite a large proportion of under-s with limited immunity,” said Prof Young.“What tends to happenthe virus gets into a classroom or school [is that] it will transmit pretty easily. While [the protections] can reduce the risk, they can’t stop it completely.“There are some schools with quite severe outbreaks and other schools which have had not so much Covid, but sooner or later, most schools are going to have to experience some virus.”So, while we know children are less likely to suffer severe illness from Covid-, it does not mean the impact on their lives is not severe.Even for those children who are asymptomatic, and setting aside the threat posed by long Covid, self-isolation rules are taking their toll on schools.NASUWT national official Justin McCamphill said: “We’re hearing instances where half the school is off with Covid, and then in some schools, it’s half the teachers.“That’s then having a major impact because whole year groups are having to be sent home, and I think that’s being borne out by the absence figures.“That’s causing real anxiety, especially for the exam classes. “I would say this is the worst we have ever seen. It’s becoming impossible for schools to run normal business.”Mental health champion Siobhan O’Neill is also concerned about Covid’s impact in schools.“There have been studies that show really clearly that young people have been displaying signs of stress throughout the pandemic, and young people need their peers to cope with stress,” she said.“They play together to help process that stress. When they don’t get that chance to be together, it does have an impact.“The short answer is there will be an impact on children’s mental health. Most children will be fine, but young people will develop mental ill-health.”Prof O’Neill said this could manest itself in a number of ways, including eating disorders and self-harm behaviours used as a coping mechanism.We know that the negative impact of the lockdowns on children was a major driving factor in reopening schools and keeping them open even as the highly infectious Omicron strain arrived on these shores.But with case rates now so high, when can families and schools expect some respite With , new cases and a further death in a person aged over  recorded yesterday, it is obvious Covid has not disappeared. Yet, Professor Mike Tildesley, an expert in infectious disease modelling at the University of Warwick, is hopeful the situation in schools will begin to improve in the coming weeks.“It’s always hard to predict, but my hope is that we get towards the end of February and start to see cases go down,” he said.However, he warned the removal of other restrictions was likely to result in at least a plateau in the case rate. “The situation is slightly complicated by the end of interventions,” he said.Prof Young is also optimistic that we may soon begin to see a downward trend in case numbers, which will eventually allow more children and teachers toto classes.“We have seen an overall increase in the case numbers of over %, and that’s been largely driven by cases in people aged  and under,” he said.“We have also seen a small increase in adults between  and , and I’m pretty sure those are parents of schoolchildren [because] there is a high risk of household transmission once Covid gets into a household.“There is a secondary peak, and I don’t think we’re over the top yet.“I think that there is a big question over how rapidly it’s going to decline. “It could be relatively slow and, certainly, it could take a number of weeks, but I would expect it to be well declined by Easter.”With Covid expected to continue to circulate at fairly high levels in schools in the coming months, what do the experts believe should be put in place to help alleviate the situation Prof Young said continuing measures such as ventilation, face coverings and vaccination would prove crucial.However, Prof Tildesley said he would like to see face coverings removed from school settings as soon as possible.Meanwhile, Prof O’Neill called for vaccinations to be made available to younger age groups.“There is evidence of increased hospitalisation of children with Covid,” he said.“I’m disappointed that vaccination isn’t available to children, I think, at the very least, there should be that choice so parents can weigh up the benefits versus the risks.”Related topicsDepartment of HealthDepartment of EducationMore On Department of HealthPolitical instability the last thing NI needs, says business chief Simon Hamilton PremiumScrapping hospital car park charges in Northern Ireland ‘would cost cash-strapped health chiefs almost £m a year’ and could damage patient care, Stormont toldOver £k to be allocated to three mental health organisations in south and west BelfastNewry district tops league table for highest Covid infection rates in UK PremiumIrish FA chiefs front up and tackle the burning questions as they launch their new strategy - A Roadmap for FootballMost ReadDonna Traynor discrimination case against BBC set to open on ThursdaySam McBrideOpinionPeculiar moves by DUP hint at party spat undermining sea border strategyCop’s we on child abuse images chargesA measure of support for DUP’s great gamble in the heartland of unionismCovid and children in Northern Ireland: ‘It’s becoming impossible to operate normal school business’Top VideosPlayFamilies of bookies atrocity vow to fight for justice on th anniversaryPlayCaoimhe Morgan Breaking The Silence Memorial WalkPlayEast Belfast reacts to First Minister Paul Givan#s resignationLatest CoronavirusMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Three deaths and , new cases reportedNI head teachers facing ‘chaos’ amid Covid battle and budget cuts, says association chiefHealth Minister Robin Swann facing judicial review over treatment of NI care home residents during pandemic‘PM made a mockery of my lowest point’, says Co Down man who stood outside graveyard while daughter was buriedLatestCharles hails Camilla’s ‘steadfast support’ on Queen’s ‘remarkable’ JubileeNot a ‘chance in hell’ PM will step aside voluntarily, says Tory peerReece James heads to Abu Dhabi with Cha as they prepare for Club World CupPhone technology among ‘cutting-edge’ cancer projects awarded £m fundingEddie Jones takes the blame for tactical decisions after Scotland loss,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueThe project was to look at the use of language by media in Northern Ireland Ciaran O#NeillFebruary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailPlans for a project to explore the “use of language” by the media in Northern Ireland will not go ahead as planned.The research was to form part of a project exploring the role northern-based media outlets play in the public debate on political issues.This was part of the Future Relationship Conversations Project, which is partly funded by the Irish government.The project is led by a Derry-based community development organisation, the Holywell Trust, and they issued a tender for the media research last year.However, a spokesperson for the Holywell Trust last week said no tender applications were received and, as a result, the project would not proceed as planned.When details of the proposed media project emerged last year, it was criticised by some unionist politicians because of the involvement of the Irish government.The tender stated that the aim of the research had been “to review and assess the impact of the use of language by Northern Ireland-based media, and the positive negative contribution that this makes to addressing ision and deepening understanding of the constitutional issue”.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox

Holywell Trust through its Reconciliation Fund.The fund annually awards grants to organisations working to build better relations within and between traditions in Northern Ireland, between north and south, and between Ireland and Britain.A DFA spokesperson said that while the proposed media research project was to be partly funded by the Irish government, it would have had no part in choosing the topics researched.Although the media research project will not proceed, plans are in place for a separate aspect of the Future Relationship Conversations Project to go ahead.The Holywell Trust has issued a tender for research to be carried out into how Protestant people living in Co Donegal believe they have been treated since the partition of Ireland.According to the tender document, the exact remit of the project will be to look at “attitudes of the Protestant community in Laggan area of east Donegalon their acceptance within the Republic of Ireland since the partition of Ireland, and Northern Ireland-related issues, including the constitutional question”.It is planned that the final research report will be published in June.The tender document claims there is a “need, and growing desire across communities, to have a conversation on the future constitutional status of Northern Ireland and Ireland”.“The conversation needs to be broad, encompassing all future possibilities,” the document adds.“The Future Relationship Conversations project engages with the community, to begin to remove uncertainty and move the conversation beyond the normal identity-focused assumptions.“The Brexit process has also clearly demonstrated the dangers in holding referendums with limited information on the outcome of the decisions.We are convinced thatpeople have been informed and engaged on

It did not comment when asked about how much of the £.m was intended for bank charges.Mr Lyons said the scheme had been a huge success, with .m cards dispatched, and spending using the cards had boosted the economy by £.m.Related topicsGordon LyonsDepartment for the EconomyUlster Unionist PartyAlan ChambersMore On Gordon Lyons PremiumViewpointOpinionWorking at home now a viable option PremiumPoliticians question Invest NI handing out £.m to fossil fuel extraction firmsDress to impress: ASOS seeks new NI tech recruitsStormont minister Lyons ‘confident’ over Boris Johnson’s pledge to replace EU fundingHigh Street scheme payments to , accounts ‘won’t have to be spent local’Most ReadDonna Traynor discrimination case against BBC set to open on ThursdaySam McBrideOpinionPeculiar moves by DUP hint at party spat undermining sea border strategyA measure of support for DUP’s great gamble in the heartland of unionismCop’s we on child abuse images chargesCovid and children in Northern Ireland: ‘It’s becoming impossible to operate normal school business’Top VideosPlayFamilies of bookies atrocity vow to fight for justice on th anniversaryPlayCaoimhe Morgan Breaking The Silence Memorial WalkPlayEast Belfast reacts to First Minister Paul Givan#s resignationLatest Northern IrelandBoris Johnson must commit to using Article , insists DUP leader‘Better education key to tackling stigma of HIV’… Positive Le CEO Jacquie Richardson wants to smash taboo around AidsEmma Spence reflects on farm tragedy  years on... ‘I feel lucky I had my dad and brothers until I was ’Ivan LittleOpinionDesperate DUP gambling with the future of Northern Ireland to save own skin‘Belfast bomber’ was the one title I didn’t want, says former boxing champion Eamon McAuleyLatestReece James heads to Abu Dhabi with Cha as they prepare for Club World CupPhone technology among ‘cutting-edge’ cancer projects awarded £m fundingEddie Jones takes the blame for tactical decisions after Scotland lossFrank Lampard warns tougher tests lie ahead after winning start to Everton reignTikTokers describe trolling and misinformation working on Covid campaign,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have got exceptional civil servants. The past  hours, it has been like a balloon being burst. We can just feel the air pummelling out of this balloon as everyone has been let down,” he said.“I am massively disappointed. I am yet to hear anybody suggest to me either a short, medium or long-term advantage to what has happened at the end of last week for our health service.“Everybody within the system is massively committed.

It allows us to plan services... as opposed to simply react and firefight. There is no question a huge opportunity is going to be lostwe don’t get that three-year budget.”Dr Stout said despite the collapse of the Executive, there “has to be movement” in the service, as he also called for Health Minister Robin Swann to be given the power to make changes to Northern Ireland’s Covid- restrictions.The possibility of easing Covid restrictions in Northern Ireland was due to be considered at the Executive’s next meeting on February .It is understood Mr Swann is seeking legal advice on whether he can still act without an Executive in place.“We have to figure out ways around this. If the minister is going to be in place without the budget we still need to figure ways around this,” added Dr Stout.“We know how much people are suffering on a daily basis. It is the absolute priority for all of us.“We have this tantalising glimpse of how things can be done well and then we took a massive step backwards.For the sake of us as a population moving forward I think that would be the most sensible [having Mr Swann take Covid- decisions].“It is great there is this level of optimism we are moving out of the pandemic, but there still is uncertainty.“We absolutely hope it is all going to be positive from this point onwards, but we need a minister there.

The softly-spoken -year-old’s performance in Washington could have broad implications for US-German relations and Mr Scholz’s standing at home.While former President Donald Trump frequently slammed Germany, accusing it of not pulling its weight internationally, his successor has sought to rebuild relations with Berlin.Having succeeded long-time German leader Angela Merkel last year, Mr Scholz also needs to appease doubters at home who accuse him of pulling a diplomatic vanishing act compared to his European counterparts.With the phrase “Where is Scholz ” trending on social media last week, German conservative opposition leader Friedrich Merz called for “clear words” from the government on the Ukraine crisis.Most ReadDonna Traynor discrimination case against BBC set to open on ThursdaySam McBrideOpinionPeculiar moves by DUP hint at party spat undermining sea border strategyCop’s we on child abuse images chargesA measure of support for DUP’s great gamble in the heartland of unionismCovid and children in Northern Ireland: ‘It’s becoming impossible to operate normal school business’Top VideosPlayFamilies of bookies atrocity vow to fight for justice on th anniversaryPlayCaoimhe Morgan Breaking The Silence Memorial WalkPlayEast Belfast reacts to First Minister Paul Givan#s resignationLatest WorldRussia hits new daily Covid- record with , casesUN experts say North Korea seeks to produce material for nuclear programmesAreas cleared in Pakistan after militant attacks kill nine troopsOlympic organisers address complaints about isolation hotelsPodcaster Joe Rogan apologises for racial slur after video surfacesLatestAdam Beard says honesty is key to Wales recovery after heavy Ireland defeatGetting back the winning feeling was important, says FernandinhoSean Dyche keeps believing after Burnley draw a blankTwo Gardai in hospital after driver crashes into patrol carRussia hits new daily Covid- record with , cases,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They went through a few phases, allowing their out half to burst through a couple of tackles to score and take a - half time lead.Playing with the conditions in the second half, Ballynahinch started the on the front foot but fell foul of the referee at the breakdown, allowing Lurgan to pin them back in their own .The visiting forwards then went to work, carrying hard and scoring another try.The conversion left the home side  points down, but they hit back almost immediately with some great attacking rugby creating space for Callum McCargo to smash his way over.The game was on the line at this point, but a lack of composure allowed the excellent Lurgan full back to punish weak tackling and score a long range try.Left with a mountain to climb, Ballynahinch once again played some superb rugby with great interplay between centres James Graham and Harvey Campbell creating space for Sam Hamilton to dash for the line.He was stopped short but desperate Lurgan defending saw them receive a yellow card before Matthew McAuley reduced the deficit to five points with a try from a quickly taken penalty.A smash-and-grab victory against  men with only a minute on the clock demanded error-free rugby and after an excellent restart Ballynahinch moved upfield.However a knock-on saw the referee blow his whistle for full time and Lurgan earned a deserved victory.Both sides can be proud and the game was played in a superb spirit with the teams having lunch together in the clubhouse..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_Mourne.jpg","title":"Beauty of local landscapes feature in exploration events  ","story":"SEVERAL familiar locations in Downpatrick, Newcastle and Strangford are at the heart of this monthrsquos Northern Ireland Science Festival.There will be a selection of events between February  and  with people across the district encouraged to explore something new as ious venues prepare to play host to a series of stirring events.The so-called STEM celebration mdash which has grown to become the largest of its kind in Ireland mdash boasts more than  events over  days.On February , the St Patrick Centre in Downpatrick is the venue for the Patrick  The Pagan Hills event which provides an opportunity to follow in the footsteps of both the patron saint and pagan in an exploration of the landscape that Patrick himself encountered when he ed to Ireland nearly , years ago.On February  and , the Strangford Activity Centre is hosting a ldquopaddle back in time kayak adventure to Mahee Island following a traditional smuggling route undertaken by Daft Eddie and the Merry Hearts.There will also be an opportunity to discover ruins of the monastic site of Nendrum, le in the monastery in the Middle Ages and the role played by the Vikings in the Strangford Lough area between the th and th centuries.The Strangford Activity Centre is also hosting ldquopaddle with a purpose on February  and  with participants invited to do their bit for the environment by joining a clean-up of Strangford Lough.And ldquoforaging afloat on February  and  at the same venue sees people joining with the Centrersquos Rory Martin and Andrea and Graham Gannon of Peninsula Kelp for a unique guide to the sights and flavour of the area as spring arrives on the lough and with it an array of seasonal wild food.On February , therersquos an opportunity to discover the wonders of the Mournes at a range of festival events.During the Diamond Rock Walking Tour on February , guide Peter Rafferty will explains how to identy erse rock types and how the Mournes were formed, alongside learning about the amazing geology and history of the area at the Geology on the Rocks event on February .The following day, the Men of Mourne ndash Stone  Steel hiking tour takes place with an opportunity to hear stories of hardship and endurance as participants take to rocky mountain tracks.During the Mourne Stone Walling ndash A Granite Kingdom event, therersquos a chance to experience the beauty and hard graft behind the ,-year-old craft of dry-stone wall building. A date for the event has yet to be confirmed.On February  at the Newcastle Community Cinema, Film Hub NI is inviting families to a special screening of lsquoThe Snail and the Whalersquo, a joyous, empowering story about the natural wonders of the world and discovering that no matter how small you are, you can make a dference.And to coincide with this special screening, NI Science Festival has organised an interactive seashore adventure with Beach Schools NI which will take place a short walk from the cinema and is included in the ticket price.Festival director, Chris McCreery, said the event exists to engage audiences, stimulate discussion, and ignite interest in the wonders of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.ldquoWe are confident that this yearrsquos erse programming will expand the horizons of festival goers of all ages and abilities across Northern Ireland, he added.The Science Festival is supported by the Department for the Economy, Belfast City Council, Tourism NI, Derry City and Strabane Council, Queenrsquos University,Ulster University, British Council Northern Ireland, MCS Group, The Open University NI, Innovate UK, Matrix NI, Film Hub NI and Arts and Business NI..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_CD.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  February 5%2C 1992  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK ndash The Downe Hospital has been identied as the possible site of a new police station in Downpatrick.The Police Authority has expressed an interest in the large site in a move which would pave the way for the construction of a new Downe Hospital, utilising Lecale House and the Maternity Hospital as the core buildings on the Ardglass Road.The present Downe Hospital, medical assessment unit and nurses home would then be completely demolished to make way for a new police base.Police Authority officials toured the hospital complex before Christmas and are reported to be impressed with both the size of the site and its central location.The officials have also held informal discussions with representatives of the Eastern Health Board who are also believed to be attracted to the plan.The revenue generated by the sale of the massive complex would go a long way to paying for the construction of a new hospital which politicians have called for on numerous occasions.A spokeswoman for the Police Authority said it is not normal policy to comment on such matters, and she added that there is still a commitment to build a new police base on the Ballydugan Road.Although the Authority has obtained outline planning permission for the Ballydugan Road site, it is believed that the nature of the land and the potential size of the highly fortied station is causing concern.Publicly the Authority is pressing ahead with plans to build there, but behind the scenes it has continued to look at possible sites in ious town locations.The Downe Hospital has now emerged as the surprise front-runner although evensuch an ambitious plan is approved, it will be many years before a police station is operational on the site.ARDGLASS ndash A special sub-committee has been set up by Down District Council to consider the European Communityrsquos review of the common fisheries policy.The committee is to be empowered to provide a response to the document.Ardglass SDLP councillor, Mr Dermot Curran, said some of the systems that were being introduced by the EC are not very helpful to the people employed in the fishing industry. Others were, such as decommissioning, but are not being put into action.ldquoIn all of these schemes there is nothing to protect the people employed in the industry. Government must do something to help the plight of these people, said Mr Curran.He complained that these workers are treated as casual labour with no claim to redundancy or national assistance.ldquoThe fishing industry plays a very important part in the economy of Northern Ireland and we must protect it and the people who work in it. Government should set up systems to ensure that everybody is treated fairly, he said.Ulster Unionist, Mr Gerry Douglas, said something has to be done to assist and to at least ensure that the processing industry is retained in Down District.KILLINCHY ndash The  new jobs announced by the Northern Ireland Spinners group as part of a pound.m investment will have no direct impact on its Killinchy factory.A spokesman for the company explained following Thursdayrsquos official announcement that the expansion of the firmrsquos sister factory in Newtownards will have no adverse impact on the Killinchy operation.ldquoThey are sister factories, both concentrating on very similar yarns, he said.ldquoWe have already completed major expansions at Killinchy, virtually replacing all the machinery we had. Killinchy is a very modern mill, as modern as Newtownards, he added.Mr Ray Dinsdale, chief executive of Richards Plc, the Aberdeen-based parent company of Northern Ireland Spinners, said: ldquoThis investment will strengthen the position of Northern Ireland Spinners as the largest United Kingdom spinner of semi-worsted yarns for carpet manufacturers.ldquoOur strategy is based on the expansion of the business into Europe, and the investment will mean that Northern Ireland Spinners will be of the size required to enable it to offer the economies of scale and cost reductions which are required to win business from major carpet manufacturers in these competitive markets, added Mr Dinsdale.CROSSGAR ndash Crossgarrsquos loss has been Bangorrsquos gain with a -job factory picking up an important quality certication.The firm of Dunn and CompanyLtd. was set up in Crossgar in , and it has now picked up the BS quality certication.After four years of trading, the company relocated from its premises in Crossgar to a factory unit based in Balloo industrial estate, Bangor.It manufacturers special purpose valves and precision components for industrial application with  per cent of it business going to the export market.It currently employs  people and has plans for further expansion, explained Mr Ron Dunn, managing director.When asked why the company left Crossgar, Mr Ron Dunn, managing director said: ldquoThere was not enough room in Crossgar.ldquoWe occupied part of the premises of my brother, Sam, but there was just nothing available in the Crossgar area at that time when we employed three of four people.His brother continues his own successful firm manufacturing machine tools on the Saintfield Road, Crossgar.BISHOPSCOURT ndash Planning Service officials have been urged to attend next monthrsquos first bike race at the former Bishopscourt base ndash before reaching a decision on a planning application for a permanent circuit.The plea has been made this week by local SDLP councillor, Mr John Ritchie.ldquoI would expect they will understand the necessity to attend to make an informed judgement on the matter, explained Mr Ritchie.ldquoAfter that date I would hope a decision would not be long delayed.Mr Ritchie said he had read the petition against the proposed race track and seen the comments of those members of the Ballyhornan Development Association who support the proposal. He had also read the details given by the two developers.ldquoThere are a number of issues involved. I understand that there can be up to  meetings without planning permission per year the equivalent of one a month and two a month in two summer months. I would have thought this wasnrsquot unreasonable.SAINTFIELD ndash The centre of Saintfield was sealed off for three hours on Friday afternoon after the discovery of a suspicious package in a telephone box.The area around Crossgar Road and Toddrsquos Hill was closed as army bomb disposal experts carried out an examination of the device.The device which consisted of cassettes, a battery pack and wires, was described as an elaborate hoax and was taken away for examination.NEWCASTLE ndash Mentally handicapped people from all over Northern Ireland will soon be benefitting from a remarkable transformation at Newcastlersquos Ruby House.For the past year passers-by have seen the conversion of the Bryansford Road complex from a row of not-so-attractive seaside resort houses into aspacious and modern residential home which now offers accommodation for  mentally handicapped adults.This year the holiday home is expected to provide upwards of  holidays for mentally handicapped people from all over the Province.The Ruby House Group now has three centres in Newcastle, including a converted house in Main Street and the purpose-built Mary Murray House in the Lawnfield.STRANGFORD ndash A single Strangford Lough management committee is to be launched in the spring by the Environment Department.It will consist of about  representatives of lough users, the community around the lough and those with specialist knowledge of the area.This weekrsquos announcement reflects some of the views expressed by the Strangford Lough Nature Conservation Association the body which was set up a few years ago in protest against restrictive DoE proposals.The new body will have the development of management proposals for the lough area as its main task. It will be consulted on any designations or proposals by government or local government relating to the area, including the marine nature reserve..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2022_Celtic.jpg","title":"Gibney’s Hoops double  ","story":"IT was a case of what could have been for Killough, as Celtic Bhoys capitalised on opportunities to stay in the race for the title on Saturday.From the refereersquos first whistle it was a heated event at Ballyhornan with both sides looking to grab possession.The advantage of the wind was with Celtic Bhoys in the first half, and it was a minor error by Killough goalkeeper, James Crangle, in the fourth minute that gted Jay Gibney his first goal of the game.Cranglersquos kick out went direct to the striker and Gibney made no mistake with his finish.The Killough players looked more driven by this and showed great character supporting their goalkeeper to get his head back into the game. Connor Kelly had a chance for the visitors, but Celtic Bhoysrsquo goalkeeper, Nathan Curran, was on form and saved.It was a balanced game as both sides had their chances with Killoughrsquos Kevin Groves coming close in the th minute and Celtic Bhoysrsquo Jordan McCoubrey pushing forwarding search of an opportunity in front of the net.Killoughrsquos Gareth George had to be subbed due to an injury on his ankle and Declan Looney came on in the rd minute of the game. Jack McLaughlin had a one on one chance facing Curran, but the ball went straight at the lsquokeeper before it was cleared.The visitors were keeping up the pressure to level the score, with a surging run up the left wing from Looney, who passed across to find Connor Kelly, but again Nathan Curran saved.The second goal of the game came from a similar scenario to the first ndash a lacklustre kick out that found the feet of Jay Gibney again and Celtic Bhoys went two up going into half-time.Two errors by Killoughrsquos goalkeeper saw the hosts leading at half-time and all of the play was going down the right side of the field.Killough signalled their intentions that the game was not over, as Declan Looney looped the ball into the danger zone, and Nathan Curran somehow got his hand to it to push over the bar.Jay Gibney was set for his hat-trick in the th minute when the Killough custodian came out to stop him in his tracks. Gibney managed to manoeuvre round him, but the ball was cleared by Sean Burns. Celtic Bhoys had another chance to go three up, as three of their players from a free-kick stood looking at one another and the chance went a miss.Killoughrsquos Declan Burns played a great ball from the middle of the field to Declan Looney, who found team-mate Daniel Taggart. The striker saw his shot saved, but the rebound fell to Kevin Groves, who finished to bring his side back into the game with  minutes to go.Celtic Bhoys made a couple of substitutes in the next ten minutes, with Sean McMahon going up front and Sean Ferris ping back into midfield.As the clock ticked to the th minute, Killoughrsquos McLaughlin fired in a free-kick to the head of Eamon Gargan.However, man of the match Nathan Curran pushed the ball at full stretch over the bar.In the final five minutes of play it was all attack by Killough. Kevin Groves had a chance which was denied with Declan Looney quickly following up, although there was no way to find the leveller. It was in the last minute that the Killough goalkeeper made a clearance mistake that saw Shaun Megahey score to break Killough hearts.Celtic Bhoys will be very happy with the win, while Killough will count their missed chances. Nathan Curran made the dference in a tight game, and Killoughrsquos young Crangle will have learnt a lot from the contest for the remaining matches of the season.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey, R Quinn, R Fitzpatrick, M Rice, C Doherty, B Tracey, P Casey, J Gibney, J McCoubrey, C Kerr.Subs: E Kelly for P Casey, S McMahon for J McCoubrey, S Ferris for Conaill Kerr.Killough FC: J Crangle, R Burns, E Gargan, C Burns, S Og Burns, D Burns, C Kelly, G George, D Taggart, K Groves, J McLaughlin.Subs: D Looney for G George, K Tierney, C Doyle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_Wave.jpg","title":"It’s like a little  safe haven here%2C somewhere you can come and cry and not get judged  ","story":"TEARS still spring easily to the eyes of Dympna Kerr, the sister of Columba McVeigh, one of the lsquoDisappearedrsquo victims.Once she begins to talk about her  year-old brother, whose body has never been recovered after he was abducted and murdered by the IRA in , after nearly  years of dealing with his loss the pain remains.Last weekend, the Donaghmore woman left her home in St Helenrsquos in Merseyside to travel to a welcoming building in the coastal village of Killough.At the newly named Wave By The Sea centre in Castle Street, Dympna spent precious time speaking with longstanding friends who are also relatives of the Disappeared. The main dference is that they have been fortunate to locate the bodies of their loved one. Several searches have yet toher brotherrsquos remains to the family but they remain hopeful.ldquoItrsquos like a little safe haven here, somewhere you can come and cry and not get judged. The people you are crying to know why you are crying as they understand, explained Dympna about her lasting need to connect with people with shared experience.ldquoGoing to the Wave house in Belfast is like going home. Itrsquos like getting a hug as soon as you go across the door. And itrsquos the same here as Irsquove already been several times.The help and support of the iniduals who make up the Wave Trauma Centre quietly helps thousands of people like Dympna who have been bereaved, injured and or traumatised by the decades of conflict in Northern Ireland.The building has been provided by the local trustees of The Kinder Project, a charitable Dutch organisation that began its association with Northern Ireland in the s for the education and social welfare of disadvantaged children and young adults.The hostel now provides residential breaks for a maximum of  people, providing rooms for families and iniduals, who use the time to break away from their lives still traumatised and dealing with the physical and emotional aftermath.Counselling and complimentary therapy sessions are offered and other courses are provided by Wave to help those who come, many of whom have never sought help before.Itrsquos the sixth centre around the province that Wave has established, along with r satellite projects, with support funding from the Victims and Support Service, NI Executive, Special EU Programmes Body and charitable donations.One of the Troubles survivors who wished the service had been available locally for him and his family is Killough man Peter Heathwood.Peter knows the benefit of support from Wave. In September  he was left paralysed after a Loyalist gun attack in his Belfast home as he played with his youngest daughter in his living room mdash bullets missing the baby by inches.His attack was witnessed by his late we and two eldest children. His father Hubert died from a heart attack at the scene when he saw his apparently dead son.As a member of the Wave Injured Group, he has campaigned for years for a state pension for people left physically or psychologically injured from the conflict.He has yet to receive his pension, even though he applied for it last autumn.ldquoI had to travel to Belfast night and day and only discovered Wave when I went on to the Victimsrsquo Forum years after my shooting, said Peter.ldquoMy we died at  with a diagnosis of PTSD and suffered with flashbacks. If I had found Wave earlier, I reckon it could have saved her as she could have met other women and shared stories and experiences.ldquoWhen I was shot, I passed out but she saw me lying there with blood pumping out of me, children screaming and my father dying. She could never deal with the fact that she opened the door to the gunmen. But I told her thatshe hadnrsquot have shouted a warning to me, I would have been dead as I was able to get up and slam the door.ldquoEven in this village, there are people who moved from Belfast and a lot of them lost relatives in the Troubles, uncles, fathers, grandfathers and many of them never speak about it. I didnrsquot really talk about it to my own children as you didnrsquot want them to be filled with hate.Peter said that even on holiday when people asked what happened to him, he would say he was injured skiing in the French Alps, a more sanitised version of his attack mdash purportedly in mistake for another man mdash as he enjoyed an evening at home with his family.ldquoWave is a fantastic organisation. We are completely cross-community. Everyone has been hurt by all groups and thatrsquos the great strength of it, said Peter.ldquoI would really encourage anyone who has affected by the Troubles and has never sought help to come along to Wave. Itrsquos never too late to talk.Waversquos chief executive officer, Sandra Peake, says that the new centre will help  people in the immediate area and around  from the district, in addition to providing weekend residential breaks from families across Northern Ireland, Britain and the Irish Republic.ldquoThis wouldnrsquot have been possible without the generosity of the Kinder Project, explained Sandra, who said that the building has been fitted out to reflect a more comfortable family style accommodation.ldquoWe had initially done some work in Downpatrick about  years ago to see what we could have provided but have always been keen to provide a local base, which Kinder has now provided to us.ldquoThe welcome from the people and the shopkeepers of Killough has been brilliant. They seem to know why our visitors are staying here and give them a respectful place and go beyond and above to help them.ldquoSome of the families have enjoyed paddle boarding lessons on the water with children experiencing this type of activity for the first time. One grandmother got to sleep in a bed for the first time in years as she normally sleeps on the couch to let her grandchildren have the bed.Wave By The Sea is much more than a weekend or holiday break.ldquoWe aim to provide a holistic service here for people. It will start with an outreach case worker working with you to establish what your needs are and then that moves us into seeing what we can provide, whether its counselling, physiotherapy, group support and so on, Sandra continued.ldquoSeventy per cent of Waversquos work is service provision, the remainder is trauma education. We have a whole range of short trauma courses now and we hope to run courses her.ldquoThey deal with how trauma affects families, recognising the impact of trauma and how to build resilience, the intergenerational impact and issues such as trauma addiction as we would see people with issues. We also provide trauma education for healthcare professionals and student doctors, nurses, and social workers.She predicts an increase of demand for services as new referrals increased last year in part due to interest in the Injured Pension scheme and the proposed Legacy proposals.ldquoThe majority of people coming to us now have never gone anyway for help.

Team-mate Devlin then converted a free to pile on the pressure.Opposing number eights, Dylan Ward and Ian Maguire, were having a notable midfield battle which drew attention fromboth sets of supporters on numerous occasions but often it was the Kilcoo man coming out on top.lsquoKeeper Kane kicked an effort off the ground and over the bar on the rd minute before Eugene Branagan scored a point from play to give The Magpies the lead.As was the theme of the contest, Sherlock knocked over a brace of frees for the Munster champions and the score line swayed once more.Daryl Branagan curled two points from play over the bar before Ryan McEvoy was shown the yellow card for a foul on the opposition. Sherlock duly converted the resulting free and now the game was in its last ten minutes of regulation time.Ward received a yellow card for more off the ball antics with Maguire but Kilcoo kept on scoring through the left boot of Devlin, who split the posts after receiving a neat pass from Daryl Branagan.As the officials indicated four additional minutes, The Magpies held a narrow one point lead with the scores reading - to -.On the rd minute, The Barrrsquos were afforded the chance to draw level from a long ranged free which Sherlock made no mistake in doing.With seemingly one lastthrow of the dice, Kilcoo launched the ball forward to the experienced Devlin, who drew the foul as he attempted to pick up the pass.With what everyone thought was the final kick of the game, Devlin prepared to knock over his free and send his side through to a second successive All-Ireland final.However, there would be one last twist before the whistle.To everyone in attendance and those watching at homersquos disbelief, Kilcoo joint-captain Aidan Branagan, who was only on the pitch for a matter of minutes, needlessly collided with Barrrsquos replacement Adam Lyne off-the-ball.After brief deliberation, referee Cawley gave Branagan his marching orders in the form of a red card and reversed his decision from a free to a throw ball.The full-time whistle sounded seconds later and the game headed to extra-time.Despite the high drama, Kilcoo would not be denied and dominated the following duration of the contest.Custodian Kane was first to kick over, before Anthony Morgan doubled the deficit. Sherlock pulled one back for The Barrrsquos from a free but Micheal Rooney quickly cancelled this out at the other end.Devlin extended the lead to three and yet again Sherlock proved reliable for The Barrrsquos through a converted free.However, Kilcoo clearly had prepared for these extraminutes and scoring opportunities looked to be seldom for their opposition, although Colm Barrett did split the posts after Devlin curled over another point.lsquoKeeper Kane saw his rsquo sail over the bar to restore a two point lead and from here St Finbarrrsquos ran out of gas.Jamie Burns saw red for the Cork side after punching out at Doherty, and Kilcoo were now afforded the extra space to stamp their authority in the closing minutes.Despite Ward picking up a late black card, a brace of Doherty points rounded off the scoring as the match finally reached its climax at - to -.After the contest, Kilcoo lsquokeeper Niall Kane spoke about his sidersquos performance and reaching yet another All-Ireland final.ldquoWe knew it was going to be tough when you get to the last four in Ireland, he said.ldquoYes everybody was saying Kilcoo were going to be red hot favourites, but deep down we knew St Finbarrrsquos are no walkover and they proved that.ldquoItrsquos only a semi-final, therersquos nothing won yet so we are back at it in the morning, get our recovery and training Monday night.St Finbarrrsquos: J Kerins S Ryan, J Burns, C Scully C Lyons, B Hennessy, A OrsquoConnor I Maguire, Eoin Comyms D OrsquoBrien, S Sherlock , B Hayes C Myers-Murray , E McGreevy , C McCrickard.Subs: E Dennehy for C Myers-Murray, C Barrettfor D OrsquoBrien, M Shields for E McGreevy, A Lyne for C McCrickard.Kilcoo: N KaneN Branagan, R McEvoy, Aaron BranaganM Rooney, D Branagan , E BranaganD Ward, Aaron Morgan C Doherty , J Johnston, S JohnstonC Laverty, R Johnston , P Devlin .Subs: Anthony Morganfor Laverty, Aidan Branagan for Aaron Morgan, C Laverty for Aidan Branagan, T Fettes for R Johnston, J Clarke for M Rooney.Referee: Brendan Cawley ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_Death.jpg","title":"Marc (18) remembered as ‘an unassuming and polite young man’  ","story":"THE funeral of a teenager who died in a road accident near Castlewellan at the weekend takes place later today.Marc Quinn died after being struck by a car on the Newcastle Road in the early hours of Sunday morning.It is believed that Marc, who celebrated his th birthday last Wednesday, was walking home when the accident occurred shortly before .am.He was treated at the scene before being taken to hospital, but sadly died a short time later.Police are appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident to contact them.The funeral cortege will leave Marcrsquos home in Annsborough today at .pm for Requiem Mass in St Malachyrsquos Church in Castlewellan at pm, to be followed by interment at St Maryrsquos Cemetery, Aughlisnafin.Marc was a talented Gaelic footballer who was a senior player for Aughlisnafin GAC.His mother, Jenny, is the club secretary, and his father, Garry, is a former player.

The tactic looked like paying off, but at the post So Ladylike, with Caoimhe OrsquoBrien in the saddle, got up to provide the rider with her second success, her first coming on this Alana McGuinness-owned runner back in October. Ballinasilla finished a close third.The winner is trained by Ian Donoghue, a brother of top Northern Ireland jockey Keith, who is no longer with Gordon Elliott.Only six of the  entries took part in the Dennison JCB Maiden Race for five year-old geldings, but the race provided spectators with a close finish.The Aaron Sinnott-ridden Song For My Father, owned and trained in Co Cavan by Shane Donohoe, just passed the judge ahead of Time For A Pint, ridden by Tom Hamilton for Co Carlow trainer Shark Hanlon, with Hapy La Vie back in third ahead of Old Style Humor.It was not long before a stewardsrsquo enquiry was called with the result that the winner was disqualied for failing to draw the correct weight. Time For A Pint was placed first ahead of Hapy La Vie and Old Style Humor .Four set out in the Kingsfield Stud five year-old Mares Maiden Race, but only three remained after the fourth fence, after Paddy Cleary lost his irons and was unseated.This left Born Famous to win from Famous Function and local hope Social Distancing. For trainer Claire OrsquoConnell it was a welcome winner. Paul Bannon was the successful rider.The Cosy Roof Open Race saw the grey Creadan Grae make most of the running but in the end had to be content with second to the ex-English trained Brain Power mdash a rare open horse for Warren Ewing, who is best known for producing top four year-olds.The successful rider was Maghera-based Oran McGill who was replacing his injured younger brother Dara. Warren is part of the well known fish merchant family. Third home was Bajan Excell, ridden by Ben OrsquoBrien.The connections of the runner-up in this race, Broughshane owner Philip McBurney, rider Noel McParlan and trainer Gerry Quinn, also based at Broughshane, had better fortune in the Armstrong Auctions  year-old and Upwards Mares Maiden when Tamlaght Eyes, pulled up in her previous three races, proved to be the smooth winner from the Lee Shawagen-ridden Any Time with Castle Arms Casa a very close third.The final race on the card was the G Curran  Co Ltd Maiden Race for  year-old and Upwards Geldings. Ask Charlie was the easy winner from Kilmoganny, ridden by Tiernan Power-Roche, and Robbie Armstrongrsquos ex-English trained Carolersquos Templer, ridden by Deckie Lavery.Good to see the long established Denis Reddan colours in the winning enclosure. Ridden by Ben Harvey, the winner is trained by his father, William.Perhaps the result may have been dferent had Paul Bannon not become unseated at the final fence of his mount Butcher Barry.Best turned out in all races as usual was courtesy of Glencairn Stables.Acting stewards: Rev Colin Hall-Thompson, Max and Margaret Evine and David Aiken.Ballee jockey Toni Quail, out of action with a broken ankle as a result of a schooling accident, was helping with declarations at the meeting.A tribute was paid to the late Maurice King who for many years was a vet at the meeting.The next meeting at Tyrella is on Saturday, March .

Tourism currently represents a considerable percentage of Northern Ireland’s GDP, but unsightly rural roads and hedgerows are unlikely to inspire atrip and can damage the perception of our region.”David Brown, Deputy President of Ulster Farmers’ Union said illegal dumping is an increasing issue in rural areas: “Fly-tipping is a scourge on the countryside and one that too many of our farmers have experienced first-hand. Dumping unwanted waste in rural areas is dangerous to human health and harmful to livestock and wildle. In the past, there have been issues where fly-tipping waste polluted watercourses and contaminated land.“When unwanted content is dumped on a farmer’s land, it becomes the responsibility of the landowner to dispose of, while local councils are left to take ownership of waste on public land and highways. This is both costly and time consuming for farmers and ratepayers.“Since the pandemic began, the amount of litter being dumped on farmers’ land has increased, with many rediscovering the outdoors for recreation. I urge all countryside visitors to be more considerate of those living locally, and of animals and to commit to taking their waste home with them.”——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.It is also true that among the much larger group of voters who are pro Union, but do not vote for ‘unionist’ parties , there was very signicant opposition to Brexit.Therefore, runs the criticism, that large bloc of people who are both overtly unionist in their voting intentions, and who voted to quit the EU, should ‘own’ the current crisis . I have previously written about how unionists in NI did not display any of the nervous reaction to the prospects of Brexit that Gibraltarians did at the time of the plebiscite. The latter had such a sense of their own vulnerability, surrounded by a Spain that feels lasting resentment over the peninsula’s British status, they voted % to stay in the EU.Many of the loudest critics of unionism, and its support for Brexit, hector it for not having seen the merits of the EU and of the single market and for instead endorsing the supposed insularity of little Englanders and so on. My own criticism of unionism in the run-up to the  referendum is that there was a failure to think realistically.The view that Brexit was driven by English nationalism is self-evidently wrong and it confuses two separate issues: the dominance of England within the UK, and the strain of English nationalism.England is dominant for simple numerical reasons: it makes up % of the nation and so will always dominate almost every aspect of cultural, economic and political le in the UK. But there is no proof that English nationalism drove Brexit. England was almost evenly ided, with % of voters opting to leave the EU, and % preferring to stay.The other three home countries of the UK were sharply ided too.Wales had almost a high a percentage of Brexiteers as England, at just under % of those who voted in the watershed  EU poll. In Northern Ireland, approaching half of voters wanted out of Europe.And even in Scotland, almost % of those who cast a ballot in the referendum were pro an EU exit.The UK would have been in deep troubleBrexit really had been driven by English nationalism, and— say — % of England had backed it and only % of Scotland. Instead the UK was unied in one respect: every part of it was split.In  I thought the arguments in favour of Brexit were very strong, but so too were the arguments against. In the end my own opposition to an EU departure was mainly because I felt that it would put the UK in peril .Butthere is a unit in Europe that could operate successfully outside the EU it is the British Isles — and I use the term consciously as a geographical one.If majorities in the four parts of the UK and the Republic of Ireland were all happy to live outside the EU then it would be easier to deliver the UK and Ireland as an internal free-trade area with strong links to Europe and America . It is not impossible that such a day will come, depending on how Brexit pans out in the coming years.The big unionist miscalculation in  was the ability to deliver a full Northern Ireland departure from the EU. That was only possible with massive political support for unionism in London. I know people in Westminster who point out that sympathy for unionism now is far greater than it was at the time of the  Anglo Irish Agreement. Even so, it is nowhere near where it needs to be for seismic change like Brexit.I perhaps had a heightened sense of this in  because I had been monitoring developments relating to the legacy of the Troubles.It has been extraordinary to behold themuted reaction to the way in which republicans are being allowed to win the narrative of what happened after .The whole apparatus of the UK state has been turned against itself – a country that saw off three decades of terror and prevented civil war. I remain unwavering in my view that this is a moral collapse both within NI and within the corridors of power in London.While the Republic continues to delight republicans by repeatedly trying to humiliate the UK over legacy in both Europe and the US over alleged past wrongdoing by the security forces, there is still no pressure applied to Dublin, and not so much as a UK demand for an inquiry into the long and stubborn Irish extradition failures of known and fanatical murderers, as a result of which so many people were killed in border areas.Given that enduring weakness towards the Republic of Ireland, what chance was there of MPs standing up to Ireland over Brexit None of this is to say that protocol is even remotely justied. As an opponent of Brexit, I feel all the more resentful over its implementation. I agree with Owen that some unionists seem not to grasp the disastrous implications of the protocol.The belated signs of flexibility from the EU over checks show how much of the Brexit border challenges could have been resolved by EU exceptions being made for bilateral UK-Ireland arrangements.I am just trying to understand some of the reasons why we are in this mess. And we can only hope that the resolve shown by London in overhauling the protocol, which mysteriously began to evaporate in November, s.European UnionNorthern IrelandBrexitProtocolEurope  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularBoris’ drinks party antics have stirred more fury than his betrayal of the UnionBen Lowry: Unionism has been stymied by lack of support in LondonTUV: We led on Northern Ireland Protocol and the DUP followed after usOwen Polley: Finally DUP does something to show gravity of Protocol predicamentU-turn after Sinn Fein excludes DUP from Stormont leadership meetingMost PopularBest high street wedding dresses UK :  bridal dress styles for every type of bride - from Coast to AsosBest men’s hiking boots  UK: what to look for in a men’s walking boot, best from On, Berghaus, SalomonBest baby car seats UK : best toddler car seats from birth to , including Maxi Cosi, Halfords, CybexBest indoor rowing machines UK : at home rowers including the best-selling Concept  and Aldi’s budget option                        This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The comic is optimistic as the pandemic reaches its endgame and feels the speed at which scientists developed a vaccine for the virus was nothing short of miraculousBasically, he has always had a bit of a mouth on him, and has used it to maximum effect - compering the Empire Laughs Back Comedy Club in Belfast for years, a comedy hotspot where Patrick Kielty first honed his craft and also turning up as a regular on BBC NI’s The Blame Game alongside Tim McGarry and Colin Murphy, but his solo material almost always sells out in venues across Ulster, mostly because he is so adept at being an equal opportunities offender, as in, he mercilessly satirises both sides of our historic ide with equal amounts of savage glee.Even while he is able to strut on stage to do standup with nerves of steel, what he calls the “martial art of the performing arts, because it’s just you up there with a microphone, no set, nowhere to hide and you have to be like lightning in keeping hecklers in place”, he maintains that off-stage he is actually a rather reticent character, and while others may have been lamenting the pains of social distancing, he, in fact, “rather enjoyed it.”Father-of-two Jake said: “I have no idea why, and it would take the best kind of therapist or psychologist there is to explain this weird paradox in my personality, but If I walk into a room and there’s five people and I don’t know anybody, I will go into a corner, almost asI am completely socially dysal or some kind of monosyllabic hermit out of their enclave. Then, on the other hand, for some reason I have never felt uncomfortable walking out on stage, be it in front of  or , people. I feel at ease and at home up there and it’s like a dferent part of me taking over, although it’s not asI’m assuming a dferent character, it is very much authentically still me. I just can’t explain that contradiction in me.”He’s been doing standup for over  years now, in all kinds of places,some more down at heel and some more swish, but although the years have made him a pro at embarrassing hecklers into shamed silence, he maintains that comics never lose their fear of completing falling apart on stage, and that in fact it is an intrinsic part of perfecting the ‘martial’ art of successful standup.Jake larking about at home where he has been incarcerated, like many of us, working from home on comedy sketches for YouTube and what he calls anti-social media“Sometimes you can walk into a gig, and for whatever reason, the chemistry in the room or whatever, it’s just not going to work, no matter what you do. I have read, even, about gigs that fell apart for Billy Connolly.A while back a mate of mine named Michael Smiley was compering a gig at a theatre in London and he had seen me doing a lot of political satire and stuff and asked me to go over there and do a show. So I went over and I can’t even remember what joke I began with but I couldn’t even see the audience and they couldn’t see me. It turns out it was a really lefty, sort of right-on crowd, and I can’t remember what I began with, but I completely died on stage.“At one point somebody threw a plastic glass. It was a total disaster and I walked off to the defeated sound of my own feet on the floorboards in silence. That was one of the those gigs where I still wake up at am in the morning in a cold sweat thinking about it.“But it was my fault! You have to gauge an audience and feel the vibe in the room and connect with the people in front of you.”His new show is focused on our response to the Covid pandemic, which has managed to change the world and all of our lives, forever: “At the start of it all I felt like it was actually the apocalypse,” he confesses. “I took to the house, but I was actually thinking of digging a moat around it too. Being a reader, I had read a lot over the years about how bad pandemics can be. I knew all about the Spanish flu, I knew all about the Ebola outbreaks, I knew about the dangers of a flu pandemic, so none of that reading made me feel remotely calm or rational about what was happening.Jake is cute as a button visiting Santa aged approx three alongside his three younger brothers Connor, Barry and Damien. Today he might be pushing  but feels about  at heart. Perhaps a le in comedy prevents ones soul from growing old “But I think because of what we have been through here over the past  years there is a stoicism to the NI psyche, and an attitude where we just go, ‘Right, whatever, let’s get on with it’. Not much shocks us and so we’ve persevered.”‘WHY I ACTUALLY CALL IT ‘ANTI-SOCIAL MEDIA’Jake is positive that we are finally reaching the endgame of the pandemic. “I can see an end in sight to the Covid nightmare and it’s all down to the hard work and genius of scientists who developed this vaccine. That they came up with a vaccine so quickly was to me miraculous. But I think a lot of the advances we have made medically are amazing. I can’t wait for the moment when we look back and go ‘Yeah, that was horrendous, but now we know how to respond to something like this.’ “People say ‘Oh, maybe a better world will emerge from this, but I think that’s being a bit idealistic, I mean I think we will always revert to type. “People say we really came together via social media and so on, but I actually call it anti-social media. Online we just peddle disinformation and people’s susceptibility to being conned is frightening to me, I mean people can be swayed into sharing very strange views. The level of mind control that people live under is frightening and there’s this confirmation bias where they find  evidence for their views and just keep going on in a loop.”‘I WAS BORN IN BELFAST IN , SO MY BIGGEST CHALLENGE HAS BEEN STAYING ALIVE’“I was always quick, even at school, I had the quick answer back for the teacher,” reflects Jake O’Kane on his childhood.His family moved around a fair bit during his youth because of the Troubles and north Belfast being a rather precarious area at the time.“I started off going to two primary schools in north Belfast, local dficulties there as I would describe it, meant that I had to move about an awful lot. One school was up in Moneymeena and I went from there to a boarding school in the Republic.“I was incarceratedthere in St Michael’s for five years until I escaped. It had been full of priests, but over time they ran out of them. I was always running south, meaning to head for Dundalk, but always ended up towards Newry. I was good at sports and English and that was it. But because I had so much movement in my early education stage, you know, I missed out on a lot of maths, physics and chemistry and couldn’t get my head around it. I was a painfully shy child.”But as he got older he found himself becoming increasingly sharp-tongued, swt to fire back wittily at those around him and engaging in his secondary school class debates with vigour.“When we did politics they used to set me up to get the argument started with the teacher, to get a bit of craic going. I seem to have a quick brain that way for getting things started or turning things around or seeing it from a dferent angle.”I ask him what the biggest challenge he has faced in his le so far is Without missing a beat he responds: “Well, staying alive. Not dying! And it’s getting harder the older I get. I was born in , the worst time in this country’s history to be born, really. It might have been easier in Darfur or somewhere, I reckon.“So most of my le was about trying to stay alive and that is the ongoing challenge. Isn’t that the case for us all ”It might surprise people to know that as a comedian and therefore a comedy writer, Jake is a voracious reader and is always bemused when doing Zoom calls and people are impressed by the manold titles on his bookshelf behind him: “You can’t write unless you read - the two go hand in hand. If you ask me what my favourite book is it’s like asking who your favourite child is. It depends where you are in le. Dferent books affect you at dferent times. “I’ve a lot of books and I do read a fair bit. I’m not so big into fiction, more history, biographies and politics, and all that stuff. But novels have just never appealed to me.”QA: ‘I ACTUALLY ENJOY HOOVERING THE CORNERS OF CEILINGS AND UNDER CARPETS’Tell us your earliest childhood memories I find it hard to remember what happened last week, never mind when I was a child. I remember being at my granny’s. One morning I got up, we lived in the middle of the Sperrins and my aunt was making bread down stairs.You could smell that coming up the stairs and there was laughter and chat and that was a nice memory.Who makes you laugh the most Billy Connolly.Who is your best friend My we. I’m actually not a very social being, I’m quite an introvert. Covid - everyone has been crying about social distancing, but I find it quite nice.Ideal way to spend a day off I’d spend it with my family and we’d go for a walk somewhere although I can’t get my kids out. They are  and  and they have no interest. My son is always wired into a computer game. With my daughtershe gives me the wrong look and doesn’t want to do something she actually frightens me.I’m coeliac and so I’d like to also maybe order a Pizza Express who are very good at catering for that sort of thing. I eat from there so much I should really be buying shares from the place.Describe yourself in three words Grumpy, short-tempered, kind.Proudest achievement My children. But they are completely mortied by me. What kind of music do you like to listen to in your downtime I have no taste in music which my we has lamented about since we first met. But I was a child of the s so I loved The Beatles.If you could have an ideal dinner party at which you could invite anyone from history, who would you bring Alexander the Great, he was some pup, Oscar Wilde and Gandhi, just so we could have a vegetarian option. I can’t cook, being from North BelfastI ever went near the kitchen my mummy would have beat the head off me and now my we does all the cooking.But I do the cleaning which works out well because I have OCD and it really bothers me when she doesn’t hoover right up into the corner of the ceiling or under carpets, which I find very distressing. We have a clear demarcation of duties which works very well. I love my hoover, you have no idea. If you said to me, you have to get rid of either your car or your hoover then that’s it, the car is gone.See Jake O’Kane’s Maskerade show on Feb  at the McNeill Theatre, Larne Feb  at the Burnavon, Cookstown Feb -, Grand Opera House, Belfast Feb , Canal Court Hotel, Newry March , Strule Arts Centre, Omagh March , Ardhowen Theatre, Enniskillen and TBC - at The Braid, Ballymena."},{"url":"http://www.penarthtimes.co.uk/news/resources/images/13445773.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

one of the restaurants most popular and profitable dates.Alan, the manager of Casa De Margarita, said: \"You could have people over at your home, but you couldnt go to a restaurant.\"It was frustrating and we had a lot of cancelled bookings.\"The issue was compounded because the restaurant had stopped taking bookings, thinking that they were going to have the maximum amount of people in.However, Alan said that being on the Esplanade has helped the restaurant, especially as they have outside seating.He said: \"We have been lucky with the location.\"If its dry, then people go outside evenit is cold.\"However, he did go on to say that he was disappointed with the Vale Council for not offering more support, especially in the case of not allowing heaters for the outside seats.This is because heaters are not allowed on the pavements.Alan said it is too early to saybusiness is improving following the lting of restrictions.Pickfords Galley  Bar with RoomsPickfords Galley  Bar with Rooms has been open since January ,  - just before the beginning of the pandemic.Therefore, despite being officially open for two years, they have only been open to the public for about two months including before lockdown.Despite being closed for some time, the restaurant has still been able to operate a takeaway service and has taken the opportunity to develop slowly.Huw Pickford, one of the owners, said: \"Ithelped us grow and develop slowly.\"We opened sections slowly but surely.\"He credits the location on the Esplanade as being vital to keeping the new business afloat.\"The main thing that really helped us was the weather and the location,\" said Mr Pickford\"If we were one or two streets back then we wouldnt have survived.\"The restaurant is already highly regarded, with it being one of the highest rated restaurants in Penarth on Tripadvisor.At the same time as thriving as a new business during a dficult time for hospitality, Pickfords has carried out charity work for organisations such as the NHS.Mr Pickford is optimistic for the future and believes that the business will only grow further as restrictions are eased. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community -

The visit was hosted by the Parliament of Ghana, UK High Commission, and other key partners.We were given a warm welcome and held candid discussions on issues including Covid, conflict and climate matters. We met local women traders and the Chamber of Commerce, as well as MPs from countries across Africa and other key figures. There were lots of discussions about how they view the UK and our mutual partnerships going forward, how we tackle global challenges, and how we fight for human rights and gender justice together.After arriving back in the early hours, I was then straight back into Westminster for anFriday sitting in Parliament – a very important one – as I joined other MPs to support my colleague Rosie Cooper MP’s British Sign Language Bill, which aims to make BSL an official language of the UK.I had a chance to thank local BSL interpreters and deaf community activists, saying: “I add my wholehearted support to this Bill. Like many hon. Members, I have campaigners in my own constituency, such as Stuart Parkinson, an activist for the deaf community with Cardf Deaf Centre, but I also pay tribute to the work of the Association of British Sign Language Teachers and Assessors. Interpreters such as Julie Doyle and Tony Evans can be seen on Welsh Government broadcasts, live with the First Minister and Health Minister, interpreting in BSL in real time in the room, and I pay tribute to them for the work they have done for the deaf community and in supporting this Bill.”.removeWhile we are thankfully now back at Level  Covid restrictions in Wales, it’s important we continue to keep up the effort on vaccinations and boosters – soyou haven’t had yours, please arrange to do so as soon as possible. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityPeople who suffer in childhood are also least likely to trust NHS information, wear masks during the pandemic or follow the rules, Welsh research has found.Adverse childhood experiencesinclude neglect, mistreatmentand growing up in a household affected by domestic violence, substance or alcohol abuse and other criminal justice problems.Parents separating or orcing, abandonment, or having a parent with a mental health condition are other examples of ACEs.The new study, published in the the open access journal BMJ Open, involved surveying , people aged  and over in Wales during lockdown restrictions .Experts looked at nine dferent ACEs as well as low trust in NHS Covid- information, whether people backed the removal of social distancing and mandatory face coverings, breaking Covid rules and vaccine hesitancy .While  per cent of those in the study had not experienced any childhood trauma, around one in five had suffered one type, around one in sixreported two to three, and one in reported four or more.The results showed that the more trauma people had experienced in childhood, the more likely they were to mistrust NHS Covid- information, to feel unfairly restricted by the Government and to support the end of mandatory face masks.The nine ACEs included in the study were: physical, verbal, and sexual abuse, parental separation, exposure to domestic violence and living with a household member with mental illness, alcohol and or drug misuse, or a family member in prison.People were twice as likely to break Covid rulesthey had four or more ACEs compared with none, while vaccine hesitancy was threefold higher with more than four ACEs compared with none..removeMore than four ACEs were also associated with a desire to scrap social distancing.Vaccine hesitancy was estimated at  per cent for those aged  to  with more than four ACEs, though older age groups were much more likely to have a vaccine. Overall, eight per cent of the entire study group would not agree to a vaccine.Around a quarter of all those in the study also admitted to at least occasionally breaking the rules.The authors concluded: “While pandemic responses should consider how best to reach those suffering from ACEs, longer term, better compliance with public health advice is another reason to invest in safe and secure childhoods for all children.”Previous research has suggested that mistreatment as a child may undermine trust in the future, including of health and other public services.The latest study suggested thatpeople had mistrust in one area, this was replicated in other areas.For example, four out of  people reporting low levels of trust in NHS Covid- information also reported vaccine hesitancy, compared with just six per cent of those who did trust this source of information.The study was funded by Public Health Wales and carried out by public health experts.This article originally appeared on our sister site The National. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.
