When he first moved to the square in 1985, the property would cost £65,000 on average. A huge 1,042 per cent increase since then means despite he is now sitting on £743,000.Yet the average small business owner only takes home around £29,000 a year, meaning he would be some way short of the £148,609 minimum income required to secure a mortgage were he to buy the same house today.  Ken Barlow (left) first appeared on the soap in 1960. Right: his home on Coronation StreetCharlie Fairfield has been a prominent figure in Casualty since 1986, and the average semi-detached property in Bristol has increased from £43,845 to £474,225 - a staggering increase of 982 per cent. Yet Charlie\u0027s modern-day NHS wage of £26,252 means he would be priced out of the market by more than £68,000, meaning his annual income would have to be £94,845 in order to be accepted for a mortgage. Emmerdale\u0027s Eric Pollard would also struggle to get his foot on the housing ladder today, as a detached house in Arncliff has increased by more than 2,000 per cent in value since he arrived on the show in 1986.          Each soap stars average salary for their job, required income for a mortgage now and the affordability gap between what they earn and need for a mortgage Based on the average income of B\u0026ampB owners, Eric would be nearly £63,000 short of the £91,937 income required to secure a mortgage.  The longest-serving soap star included on the fitures, Christine Barford of the Archers, would have been on around £54,000 as a stable owner before she retired.Having bought in 1953 for little over £2,000, the price of a detached home in Cutnall Green would have increased by 21,355 per cent today.Yet were she to buy today, she would be just over £44,000 of the £98,992 needed to secure a mortgage.          Eric Pollard, as played by Chris Chittell, would struggle to afford his property if he were buying it today  The Grange Bed and Breakfast in Emmerdale The same goes for Tony Hutchinson, Ken Barlow, Jac Naylor and Hywel Llywelyn, who would all be priced out of their respective local markets if they tried to buy today.  Only Jimmi Clay could afford his property today with his GP salary of nearly £70,000 when securing a mortgage in Birmingham. Alastair McKee, Managing Director of One77 Mortgages, commented: \u0027Unfortunately for our best-loved soap stars, the cost of getting on the ladder today would see many of them resigned to the rental sector.           Graphic shows the average price when the characters moved into their home compared to what it is in the current housing climate          Only Jimmi Clay could afford to buy the property he now lives in, according to new figures\u0027Luckily for them, they took that first step when prices weren\u0027t as high and as a result have benefited from some very healthy price growth across the board. \u0027Of course, this research is just a bit of fun and in many cases mortgage affordability would be bolstered by a partner or spouses\u0027 income, but it does raise a more serious issue. \u0027Regardless of property type, profession and location, there is a huge disparity between the price of UK property and the wages on offer and it highlights the struggle facing many aspirational buyers today when trying to secure a mortgage.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Samantha Markle calls Meghan bulls story imaginary pals praised princess","story":"    Brave: Meghan Markle (above last Friday) was praised in a glowing People profile that featured interviews with five anonymous friends who were tired of seeing the princess be bullied          Counterpoint: \u0027#PeopleMagazine this article is total bulls*** there are plenty of text messages and receipts to prove otherwise.

A. Milne\u0027s poem Now We Are Six ends: \u0027But now I am six, I\u0027m as clever as clever. So I think I\u0027ll be six now for ever and ever.\u0027 That\u0027s how I felt that day. Over subsequent decades my \u0027spirit age\u0027 was mostly far older than my real vintage.The first LP I bought, aged 12, from the Cirencester branch of FW Woolworth, was Bach\u0027s Brandenburg Concertos. As a teenager I ached to wear baggy corduroys and smoke a pipe. I have owned only one pair of jeans and they were not a success.          Quentin Letts says his spirit age is around one year older than his actual age At university in Ireland I hated the pressure to be \u0027with it\u0027 and dated a beautiful Belfast artist who was ten years my senior. As a 30-year-old reporter, I envied older journalists who had seen the world and mastered their craft.When I married Lois in 1996, I knew she was a cracker yet felt itchy when grannies cooed over us as \u0027love\u0027s young dream\u0027 and told us: \u0027It\u0027s all in front of you.\u0027 I didn\u0027t want to be young. I wanted to be established, successful, my own man, with a lawnmower and a drinks cabinet and shoe-trees.Now I\u0027ve got them and it feels right.In The Idiot, Dostoyevsky writes that 56 is the age at which real life can begin: a \u0027fine complexion, sound though discoloured teeth, a stocky, solid figure, a preoccupied air in the morning, a gay face in the evening\u0027.There is also, though this he omitted, a disposition to pity anyone younger, and a sense of relief to have left behind youth\u0027s gulping gawkishness. Thank heavens for middle age.EVEN AT 56 I STILL GET SCHOOLGIRL CRUSHESSusannah ConstantineReal age: 56. Spirit age: 16.          Susannah Constantine \u0027still get schoolgirl crushes\u0027So, Christie Brinkley jokes that she\u0027s turning 50 for the 15th time, declaring her spirit age is far younger than her 65 years. Why has she chosen an age that is ten years older than she looks?When it comes to how I feel, I\u0027d put it at somewhere around 16. I still get schoolgirl crushes and it would be wonderful to have no responsibilities. Often, I see myself in my children and it makes me laugh when I tell them to behave or grow up, when inside I\u0027m wanting to do exactly the same as them, despite the statins, hot flushes and insomnia.I yearn to eat rubbish as often as I like without pumping up the cholesterol levels. I\u0027d love to be able to sleep until noon. It would be heaven to have a night on the tiles and not look like stale bread the next morning.Sadly, at the ripe old age of 56, it would be unwise to live my spiritual age because it could take me to an early grave.    Henry Deedes\u0027s spirit age is the age he got married My spirit age — 28 — is the age I got married. That\u0027s not a dig at my ex-wife, we had many wonderful times. Still do. But I feel younger now than I did then.Midlife complacency set in prematurely after marrying. The burden of responsibility meant I neglected myself.Week nights covering the canape-and-Krug party circuit had left my skin sallow, my belly blubberous. Home life was often a whir of bills and builders as I tottered under the weight of a mortgage bigger than the Brexit orce fee.These days, I eat better, drink less and am mildly more solvent. Frequent exercise means I can wear T-shirts again without feeling like a lager-tummied extra from Benidorm. That feeling of youthful spontaneity is wonderful. I have a sense of adventure again.Every now and again I get a quick reality check. Hangovers get harder. Hair gets greyer. And yesterday I ordered a hip support from Amazon to wear in the gym — but let\u0027s not dwell on that.CHILDREN CAN TELL I\u0027M NOT A GROWN-UPRowan PellingReal age: 51. Spirit age: 15.I have never lied about my age and told everyone when I turned 50 last year. But that might be because I am certain, deep down, that the largest part of me remains resolutely 15.          Rowan Pelling never lied about her age I have spent my life avoiding certain adult responsibilities (tax returns, form-filling, housework, the duller side of childrearing) and veering off into my own vivid, imaginary world.I still make the kind of intense friendships I made at school and like sloping away from chores like a naughty schoolgirl having a ciggie behind the bike sheds.My life would have fallen apart, I suspect, if I hadn\u0027t married a proper grown-up who provides the necessary domestic balance. I happily wear clothes many peers would judge to be age-inappropriate, such as skinny jeans, short skirts and bikinis, and only yesterday I received a Sex Pistols T-shirt in the post.Children (little girls in particular) often recognise I\u0027m not a real grown-up and are happy to talk to me about unicorns, imaginary friends and dragons. If there\u0027s a trampoline or a game of \u0027It\u0027, I\u0027m first in the queue.My chief guilty pleasure is nestling in an armchair with a clutch of favourite children\u0027s books.I don\u0027t think I chase youth: I\u0027ve never had Botox or filler and I\u0027m happy with my wrinkles. But I suspect feeling young is what makes a person buzz, not looking it. If I were ever to have a tattoo, then it would say simply: \u0027There are no rules.\u0027IN MY DREAMS I\u0027M 17 AND A RUGBY HEROStanley JohnsonReal age: 78. Spirit age: 17.          Stanley Johnson dreams of being a rugby hero Even now, I dream about my schooldays when I played prop in rugby for Sherborne, aged 17.The other side (Marlborough? Clifton?) kicks off. I catch the ball full-toss and charge straight for the line, looking neither right nor left, to score under the posts.Of course, I\u0027m not arguing that the grit and determination you acquire on the rugger field as a schoolboy is the end of the story. Yes, I wanted to gain a rugger blue at Oxford after I left school, but I also wanted to get a First and be President of the Union.As it happened, I flunked all three goals, but there was one great consolation prize which I have cherished all my life: I won the Newdigate Prize for poetry with a 98-line poem called May Morning. I had to recite it at the university\u0027s summer prize-giving ceremony, Encaenia.Charlie Chaplin was one of those honoured that year. He signed my programme and, 56 years later, I still have it.In a nutshell, my spirit age still hovers around 17. I have the sense that even though I hung up my boots years ago, it\u0027s worth charging full-tilt towards the goal.BEING A YOUNG DAD WAS THE BEST TIMERay ConnollyReal age: 78. Spirit age: 29.Emotionally frozen at the age of 29, that\u0027s what I was. That\u0027s how I still think of myself.It was the age when I became confident that I knew how to do what I was good at.We bought a big, run-down house on my 29th birthday in 1970 and it felt like a new beginning, setting off on a new adventure with a future rich in hope and possibilities.          Ray Connolly is \u0027frozen at the age of 29\u0027That was also the time when I was a young father. I liked the role of being a dad — I still do. Not the sort of dad who helped much around the house, more the type who saw children as people to amuse and who enjoyed being amused by them.I expect lots of men identify with being in their late teens — which suggests to me they must have had more success with girls at that age than I did. Marrying Plum when I was 25 was the best thing I ever did. We\u0027ve grown old together, but still reckon the years when the children were small were the best.It was hard, of course. Not much money, two children and soon another on the way, redecorating all four floors of our home in the evenings — Wedgwood blue and white panels nearly everywhere.Not everything has turned out as I hoped. There have been some mistakes — like selling that perfect house — and setbacks. But I\u0027m still happily working seven days a week, still getting new ideas and beginning new projects. Still feeling all of 29.WE GRANNIES ARE FULL OF ENERGYLynne FranksReal age: 70. Spirit age: 30.I have been in my early 30s for almost 40 years. Although clearly my body is older, my enthusiasm for new projects and my energy are the same, and my creativity is as full-on.          Lynne Franks has \u0027been in my early 30s for almost 40 years\u0027At 70, I am opening three new businesses, have moved to a new home in Somerset where I\u0027ve never lived before, and am still optimistic about love and romance.I know good health is vital to keeping up my energy and I eat well, take the best natural supplements and stay as physically active as I have time for, with regular boxing sessions, daily dog walks, tennis lessons and dancing.But I think it\u0027s my love of life and excitement for what each day will bring that keep me feeling less than half my biological age.I meet so many women in my work as a coach and mentor who are my age and planning their next career. It\u0027s as if being grandmothers and well past the menopause has given us a new lease of life.Laughter, love, creative ideas, hugs and a belief that we can work together to create a new and better kind of world is what keeps me and my friends spiritually 30.IS IT TIME I FOUND A PROPER JOB?Libby PurvesReal age: 69. Spirit age: 27.If you\u0027re a freelance, your spirit age stays shamefully young. Actors and musicians know the feeling, too, and I suspect a lot of us still unconsciously feel about 27.It\u0027s understandable: you have never been a serious employee, corporate executive or brisk office manager never been eligible for a company pension, sick pay, maternity leave or an unfair-dismissal tribunal. So you roam the landscape as bright-eyed and wary as a weasel.          Libby Purves says freelancing keeps you \u0027shamefully young\u0027You always wonder about the next contract or the next gig, and never mind being busy you remember how the young Roy Hudd, complaining of overwork, was told by a grand, old, end-of-the-pier agent: \u0027Roy, a full date-book is a happy pro!\u0027You rather relish the sense of adventure involved in professional insecurity, wondering who might try to hire you next and if you would match up to their style, or be able to tolerate the management\u0027s notorious attitude problem.Like a twentysomething between boyfriends, you have a giddy sense that something intriguing and wonderful might be just around the corner. And when it isn\u0027t, you learn to laugh it off and scrounge around for anything that\u0027s going.Yet you\u0027re not a callow teenager: by the mid-20s you had learned to accept nasty rejection without falling into a furious depression.At the same time, you have started to know your value and your price and nerve yourself occasionally to say: \u0027No.\u0027But always there\u0027s that roving eye for a new chance, and a faint sense that maybe you ought to be looking for a \u0027proper job\u0027.Even when I had two small children and lived in a Suffolk field, it was impossible not to read the situations vacant column and go into some mad fantasy of retraining as a psychiatric nurse, PE teacher or automotive bodyshop manager.And, shame to say, I still do.Royalty, presidents and \u0027the most famous elevator ride in...Michael Avenatti\u0027s estranged wife says she wishes he would...\u0027She is super smart and has great energy\u0027: Stormy Daniels\u0027...Firing up viewers: Today scores best ratings in two years...Share this article    Roger Alton says his body feels 171My passport says I\u0027m 71, but most of the time my body feels 171.Especially in the morning (come on knees, do your stuff and get out of bed) or the afternoon (try not to snooze with your mouth open), not to mention the evening (have a shower, not a bath, or you\u0027ll never get out). Then there\u0027s the nights (not the bloody loo again).All a bit embarrassing for a chap who still thinks he\u0027s 34 — physically, socially and professionally in the prime of life, with a rich circle of sporting and friendship associates. Eh! Who are you kidding?\u0027Hi guys. Any chance of a game? I heard you were short and I\u0027ve got my kit.\u0027\u0027Actually, it\u0027s OK. But we\u0027d love it if you would make the tea.\u0027I am not alone: Sergio Parisse, veteran captain of the beleaguered Italian rugby team, was asked if he was thinking of retiring before his team played Scotland last weekend.Not really, he said. \u0027In my head I\u0027m still 16.\u0027I know how he feels. Now, if I can only get up and head for bed . . .YES, THERE\u0027S LIFE BEYOND STRICTLYJohn SergeantReal age: 74. Spirit Age: 74.          John Sergeant feels his exact age I get worried when a young person says: \u0027I\u0027m going to go round the world and try to find myself.\u0027This attempt is unlikely to succeed — for we have many selves, from diligent child to grumpy old man, via many other characters on the way.One of my great joys has been being able to take part in a contrasting range of activities, be it Strictly Come Dancing or reporting Parliament and, somehow, making each one my own.To thine own self be true — but I have preferred to be true to mine own selves.My spirit age is highly variable. Sometimes I feel like a teenager, reluctant to get out of bed in the morning. Running up stairs is now a fairly rare pleasure — I am more likely to imagine that my 90th birthday looms.My spirit age also changes as the year progresses. At the moment I have adapted well to being 74.I feel plenty of adventures still lie ahead. But in just over two months I will be 75, and that is a source of unease.I think the best plan is to set my spirit age at 74 until I am ready to take stock."},{"url":null,"title":"Fracking firm claim strict red tape prevents tapping rich reservoir shale gas","story":"    Fracking firm Cuadrilla\u0027s Preston Road fracking site is seen near Blackpool, where they say a \u0027rich reservoir\u0027 of gas is presentThe company has written to its regulator, the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA), to call for a review of the rules.

Cuadrilla had to pause work several times late last year after tremors exceeded the 0.5 limit. The company says it has not been able to complete part of the fracking process – injecting sand after water has been pumped in – without breaching the threshold.Chief executive Francis Egan called for the limit to be raised but did not say where he wants the tremor level to be set.‘All we ask now is that we are treated fairly, with comparable seismic and ground vibration levels to similar industries in Lancashire and elsewhere in the UK,’ he said.          A protester stands outside Cuadrilla\u0027s Preston Road fracking site near BlackpoolThe current limit was imposed after fracking caused minor earthquakes at a different Cuadrilla site in Blackpool in 2011.Dr Brian Baptie and Dr Ben Edwards, advisers to the OGA, have previously said it is safe to treble the magnitude to 1.5 because the risk of harm is ‘vanishingly small’.Earlier this week Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Britain’s richest man and chairman of chemicals firm Ineos, urged regulators to allow earthquakes of up to magnitude 4.0 – said to feel like a large lorry passing by.‘It’s ridiculous we’re not allowed to do the science,’ he said. ‘They’ve just picked stupid levels.

Cyberbullying, online predators, harassment and disturbing content have all been identified as dangers for children online, with experts warning of the impact on mental health – especially when combined with poor sleep and a lack of exercise.Dame Sally said: \u0027Time spent online can be of great benefit to children and young people, providing opportunities for learning and skills development, as well as allowing young people to find support and information.\u0027But we need to take a precautionary approach and our advice will support children to reap these benefits and protect them from harm.\u0027Experts last night welcomed the guidance as simple, straightforward and achievable.       The family of schoolgirl Molly Russell have found it \u0027impossible\u0027 to discover potentially vital information about what she viewed online in the hours before she killed herself.Her parents – who have accused social media companies of contributing to her death – have been unable to gain access to both her Apple iPhone and iPod Touch, which are both encrypted.They have also been hamstrung by efforts to access the 14-year-old\u0027s social media accounts, which do not become accessible to parents even if a child dies.Molly\u0027s father Ian Russell told the BBC: \u0027There is data on her electronic devices that we can\u0027t access because it is locked in there.

Purchasing managers have reported falling activity in all three sectors of the economy — manufacturing, construction and services — in January.Quite a gloomy message from the EC today:The EC has also predicted that Britain will be the joint third-slowest growing (current) EU member this year - alongside France, Belgium and Sweden, but not as slow as Italy and Germany.Newsflash: The European Commission has just downgraded its growth forecasts, and Italy is in the firing line.Commissioner Pierre Moscovici is blaming the US-China trade war, and weakness within Europe. The Commission is blaming Italy’s new populist coalition, which battled Brussels last year as it tried to raise spending and cut taxes.As well as Brexit, and a cooling housing market, the Bank of England also needs to worry about the eurozone.With Italy in recession, and Germany worryingly close, a slowdown over the Channel is another headache for the UK’s central bank.And just this morning, weak industrial production data could have sent governor Carney reaching for the Nurofen. Factories in Germany and Spain have both reported that production declined in December, as 2018 ended with a whimper.Overnight, we’ve learned that housebuilding declined sharply in London and the Midlands last year as Brexit worries hit the housing market.Gary Barker, CEO of Reapit (supplier of CRM and accounting software to estate agents) has confirmed that buyers and sellers are shunning the property market, especially in London.But he believes stronger demand outside the capital should support prices.“However, there are other factors at work beyond Brexit: reasonable affordability, rising levels of employment and wage growth in the North and Midlands have attracted investors and first-time buyers alike, who are retreating from higher property prices in the Southern market. While growth in the South has slowed, we cannot ignore that growth remains elsewhere.“Until Brexit is clarified, limited housing stock and strong growth in the North and Midlands will buoy the market, preventing any outright falls.”Britain’s housing market has been sent into a spin by political uncertainty, and low supply of houses, says Lucy Pendleton, director of independent estate agents James Pendleton.“The long-term holding pattern in prices ahead of Brexit is abundantly clear and overall measures of consumer confidence have been scraping five-year lows.However, if the UK does enjoy a good EU exit, then a relief rally could be in store given the plentiful government support for buyers, cheap borrowing and rising wages coupled with low supply.”Halifax’s data also show that prices are actually lower than a year ago - another sign that the housing market has cooled.Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, believes Brexit uncertainty is dragging the housing market back.Here’s his take on the Halifax’s house price data:‘Flat growth is probably the best we can hope for given the current tricky political situation we find ourselves in. Brexit has caused a slowdown in purchase activity as would-be buyers sit on their hands, waiting for the outcome before committing to something as major as buying a new home. Fewer transactions has meant less business for lenders, yet they remain keen to lend. They run big operations and need their staff to be busy, so have two options - change their risk profile or mortgage pricing. The latter is easier, which is why many lenders have reduced their mortgage rates, and is great news for borrowers who are ready to make a move.The big picture is that the housing market is clearly cooling, in the face of political uncertainty, despite real wages finally picking up. That could clearly bolster the Bank of England’s reluctance to raise interest rates.Economist Rupert Seggins shows the full picture:Sterling has hit a two-week low this morning, as traders fret about Brexit ahead of the Bank of England meeting.The pound has shed 0.3 of a cent against the US dollar to $1.29, its lowest point since January 22nd.Theresa May is heading to Brussels today in an attempt to reshape the Brexit deal. The latest word, though, is that she doesn’t actually have a firm proposal - dampening any hopes of a breakthrough.Neil Wilson of Markets suspects that EC president Donald Tusk’s ‘place in hell’ attack has alarmed traders:“Sterling opened on the back foot, falling to a fresh two-week low, as Brexit risks heighten and the Bank of England looks set to stand pat on rates.The move lower in sterling seems more about Brexit than the BoE, although as described above it seems the Bank is not about to offer a hawkish boost to sterling bulls. It does rather look like Tusk’s bizarre outburst betrayed deep frustration among the EU that Britain is heading for the exit, not least because they had probably held out some vague aspirations that the UK would seek a second referendum and ultimately stay.Bloomberg has predicted that the Bank’s monetary policy committee will probably vote unanimously to leave interest rates unchanged.But....you can’t rule out one or two hawkish members jumping the fence and voting to hike. Chief economist Andrew Haldane or external member Michael Saunders are the most likely candidates.CNBC’s Joumanna Bercetche says there are three reasons for the Bank of England to leave interest rates unchanged -- recent economic data has been patchy inflation has fallen and we still don’t know what’s happening with Brexit.If Brexit uncertainty wasn’t casting such a dark cloud over the UK, the Bank of England could easily be raising interest rates today.So savers and borrowers should listen out, for any hints about how rates could move in the months ahead.Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.While Brexiteers get a special place in Hell, economics journalists must settle for a special place at the Bank of England today, as the central bank sets interest rates and releases its latest economic forecasts.Yes, it’s the final Super Thursday (as they’re known in the City) before Brexit day. Investors, business leaders, consumers and politicians should all pay attention to what governor Mark Carney has to say about the risks of a no-deal Brexit, and the state of the UK and global economies.The Bank’s economists may also cut their growth and inflation forecasts, given weakness in the global economy since their last meeting in November. So it should be a fun-packed press conference at lunchtime, when Carney takes questions from the media. Will he take the opportunity to issue any fresh Brexit warnings? Fiona Cincotta of City Index says:With Brexit clouding vision the central bank has their hands tied as far as policy is concerned. We expect further warnings over a no deal Brexit and the one hike a year mantra until Brexit uncertainty has cleared.Halifax Bank is releasing their latest UK house price data - it may confirm that prices are levelling off.The European Commission will publish its latest economic forecasts this morning. They could slash growth forecasts for some euro area members, such as Germany and Italy, given recent weak data. That could spark a new row with Rome, just days after the Italian economy slumped into recession."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ba07a288b0ea336fb144bb210ee79844c947324/733_0_3263_1958/master/3263.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a130de45f33a9ac70e95b95b63d7a47b","title":"clear him out palestinian tenants struggle to rent in west jerusalem","story":"In this ided city, an Arabic name can severely limit the ability to find a home – and anti-discrimination laws don’t cover private housingThe new housemate seemed perfect. A young professional from Jerusalem, fluent in multiple languages, he gelled well with the other tenants. After a short sublet, he asked to be officially added to the lease so he could apply for a parking permit.The landlord became angry and refused. The would-be-housemate had a distinctly Arabic name and the landlord said he wouldn’t rent to a Palestinian. In a text message to one of the other housemates, a British-Israeli teacher, the landlord wrote that he didn’t want a “non-Jew” renting and ordered them to “clear him out as soon as possible”. When the housemates pushed back, the landlord threatened to come with his brothers, change the locks and throw them out.“I was shocked,” says the teacher, but their Palestinian would-be housemate wasn’t. He declined to speak on the record or file a complaint. “What do you expect?” the teacher recalled him saying. “This is Jerusalem.”Like many Palestinians, he had experienced suspicion and racism before in Jewish-majority west Jerusalem. Facing discrimination is common for Palestinians trying to rent apartments on the well-maintained west side of the city. Sometimes it’s an upfront “No Arabs” directive from the landlord, but more often it is harder to pinpoint not getting a call back once an Arabic name comes up, for example.A few years back, Lustingman was leaving an apartment in west Jerusalem before the lease ended and needed a replacement. Luckily a friend, a Palestinian doctor, was interested. He had a guarantor and all the paperwork ready.“The landlord would not accept him as a tenant,” Lustingman says. “He wouldn’t allow a Palestinian person to move there … He’d rather the house stay empty.”She offered to represent her friend in a legal battle, which he declined. “He just wanted to find a different place to live.”Of these four Palestinian statuses, two – Palestinian citizens of Israel and east Jerusalem residents – feel the impact of Jerusalem’s housing dynamics.Given this labyrinthine question of status, as well as the history and ongoing violence between Israelis and Palestinians, the two populations are often fearful of mingling. Palestinian suicide bombers in the mid-2000s brought everyday life in west Jerusalem to a halt, and since 2015 there have been waves of Palestinian stabbings. Many Israelis describe Jerusalem as the kind of city where the three main communities – Jewish Israelis, Palestinians, and ultra-religious Jews – prefer to live separately. The Israeli public was elated when US president Donald Trump moved the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in May last year, effectively endorsing Israel’s position that Jerusalem is its unided capital. Palestinians, however, also claim east Jerusalem as the capital of their future state.Amid these political battles, unofficial housing discrimination remains an effective way to keep the population ided as Israel’s right-wing government attempts to extend its dominance over Jerusalem.A number of lawyers and human rights groups contacted say they are not aware of any legal cases contesting this kind of housing discrimination.“It is difficult to prove,” Lustingman adds. “That’s part of the problem. Usually people will see the name and they won’t say directly that this is the reason … There is no direct straightforward test to this.”While Israeli law directly forbids race, gender and other discrimination in areas such as employment and public space, there is no direct prohibition in relation to private housing. There is, however, a basic premise under Israeli law which stipulates that a contract must be negotiated in good faith – and Lustingman says a lawyer could argue housing discrimination violates this.Estate agent Eva Aviad says there are some areas of west Jerusalem, such as the mixed neighbourhood of Abu Tor, where Palestinians would not face problems renting, adding that she has never encountered a landlord refusing to let to an Arab client.“Most of the landlords that I work with are liberal, excuse me for being so frank,” she says. “The trouble is in this country – and especially in Jerusalem, where you really feel the conflict – is it is hard to be a liberal.”Muhammad, 28, a Hebrew-speaking Palestinian raised in the Old City in east Jerusalem, requested that the  only use his first name. He says he has lived in west Jerusalem for several years but for the past few months has been hunting for a new apartment – and is finding it difficult. Ultra-Orthodox Jewish areas of the city are entirely off limits, he says, and he doesn’t want to live on a street where he’s the only Arab.But Muhammad needs to keep living in Jerusalem to maintain his residency. And as a young person looking for freedom, he doesn’t want to live in the Old City – “the bubble,” he calls it – where Israeli paramilitary police patrol, social norms are conservative, and where his family and neighbours can constantly monitor and restrict his lifestyle.So, before Muhammad goes to meet a potential housemate or landlord, he looks them up on Facebook to try to get a sense of their politics. He then holds his breath for the moment when “you feel something change with them” and he’s told there are others looking or the room is already taken.“Bottom line – I’m still looking for an apartment.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e808aa0c857d3f0dcafcaa7c14aea547d060f80/0_69_4550_2730/master/4550.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0c55ea4b8065bef8f7dd87e1f917a02","title":"arts culture services austerity","story":"Since 2010, £400m has been stripped from these ‘non-essential’ services. It is a short-sighted, dehumanising tragedyAs it emerged Grantham Museum will soon look out on to a bronze statue of Margaret Thatcher, I found myself thinking about the last time I stepped foot in there.Growing up in the town in the 1990s, the local museum was a cheap trip out for my primary school class, a sea of sticky fingers smudging the glass. I still remember the smell – a sort of musty air mixed with a whiff of adventure.For a small market town, Grantham has a big history, producing not only Thatcher but (more favourably) Isaac Newton. As a kid, our museum was a small window into another world, where the past was packed into a space each of us could explore.Then in 2011 Lincolnshire county council ) moved to close Grantham Museum as part of a “cost-saving exercise” for heritage services. More than 80 years after it first opened, the museum was deemed a service modern society could not afford. In the end, local people formed a charity specifically to save it. The museum survives today because of them – a group of 20 volunteers giving their time to keep history open.It’s a state of affairs replicated up and down the country, with museums, libraries and arts festivals increasingly hollowed out by cash-strapped councils. The maths is simple: as years of austerity have left local authorities struggling to cover even their legal duties, such as social care and child protection, a growing number of so-called nonessential services such as art and culture are cut. Research by the County Councils Network (CCN) recently found £400m has been removed from culture and arts budgets since 2010, with some councils at risk of becoming “little more than social care providers”, as they reduce non-care services to the bare legal minimum.By 2025, the Local Government Association says an £8bn funding black hole will “swallow up” popular council amenities. That means closed leisure centres, axed cultural facilities, fewer bus services, and unkempt parks and green spaces. Even lollipop men and women are under threat.This is all on top of existing cuts. One in three parks no longer has any staff on site, with park funding reduced by at least £15m in the past two years. Elsewhere, £30m was stripped from council library spending in England in 2017-18, according to the Chartered Institute for Public Finance and Accountancy. Over that time, 127 libraries closed nationwide, with others only propped up by volunteers.It’s easy to dismiss these sorts of services, but there’s a clear symbolism to an area facing the loss of its green spaces or museum. Just as boarded-up shops eat away at a place’s sense of its own worth, the closure of arts, nature, and cultural programmes entrench a feeling that culture is for “other people”. In an all too familiar story, we find ourselves sleepwalking into a society in which creativity, escapism and fulfilment are increasingly saved for the middle classes or big cities.As with so many of the cuts we’ve seen over the last decade, the short term cost-cutting of cultural services will likely ultimately put a larger strain on the public purse. Cut community programmes and anything from literacy problems to mental illness and isolation shoots up.But more than that, it shows how austerity doesn’t simply reduce the services councils are able to offer, but shrinks the landscape of those who rely on them. Or to put it another way: an ideology based on endless money saving can never understand the value of something. A library is not only a place to store books it’s the place a teenage girl goes to find quiet for her exam revision. An arts programme is not a waste of funds it’s how a young man finds a way to express himself. Local services are worth more than their cost on a spreadsheet.When it comes to the spin of austerity, none have been worse affected than local government: Conservatives in Westminster gutted council spending, knowing that the blame would fall on local authorities. And yet matters of who is to blame for a mess are only useful when determining what needs to be done to clear it up. The answer to that is as unfashionably simple as more money: try as they might, ministers know it is simply not possible to cut this deep and for services not to crumble.The question surrounding it, though, is altogether more complex. Just what is it a modern society expects the state to provide? In the coming years, there needs to be an honest discussion on what role councils are expected to play in their communities, and the level of funding this requires. It would be a small, sad nation that set its expectations so low it decides the highest aim of government is to keep the lights on. There are the services that keep us alive. And then there are those that make life worth living."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26ca4ebb83908a430230d9ca7ed4f3ad80a672b4/0_540_3707_2224/master/3707.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c4b8320a7cc3d6a0c3b66cece815733","title":"poundland engagement ring is perfect sold 20000","story":"These days, no one can afford a ‘real’ ring, so what’s wrong about opting for a cheap ‘placeholder’?I can remember exactly where I was (a pub) when I first discovered the economics of wedding and engagement rings, I was that astonished: the groom is supposed to spend three times his monthly salary on the item. The reason it should be so expensive is that the ring has many functions a gesture of such great love it should cost more than a boiler a symbol of inidual wealth becoming irrelevant as two destinies are conjoined and a signal to the rest of the world of the scale of the catch you have just landed. But if it seemed ridiculous in the 90s, it seems even more outlandish now. Savings are so last century.Poundland recently came to the rescue with a £1 “placeholder” ring: the idea is that you choose your real ring together, but this is a myth, like “first-time buyer”. No one can afford a “real” ring, or a separate wedding ring, least of all when they have to get married. The 20,000 “bling rings” Poundland sold, in a week, will be the rings everyone says “I do” to.I got married, for the second time, less than a year ago. Without going into too much detail about how expensive getting orced is, we were skint. My Mr wanted to get a £20 wedding ring from Argos I wanted a secondhand ring for 20 times that. I won’t say it was the first time we argued, or even the first time we argued that day, but it was definitely the first time he gave me that “who even are you?” look. It is true that I do not seem like the sort of person who would make a rash decision for display purposes – unless it were, I don’t know, buying a Darth Vader suit for a dog.But I knew two things: the first is that nobody ever knows what to say to you when you’ve just got married, so they tell you you look pretty, then they ask to see your ring. I don’t think this happens to men, but it sure as hell happens to women. If you have to do that 50 times, then you will basically spend the whole of your special day talking about Argos. You’ll probably get on to the subject of its tiny pens and its awesome distribution network more than once. That’s not to say a ring doesn’t bring potential negative externalities, since it’s hard to make conversation about adornments per se. I had a friend who said, “I can never believe how cheap antique jewellery is”, then sent me an elaborate apology. At that point, I genuinely was offended that anyone would think I could be offended by someone calling my ring cheap.Second, that ring, unavoidably, becomes sentimental. When Snoop Dogg’s Beautiful is playing because you didn’t bring your own CD, when the registrar is asking you to check the certificate for errors, and you’re saying, “Yes, that’s fine, except you’ve misspelled ‘Southwark’, which is weird, as you have it embroidered on your tie”, that’s the ring you’re in. You will never replace that ring. You might buy another ring, but that will be your original ring. And if it oxidises and turns your finger a bit green, it is still your ring.This doesn’t mean a Poundland ring is a bad idea it’s brilliant. You just need to put FAQs on the invitation, with “Poundland” under “Where did you get your beautiful ring?”, so you don’t spend the day talking about the incredible value of its Halloween decorations. Also, buy seven. Because they might be cheap, but they probably won’t be built to last, even as long as the average marriage. Sentimental attachments are transferable between items, so long as they are identical."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03718a88ba7d71186b6d19c7b34ee7a7e402b3e8/137_0_1498_899/master/1498.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f904c7e31ac2a67c119acd2371a81055","title":"cavity two thirds the size of manhattan discovered under antarctic glacier","story":"Disintegration of rapidly melting Thwaites ice mass could threaten coastal communities worldwideScientists have discovered a giant cavity at the bottom of a disintegrating glacier in Antarctica, sparking concerns that the ice sheet is melting more rapidly than expected.Researchers working as part of a Nasa-led study found the cavern, which they said was 300 metres tall and two-thirds the size of Manhattan, at the bottom of the massive Thwaites glacier.The space is big enough to have contained 14bn tonnes of ice and most of that ice has melted during the past three years.In a paper published in Science Advances, the scientists said the rapid change in the ice was “unexpected” at some points on the glacier.The researchers found the cavity using Italian and German satellites and ice-penetrating radar from Nasa’s Operation IceBridge, which uses research aircraft to monitor changes in polar ice.But Milillo told the  the size of the underwater cavity was not the main concern because the 14bn tonnes it released were already underwater and so would not contribute to sea level rise. The important aspect of the paper, he said, was what it revealed about the interaction between sea and ice.Jeremie Mouginot, a co-author of the paper and a research scientist at the Université Grenoble Alpes, said ocean water was filling a widening gap between the floating ice shelf and the bedrock.Thwaites, he said, was a 120km-wide “monster glacier” that is continuing its retreat with huge future implications, because it could potentially add 0.6 metres to rising seas.Thwaites also supports neighbouring glaciers that, if they melted, would increase sea levels by an additional 2.44 metres, threatening coastal communities worldwide.Mouginot said further studies would be needed on where and how Thwaites will decline. “The current question is not if the glaciers will retreat but at which pace.”There are already new investigations of Thwaites under way, including one by a UK team, as well as studies of other Antarctic regions.The hole is on the glacier’s western side and has been melting at a rate of about 0.6 to 0.8km a year since 1992, a rate that while stable was “extremely high”, Nasa said.Eric Rignot, a co-author of the study, said understanding how warming oceans were melting the glacier away was “essential to project its impact on sea level rise in the coming decades”.“We have suspected for years that Thwaites was not tightly attached to the bedrock beneath it,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc94478816bde4925c414ae578b98c0506f60340/0_0_1250_750/master/1250.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6dd3b67f759bc24e1c33682ab76b4dd2","title":"uk worst offender in europe for electronic waste exports report","story":"Electronic waste hazardous due to toxic parts was tracked to developing countriesThe UK is the worst offender in Europe for illegally exporting toxic electronic waste to developing countries, according to a two-year investigation that tracked shipments from 10 European countries.The investigation by the environmental watchdog the Basel Action Network (BAN) put GPS trackers on 314 units of computers, LCD monitors and printers placed in recycling facilities in 10 countries. Researchers mapped what they said was the export of 11 items to Ghana, Nigeria, Pakistan, Tanzania, Thailand and Ukraine. The UK was the top of the list of suspected illegal shipments. Five computers and LCD monitors were shipped to developing countries after they were tracked and placed in council recycling centres across England and Scotland.Ireland, Denmark, Italy, Spain and Germany also exported electronic waste to developing countries in what are suspected to be illegal shipments, the report said.By extrapolating the illegal exports with figures on electronic waste generation throughout Europe, the report estimated that 352,474 metric tonnes of electronic waste was being illegally shipped from the EU to developing countries each year.Jim Puckett, director of BAN, said the illegal shipments perpetuated an EU waste management regime “on the backs of the poor and vulnerable”.“We have discovered a very significant stream of illegal shipments of hazardous consumer electronic scrap to vulnerable populations,” he said.“This flies in the face of EU claims to make continuous efforts to implement a circular economy which can only responsibly exist by eliminating … leakage from the system.”The UK’s shipments went from council recycling facilities to Nigeria, Tanzania and Pakistan.Chris Smith, national intelligence manager for the UK Environment Agency, said: “The Environment Agency takes these matters very seriously with a proactive criminal intelligence led team in place that is dedicated to detecting and preventing illegal waste shipments from England.“However, our challenge is vast. Detecting illegal waste shipments is the ultimate hunt for the needle in a haystack, and this is where partnerships allow us to extend our reach and effectiveness. By providing the Environment Agency with an early insight into their tracker deployment, the Basel Action Network enabled us to quickly and efficiently close down four illegal waste operators who exported the electrical waste containing their trackers.”The report said that due to the lack of proper waste management in the recipient developing countries, including open burning of e-waste, there was likely to be local contamination of crops and threats to humans from the illegal exports.Far more should be done, the study said, to prosecute the robust illegal trade, including working with target countries to stem the toxic tide.Puckett condemned lobbying by the electronics manufacturing industry, which is attempting to create a loophole in the Basel convention to allow broken, low value electronic scrap to flow from Europe on the grounds that it will be “repaired” in developing countries. He urged the EU not to agree to the loophole.“The answer to criminal activity is not legalising that activity but improving the enforcement to ensure the future health of Europe is not dependant on poisoning the rest of the world.”In the last two years the rest of the world has increasingly begun to act against imports of rubbish and waste from Europe. China banned the import of millions of tonnes of plastic waste last year.Thailand – one of the countries to which illegal shipments were found to have been made – acted in June 2018 to stem the flow of e-waste being imported after concerns it was becoming the dumping ground for the world.Other countries have also begun to restrict waste imports from European countries. recently revealed concerns over illegality and fraud in the plastic recycling export industry in the UK as the impact of the import bans created a crisis in UK recycling."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a617c78c096c4884eb21f067e0860fd40a7521c4/0_374_1242_745/master/1242.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66db1d266c5a7e242260e73f5f9d966a","title":"gucci withdraws jumper blackface balaclava","story":"Italian fashion brand lambasted over ‘balaclava’ polo neck with large red lipsGucci has withdrawn a polo neck jumper from its shops after social media users said it resembled blackface.The $890 (£689) “balaclava” knit, part of the autumnwinter 2018 collection, covers the bottom half of the face and has a cutout mouth with large red lips.On Wednesday, Twitter and Instagram users posted pictures of the jumper, with several pointing to the fact it was currently Black History Month in the US.One person tweeted: “Balaclava knit top by Gucci.

He had meddled too much with the script. The studio wanted him gone.Moneyball, a back-office drama about the Oakland A’s manager Billy Beane’s quest to revolutionise baseball analytics, was eventually shepherded – by a substitute director, Bennett Miller – to six Oscar nominations. It was a Hollywood success story. But for Soderbergh it was more evidence that Hollywood was failing: another film made in competition with its studio.The director announced his retirement from film-making a few weeks later. “Movies don’t matter any more,” he said. Directors were being treated like dirt.Almost 10 years later. Another revolution. Soderbergh hasn’t changed, but Hollywood has. High Flying Bird, his third film since his return to feature directing in 2017, lands in a new world. A micro-budget Netflix production shot on a smartphone, it’s a very different sports drama, but another story about an innovator upturning the order for the love of the game.André Holland stars as Ray, a basketball agent whose acquisition of the year’s number one draft pick would be a slam-dunk, if only his player was allowed to play. There’s a lockout between the NBA and the athletes, a dispute over pay that has left new recruits like Ray’s client, Erick (Melvin Gregg), sidelined.Ray, a black man looking after the interests of young black men, has to navigate carefully. But, with the help of a sparky former assistant (Zazie Beetz), he takes on the corporations (personified by an ultra-slimy Kyle MacLachlan) and uses their staleness against them. The digital age offers opportunities the old guard have been too slow to tackle. The lockout covers TV broadcast, so streaming platforms are fair game.It’s here that Netflix sub themselves in and it’s this celebration of the company’s own disruptor status where the film fouls up. A particularly clunky scene has Ray, shoring up his client’s confidence in his scheme by proudly announcing that he’s got meetings lined up at Netflix. It plays like a meta love-in between Ray, Soderbergh and the studio, but Netflix – which spent more than $13bn on original productions last year – is too big to claim outlaw status.Still, High Flying Bird makes risky plays. The bold take on race and sport isn’t – and couldn’t be – Soderbergh’s alone. Instead, the film is passed between the director and the screenwriter, Moonlight playwright Tarell Alvin McCraney. His script zips between sports jargon and scripture, analysis and allegory. One sequence has a character draw parallels between professional sport and slavery, then another character quickly ridicule the same. We’re left with Ray’s mentor as our guide and castigator: “Anyone who refers to the institution of slavery in front of me, particularly in reference to basketball and its players, must say these words: ‘I love God and all of his black people.’” Again, this isn’t your typical studio ballgame.The film – with cinematography by Peter Andrews and editing by Mary Ann Bernard (both Steven Soderbergh aliases) – doesn’t always look beautiful. It has a cold blankness, befitting both the soullessness of its subject matter and – perhaps – its $2m budget. It warms up through short interviews the director has filmed with real-life basketball stars Reggie Johnson, Donovan Mitchell and Karl-Anthony Towns, who talk about making the transition from rookie status to the NBA. Filmed as they look up, above the camera, they talk about mistakes, insecurities, family and home. Suddenly, we see them as Ray sees them: as kids. Super-talented, multimillionaire kids, but kids all the same.In picking at a system until it’s threaded, High Flying Bird is a classic Soderbergh construct. Throughout his career – from Sex, Lies and Videotape to Erin Brockovich to Che to Magic Mike – he’s revelled in telling stories of the inidual chipping away at the status quo. Like them, like Ray and like Moneyball’s Billy Beane, Soderbergh sought an alternative to a system that was doing their passion a disservice. The rules have changed, it’s his game now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000.

A Japanese snack company is offering chips that require only a single hand to consume – and you don’t have to touch the chips at all. The Tokyo company Koike-ya is behind One Hand Chips, which come pre-smashed so that you can essentially drink them, according to the Wall Street Journal. Now you can swipe with clean hands, and while the calories pile up, you don’t have to waste valuable energy chewing. As one enthusiast tells the paper: “I can just take it and chug it.”Koike-ya is aware of the significance of its accomplishment, calling One Hand Chips “a new snack style humankind has been waiting for”, the Journal reports. But it’s far from the first company to tailor the dining experience around our phone-centric lifestyles.Nearly a decade ago, TechCrunch reported on the Potato Chip Hand. It’s a plastic stick with pincers on one end, forming a grabber that pleasingly mimics the white gloves favored by Mickey Mouse and Goofy. It emerged just a few years after release of the first iPhone.McDonald’s, meanwhile, has gradually refined its own tools to address the phone-grease conundrum. In 2017, it unveiled the Frork, which is a device to hold and dip French fries. Wooden chip forks are commonplace in the UK, of course – with the life-changing implication that fries can be a meal – but this was different. The beauty of the Frork was how the fries became a part of it, serving as makeshift tines that you could sweep through ketchup. The trouble was loading the holder with fries, which was essentially impossible without touching them, as the writer Tim Carman observed in a series of Washington Post pieces on fry-centric tech.Perhaps that’s why the brilliant minds at McDonald’s rethought the strategy last year. Instead of targeting the fries, they focused on the phone with the Frylus. Your hands might be covered in grease, but the tool allowed you to use your phone without touching it. Had Apple considered this innovation, perhaps the iPhone would have come with one from the start.According to General Mills, makers of Cinnamon Toast Crunch, you shouldn’t have to “choose between eating and posting” selfies, either. The cereal team invented the selfie spoon a few years back, as reported in Time and promoted in this horrifying music video.It’s a selfie stick with a spoon at one end. They are (or were) free – “Our awesome fans love to share their obsession with our cereal on social media so we wanted to show a little love back,” a marketing planner said on the company’s blog – but you do have to cover shipping. SelfieSpoon trumpets the fact that this is “really a thing”. They are sold out, presumably forever, but one is available for $50 on eBay.One-handed eating is not new. Chopsticks predated the Frork by roughly 4,000 years. There are also a number of longstanding snacks well suited to one-handed eating – I personally recommend granola bars. A word of caution, however: you’re probably better off keeping eating and Instagramming separate. Unsurprisingly, researchers have found that using a phone during a meal leads to less enjoyment. Presumably subjects were not using selfie spoons."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53d7d9d2b8e7eb7de31f1fa99c23bdef4457395c/0_198_3837_2302/master/3837.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e10bdf85e45d1b88c092b87aa23c37e1","title":"manchester city everton premier league title race","story":"Goodison Park was fairly empty three quarters of an hour before the kick-off when Pep Guardiola emerged from the tunnel and took a seat in the away dugout. Wrapped in a heavy grey cardigan he sat with his thoughts and assistant Manuel Estiarte for company, although there was mainly silence at a time the Manchester City manager would usually have been issuing late instruction inside the dressing room. The inference to his players was clear: you know what you have to do. City obliged with a show of character to nudge aside Liverpool at the Premier League summit.The champions did not send a title warning across Stanley Park with the level of their performance. Guardiola was bellowing much-needed advice from the edge of his technical area moments after the contest began. But they were resolute, assured and patient against an improved Everton team as their experience of such demanding nights told. Liverpool will have noted those title-winning traits.Stoppage time goals in both halves, from Aymeric Laporte in the 47th minute and Gabriel Jesus in the 97th, were testament to City’s composure and resources, with a substitute of the calibre of Kevin De Bruyne supplying the pass for Sergio Agüero’s replacement to seal victory. Restricting Marco Silva’s side to one shot on target all game also underlined their resolve. Every title contender will drop points during the run-in, the City manager predicted, and given his team’s schedule that seems a likely prospect, but the return of last season’s record breakers to the top of the table makes ominous reading for their rivals.The accusation that Everton would lay down and die to hinder Liverpool’s title chances was exposed for the insult it always was to Silva’s players. Everton have been struggling to do themselves any favours of late, never mind their local rivals, but the commitment of their players and supporters in search of a much-needed victory was evident. It just wasn’t enough to distract the champions from their focus of reclaiming top spot.Silva himself was accused in some quarters of aiding City’s challenge by fielding a weakened team. Only those who have not witnessed the recent toils of Gylfi Sigurdsson, Richarlison and Seamus Coleman could come to that conclusion. Silva would arguably have made more changes from Saturday’s meek defeat by Wolves if possible and those he did introduce, plus the switch in formation, brought instant improvement. Not enough to break the champions’ control or rhythm, however.The chasm between the teams extended beyond quality, confidence and single-minded ambition. There is a maturity to City both as a group and as a reflection of their manager’s vision. By contrast, Silva spoke on the eve of the game of having to develop a young core at Everton, a decision taken in conjunction with majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri, director of football Marcel Brands and chairman Bill Kenwright last summer.Everton’s latest strategy underlines the exorbitant sums wasted during the three years of Moshiri’s reign but was supported by a 20-year-old local product, Tom Davies, captaining the team against the reigning champions. The Everton line was led by a 21-year-old, Dominic Calvert-Lewin, while Jonjoe Kenny, another 21-year-old, replaced Coleman at right-back. The youngest player in City’s starting lineup was 23-year-old Leroy Sane, a full Germany international, and experience shaped the visitors’ latest victory.Silva’s young trio justified their inclusion but Everton’s energetic start was soon stifled by the visitors’ dominance of possession. It yielded few opportunities to prey on a vulnerable home side for 45 minutes, Laporte steering his first free header wide from a corner and Ilkay Gündogan hitting the bar, but City’s patience never wavered. They may have been too pedestrian and predictable on occasions for Guardiola’s liking but his players stuck faithfully to the game plan, sensing the breakthrough would come.Everton’s consistently awful defending at set-pieces under Silva offered extra confidence in that respect. It was vindicated when David Silva lined up a free-kick into Jordan Pickford’s penalty area. The home crowd feared the worst. Everton’s static defence proved them right. Laporte had been marked by the much smaller Davies when he headed wide from Gündogan’s corner.The central defender had no Everton player for company when his second chance arrived, and sent a soaring header beyond Pickford. Jesus added the second from a piercing pass by De Bruyne and, moments later, the City players gathered en masse in front of their travelling support to embrace a significant night.

The UK’s three major commercial radio networks are investing heavily in new, digital-only outlets in the belief that the proliferation of digital radios and smart speakers such as Amazon’s Echowill encourage people to try new stations.The BBC’s director of radio, James Purnell, has previously said he was not concerned with such metrics and was instead focusing on developing the audience for the much-criticised BBC Sounds app and ensuring its output was relevant to the next generation through increased investment in podcasting and online audio.The period covered by the Rajar figures was shortly before a substantial changeover in the world of radio that saw several high-profile presenters switch stations including Chris Evans to Virgin Radio, Zoe Ball and Sara Cox starting new shows on BBC Radio 2 and Simon Mayo leaving to start a new classical music station.BBC Radio 1 also lost half a million listeners, though the new Greg James breakfast show added 300,000 people to its audience when listeners aged 10 and over were included.Radio 4’s Today programme is now listened to by 6.8 million listeners a week, only a slight dip on the same period last year. On Wednesday John Humphrys confirmed he would be leaving the station after 32 years with the programme.Elsewhere in the commercial radio sector Bauer Media’s Magic network has hit a record high of 4.2 million listeners, while Global’s Heart network is reaching 9.7 million listeners a week.Rupert Murdoch’s Wireless Group, the third-biggest UK commercial radio group, has made a substantial investment in the likes of Virgin Radio and TalkRadio, but listener figures suggest it is still struggling to build an audience.Despite outbidding the BBC for sports rights and hiring Jeremy Kyle, Matthew Wright and Eamonn Holmes, the audience for its national stations has only edged up slightly from a low base and it remains a comparative minnow in the industry.Virgin Radio only attracted 447,000 listeners a week at the end of 2018, a far cry from the 9 million who tuned in to the final months of Evans’s BBC Radio 2 breakfast show. His bosses will be hoping this figure jumps substantially in the coming months, aided by his high-profile arrival, heavy advertising and cross-promotion from the Sun newspaper."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6f84e733526d67ba0ae91daa75d92f76e25032c/0_153_4060_2436/master/4060.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a383a839d61adf38b632ac036a5c4c50","title":"is climate change way worse than we realise today in focus podcast","story":"David Wallace-Wells, the author of new book The Uninhabitable Earth, depicts a world ravaged by climate chaos.

By doing this, they can help avoid the need for costly and time-consuming customs checks during trade between members of the union. Asian shipping containers arriving at Felixstowe or Rotterdam, for example, need only pass through customs once before their contents head to markets all over\u0026nbspEurope. Lorries passing between Dover and Calais avoid delay entirely.Customs are not the only checks that count – imports are also scrutinised for conformity with trading standards regulations and security and immigration purposes – but they do play an important role in determining how much friction there is at the border. A strict customs regime at Dover or between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would lead to delays that will be costly for business and disruptive for travellers. Just-in-time supply chains in industries such as car making could suffer. An Irish peace process built around the principle of entirely unfettered travel between north and south could be jeopardised.His intervention will dismay backbench Labour MPs and grassroots activists still hoping he will switch the party’s policy towards demanding a second Brexit referendum – which is not mentioned in the letter.And it comes as No 10 prepares to publish legislation underpinning workers’ rights, perhaps as early as next week, in an attempt to win support from Labour backbenchers.In his letter, Corbyn calls for the government to rework the political declaration setting the framework for Britain’s future relationship with the EU – and then enshrine these new negotiating objectives in UK law, so that a future Tory leader could not sweep them away after Brexit.He says the changes to the political declaration must include:There is no mention of the second of the shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer’s six tests, which said that Labour would not support any deal that failed to deliver the “exact same benefits” as single market and customs union membership.Labour’s approach, which Corbyn called “constructive”, appears to be focused firmly on the forward-looking political declaration, rather than the 585-page withdrawal agreement, which contains the Irish backstop and the orce bill.“We recognise that your priority is now to seek legally binding changes to the backstop arrangements contained within the withdrawal agreement, as we discussed when we met,” Corbyn writes.“However, without changes to your negotiating red lines, we do not believe that simply seeking modifications to the existing backstop terms is a credible or sufficient response either to the scale of your defeat last month in parliament, or the need for a deal with the EU that can bring the country together and protect jobs,” he says.He does not explicitly say that article 50 should be extended – a move that the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, described as “sensible” on Wednesday.But he said that because of the government’s negotiating failures “time has run out for the necessary preparation and for legislation to be finalised”. He added: “Following last week’s rejection by the House of Commons of no deal, all necessary steps must be taken to avoid such an outcome.”He concluded: “My colleagues and I look forward to discussing these proposals with you further, in the constructive manner in which they are intended, with the aim of securing a sensible agreement that can win the support of parliament and bring the country together.”May has so far vehemently resisted the prospect of reopening the political declaration, focusing instead on securing changes to the Irish backstop, which has been the flashpoint for Brexiter Conservative MPs.But at the same time, her government has been trying to win over Labour backbenchers with new legally binding promises on workers’ rights.She could propose a new draft bill as early as next week guaranteeing that UK workers’ rights will keep pace with Europe.Backbench Labour sources said the new bill was in the late stages of drafting and would include a “regression lock” that the UK parliament would ensure workers’ rights would never slip below European standards. That approach appears likely to come close to meeting one of Corbyn’s five tests.Multiple Labour MPs who have met May over the past few months have made it clear to her that they needed the guarantees to be made in primary legislation – because they do not trust that May will remain in No 10 for much longer.Those who are in negotiations with the government have insisted that the bill must be tabled and have had at least one day of second reading within the next few months.The Labour MP John Mann, one of the key figures behind the push for legislation, said: “There needs to be a bill produced soon. We aren’t basing anything on a promise, with all due respect to the prime minister. We are doing it based on statute.”The Labour MP Lisa Nandy, who has also intimated she could back May’s deal, said the right offer from No 10 could win over up to 60 Labour MPs.But Phil Wilson, the Labour MP for Sedgefield and a leading supporter of the People’s Vote campaign, said: “It was perhaps inevitable that at some point my party would publish something like this even though most Labour MPs, members and voters have long since worked out that there is no form of Brexit that can meet the promises made in 2016 or do anything but make people poorer … In the end there is only one way out of this mess for both our country and the Labour party – a people’s vote.”Trade unions are understood to have been pushing for the legislation to include an easing of restrictions on union activity. Union leaders had been seeking more concrete proposals for regulation of the labour market after Brexit and the enforcement of existing law.“Their desire to bring in seasonal agricultural workers from around the globe, as well as barista visas, really does ring alarm bells,” one union source said. “Our fear is that when workers depend on their bosses for their visas, exploitation is sure to follow.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f75c09f2ebc925d35e50eca91c99a49969dce177/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=854e7cd192fc5aba5983ad5026a4b7ce","title":"brexit latest news developments theresa may brussels talks corbyn faces backlash from labour pro europeans after sending brexit plan to pm politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen, including Theresa May’s visit to Brussels for Brexit talks with Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude JunckerEarlier in the Commons Tom Watson, the deputy Labour leader and shadow culture secretary, accused the government of implementing a “Tory triple-whammy tourist tax”. He made the claim as he asked an urgent question about the HuffPost report saying, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, mobile phone roaming charges could return for people visiting Europe under government plans. Watson said:But Watson said that this assurance was not good enough for consumers. He told MPs:Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, has just announced the business for next week. It does include a debate on Brexit on Thursday.She said the government was still committed to having a “meaningful vote” on a revised deal as soon as possible. If this does not happen by Wednesday next week, Theresa May will make a statement to MPs, followed by the debate on Thursday, Leadsom said.Theresa May encountered an anti-Brexit campaigner when she arrived the the European commission HQ in Brussels, the BBC’s Adam Fleming reports.A senior Labour source says that Matthew Pennycook’s claim that the party will move to backing a second referendum if Theresa May does not accept its Brexit proposals in full (see 10.52am) does not not reflect the official leadership position.The Lib Dems, who are campaigning for a second referendum, have criticised Jeremy Corbyn’s Brexit offer to the government. Tom Brake, the party’s Brexit spokesman, said:Jeremy Corbyn has turned his back on the millions of Labour members and voters who demand a better future than Tory Brexit Britain. He has chosen to forget that Labour conference voted for the party to campaign for a people’s vote after failing to secure a general election.After thirty years sitting on the backbenches arguing for more power for members and against the EU, Corbyn has finally chosen to go for the latter at the expense of the former.Matthew Pennycook, a shadow Brexit minister, says that if Theresa May does not accept Labour’s Brexit conditions (see 9.36am) “in full”, the party must move to backing a second referendum.What Pennycook is saying is entirely consistent with the Labour Brexit policy agreed at party conference. But that document was a masterpiece of elasticity, designed to accommodate all opinion within the party ranging from People’s Vote to Corbynite Lexitism.In truth, Pennycook’s message is rather different from Jeremy Corbyn’s. In his letter, Corbyn did not say anything about what Labour might do if May does not accept his proposals and he did not raise the issue of a second referendum at all. Also, whereas Pennycook is saying May must accept Labour’s demands “in full”, the Corbyn letter said any negotiation with the EU would require “flexibility and compromise”.I’ve asked Corbyn’s office if they support what Pennycook is saying. I will post the response when I get it.On the Today programme David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister and Theresa May’s de facto deputy, said that the government would be happy to talk with Labour further about its Brexit plans. He said that he had not received any “direct overtures” from the party about talks, but that he would be willing to discuss the issue with Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, or Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary.But he also claimed that the Labour proposals (see 9.36am) reflected “wishful thinking”. A key part of any discussion would be “to understand exactly where the Labour frontbench is coming from”, he said. He went on:I would be saying to Labour, ‘What is it that you don’t like about what is in the political declaration at the moment?’, because what we have there is an idea of a customs arrangement with the European Union that still allows us to have an independent trade policy on top of that, but while getting access - tariff-free and quota-free - for our goods and agriculture to the European market.I would be asking what on earth they mean when they say they want to be in a customs union with the EU but also for Britain to have a say in EU trade policy with other countries. That’s not something that’s allowed under the European treaties. This seems to be wishful thinking.Here are three more Labour MPs expressing doubts about Jeremy Corbyn’s Brexit offer to Theresa May.Theresa May has arrived in Brussels. Last night Downing Street sent out a briefing note setting out the key messages that Theresa May will be delivering in Brussels today. For the record, here they are in full.The UK’s objective is to find a way to guarantee we cannot, and will not, be trapped in the backstop.The prime minister is open to different ways to achieve this, but is clear it must be legally binding and therefore will require changes to the withdrawal agreement.Securing such changes will not be easy.The withdrawal agreement was the product of much hard work and was negotiated in good faith.However, parliament voted by a significant majority in the meaningful vote, sending an unequivocal message that change is required.Last week, parliament made clear that for the first time it could support the withdrawal agreement, subject to changes to the backstop. Importantly, MPs also reiterated their absolute commitment to both avoiding a hard border and leaving the EU with a deal.While Labour did not whip for the Brady amendment, Jeremy Corbyn has said he also has concerns about the backstop – so this is an issue that needs to be resolved, not just for our Conservative MPs and the DUP, but for MPs across the House.To achieve this we have launched urgent pieces of work examining alternative arrangements to the backstop and considering legal changes to the current backstop that could provide the type of guarantees MPs from all sides have said they need.The government now wants urgently to work with the EU to secure such changes.The EU shares the UK’s commitment to leave with a deal. We must show determination and do what it takes to now get the deal over the line.The People’s Vote campaign, which wants a second referendum, has released a response to the Corbyn letter from the Labour MP Phil Wilson, one of its supporters. He calls for the Corbyn plan to be scrutinised - so that it can be rejected. He says:It was perhaps inevitable that at some point my party would publish something like this even though most Labour MPs, members and voters have long since worked out that there is no form of Brexit that can meet the promises made in 2016 or do anything but make people poorer.What’s needed now is for this and any other alternative Brexit proposal to be given the same level of scrutiny that led parliament to reject the government’s deal last month. That will show that no number of tweaks to the political declaration pretending we can have our cake and eat it can change the reality that any Brexit deal means leaving the EU without clarity or certainty about where we will end up.Our party conference agreed last year that if it couldn’t get a general election it should explore other options including a new public vote. The party and parliament should examine this option so that if and when it is rejected, Labour can fulfil the wishes of the overwhelming majority of its voters and members by campaigning to give the public the final say. In the end there is only one way out of this mess for both our country and the Labour party - a People’s Vote.Although People’s Vote is calling for the Labour plan to be subject to rigorous scrutiny, in fact a critical analysis has already been published - by the People’s Vote campaign itself. Last month it published a 16-page briefing paper (pdf) highlighting problems with the “Norway plus” plan, with Labour’s plan, and with a no-deal Brexit.(Compared to the usual standard of political attack documents, this one is remarkably good. In recent months the People’s Vote campaign has started devoting more of its time to highlighting the flaws with alternative Brexit plans, on the grounds that people will only back a second referendum when the alternatives have been shown to be unsatisfactory. The campaign is well funded, and the briefing material is produces is currently of a much higher quality than anything journalists get from either the Conservatives or Labour.)Here is an extract from Jeremy Corbyn’s letter to Theresa May, setting out Labour’s five demands for Brexit.Labour has long argued that the government should change its negotiating red lines and seek significant changes to the political declaration to provide clarity on our future relationship and deliver a closer economic relationship with the EU. That would also ensure that any backstop would be far less likely to be invoked.The changes we would need to see include:We believe these negotiating objectives need to be enshrined in law before the UK leaves the EU to provide certainty for businesses and a clear framework for our future relationship.We recognise that any negotiation with the EU will require flexibility and compromise. Our first priority must be a deal that is best for jobs, living standards, our communities, in the context of increased and more equitable investment across all regions and nations of the UK. That approach should guide how alignment with EU regulations is to be maintained in future, as well discussions on dispute resolution, the role of the ECJ, and competition and migration rules.Theresa May is in Brussels today for her first face-to-face talks with EU leaders since her Brexit deal was comprehensively rejected by MPs. As my colleague Heather Stewart reports in a handy scene-setter, May does not have a firm alternative plan to propose, suggesting that her meetings might achieve little.But this morning there is an alternative plan B on the table. As the  reports, Jeremy Corbyn has written to May setting out five changes to the Brexit plan that could lead to Labour MPs backing it in the Commons. Labour used to have six tests for Brexit, which seemed drafted in such a way that the PM’s plan was always bound to fail. These new conditions are different, because they read like the outline of something that could eventually pass the Commons. Indeed, during PMQs yesterday, after listening to May’s pro-European deputy David Lidington and the shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, Ken Clarke told the House that he got the impression that if the two of them were left in a room together “they would take about five minutes to agree a proposal that would take us smoothly through 29 March into proper negotiations.”Here is the Corbyn letter. And a more readable version of the full text is here.Corbyn’s letter is addressed to the PM. But it will be read closely in Brussels and, as Politico Europe’s Jack Blanchard points out in his London Playbook briefing,it has the potential to change the dynamics around May’s talks. Blanchard says:The PM’s whole message to the EU, remember, is that there’s no way to get the Brexit deal through parliament without reopening the withdrawal agreement and rewriting the backstop. As of today, that is no longer true. Juncker and co. can politely suggest she go back home and cut a deal with the opposition if she wants to get this thing done. One Labour source confirmed last night: “This is as much a letter for the EU as it is for Theresa May.”But Labour pro-Europeans, who were hoping that after failing to trigger a general election through a confidence vote, the party would be campaigning and voting for a second referendum, not offering to facilitate Brexit, have reacted angrily to Corbyn’s move.These are from Chuka Umunna, one of the leading Labour supporters of the People’s Vote campaign.This is from Owen Smith, who challenged Corbyn unsuccessfully for the Labour leadership in 2016, partly fighting on the grounds that Labour should be open to a second referendum.This is from David Lammy.And this is from Chris Leslie, who was shadow chancellor for a short period after the 2015 election.Here is the agenda for the day.9.30am: Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, takes questions in the Commons.9.30am: Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury, and Nick Timothy, Theresa May’s former chief of staff, take part in a debate on the future of the Conservative party at the Resolution Foundation.10am (UK time): Theresa May meets Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, in Brussels. At 1pm she will meet Antonio Tajani, president of the European parliament, and Guy Verhofstadt, the parliment’s lead Brexit spokesman. And at 2pm she will meet Donald Tusk, the president of the European council.10.30am: Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, makes a Commons statement about next week’s Commons business.As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, but I expect to be focusing mostly on Brexit.

While being told to discuss the possible misuse of images, words and videos online with their children, the recommendations ask adults to curb their own oversharing.“Parents and carers should never assume that children are happy for their photos to be shared,” the recommendations said. “For everyone – when in doubt, don’t upload!”The guidelines come days after a report by the Commons science and technology select committee flagged a lack of high-quality research into the effects of screen time on young people, including studies that explored the impact of particular uses of screens.A commentary by the chief medical officers that accompanies the guidelines also stressed that more research was needed.However, the officers said immediate action to safeguard young people is necessary by the government, social media platforms and technology companies. Among their suggestions are that the latter sign up to a voluntary code of conduct to protect children online, before the possible introduction of new laws.Further recommendations echo those of the committee, including calls for tech companies to share anonymised data to aid research. The officers also said those who sell technology should make sure consumers are aware of child security features and shown how to use them.Andy Burrows, the associate head of child safety online at the NSPCC, agreed urgent action is necessary.“For over a decade, tech giants have failed to protect their young users, and we can’t waste any more time waiting for them to clean up their act,” he said.“We urge the government to legislate without delay, to make social networks accountable and punish them if they fail to keep children safe.”Dr Bob Patton, a lecturer in clinical psychology at the University of Surrey, said it is impossible at present to break screen time down into “good” and “bad”, since it is highly dependent on content and context.“Idly flicking through a social media site is not the same as doing research for a project or homework – clearly those are very different activities – but at the moment, they have all got lumped together into a general ‘how much time do you spend on the screen’,” he said.The advice for parents and carers includes:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24a994391f29b2e7afeeb84277ee5616b49c921b/1232_1139_4768_2861/master/4768.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f19e7a5c29f5f444060c0214652be0d9","title":"control life alexa role public service chatbots councils","story":"Councils, the police and Whitehall are using virtual assistants for new tasks, from supporting disabled people to queries about school menus Every few hours, Alexa, Amazon’s voice-activated virtual assistant, helps Scott Walker stay well. Walker’s cerebral palsy means he has poor coordination and movement, but since last spring Alexa has reminded him to take his medication, as well as automating other tasks around his home.Previously, Walker, who works at Next, used light from his television to get into bed, but can now turn the room lights on and off with his voice. “I haven’t fallen since I’ve had this machine,” he says. “It’s feeling you are in control of your life. My father doesn’t have to worry I am taking my pills at the right time.”An estimated five million UK households have a device that runs either Alexa or Google’s equivalent, according to the research firm Enders Analysis. While most people use chatbots – software that recognises spoken or written natural language and responds in kind – to play music or get answers to questions, there’s increasing interest in people using them to take greater control of their lives. “It could stop a partner becoming a carer,” Walker points out. Walker’s speaker, provided as part of a pilot run by Hampshire county council for 50 recipients of adult social care, does not replace regular visits from care workers to help with physical movement, but means he can do more for himself. Many social care visits are brief calls to check on whether, for instance, someone has taken their pills. If chatbots can replace some of these shorter visits, it could mean care workers being able to spend longer on more useful visits.Graham Allen, Hampshire’s director of adult health and care, says almost three quarters of those in the pilot felt the device helped improve their lives and almost as many felt it had improved their independence, with numbers fairly consistent across different ages. “It’s not a cure-all,” he says. “It needs to be used along with other measures.” But he can see potential for many care service users living at home, and the county’s children’s social services department has just started issuing similar devices.A number of public sector organisations have introduced chatbots, so far mainly to provide information and enable people to report problems. The politan police  is reported to be developing ways for people to report crime via voice-activated systems. School menus in Hampshire are all  online and Amazon’s Alexa can answer questions about them. from parents and children. The Cabinet Office’s government digital service has taken a similar approach with the gov.uk website, so voice-activated speakers can get answers to detailed questions on, for example, the minimum wage for 17-year-olds.Some organisations have gone further. In June 2017, Transport for London launched a text chatbot that uses Facebook Messenger. “It’s useful for people, particularly in their early 20s and 30s, who are more used to the conversational style of messaging platforms,” says Ben Gammon, head of digital services.The TfL chatbot helped more than 29,800 users with travel queries in the last three months of 2018, is available all the time and provides up-to-date, consistent information, says Gammon. “Customers who have simple questions can get an answer while on the go more easily rather than having to search online or call our customer services line.”Aylesbury Vale district council, which runs both text and voice-based chatbot services to deal with a wide range of queries, uses staff to check most queries and, if necessary, edit software-generated responses. The software does provide automatic answers for a handful of the most common queries, but a member of staff still monitors this work and responses are marked as being from an automated system. “ It is important to be transparent,” says Maryvonne Hassall, the council’s digital strategy manager. Last spring, the London borough of Waltham Forest introduced its Walt environmental reporting chatbot, accessible through Messenger and direct messages to a Twitter account @WFTellWalt. It accepts reports on problems such as fly-tipping by asking a short series of questions, with smartphone users able to pass on their locations and pictures of problems. Reports are passed on to the council’s contractors, and people are notified when a problem is solved – something the council says users appreciate. But building chatbot services is expensive for councils, particularly as they are unlikely to be used as much as other channels: three fifths of reports in Waltham Forest come from a standard website form, for instance, with only one fifth arriving through Facebook and Twitter and the rest by phone.Rocco Labellarte, Oxford city council’s chief technology and information officer, says building chatbots is not something councils can do on their own. The city is leading a group of 12 English councils with central government funding to collaborate on developing text and voice chatbots. When Oxford explored voice services, it realised it could afford to build only a couple – a drop in the ocean compared with the hundreds of services most councils provide. If the collaboration’s initial assessment phase justifies further funding, the group hopes to develop text and voice chat services for adoption by more councils. Labellarte led the introduction of the Amelia chatbot service at the London borough of Enfield, which handles queries and requests for permits and authenticates licences. He says that, despite initial set-up costs, chatbots will save councils money by automating the task of answering queries. Labellarte says this could enable people to move to more complex work, where demand is increasing, but there are fears that automation could lead to staff losses and Mariarosaria Taddeo, research fellow at Oxford University’s internet institute and deputy director of its digital ethics lab, believes public services need to exercise care when introducing chatbots. This includes making it clear when bots are in use: “It’s important that users realise there is a machine on the other side,” she says. It also means ensuring automated systems are fair. Many chatbot systems rely on machine learning and there is growing concern about built-in bias. Automated systems can make organisations more efficient – but they must be supervised by real people, says Taddeo.  In Aylesbury Vale, Hassall says chatbots can provide a better service when it comes to factual questions, because they give a consistent response. But she adds that real people should continue to deal with complex queries and anything that requires compassion, such as the result of medical tests. “You need people to engage with people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83c0013f70c80a38a9cea699b656cf7508c3c162/0_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e47595ec602f5f26c3ea1cb706549ee7","title":"british skier james woods wins first world title slopestyle","story":"Great Britain’s James Woods has been crowned world champion for the first time after winning the men’s ski slopestyle competition in Utah.The 27-year-old defied difficult weather conditions to edge out Norwegian teenager Birk Ruud and US double Olympic medallist Nick Goepper.Woods said: “It feels good.

Surprisingly, given that until recently women weren’t even allowed to watch sporting events in Saudi Arabia, there is even talk of a women’s tournament being held in the kingdom. (Insert your joke about the country finally welcoming female drivers here.)“The old story of Saudi Arabia that it’s segregated is no longer applicable,” Majed Al-Sorour, CEO of the Saudi Golf Federation, said last week.Would I have wanted to play there during my days on the professional tour? The answer is almost certainly “no” and I am sure many of my fellow female professionals would have felt the same. How comfortable would we be in a country where women and girls aren’t allowed to swim in public, play sports in public schools or have prolonged interaction with men they aren’t related to?And can you imagine what the reaction would be to a female golfer had she destroyed greens in anger in the same manner that Sergio Garcia did? By all accounts, it’s safe to assume she would have been treated differently, seeing as wearing a mini-skirt can get you arrested and speaking up can end in torture. And, of course, any gay players would be competing in a country where homosexual acts are punishable by death. That’s before we get into the other red flags, such as the death of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi Arabian journalist killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October, and the country’s involvement in the civil war in Yemen.The inaugural men’s tournament, funded by the Saudi government to help promote the country, teed off last week, and few of the professionals seemed bothered. Paul Casey stayed away, to his credit, as did Tiger Woods, although he spent his time golfing with Donald Trump, which is almost as dubious. Journalists, including the ’s Marina Hyde and Ewan Murray, voiced their disapproval and the European Tour was forced to defend its decision to hold a tournament in the nation, arguing that the Middle East is one of the few regions that has the climate needed to play during the Northern Hemisphere winter.But the golfers who agreed to play after receiving a hefty appearance fee? Well, according to them, golfers gotta golf. World No 1 Justin Rose said, “I’m not a politician, I’m a golfer,” while Dustin Johnson, known for his intellect and depth added, “I’m going over there to play a sport I’m paid to play. It’s my job to play golf.” And, presumably, to help sportswash a country where journalists end up dismembered in consulates.Other golfers who made the trip included Garcia, Patrick Reed, Bryson DeChambeau, Lee Westwood, Ian Poulter and Henrik Stenson. They are all multimillionaires, meaning there were no pressing financial reasons for them to play in the tournament. One could argue that there are ranking points at stake. However, there are plenty of other tournaments they could play that would undoubtedly make up any shortfall.Nothing justifies holding or playing an event in Saudi Arabia, no matter how much financial trouble the European Tour is in, or whatever duty or these golfers felt they had to “play golf”, as Johnson put it.As for the networks that aired the tournament, they are just as culpable, along with publications that covered the event extensively. It deserved zero meaningful coverage, expect to highlight how problematic it is to normalize a country where women’s rights activists are beaten and tortured. The only type of coverage an event like this should receive is to call out every single person who played in it, every corporation that sponsored it, and the European Tour for bowing to the Saudi government in the same manner the US government did after the death of Khashoggi.This European Tour’s dalliance with Saudi Arabia only highlights how far the sport has to go to stand for something more than the accumulation of cash. Instead, they abandoned one of the principles of golf: the importance of personal accountability."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d9a072c7025b7d3ab9d4d0924fd5e3e03de4743/0_5_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff4bf8974bfe7b3e15900c30138fde67","title":"england heaviest test defeats the 1981 fed cup and haneen zreika classic youtube","story":"This week’s roundup also features the worst Super Bowls, a points-fest of a Six Nations final day and golfers being good2) What an absolute screamer this was by Konstantinos Mavropanos for the Arsenal Under-23s. Well, probably. Possibly. Actually we have no idea.3) With England facing France in the Six Nations at the weekend, it’s worth going way, way, way back to, erm, 2015 and the extraordinary final day of that year’s tournament. A George North-inspired Wales handed Italy’s bottoms to them in a 61-20 hammering, taking top spot in the standings, but if Ireland could beat Scotland by 21 points they would usurp the Welsh. They did so with room to spare, running out 40-10 winners at Murrayfield and thus meaning England needed a 26-point victory over France. They gave it a fair dig, ultimately ‘only’ winning 55-35 and the Irish took the title. Still, 221 points over three matches isn’t bad.4) The New England Patriots won what has been widely regarded as one of the worst Super Bowls of all time last week – at 13-3, it was certainly the lowest scoring. However, the 2000 edition – enticingly billed as a clash of the two best defenses in the game – between the Baltimore Ravens and the New York Giants is in with a shout, while a thumping is never particularly edifying so the San Francisco 49ers’ 55-10 blowout against the Denver Broncos wasn’t a great watch. Then there was the previous low point for, erm, points, when Washington kept things tight by beating the Miami Dolphins 14-7 in 1973.5) Great Britain are playing in the Federation Cup this week: they’ve never won, but here’s the closest they came in 1981, one of four times they were runners-up, when Chris Evert beat Sue Barker. Perhaps we’ll never know whether or not Barker was distracted by the future prospect of having to work with Phil Tufnell and Matt Dawson every week.6) Enjoy Patrick van Aanholt and Andy van der Meyde discussing what it’s like working with Sam Allardyce.

The pairing of Danny Dyer and Martin Freeman in The Dumb Waiter (1957) guarantees a pre-sold hit. But it is Jamie Lloyd’s production of a lesser-known radio play, A Slight Ache (1959), with John Heffernan and Gemma Whelan from Game of Thrones, that provides a genuine shock and surprise.The Dumb Waiter is a classic study of two gunmen nervously awaiting instructions in the bleak basement of a Birmingham restaurant. It owes much to Hemingway’s The Killers and anticipates Martin McDonagh’s movie In Bruges. At the same time, it combines the staccato rhythms of music-hall cross-talk with a political study of power and victimisation. Gus, an anxious hitman, asks endless questions while the senior partner, Ben, obeys orders. In Lloyd’s production, even the dumb waiter comes crashing down with the force of a guillotine.But the play is also a joy for actors. Past pairings have included Lee Evans and Jason Isaacs, and Kenneth Cranham and Colin Blakely. The current duo are a match for their predecessors. Freeman avoids the temptation to make the fretful Gus overtly comic: instead he gives us a dapper organisation man, aware that something is not quite right. Dyer, with his looming physique, is the perfect epitome of fake assurance as he rubs his sweaty palms on his thighs. The beauty of this production is that it shows both men are aware that they are part of a hierarchy of terror.If A Slight Ache comes as more of a revelation, it is because of Lloyd’s radical staging. He openly acknowledges this is a radio play and has Heffernan and Whelan initially sitting at microphones as they play a comfortably middle-class couple, Edward and Flora, having a mild spat over the breakfast table. But the action hinges on the intrusion into their lives of an old match-seller who exposes the precariousness not just of their marriage but of their whole existence.On stage, the match-seller is normally a visible presence: sweaty, decrepit and balaclava-helmeted. Lloyd, however, follows the conventions of radio drama and leaves him to our imaginations. As a result, it becomes a play about two people projecting their deepest fears and desires on to a fantasy figure. Heffernan’s Edward moves from a breezily comic attempt to co-opt the unseen match-seller into his own world (“I was in commerce too”) into revelations of panic and insecurity. Whelan is equally remarkable. She adopts a cut-class accent that gradually yields to a disclosure of her unfulfilled longings: when she urges the match-seller, “Speak to me of love”, it is in the breathily urgent tone of a woman who, you infer, has long been denied the joys of sex.These two plays conclude a season that has itself been full of discoveries. It has reminded us that Pinter, while experimenting with form, had a unified imagination. It has also demolished the myth that one-act plays, like short stories, are an inferior form. In Pinter’s hands they are as richly fulfilling as many an inordinate three-hour epic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e716abc367f653c36a1afe0528d3dce1420cf188/0_117_2350_1410/master/2350.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86a86670b2e36f1e16102e411cb9fcf2","title":"disability campaigners give to new emojis for 2019","story":"Guide dogs, prosthetics and accessibility emojis welcomed by rights groupsFrom falafels to mischievous sloths, dozens of new emojis will bring greater ersity to messaging applications this year, as the organisation behind the symbols responds to a number of campaigns.The introduction of image-based characters such as hearing aids, wheelchairs, prosthetic limbs and guide dogs will help redress the underrepresentation of disabled people on the emoji keyboard, while there will also be a wider range of mixed-gender and ethnicity couples for users to choose from.Disability rights campaigners welcomed the new accessibility-themed icons. “Love them or hate them – emojis have become part of our everyday digital lives,” said Phil Talbot, the head of communications at disability equality charity Scope. “Social media is hugely influential and it’s great to see these new disability-inclusive emojis. Up to now disability has been greatly underrepresented.”Following a campaign by a girls’ rights charity to introduce a period-themed emoji, a new ‘drop of blood’ icon is also being introduced.“The inclusion of an emoji which can express what 800 million women around the world are experiencing every month is a huge step towards normalising periods and smashing the stigma which surrounds them,” said Lucy Russell, the head of girls’ rights and youth at Plan International UK. “An emoji isn’t going to solve this, but it can help change the conversation. Ending the shame around periods begins with talking about it.”Spanning a number of other items that were previously omitted, the 59 newly approved images are expected to be released in the second half of 2019.The perceived ambiguity of one of the new emojis sparked a debate on social media. It is believed that a pinching hand gesture reported to indicate a person’s penis size could be useful for rebuffing “unsolicited dick pics”.Yawning faces, raccoons, a pot containing the South American drink maté, and waffles were among other new emojis that are potentially less open to interpretation.Last year, the highly anticipated addition of emojis depicting cartoon people with ginger hair dominated the headlines, following the annual series of additions from the Unicode Consortium, the body which maintains and regulates the library of characters."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/538d43627198d0539941584f404163bbe4bd630b/0_0_4446_2668/master/4446.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a7f448a8e7af7ce27175bfcbc4c949b","title":"back up bookmarks google","story":"Jenifer wants a backup while EC wants a replacement for Google+, which is shutting downI have a lot of bookmarked sites for medieval manuscripts on my laptop, which it took a long time to collect. How can I back them up in case the laptop dies? JeniferAs you know, Google is closing Google+ in April. I currently use the site as my online bookmarking tool. Can you suggest something that is easy to use both online and on mobile? ECFirst things first, Jenifer. You should have a backup of your whole hard drive in case your laptop dies. Your operating system almost certainly includes usable backup software. Otherwise, there are more than 30 free third-party alternatives for Windows including BackUp Maker, AOMEI Backupper Standard and EaseUS Todo Backup Free.Fortunately, almost all browsers let you save bookmarks into a single file in the web’s HTML format. Double-clicking this file will load it in a tab in your default browser, where you will be able to click the links to your heart’s content. In fact, some people find that having their bookmarks as a local webpage is handier than folders of bookmarks. The drawback? The saved document isn’t updated when you add a new bookmark.In a well-designed browser such as Vivaldi, you can go to the File menu and simply select “Export Bookmarks …” to create a backup file. Opera is almost as good – you select Bookmarks then “Export Bookmarks …” – but most browsers now make it more complicated.In Firefox, for example, you have to use the obscure Library button, or press Ctrl-Shift-B (for Bookmarks), then click the drop-down menu item for “Import and Backup”. In Google Chrome, you can press Ctrl-Shift-O (for Obscure, I assume) to load the bookmark manager or, like me, type chrome:bookmarks in the address bar and hit enter. After that, click the three dots in the blue Bookmarks bar and select “Export bookmarks”.In Microsoft Edge, click the three dots for Settings, or press Alt-X, then the “Import from another browser” button. The export routine has been cunningly hidden behind the import routine.Once you have saved a file called Vivaldi_Bookmarks-20190207.html or something similar, you can stow it somewhere safe. The options include an external hard drive, a USB memory stick, an SD card and so on. You should also load the file – drag and drop usually works – into one or more of your free online storage spaces such as Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive, Apple iCloud, Dropbox or whatever you prefer. Once the file is online, you can access it from other PCs, smartphones, tablets and other devices.You can even store your bookmarks in a Microsoft Word document, which will preserve any layout and provide Ctrl-clickable links. I do this by loading the HTML file into a browser, saving it as an MHTML or MHT file, loading that into Word and then saving it as Word file (eg as a doc, docx, rtf file, etc). Internet Explorer can save files in the standard MHTML format. Chromium-based browsers such as Google Chrome, Vivaldi and Opera can also save MHTML files if you edit the settings (chrome:flags or vivaldi:flags or opera:flags etc). Alternatively, add a browser extension such as SingleFile, which works in both Firefox and Chrome. (MHTML usefully encapsulates whole web pages in a single file, without creating a subdirectory to hold loads of separate js, css and other files.)Browsers generally use folders and subfolders to manage bookmarks. Many of them including Chrome, Firefox, Vivaldi and Edge also have synchronisation systems built in to sync bookmarks across different devices, which can be used to restore them onto replacement computers should the worst happen. However, folders can become unwieldy when you have hundreds or thousands of bookmarks, which is where bookmark managers come in.Bookmark managers generally allow you to add tags, notes and comments. Tags are useful because you can give each link multiple tags, which is like putting them in multiple folders.Bookmark managers should also provide an extension or bookmarklet so that you can bookmark sites from your browser, without going to the bookmark manager’s website.Google has one of the simplest bookmark managers, which is deservedly obscure, but could suit some users. Apple’s iCloud Bookmarks is rather better, and works in several different browsers – Safari, Firefox, Chrome, IE but not Edge – on many different devices.I have not used many bookmark managers or checked for online apps, so you’ll have to try a few to find something you like. The options include start.me, Bookmark Ninja, Dropmark, Raindrop.io, Bookmax, Atavi and, for Chrome only, Booky. Sadly, two of the most popular sites in this category – Delicious and Xmarks – have closed down.There’s also the excellent Pinboard, which now costs $11 a year. Pinboard is run by its founder, Maciej Cegłowski, who bought the remains of Delicious.  Technology used Pinboard for a few years for linkbucket blog posts.Pocket – which is incorporated into Firefox but available for Chrome – would work as a bookmark manager, but is generally used for saving pages to read later. Instapaper does much the same thing.Most researchers who need Zotero will already know about it, though it could well suit someone who likes medieval manuscripts.Otherwise, people who habitually use Microsoft OneNote or Evernote will know they can work really well as bookmark managers, as well as storing web clippings, photos, documents and many other things.Bookmarks graduated from being personal directories to shared resources on sites such as Delicious. This gave rise to social bookmarking and, from 2005-07, a boom in folksonomy or collaborative tagging. In other words, lots of different people adding tags to public links. Delicious was the archetypal example of the genre. Lots of us loved it.Folksonomy was replaced by #hashtagging. This is exactly the same thing, except that hashtags can be applied to anything, not just bookmarks. The main hashtagging sites include Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. But they are social networking sites, not bookmark managers.I would not have suggested Google+ as a bookmarking site, but perhaps its failure as a social network helped make it viable for that purpose. You could replace it with Bookmax (where free accounts are limited to 1,000 links) or Raindrop.io, but Pinterest might be the best alternative.The basic idea of Pinterest is to create public displays, but you can have any number of “secret boards”. These are private by default, though you can share them with selected people. You could create a separate board for each set of bookmarks to cover news, movies, music etc.Either way, you should download your data from Google+ before it closes on 2 April. The download page lets you select posts from your page and Google+ Communities in HTML format, plus contacts from your Circles. These are in vCard format by default, but you can select CSV, HTML or JSON instead. It doesn’t matter because you only get their name, nickname (if any) and their doomed G+ address. You don’t get their email addresses, phone numbers, job titles or anything else that might be useful.You can have your takeout data sent to Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox or Box, or download it from an emailed link.

Young readers reveal why they adore it – from the sarcasm to the timeless love stories ... and Fat MonicaA new survey into teenage media habits done by Childwise shows that the New York-based comedy is the favourite TV show of viewers aged five to 16 in the UK. It’s a remarkable statistic, given that the majority of those surveyed would not even have been born when the series ended in 2004. We asked you to tell us why you love Friends. Here’s what some of you said:It gives us all hope that everything will work out. In real life, friendships don’t happen like they do in Friends and neither do relationships, but I think everyone who watches it wishes they did. I also think people love the idea of always having someone to talk to and share things with.My favourite character is Chandler. I think he is underplayed: many people like Joey and Phoebe because they are seen to get all the best lines, but Chandler has a different type of humour – one that I appreciate! His relationship with Monica is perfect, too, and they balance each other out.My favourite episode has to be The One with Five Steaks and an Eggplant. It’s a bit of an odd choice as the gang are at ends with each other, but I love how they do everything they can to work things out. This is really rare nowadays, when a tiny disagreement can end friendships. Molly, 15, HertfordshireI watch Friends almost every day and when I finish the 10th season I rewatch it. I find out a lot of things about life from the show. I like being treated like an adult when I hear people talking about it and I can join in. I have only been allowed to watch it since May as I’m nearly 12.I don’t have a favourite character – I have a list. My top favourite is Fat Monica. Second is Rachel and third is Chandler. Chandler is funny because he’s sarcastic and I like sarcasm.I like all the flashback episodes, but my favourite is where Rachel and Monica watch the Thanksgiving tape and see Ross about to take Rachel to prom. Leah, 11, EnfieldFriends is relatable to nearly every person, as well as being funny. It involves scenarios people my age are starting to go through, but instead of taking them seriously, it manages to make a joke of every single one. It’s based on everyday lives, and most people can relate to one of the characters. My favourite character? That’s a tough one. I’d have to go with Phoebe, because of how she deals with everything that comes her way. She gets herself into situations that are just hilarious.There are too many good episodes to choose from, however one of the best would be The One with Chandler and Monica’s Wedding: Part 2, when Rachel’s pregnancy is revealed to Monica and Phoebe. When Phoebe finds the pregnancy test she assumes it is Monica’s. When Phoebe realises that it is in fact Rachel’s, instead of revealing it, she says she is the one who is pregnant with James Brolin’s child and that she needs to call and let him know! Sam, 16, LeicesterI love Friends because it’s one of the first series (in another language) I ever watched. When I watch episodes again, it’s like going back to my comfort zone.If I had to choose a favourite episode it would be the one when Phoebe and Ross discover that Monica and Chandler have been going out. It’s SO funny … but I think I watched it too many times. Sol, 16, Rosario, ArgentinaFriends has surprisingly been a conservation-starter with a few of my friends. It’s like the glue that sticks us together. Plus, the show stands as the epitome of how friendship should be. Whenever I watch Friends, I fantasise about a friendship circle I would like to have. The silly jokes and the awkwardness between the characters are bonuses.My stand-out character is Phoebe because she is silly but smart and knowledgeable. For a person who you might think would have anger bottled up, she seems pretty calm. She takes control of her own life and she is not abashed about what she does and what she thinks. Hal, 17, IndiaFriends handles issues such as orce, unemployment and unrequited love in an excellently comedic way. It perfectly captures sibling rivalry between Ross and Monica that is surprisingly relatable. It looks at the difference of class and intellect between the friends and you get to know each one personally until you realise there is more to them than meets the eye.My favourite character has to be Chandler. His witty lines, physical comedy and mannerisms just turn him into a super lovable character. Also he’s kinda fit (good looking)! I think everyone has parts of all the characters in them, no matter how much you try not to. (Ross is my least favourite character. He’s so ANNOYING).All the episodes are really funny! If I had to choose a favourite, it would either be the one where Chandler hooks up with one of Joey’s sisters but can’t remember which one, or (spoiler alert) the one where Ross and Rachel finally start dating.

Why did the powerhouse that was black TV drama lose its way? We speak to its trailblazers‘We’re guests here, always on our best behaviour, never at ease. No wonder so many of us go round the twist.” So says Don Warrington in Carbon Copy, a television play first broadcast in 1975. Warrington’s character, Albert, is the son of Jamaican immigrants and is reassessing his place in “the mother country” after a recent awakening of his black identity. Had he been able to see four decades into the future, Albert would doubtless feel even less at ease.Last year’s shaming Windrush scandal, in which British nationals of African-Caribbean heritage were targeted for deportation by the Home Office, demonstrates how some in the UK are still determined to treat black people as “guests”. But Albert might also be depressed at the state of British television 40 years on: how little it built on pioneering dramas like Carbon Copy, and how little is even remembered of them.The title of the British Film Institute’s current season, Forgotten Black TV Drama, is no exaggeration. Most of the titles it gathers together have not been seen by the public since they were first broadcast. Between them they tell a story that is in many ways all too familiar, but in others surprising, perceptive and eerily prescient. In another forgotten drama, 1973’s The Museum Attendant, a black character declares “hating immigrants is the only thing that draws English people together”.It is often assumed that US cinema and television blazed the trail when it came to representation of black people on screen, but British television was ahead of both, argues Stephen Bourne, co-curator of the BFI season. The BBC soap Compact, which began in 1962, had a black magazine photographer, played by Horace James, as a recurring character. ITV hospital drama Emergency – Ward 10 regularly featured a black doctor, played by Joan Hooley, who embarked on a relationship with a white man – including a then-controversial interracial kiss. This was in 1964, four years before Lt Uhura and Captain Kirk kissed in Star Trek. And it wasn’t even the first such kiss on British TV (that was in the Armchair Theatre play Hot Summer Night, in 1959).Interracial relationships figure in the forgotten dramas of the BFI season, but they are by no means the sole preoccupation. The works of Jamaican-born writer Barry Reckord, for instance, are about class isions as much as racial ones. In 1962’s You in Your Small Corner, an educated young black man (played by Reckord’s brother, Lloyd) begins a love affair with a working-class white woman. And in Reckord’s Club Havana, from 1975, Warrington comes from Jamaica to his mother’s Birmingham nightclub and begins an affair with the barmaid, played by a young Julie Walters. His mother dismisses Walters as a “cheap white woman” – not good enough for her son.In Carbon Copy, too, Albert mingles with the white middle classes. His mother is a wealthy first-generation immigrant. “In England, people don’t look down on a person for being black,” she tells him. “They look down on him for being uncultured.”After rediscovering his “blackness”, Albert falls for a British-born black woman, played by Cleo Sylvestre, who is not quite as rapturous about their mystical “African” bond as he is. Nor is she into isive race politics, favouring class solidarity. “We’ve got to separate to keep our identity,” Albert tells her. “No,” she replies, “we’ve got to get together with people who’ve been screwed just like we are.”“Why should we assume that all black people that came to Britain after the second world war were working class?” says Bourne, who has researched and written about black British history and culture for 20 years. “There have been middle-class, affluent black people coming to this country since the year dot. It’s just one of those myths that needs to be addressed.”Reckord came from a well-to-do Jamaican family. He earned a scholarship to Cambridge University in 1950 (brother Lloyd joined him in the UK a year later). Between them the Reckord brothers staged and performed some of the first black British works to be performed – several of which were adapted for television.There was also Guyana-born Jan Carew and his Jamaican wife Sylvia Wynter, who spent a few fruitful years in Britain in the 1950s. Their work seems to have found sympathetic ears – on radio, then on the small screen. In 1961, ITV filmed two of Carew’s plays: The Big Pride (co-written with Wynter) and The Day of the Fox. Both are set in the Caribbean but British immigrants would readily identify with their examinations of postcolonial politics and identity. Somewhat incongruously, The Day of the Fox is led by Sammy Davis Jr - who had just made Ocean’s 11 the year before. The fact that he had to come from Hollywood to British TV to make anything vaguely “political” tells its own story.It is difficult to resist the temptation to describe this as a golden age – even if it was only a few enlightened commissioners allowing the occasional black production through the gates. By the 1980s, though, the quality black drama had somehow dried up. Bourne cites Enoch Powell’s infamous Rivers of Blood speech, in 1968, as a turning point. “After that all the good work we’d done before was erased and forgotten.”Sylvestre agrees. Before her part in Carbon Copy, she became one of the first black soap characters: Melanie in Crossroads, who turns up at the motel and announces she is the adopted daughter of the manager, Meg Richardson.According to Sylvestre, the producer Reg Watson cast her in response to Powell’s speech and the rise in racial tensions around Birmingham, where the show was set. “He wanted to show a young, black character who wasn’t defined by her colour,” says Sylvestre. “It was a very bold move at that time. In fact, I used to get people coming up to me in the street who I’m sure would have agreed with Enoch Powell who’d say, ‘Oh, I love your character.’”For the most part, comedy became the preferred medium for broaching British ersity. Warrington went on to star in one of the better offerings: Rising Damp. His character Philip, who claimed to be an African prince but was actually from Croydon, was often the subject of landlord Rigsby’s animosity. Far less sophisticated was Love Thy Neighbour, which wrung crude, cringeworthy racial humour out of a black couple and a white couple living next door to each other. The white husband routinely referred to his black counterpart (Rudolph Walker) as “nig-nog” or “sambo”.That shift from drama to comedy is clearly visible in the work of writer Trix Worrell, best known as the creator of the hit 1990s sitcom Desmond’s. Originally a theatre director, Worrell made his TV debut in 1984, after he won a scriptwriting competition held by the recently launched Channel 4.His play, Just Like Mohicans – also part of the BFI’s season – was adapted into a 40-minute TV drama. It is virtually a two-hander: an encounter between an elderly Jamaican widow and a hip-hop-savvy black teenager (future EastEnders regular Gary Beadle) who breaks into her house to burgle her. The relationship steadily morphs from victim-criminal to mother-son, and the play becomes an angry clash of generational values.It was heavily autobiographical, acknowledges Worrell, who was born in St Lucia and moved to London as a child in the mid-60s. “Our parents bought into that whole empire, British thing and wanted to better us and better themselves. But we were on the street. We had to suffer the slings and arrows. We were the kids that suffered Sus” – “suspected person” laws, a 1980s precursor to stop and search. “We were walking home from school and being spat at and called all sorts of crap – and that’s just by the police. Shit happened all the time. So you start to go, what the hell are we here for?”The only positive representation Worrell remembers growing up was Carmen Munroe as a nurse on ITV soap General Hospital (he later cast her in Desmond’s). But they still watched Love Thy Neighbour, he says. “We watched it because there we were. We could see ourselves on screen, and that was a thrill in and of itself.” There was also the newsreader Trevor McDonald, Worrell adds. “So it went from the sublime to the ridiculous: Trevor reading the News at 10 and Rudy Walker being called a ‘nig-nog’ in the same evening.”Desmond’s was arguably the first mainstream series to simply accept black Britons as characters in their own right, and it was a huge hit. “I’ve always said you can sell more in comedy than you can in drama,” says Worrell. “You can be more hard-hitting. You can bash them over the head and make them laugh at the same time.”Times have moved on and representation has improved immensely on British television but looking back at the passionate, angry, questioning dramas of the 1960s and 70s, something has been lost. Subsequent generations seem to have had less of a platform to engage with these issues seriously – at least on the small screen.New black British talent is more likely to thrive in the US than at home, looking at the experience of actors such as Idris Elba, Thandie Newton, Daniel Kaluuya, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and John Boyega. The continuity has been broken. The contributions of these black dramatists and performers is in danger of being erased, from history and from the archives. It is never too late to start remembering."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9bb7caff362af4cb96195c6848c5ed7aaea3dd8/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=811fe9d5de7f84bb9ab8d4ff1f20cb9c","title":"tell us about the issues men face today","story":"From mental health to relationships, we’d like to hear from men of all ages about what they are really thinkingThe debate around modern-day masculinity has intensified in the wake of the #MeToo movement, and we are asking men to tell us what they are really thinking.As the role of men and women in society continue to change, so too do the dynamics from the workplace to the bedroom and everywhere in between.

Photograph: PAThe Border town of Newry is being considered as a location to dispose of the United Kingdom’s nuclear waste, with research identifying the area as potentially suitable for an underground disposal facility.It is one of five sites in Northern Ireland under consideration as possible stores for the waste and among 45 being examined across the UK as whole.An area of granite bedrock near Newry may be suitable for a geological disposal facility (GDF), according to a recent preliminary report by Radioactive Waste Management (RWM), a UK State-owned company.The area of rock stretches from Slieve Gullion to the Mourne mountains. Geological disposal sites hold radioactive waste hundreds of metres underground, and there are no current facilities in Northern Ireland.Future policy decisions on nuclear disposal in Northern Ireland rest with the Stormont executive, where power-sharing has been collapsed for more than two years. The British government’s current preference is that one facility would service the entire UK, a spokesman for RWM has said. Any future facility would need the support of the local community before it could be approved.Nuclear waste is stored at about 30 sites across Britain, but predominantly at ground level at the Sellafield reprocessing plant in Cumbria.Granite“There are granites and similar strong rocks around Newry, in which we may be able to site a GDF,” the recent RWM report said. “We would need to do more work to find out whether these rocks have suitable properties and thicknesses in the depth range of interest for a GDF.” Preliminary reports into other regions of Northern Ireland found a section of strong rock between Omagh and Cookstown, Co Tyrone, which might support a similar facility.A number of areas in the north of the country could also possibly be suitable, researchers found. These included one location between Belfast and Larne, areas around Coleraine, Co Derry, and Ballymoney and Ballycastle, in Co Antrim.On Monday, an emergency motion was passed at the Newry, Mourne and Down District Council, unanimously opposing locating any nuclear waste facility in the local area.Some 45 preliminary regional reports had been completed across the UK, assessing what locations might have suitable rock types to build a facility. The reports began a process that could take 10 to 15 years to identify a suitable area, gain the consent of a local community and build the facility, the RWM spokesman said. There was a “false narrative” that nuclear waste disposal facilities would be forced on communities, he said. The waste facility will contain multiple barriers to secure the radioactive material underground for hundreds of thousands of years. The British government has also promised communities hosting future facilities significant investment.Responding to the Newry report, Sinn Féin MP for South Down Chris Hazzard said Britain could not be allowed to use the North “as a dumping ground” for its hazardous and toxic waste. “Not only would this have dire consequences for our environment but it would also pose a serious health risk to the population,” he said.Fine Gael councillor for Dundalk, Co Louth, John McGahon said the initial report was likely nothing more than a “fishing expedition”.He said the probability of any plan being approved was “extremely remote”. It was important politicians on both sides of the Border were not “asleep on the issue,” but equally that local representatives did not engage in “scaremongering,” he said.

Photograph: Nick Bradshaw RoundShield Partners, a €1 billion property investment house, has signed a €50 million social housing deal with debt advisory firm New Beginnings.Under the terms of the deal, which are revealed in a letter seen by The , the Irish firm will purchase, refurbish and manage residential properties for RoundShield, which has “agreed to provide up to €50 million in financing for residential acquisition”. The properties purchased by RoundShield will be let to local authorities for use as social housing under leases of 25 years. New Beginnings is led by barrister and debt advisor Ross Maguire. It is understood that the first commitment of funds could be just the beginning for the RoundShield project in Ireland, with one source saying that there were “substantially” more resources potentially available for the project.“The fund has discretionary capital significantly in excess of the requirements related to the possible acquisitions,” according to the letter. Sources with knowledge of the matter said the RoundShield fund had already begun purchasing units and was on the hunt for more deals, including potential off-market transactions. In a statement, RoundShield chief financial officer Herbert Beckman confirmed that the firm, through its Irish social housing fund, was “acquiring residential properties to support Irish local authorities in the provision of social housing”.Substantial renovationHe said the fund was “concentrating on properties that need substantial renovation, or those being sold with social tenants remaining in situ”. The fund is being administered by Davy Stockbrokers, through a Central Bank structure known as an Irish collective asset-management vehicle.New Beginnings was founded in 2010 by Mr Maguire, a senior counsel, and David Hall, the debtors’ rights campaigner. However, the pair had a falling out and have now found themselves on opposite sides of the debate about mortgage debt and the role of private-equity funds in the Irish market. Since then, the firm has expanded to include in its work a range of commercial funding products, including bridging and mezzanine loans for values above €1 million. RoundShield Partners has raised more than €1.4 billion for a variety of investment platforms, but its focus is European asset-backed “special opportunities”. The fund was established in 2013 by three former executives from capital market company ESO Capital.Sources said the deal showed that social housing was becoming an increasingly attractive asset class for overseas investors. While investing in housing for low-income people may not offer the rapid climbs in asset value provided by grade-A offices or high-end residential developments, it allows investors to tap into regular, reliable and government-backed income streams.

Photograph: Nick BradshawThe strikes by nurses this week and last have lifted the lid on the massive risk that exists in the health service on a daily basis due to staff shortages, their trade union has said. As members of the Irish Nurses and Midwives (INMO) hold a third 24-hour strike over pay and staffing issues on Thursday, its general secretary Phil Ni Sheaghdha said all of a sudden HSE managers who due to the stoppages were working a 24-hour cycle were recognizing this risk. Asked whether the work stoppages were placing patients at risk, she said: “there is a massive risk in the health service in a daily basis due to staff shortages. What we are doing is highlighting the risk that exists every single day.”She said the INMO had made very stringent efforts to put in place emergency services that will continue. “We have been meeting the HSE continuously for the last three weeks. We have agreed many derogations. And in addition to that we link in with then every two hours. “She said the union was satisfied with the emergency services that were being provided during the days of strikes. “What we are not satisfied about us the level of care that exists on an ordinary day. We know that is high risk and does not provide a safe level of care for patients. That is why nurses and midwives are protesting and on strike.”Ms Ni Sheaghdha said the union had received no correspondence from Government about finding a resolution and she said her members remained “resolute”.40,000About 40,000 nurses who are INMO members are taking part in the strike today in a dispute over pay. About 50,000 patients are likely to be affected by the stoppage which will see all outpatient, inpatient and day surgery appointments scheduled for today cancelled. Minor injury units will be closed and routine community nursing services and health centre nurse clinics will also be cancelled. Thursday is the third in a series of eight 24-hour strikes planned by nurses over their pay claim and nurses are planning to strike for three days next week. Nurses also plan to strike on February 19th and 21st. They are seeking pay parity with other medical professionals which would equate to an approximately €7,000 pay rise per nurse, or a rise of around 12 per cent. The Government has said it will not offer additional payments to nurses, although it said on Monday it was willing to discuss staffing and other non-pay issues. Nursing unions have rejected the proposal. Separately, an overtime ban by psychiatric nurses has resulted in what the HSE describe as “significant challenges” in ensuring a safe service in mental health facilities Wednesday. This ban will continue throughout Thursday night. The HSE said it was “continuing to engage and negotiate with the PNA”. On Wednesday night, ambulance service staff said they would also go on strike next week. Up to 500 ambulance workers plan to strike for three more days in the weeks ahead as part of a dispute over trade union representation rights and the deduction of union subscriptions at source from their pay.The staff, who are members of the National Ambulance Service Representative Association (Nasra), will stage stoppages on Friday, February 15th Thursday, February 28th and Friday, March 1st.The action will run from 7am to 5 pm each day. Members of Nasra already staged a 10-hour work stoppage at the end of January.

In fact, not at all, according to Selmayr, after MPs from the Commons cross-party Brexit select committee suggested as much following a long meeting with him.At issue was whether the idea, which was certainly discussed, emanated from Selmayr or from the MPs. If the former, was he really suggesting that the commission, contrary to its repeated insistence, would be prepared to “reopen” the 585-page withdrawal agreement to include what has been described variously as an additional “codicil” or protocol?‘Unzipping’“I would term it unzipping,” he explained somewhat indelicately.Responding to press reports of the meeting, Selmayr tweeted a non-denial denial saying: “On the EU side, nobody is considering this.”He added: “Asked whether any assurance would help to get the withdrawal agreement through the Commons, the answers of MPs were ... inconclusive...”What Selmayr did make clear to the group, having emphasised that he, no more than they, was not a negotiator, was that the EU was unlikely to concede anything new without cast-iron guarantees from the UK that would swing the Commons behind them.Any premature offer, Brussels knows, could simply be pocketed by Brexiteers with an endless series of demands for yet more. We are not going there.Kinnock reported that “Selmayr’s question to the Brexiteers was: If we did that, would you vote it through? And they weren’t able to answer that question.”Tory Brexiteer MP Stephen Crabb acknowledged the secretary general was concerned that adding the legally-binding assurance would be worthless if offered to MPs.‘Legal protocol’Crabb told the Express: “We talked around the idea of the Tusk letter being written into some sort of legal protocol but everytime someone asked him if it is something he could do, he said first of all it’s not me negotiating and secondly let me turn around the question – if we were to do that would you be guaranteed to vote for the deal?”A commission spokeswoman on Tuesday described the account as the most accurate report of the meeting – probably the first time the Eurosceptic paper had ever been praised by the commission.In truth few believe that these assurances, even in legally-binding form, could provide Theresa May with anything like the swing votes for her deal that she needs. If this is indeed what she will be seeking in her visit here on Thursday.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe Juncker and Tusk letter of assurance was sent to the British prime minister last month to help clarify the EU understanding of the backstop, and specifically to respond to demands for a time limit or unilateral exit mechanism from it. But it made clear that the EU is not in a position to resile from or in any way undermine the obligations set out in the withdrawal agreement, specifically its Northern Ireland protocol.‘Facilitate the next steps’“As you know,” the letter says, “we are not in a position to agree to anything that changes or is inconsistent with the withdrawal agreement, but against this background, and in order to facilitate the next steps of the process, we are happy to confirm, on behalf of the two EU institutions we represent, our understanding . . . ”That understanding involves a joint view of the backstop as a malign necessity which can only be temporary “unless and until” it is replaced by an agreement on a future relationship which provides the sort of guarantees necessary to safeguard a frictionless border.The commission commits to entering negotiations and proceeding with them as expeditiously as possible with a view to ensuring that when the extendable transition period of two years comes to an end it will not be necessary to trigger the backstop.Why anyone should believe that a reiteration of that kind of assurance, whether or not in legally binding form, would help build a May majority is not clear.

He was speaking after talks with  Leo Varadkar in Brussels. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFigures from the Irish-American caucus on Capitol Hill said they would definitely speak out fi the Belfast Agreement was threatened.Britain’s hope of striking a trade deal with the United States after Brexit could be in jeopardy if the Belfast Agreement is compromised by Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union, senior US figures have warned.Speaking at an event in the United States Capitol building to mark the 100th anniversary of the Dáil, Republican congressman Peter King told an audience: “If the British want to consider any type of trade agreement with the United States it is important that the soft border is maintained.”He continued: “What influence we have, we will use it, in the Friends of Ireland” he said, referring to the Irish-American caucus on Capitol Hill. “We will definitely speak out.”His warning was echoed by Richard Neal, the Massachusetts congressman who was recently appointed chairman of the Ways and Means committee. The committee has sweeping powers over US trade policy, and would have ultimate oversight of any trade agreement signed between the United States and Britain after Brexit.Trade dealSpeaking at the event, which was hosted to honour Tánaiste Simon Coveney who is on a three-day visit to the United States, Mr Neal said that concerns about the Belfast Agreement would “weigh on his mind” as his committee considers a new trade deal between the United States and Britain.He said he has already outlined his concerns to the United States trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, although he ultimately wanted a trade deal between the US and United Kingdom.“I think that America is heavily invested in the success of the Good Friday Agreement and anything that might disturb the success that America offered certainly would not be welcomed, that’s for sure. I think there are few parts of American foreign policy that have worked as well as being an honest broker in the run-up to the Good Friday Agreement, so we take great satisfaction in what happened and undoing it for a problem that appears as though the British government got themselves into, I think would be a step backwards.”In addition to Mr Neal, two other Irish-Americans – Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania and New York congressman Brian Higgins – are members of the committee.Later, in a speech, Mr Neal commended the Irish Government for the stance it has taken in the Brexit negotiations. “The way that the Irish government has remained so firm on that border is so gratifying to us here,” he said, noting that all parties in Ireland and Northern Ireland except one were unified on the issue.“It is extraordinary that that border has been as successful as it has been and there might even be a debate about going back to checkpoints,” he said.Former congressman Bruce Morrison also warned Britain about the difficulties ahead in negotiating a trade agreement with the United States – a key priority for Brexiteers who have pointed to their ability to negotiate a future trade deal with the United States, and other non-EU countries, as a key economic benefit of leaving the EU customs union. The US is Britain’s main trading partner outside the EU bloc, and exports to the US are worth an estimated 100 billion pounds to the British economy each year.“I think the British have made a lot of assumptions about trade agreements with the US and with other countries and frankly, from a hard-headed economic standpoint, dealing with the EU is a lot more important than dealing with Britain, so I think they have an uphill slog on that,” Mr Morrison said. “They’ve been talking to themselves and not talking to others in thinking how great it’s going to be to be out of the European Union.”Face-to-face meetingThe intervention from Capitol Hill came hours after Mr Coveney held his first face-to-face meeting with US secretary of state Mike Pompeo at an event in the US State Department, at which the Minister for Foreign Affairs discussed the need to protect the peace process in the context of Brexit.But Mr Coveney stressed that Ireland was not asking the United States to “take sides” amid increasing concern among the Irish-American caucus on Capitol Hill about the implications of Brexit on the Belfast Agreement.“I made it very clear to him that we’re not asking the US to take sides – Ireland over the UK or UK over Ireland,” Mr Coveney said. “But we are asking people here to think about a peace process that they have been very much involved in creating and sustaining, and using influence to ensure that decisions that are taken in relation to Brexit don’t undermine that progress.”Nonetheless, he said that Mr Pompeo, as well as representatives of other nations attending the global coalition against Isis on Wednesday, had discussed Brexit. “Obviously there have been a lot of questions today from US voices, but also many of the other ministers who were here today for the conference, all asking the same questions – where is this going, how can we avoid a no deal Brexit.”Mr Coveney’s visit continues on Thursday with bilateral meetings with member of Congress about Brexit and its implications for the border with Northern Ireland.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Stefan RousseauPA Wire Europhile Labour MPs have rounded on their party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, after he offered to support Theresa May’s Brexit deal in exchange for significant concessions.Mr Corbyn wrote to the British prime minister on Wednesday evening, saying that Labour would support her agreement with the EU if the non-binding political declaration were changed towards a softer Brexit.“We recognise that any negotiation with the EU will require flexibility and compromise,” the opposition leader wrote.His five proposed changes include keeping the UK in a customs union with the EU, something that Mrs May has repeatedly refused to countenance because it would curtail the UK’s ability to sign trade deals. However, the tone of Mr Corbyn’s letter – and his willingness to accept the withdrawal agreement, with its controversial backstop to avoid a hard Irish border – deepened anger among Europhile backbenchers.Chuka Umunna, one of the main Labour backers of a second Brexit referendum, said Mr Corbyn’s letter was “totally demoralising”.“This is not opposition, it is the facilitation of a deal which will make this country poorer,” he said.Chris Leslie, another Labour backbencher, said Mr Corbyn had put Labour’s conference policy, which potentially includes support for options such as a second referendum, “in the bin”.Lucy Powell, a Labour MP who backs membership of the customs union and single market, said Mr Corbyn had made “a really significant move to break the Brexit paralysis”.Brussels meetingMPs on all sides of the Brexit debate are awaiting the outcome of Mrs May’s meeting with Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president, on Thursday.The prime minister has so far failed to specify what alternative arrangements might replace the backstop, the insurance mechanism that Eurosceptics fear would trap the UK in a customs union with the EU. She has mooted a time limit to the backstop and a unilateral exit mechanism, options that have been previously rejected by Brussels.The EU has, however, indicated its willingness to amend the political declaration if the UK’s red lines change.With just 50 days until the scheduled date of Britain’s exit from the EU, Europhile MPs are running out of time to influence the process. They are expected to table motions next week, calling for an extension of article 50, the EU’s formal exit process, and also propose that parliament hold Brexit debates in which MPs could vote on different ways forward.Similar motions, put down by Labour’s Yvette Cooper and the Conservative Dominic Grieve respectively, failed last week, partly due to rebellions by more than 25 Labour MPs. None of the eight shadow ministers who rebelled was sacked from Mr Corbyn’s cabinet.Europhile MPs and some trade unions now suspect the Labour leader is manoeuvring to allow Mrs May’s deal to pass parliament, without Labour taking political responsibility for it.Along with a permanent customs union, the other Brexit demands made by Mr Corbyn are: close alignment with the single market a pledge to keep workers’ rights in line with those in the EU commitments on UK participation in EU agencies and “unambiguous agreements” on future security arrangements, including “access to the European Arrest Warrant”. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2019Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tVirginia governor-elect Ralph Northam (centre) celebrates with lieutenant governor-elect Justin Fairfax and attorney general Mark Herring at Mr Northam’s election night rally in Fairfax, Virginia, in November 2017. All three men are fighting for their political lives. Photograph:  Aaron P BernsteinReutersThe political crisis in Virginia deepened on Wednesday when the attorney general admitted to wearing blackface in the 1980s at a college party, becoming the state’s third high-ranking Democrat caught up in scandal.Attorney general Mark Herring (57), who has expressed gubernatorial ambitions and called four days ago for Mr Northam to resign, admitted in a statement he donned brown face paint at a party in 1980 to impersonate a rapper.Mr Northam (59) acknowledged last weekend to having worn blackface – a practice dating to 19th century minstrel shows caricaturing slaves – in 1984 to impersonate Michael Jackson. His admission came after a conservative media website published a photo on Friday from Mr Northam’s page in his 1984 medical school yearbook showing one man wearing blackface beside another masked figure in robes of the white supremacist group the Ku Klux Klan. After initially saying he was one of the two depicted in the photo, Mr Northam changed his story and said neither was him.A separate scandal engulfing Democratic lieutenant governor Justin Fairfax (39), who is black and would succeed Mr Northam were he to step down, intensified on Wednesday when a woman accused him of sexually assaulting her at the Democratic National Convention in 2004.Mr Herring, who like Mr Northam is white, is second in line to succeed the governor as attorney general.Republican twistThe simultaneous controversies embroiling the top three-elected politicians in the executive branch of Virginia’s government raised the unlikely prospect of Democrats losing the governorship to a Republican. Kirk Cox, Republican speaker of Virginia’s House of Delegates, is third in the constitutional line of succession.Mr Cox (61), a former high school teacher who has served in the state’s Republican-controlled House since 1990, issued a statement on Wednesday saying the controversies in the executive branch “are disturbing” but “will be resolved in due course”. In the meantime, lawmakers would focus on budget deliberations and “hundreds of bills remaining before us”.Legislators otherwise kept a low profile on Wednesday, ducking reporters as they left the state capitol in Richmond following Wednesday’s legislative session.Mr Northam has remained out of public view since Saturday, when he held a news conference to address the furore over his yearbook pictures, which sparked calls for his resignation from fellow Democrats in Virginia, a key swing state in the 2020 presidential race.Civil rights groups and at least five Democratic candidates for the White House also have urged Mr Northam to step down.Despite the Democratic Party’s current zero tolerance for bigotry and sexual misconduct, Democrats might be motivated to rally behind Mr Northam if faced with the prospect of Republicans suddenly assuming the governorship.In his statement, Mr Cox singled out the allegations against Fairfax as “extremely serious”. The lieutenant governor has acknowledged knowing his accuser but on Wednesday repeated his assertion their encounter was consensual.The woman, Vanessa Tyson, in a statement issued by Washington law firm Katz, Marshall \u0026amp Banks, said that Fairfax forced her to perform oral sex on him in a hotel room.“I cannot believe, given my obvious distress, that Mr Fairfax thought this forced sexual act was consensual,” Ms Tyson said in the statement, which was published by multiple US media outlets.The same website that disclosed Mr Northam’s yearbook photo was the first to report Ms Tyson’s allegations on Monday.RespectAfter she came forward, Mr Fairfax again denied wrongdoing but asked that she be treated with respect. “But I cannot agree with a description of events that I know is not true,” he said in a statement.Elected officials in both parties have recently seen their careers ended by allegations of racism and sexual misconduct.Florida’s Republican secretary of state last month resigned after a newspaper published a photo of him wearing blackface at a 2005 costume party.Democratic US senator Al Franken resigned in 2017 after being accused of sexual misconduct.Attorney general Mr Herring said in a statement on Wednesday he now realised he showed poor judgement by dressing as a rapper and donning a wig and brown make-up to perform a song with similarly attired friends.“I had a callous and inexcusable lack of awareness and insensitivity to the pain my behaviour could inflict on others,” he said. – Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

Yellow weather warnings for wind have been issued to the entire south of England and Wales from Wednesday afternoon through to Saturday evening. Overnight winds reached 79mph on the Isle of Wight, and 67mph on the Isles of Scilly off the coast of Cornwall.The Met Office has warned residents to prepare for power cuts, travel disruption and an impact to services as two separate weather fronts cross Britain.The first, on Thursday, means that everywhere south of Manchester will be subject to the yellow warning. A second warning comes into place at midday on Friday and lasts until Saturday at 6pm and covers all of Britain south of Dundee. Northern Scotland has been issued its own yellow warning for rain. Meteorologist Mark Wilson advised motorists to take care.He said: Be mindful that there could be some tricky conditions on the roads, for example there will be strong winds that could affect transport, like high-sided vehicles crossing bridges, so there could be delays.While winds will ease off into breezy weather mid-morning, leaving sunshine and showers, gusts are due to pick up again by midday on Friday, with a warning from then covering most of the UK and remaining in place until Saturday evening.This will be accompanied by a warning for persistent heavy rain in Scotland, where as much as 60mm is forecast to fall over high ground.Temperatures will stay mild on Thursday, with highs of 7C (45F) in Scotland and 10C (50F) in the south of England, Mr Wilson added.The yellow warning for wind says: Some delays to road, rail, air and ferry transport are likelyDelays for high-sided vehicles on exposed routes and bridges likelySome short term loss of power and other services is possibleIt’s possible that some coastal routes, sea fronts and coastal communities could be affected by spray andor large wavesThe latest bad weather has not yet been upgraded to a storm, which requires the weather warnings to be at least amber or red.Although cold, January 2019 was a very dry month for much of the UK with many places seeing less than half the expected rainfall.The end of the month saw a cold spell that brought widespread ice and snow.Please review our commenting policyComment: The EU has a special place in hell for Mrs May: doing a Brexit deal with the Labour devilBrexit latest news: Theresa May meets EU leaders in Brussels for crunch talks as Jeremy Corbyn offers olive branchComment: The backlash against Turning Point UK rather proves its point it\u0026#39s hard being a conservative on campusLibby Squire: Man, 24, arrested on suspicion of abduction in connection with missing Hull studentWhat is the Brexit backstop, and why is the Irish border so important to the deal?The EU is furious with Theresa May and will leave her empty-handed - as accidental no-deal Brexit loomsConjoined twins trapped in Yemen warzone as doctors plead for evacuationDrop in suicide rate in China fuels global fall in deathsValentine\u0026#39s Day 2019: Why Cupid and the heart are associated with loveBody recovered from wreckage of Emiliano Sala\u0026#39s planeThe World Exists to \u2028Be Put on a Postcard, British Museum review: these mini-artworks are witty, fun razor-sharpLabour anti-semitic rows help push hate incidents against Jewish community to highComment: Let’s celebrate the wonderful ordinariness of small-town lifeThink no evil: kind thoughts can boost immune system, study findsMiddle class parents should lose their free nursery hours because childcare policy \u0026#39entrenches inequality\u0026#39, MPs sayComment: In order to survive after Brexit, the Tories need to be more than the party of freedomOcado Andover warehouse fire prompts evacuation of nearby homesWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/06/TELEMMGLPICT000187656710_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq9pjbsMukG4pAEa56by8byGDGTg8gQCUmuwngxWIbnKE.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"us urges venezuelan troops allow aid country exchange freedom","story":"Lorries block the road linking Colombia and Venezuela, in Cucuta, in order to prevent aid being brought inVenezuelan troops have barricaded a bridge on the country\u0027s western border with Colombia in an attempt to block the delivery of humanitarian aid, and stop what Nicolas Maduro claims is a prelude to a full invasion.Juan Guaido, the self-declared interim president, has welcomed an offer from the United States of $20 million (£15m) of food and medicines, and the supplies are being transported to the border. But Mr Maduro, who has the support of the army, will not allow it to cross.On Wednesday, Venezuelan soldiers were using a fuel tanker and cargo containers to cut off access to the Tienditas bridge, which links the Colombian border town of Cucuta to Ureña in Venezuela. Members of Venezuela\u0027s Bolivarian national guard could also been seen at the border crossing.The Colombian Foreign Ministry says a second crossing in the northern department of La Guajira has also been blocked.A blockade at the Tienditas bridge, on the Colombian-Venezuelan borderMike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, reacted angrily to the blockade, tweeting: “The Venezuelan people desperately need humanitarian aid. The US \u0026amp other countries are trying to help, but #Venezuela’s military under Maduro\u0027s orders is blocking aid with trucks and shipping tankers. The Maduro regime must LET THE AID REACH THE STARVING PEOPLE. #EstamosUnidosVE”John Bolton, the US national security adviser, echoed his comments, and lashed out at Mr Maduro for seeking only to look after himself.“Maduro and his cronies live lavishly in Europe and enrich their Cuban patrons while plundering Venezuela’s wealth,” he said. “Meanwhile, they are physically blocking the Venezuelan people, including the military rank and file, from receiving humanitarian assistance.”He said the US would protect any senior military official who accepts Mr Guaido’s legitimacy.“The US will consider sanctions off-ramps for any Venezuelan senior military officer that stands for democracy and recognizes the constitutional government of President Juan Guaido,” he said. “If not, the international financial circle will be closed off completely. Make the right choice!”Mr Maduro, increasingly isolated, has sought to sell off the country’s gold reserves to keep his regime afloat. The Bank of England, which holds $1.2 billion in Venezuelan gold, has blocked him from doing so, but Mr Maduro\u0027s government last year sold 73 tonnes of gold to Turkey and the United Arab Emirates without the required approval of the opposition-led national assembly, an opposition politician said on Wednesday.Nicolas Maduro, pictured inspecting troops on MondayCarlos Paparoni also said that Mr Maduro\u0027s administration had transferred 127 million euros to bank accounts in Russia, without specifying when. Since Monday, the Venezuelan government has not been able to move money between its accounts in banks in the European Union, he added.We will keep working so that not one more gram of gold can be sold, Mr Paparoni said.The FBI raided a bank in Puerto Rico on Wednesday, on suspicion of the bank breaking sanctions placed on senior members of Mr Maduro’s government.And the aid delivery represents the latest attempt by Mr Maduro\u0027s political rival, 35-year-old national assembly president Mr Guaido, to weaken the Venezuelan regime by forcing members of the military to disobey Mr Maduro\u0027s orders.Mr Guaido on Tuesday met with former cabinet members of the late Hugo Chavez to discuss the way out of the impasse. He also met with mayors of Venezuelan cities to discuss distributing the aid.Venezuelan opposition leaders, who have gathered in Cucuta, appealed to the Venezuelan military to allow safe passage for the aid trucks.You know there\u0027s a red line, you know well there\u0027s a limit, you know that medicines, food and medical supplies are that limit, said Miguel Pizarro, a pro-Guaido politician.Tents and other logistical supplies have begun to arrive in Cucuta, but the bulk of the 60 tons of aid remains in the Colombian capital, Bogota. Local officials suggested the arrival may be delayed until the border crossing is cleared, or until both sides have negotiated an agreement to let the aid pass.The United Nations and the Red Cross expressed alarm on Wednesday about the politicisation of aid.Humanitarian action needs to be independent of political, military or other objectives, said Stephane Dujarric, UN spokesman, speaking in New York.When we see the present stand-off it becomes even more clear that serious political negotiations between the parties are necessary to find a solution leading to lasting peace for the people of Venezuela.Mr Guaido wrote to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres last month asking for help in tackling the country\u0027s crisis. But Venezuela\u0027s seat at the 193-member world body is held by Mr Maduro\u0027s government and Mr Guterres is unable to ramp up a humanitarian response in Venezuela without Maduro\u0027s approval or UN Security Council authorisation – something which would be blocked by Russia and China.In Geneva, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it was doubling its resources to cope with the crisis, where food and medicine shortages have pushed 2.3 million people to flee since 2015.Our focus is really to, on the one side increase our response to Venezuelans, and on the other hand to keep away from the political controversy and political isions which are characteristic to the crisis in Venezuela, said Peter Maurer, ICRC chief.Juan Guaido, the man recognised by Britain, the US and dozens of other nations as the rightful interim president of VenezuelaWalter Marquez, a former member of Venezuela´s national assembly, told The  that the refusal to allow the entry of food and medicines contravenes international law.“The UN must assume its responsibility to protect the people of Venezuela,” he said. “The International Criminal Court has the power to take preventative measures and that´s what we´d like to see.”Mr Maduro has said repeatedly that the arrival of humanitarian aid would be the start of a US-led invasion, insisting that no one will enter, not one invading soldier.”Mr Marquez denied that the Venezuelan opposition hoped to provoke military intervention, but he said he was pessimistic about the chances of a peaceful solution.“I don\u0027t see how negotiations will work,” he said. “They will have to use force to get the aid in.Please review our commenting policyBrexit latest news: Theresa May meets EU leaders in Brussels for crunch talks as Jeremy Corbyn offers olive branchComment: The backlash against Turning Point UK rather proves its point it\u0026#39s hard being a conservative on campusLibby Squire: Man, 24, arrested on suspicion of abduction in connection with missing Hull studentWhat is the Brexit backstop, and why is the Irish border so important to the deal?The EU is furious with Theresa May and will leave her empty-handed -

To lure her away, Apple gave Ahrendts company stock valued at $70 million in 2014. In her last full year at Apple, she received a compensation package valued at $26.5 million, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\u0026nbspAhrendts’ arrival at the Cupertino, California, company coincided with the rollout of the Apple Watch, which the company designed to be a fashion statement in addition to a wearable piece of technology.\u0026nbspWhile at Apple, Ahrendts engineered renovations of high-profiles stores in San Francisco, New York, Chicago and other cities in an attempt to transform them into hip places to hang out while shoppers checked out the company’s latest innovations. Her lofty description of the stores as the equivalent of “town squares” became the subject of derision among some analysts and media commentators.Additional reporting by Associated PressBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This was a 1.4 percentage point increase on the application rate in 2018.It comes despite a 1.8 per cent fall in the overall number of 18-year-olds in England.Sarah Stevens, head of policy at the Russell Group, said: “I expect the confirmation of home fee status next year could have helped the numbers, although so could the weak pound as it makes life in the UK cheaper for both EU and non-EU students.”The number of applicants from China increased by a third this year - rising to 15,880, which brings Chinese applicant numbers to almost the same level as those from Wales and Northern Ireland.On the rise of applications from 18-year-olds, Ms Stevens added: “These figures show there remains a strong appetite for university study. Time spent at university opens-up lifelong opportunities for students and prepares them for an uncertain and competitive job market.”Universities accept fewer students as overall A-level pass rate dropsUniversities \u0027should do more to tackle student mental health crisis\u0027Unconditional offers may mean A-level students take \u0027foot off the gas\u0027Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute (HEPI) think tank, told The Independent: “There is so much uncertainty at the moment with Brexit but getting a degree is almost an insurance policy against future problems.”He added: “We know that the people that are most worried about Brexit are young people. They are the ones who think, rightly or wrongly, that the future has been made more difficult for them.“The more highly skilled you are, the better your life chances. It is a very rational thing that young people are doing.”James Seymour, director of admissions at the University of Buckingham, said: “Although there’s lots of uncertainty around Brexit there’s a feeling of certainty when it comes to doing a degree in the UK.“There’s a feeling of ‘it’s my choice’ regardless of what is going on with Brexit. There have been some question marks over apprenticeships but people feel they can trust a degree.”Clare Marchant, chief executive of Ucas, said: In this time of uncertainty, it\u0027s welcome news to see more EU and international students wanting to come and study in the UK.Alongside this, demand from UK 18-year-old students remains strong, despite the falling numbers of this age group in the population.The unexpected rise in the application rate from English 18-year-olds, against the population trend, signals they still recognise the challenge and rewards of full-time undergraduate study.Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, said: It\u0027s excellent to see that 18-year-olds in England increasingly value a university education, with a record rate of applications.We are also pleased to see a record high in the percentage of young people from disadvantaged areas applying to university.However, we need to be more ambitious. To retain a competitive advantage on the global stage post-Brexit we must encourage and support more of the population through higher level study.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

William Cook travels to Brussels to meet the famous duo, who have\u0026nbspturned their lives together into a perpetual, seamless artworkClick to followThe IndependentGilbert and George outside their house in Spitalfields: ‘We really believe that Fournier Street is the centre of the world for us’In a dilapidated old arsenal on the industrial edge of Brussels, Gilbert and George are singing the music hall song that made them famous. Their audience seem a bit bemused, and who on earth can blame them? “Underneath the Arches” is as British as warm\u0026nbspbeer or test match cricket, and equally incomprehensible to European punters. First performed by a very different duo, Flanagan and Allen, way back in the 1930s, it was already a golden oldie when Gilbert and George started singing it in art galleries 50 years ago.Half a century later, it’s become the theme tune for their lifelong career as Living Sculptures. No wonder these continental liggers are nonplussed. To anyone who isn’t steeped in British culture, with its weird passion for nostalgia, Gilbert and George must seem very odd indeed. “We never wanted to be weird because all artists like the idea of being weird, and we never wanted to be normal because everybody’s normal,” says George, by way of explanation. “We like to be weird and normal at the same time.”Gilbert and George are here in Brussels to open Brafa, one of Europe’s most prestigious art fairs. Each year, a famous artist is invited to be Brafa’s guest of honour. Last year, it was Christo. This year, it’s Gilbert and George. Their big bold artworks are scattered around this huge hall, an incongruous contrast to the antique paintings that surround them.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThis juxtaposition is surreal – and here in the Belgian capital, the city of Magritte, that’s really rather fitting. For Brexit-obsessed Britons, Brussels may be synonymous with the European Union, but for Europeans it’s always been synonymous with surrealism – and what could possibly be more surreal than Gilbert and George?Despite their matching suits, and shirts and ties, they’re easy to tell apart. George looks like Eric Morecambe. Gilbert looks like Ernie Wise. However, unlike Eric and Ernie, they’re more than just a double act. They live together, they work together, they always appear in public together. This has been their way of life since they met, in London, in 1967, at St Martin’s School of Art (now Central Saint Martins). Their artworks are striking, and often bizarrely beautiful, but they’re a sideshow compared to their greatest work of art: themselves.Created with Sketch.Gilbert and George: portraits and works Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Gilbert and George in their local cafe in Spitalfields, 2017Gilbert and George outside of their favourite restaurant, Mangal II, a Kurdish restaurant in Stoke Newington 2017 Portrait of Gilbert and George RA after receiving their medals at the Royal Academy of Arts on May 2, 2017Portrait of Gilbert and George RA after receiving their medals at the Royal Academy of Arts on May 2, 2017Gilbert and George, 2015Gilbert and George in their younger yearsGilbert and George - SFG (2013)Gilbert \u0026amp George, White Cube and Albert BaronianGilbert and George - HANDBALL (2008)Gilbert \u0026amp George, White Cube and Albert BaronianGilbert and George - TEACHER STRAIGHT (2011)Gilbert \u0026amp George, White Cube and Albert BaronianGilbert and George - BEARD RAIDS (2016) Gilbert \u0026amp George, White Cube and Albert BaronianGilbert and George - BEARD MAD (2016)Gilbert \u0026amp George, White Cube and Albert BaronianGilbert and George, 2017Early morning.

Everyone assumes so, but no one seems to know for sure, and their public life is far more intriguing than whatever they might get up to in private. Young men feature prominently in their work, women are conspicuous by their absence, but you wouldn’t call these pictures homoerotic. Indeed, there’s something strangely sexless about them, like artworks from another planet.Their\u0026nbspDirty Words\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspNaked Shit\u0026nbsppictures caused a predictable furore (the titles are self-explanatory) but most of their work isn’t overtly controversial. The most radical thing about them isn’t their art, but the way they’ve merged their inidual identities into one.‘Fake’ Hitler paintings seized by German police in BerlinThey’re reluctant to discuss the details of their lives before they met, but their backgrounds are fascinating. When pressed, they stress the similarities – they were both war babies from provincial, lower-class, unartistic families – but the differences are far more notable, and the most notable difference is that one half of this very British duo wasn’t originally British at all.Gilbert Prousch was born in a small village in the Italian Dolomites in 1943. His father was a shoemaker, like his grandfather, great-grandfather and great-great grandfather before him, but after the war mass-produced shoes became much cheaper and so Gilbert’s father struggled to make a living. Inspired by Michaelangelo, Gilbert studied art in Salzburg and then in Munich, where he heard about St Martin’s. He travelled to London and wangled a place on its internationally renowned advanced sculpture course. He didn’t speak a word of English. He still speaks with a strong Italian accent today.George Passmore, conversely, speaks like a BBC newsreader from the 1950s. He was born in Devon in 1942. His father left home soon after George was born, possibly before. His mother was uninhibited, and George had a succession of “uncles”, which must have exposed him to gossip in postwar Totnes. At state school he showed a talent for art, which eventually won him a place at Dartington Hall, a private school renowned for its progressive attitudes. Inspired by Van Gogh’s letters, he went on to art school, and ended up at St Martin’s, on the advanced sculpture course, with Gilbert Prousch.“George took an interest in me,” says Gilbert. They became friends – and then lovers? Last time I met them, in their home in London, I asked them if it was love at first sight. “No,” said George. He described their relationship as something that happened gradually, “like an atmosphere or a cloud”. Do they ever wonder what might have happened if they’d never met? The idea clearly seems inconceivable to them. They believe they were destined to be together. “It was fate,” says Gilbert.The sculpture course at St Martin’s was (in)famously laissez-faire. Students could do whatever they wanted, which suited Gilbert and George just fine. “St Martin’s was the best art school in the world,” says Gilbert. “This was a school that said to an artist, ‘Anything goes. You are free to think in different ways.’ No other art school did that.” His art training in Munich had been traditional and academic. “St Martin’s was different – anything could be art.”Their fellow students included Barry Flanagan, Bruce McLean and, most notably, Richard Long, who turned walking into an artform. Gilbert and George went even further. They turned their lives together into a perpetual, seamless artwork. As Gilbert says, “We were the centre of our art.”While Long set off into the wilderness, Gilbert and George wandered around London’s East End. It was here, in a Dickensian junk shop, that they found an old record of “Underneath the Arches”, and came up with the idea of singing along to it, for hours and hours on end. They called this artwork The Singing Sculpture. “We felt we were doing something different,” says Gilbert. Like all the best ideas, it was both in keeping with, yet contrary to, the spirit of the times. Conceptual art was all the rage, but most of it was terribly earnest. Their Singing Sculpture was full of fun.Brafa, one of Europe’s most prestigious art fairs\u0026nbsp(Fabrice Debatty)“For the artists who were showing in those galleries, colour was taboo, figuration was taboo, sex was taboo, feeling was taboo – and these were all of the things we were interested in,” says George. Other artists got drunk in the evening, then went back into the studio in the morning to make sombre, sober art. Gilbert and George turned their drunken revels into art.They couldn’t get any public subsidy, and they had no family money to support them. Looking back, they now believe this gave them an advantage. “We could feel more free – we didn’t have to fit in in any way,” says George. “Middle-class people are more constrained.”They got their big break at a group show in London called When Attitudes Become Form. When the curator declined to include their work they gatecrashed the private view, and stole the show with their Living Sculptures, standing in the middle of the gallery like showroom dummies. Konrad Fischer saw them at this show, and asked them to perform in Düsseldorf. In Düsseldorf they were seen by Illeana Sonnabend, who invited them to New York. Fischer and Sonnabend were two of the world’s most influential art dealers. Gilbert and George had arrived.Around the same time they moved into a Georgian townhouse in Fournier Street, in London’s Spitalfields. They’ve lived there ever since. It was a poor area when they moved in. It’s got a lot smarter since, but it’s still a tough old place. The tramps that used to live there have been replaced by drug addicts, but they don’t mind this shifting cityscape – they embrace it. “We are very optimistic people,” says George. “We are never against anything.”Like a lot of their boldest statements, this is only partly true. They were certainly against the artistic orthodoxy of the 1960s and 1970s. In their suits and ties and starched white shirts they stood out a mile. “To be an artist you had to be critical. You had to be against the bomb, or against America, or against the Conservatives or against Labour,” says George. “We thought, ‘How marvellous it would be if we didn’t have to be Anti!’” It’s a philosophy they maintain when people bring petitions to their front door. “If it’s for something, we sign it. If it’s against something, we don’t sign it. We must have signed for some horrible things, but at least we were for.”Living in Spitalfields has been absolutely central to their art. “We really believe that Fournier Street is the centre of the world for us,” Gilbert tells me. “It’s an amazing mixture of different kinds of people.” Spitalfields has long been a refuge for arriving immigrants: Huguenots, Jews, Sikhs, Muslims… “The East End of London is a mixture of so many countries, a mixture of so many different people.” This is just the way they like it. “You face the modern world whenever you step out of the front door,” says George.They’ve exhibited all around the world, but though their pictures attract a lot of interest, wherever they go the main attraction is always Gilbert and George. It’s the same story here in Brussels. It’s like attending a press conference with Quentin Crisp and Oscar Wilde. Sure, it’s the same show every time, more or less, endless variations on a single theme, but it’s still more entertaining and enlightening than talking to any other artists I can think of.They set off for a walk around Brafa, followed by a swarm of hacks. “Our motto is ban religion,” says Gilbert, as they pause for photos in front of one of their monumental pictures. Religion loomed large in both their childhoods: Gilbert was raised a Catholic George’s brother became a vicar. Their artworks are oddly reminiscent of stained glass windows, but they’re both devout atheists. “We don’t believe in God,” says Gilbert. “All the gods are manmade. We are in charge of what we are doing in this world.”“We’ve always firmly believed that the national galleries of the world should remove all of the Christian art and hand it back to the Church,” says George. “They can look after the insurance and maintenance and conservation, and give over the national museums to humanist art, not Judeo-Christian voodoo.” George tells a story about an elderly vicar who knocked on their front door. “I thought it was marvellous that you said Ban Religion,” he told them. “My congregation come to church every week, and they’re all very religious. But I don’t want them to be religious. I want them to be good.”“We believe in the enlightenment, when people became human for their own sake,” adds Gilbert. “They didn’t need God anymore to make themselves human.” Their heroes are Charles Darwin and Alan Turing.We stop in front of a montage they made from tabloid posters, which they stole from outside newsagents. “It’s not a very easy thing to do because the shopkeepers don’t like you to do that, so one of us would go into the shop to distract the shopkeeper while the other stole the poster,” confesses George. “After three and a half years we ended up with more than 3,700 posters, and then we ided them into subjects – the ones which said Rape, the ones that said Murder, the ones that said Mugged, and ended up with a very big group of pictures.” They only got caught once. “We were very polite and gave it back to the shop, but we went the next night and stole it again.”‘Honest posters’ take down this year’s Oscar nomineesMan mistaken for employee strolls out of art gallery with $1m paintingThe rise of graphic novels, from To Kill a Mockingbird to SabrinaDespite these rebellious attitudes, they’re reassuringly old-fashioned. They don’t use the internet, or mobile phones. The only time they use the telephone is to book a table at the local restaurant where they’ve eaten for the past 20 years. After 50 years in the spotlight, they still maintain they’re outside the art establishment.Maybe they were, once upon a time (when they met, in 1967, homosexuality had only just been decriminalised) but that time has long since passed. Today they’re Royal Academicians who’ve exhibited in virtually every major gallery across the globe. If they were ever anti-establishment, the establishment has long since absorbed them. Yet for all their success there’s still something discreetly anarchic about them, a hint of danger behind their impeccable manners and immaculately tailored suits.They’re now lionised by the art world, but they don’t like hobnobbing with other artists. “We had friends in London, Paris, Germany, New York, a huge group of friends – drinking, celebrating, parties – and then one day we cut it off, we stopped,” says George. “We realised it was all to do with gossip and business – the nightmare of a world that has nothing to do with being an artist.” “We wanted to be free of gossiping,” says Gilbert. “We have friends, but we don’t want artist friends.” Though the art world has appropriated them, and sanctified them, they’re still outsiders at heart.So what advice would they give to an aspiring young artist starting out today? “Tomorrow morning, when you wake up, sit on the edge of your bed, keep your eyes closed, and don’t open them and stand up until you have decided, ‘What do I want to say to the world today?’” says George. Gilbert’s advice is a lot more succinct: “Fuck the teachers.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Rosalind the rover captures this spirit and carries us all to the forefront of space exploration.Rosalind Franklin was central to the discovery of DNA, alongside\u0026nbspCrick and Watson, but her part in the work has been historically overlooked. She was not mentioned when Crick, Watson and Wilkins were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1962 for their work on DNA, and her name was left out of many science books until the 1990s – but in recent years there has been a major effort to recognise her part in the pioneering work.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is unlikely the pair will ever be heard from again.It has been more than a month since the robots were last heard from and they are now millions of miles beyond the red planet.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBut Nasa considers the very fact it could talk to them at all a major success. The two craft pushed up against the limits of experimental technology, they say, and helped prove concepts that could allow such tiny robots to venture even more deep into space.MarCO was th first interplanetary mission to use a class of small spacecraft known as\u0026nbspCubeSats. Together, the pair worked as communications relays during the landing of InSight, a Nasa rover that dropped down around New Year and will be delving deep into Mars\u0027s surface.The two spacecraft were able to beam back data during the descent of the lander in near real-time, and sent back the stunning first images that were taken by InSight. The craft even did some science of their own: WALL-E took its own photos, and EVE did some simple radio science.Because the technology was experimental, Nasa weren\u0027t relying on either of the CubeSats working at all. If they had broken on their way – as engineers suspected they might – the data would still have been sent back but it would have taken much longer to receive it.After their work was done at Mars, they carried on off into space. WALL-E hasn\u0027t sent a message since 29 December, and is thought to be more than a million miles past Mars EVE is even further away, at about two million miles, and hasn\u0027t spoken to Nasa since 4 January.Nasa\u0027s Mars InSight lander sends back stunning first selfieResearchers don\u0027t know exactly why the pair have lost touch. WALL-E has a leaky thruster and might be wobbling so that it can\u0027t send commands. The sensors that allow them to charge their batteries from the sun might also have broken.They will continue flying away from Earth as February goes on, making sending any data\u0026nbspever more difficult and so meaning that Nasa don\u0027t expect to ever hear back.This mission was always about pushing the limits of miniaturized technology and seeing just how far it could take us, said Andy Klesh, the mission\u0027s chief engineer at JPL. We\u0027ve put a stake in the ground. Future CubeSats might go even farther.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

But what about the impact on firms that only sell in the UK? Ben Chu looks at the possible consequencesClick to followThe IndependentSupermarkets may sell only to British-based customers but around 30 per cent of our food is imported from the EUThe Brexit media spotlight has, for understandable reasons, tended to shine on exporting firms and major manufacturers with just-in-time supply chains, such as Nissan.These businesses are clearly at severe risk from the impact of a no-deal Brexit because they would suddenly face EU tariffs or import delivery problems that could shatter their ability to function.But what about UK firms that don’t export or manufacture? What about those companies that simply serve the domestic\u0026nbspmarket? What about smaller companies? What might the impact on them be?For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe answer is (as so often): it depends. If these firms rely on imports for their stock they too are severely exposed to any problems at the border. Think of supermarkets and grocers. They may sell only to British-based customers, but around 30 per cent of our food is imported from the European Union.Retailers that source “fast-fashion” clothing items from developing countries\u0026nbspcould also be adversely affected. That applies as much to small independent shops as it does to department stores.Created with Sketch.Brexit and travel: all you need to know Show all 14Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.British passports that expire after 29 March 2019 will continue to be valid as UK travel documents, but will lose the power that comes with being a European Union passport – notably the right of free movement within the EU27.You will still be able to travel to the EU with your pet after Brexit, but it could well get more complicated depending on the status that the European Union decide to apply. If the UK is given “Part 2 listed status”, there would be some extra requirements for travelling pets and owners post-Brexit. “These would require an additional visit to the vet and some additional papers to be carried but would not prevent you from enjoying your trip,” says Eurotunnel. The Treaty of Canterbury between the UK and France governs the Channel Tunnel link and operations will continue – subject to any local disruption at Folkestone andor CalaisMotorists, whether taking their own cars or hiring abroad, are likely to need to obtain an International Driving Permit or two different EU countries are signed up to different treaties, so for a trip embracing Spain and France you would need both types.Even in the event of a no-deal Brexit, flights will continue to operate between the UK and European Union.The network of flight links between Britain and eastern Europe could be affected by any reduction in the number of workers from those countries. Not only do they use the flights – so do their families and friendsCurrent European passengers’ rights rules, known as EC2612004, stipulate high payouts for delays and cancellations that cannot be attributed to “extraordinary circumstances”. Buried in a document called Beyond the Horizon: The Future of UK Aviation, the government says “the UK will not fall below current standards of protection when we leave the EU”814 Entry regulations to the European UnionFrom 11pm GMT on 29 March 2019, UK travellers will become “third-country nationals” when travelling to Schengen countries and subject to the standard rules of admission for citizens of nations such as the US, Japan and Australia. That means there must be at least 90 days (roughly three months) left on your passport beyond your intended date of departure.914 Online registration prior to travel – ETIASFrom 2021, non-EU nationals who do not require a visa to enter the Schengen area – including British travellers – will need to request prior authorisation to visit Schengen countries.A large number of travel providers – even including National Express coaches – have added “Brexit clauses” to their terms and conditions. These generally specify that they will not be liable for “consequential losses” as a result of Brexit-related issues1114 ‘Fast track’ lanes for passport control entering EU countriesBritish passport holders will not be able to use them, and must join the queue for third-country nationals.The ferry industry insists vessels will continue to sail. The UK Chamber of Shipping says: “Unlike the carriage of cargo, trade deals do not have a significant effect on the cruise and passenger ferry industry. The explicit standardisation of commodity codes and tariffs associated with trade deals have little relevance to holidaymakers.”The EU says: “If you fall ill or have an accident during a visit to another EU country, as an EU citizen you have the right to receive the necessary public healthcare in any EU country under the same conditions as people in the host country.” The EHIC also works in Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein.

If the UK is given “Part 2 listed status”, there would be some extra requirements for travelling pets and owners post-Brexit. “These would require an additional visit to the vet and some additional papers to be carried but would not prevent you from enjoying your trip,” says Eurotunnel. The Treaty of Canterbury between the UK and France governs the Channel Tunnel link and operations will continue – subject to any local disruption at Folkestone andor CalaisMotorists, whether taking their own cars or hiring abroad, are likely to need to obtain an International Driving Permit or two different EU countries are signed up to different treaties, so for a trip embracing Spain and France you would need both types.Even in the event of a no-deal Brexit, flights will continue to operate between the UK and European Union.The network of flight links between Britain and eastern Europe could be affected by any reduction in the number of workers from those countries. Not only do they use the flights – so do their families and friendsCurrent European passengers’ rights rules, known as EC2612004, stipulate high payouts for delays and cancellations that cannot be attributed to “extraordinary circumstances”. Buried in a document called Beyond the Horizon: The Future of UK Aviation, the government says “the UK will not fall below current standards of protection when we leave the EU”814 Entry regulations to the European UnionFrom 11pm GMT on 29 March 2019, UK travellers will become “third-country nationals” when travelling to Schengen countries and subject to the standard rules of admission for citizens of nations such as the US, Japan and Australia. That means there must be at least 90 days (roughly three months) left on your passport beyond your intended date of departure.914 Online registration prior to travel – ETIASFrom 2021, non-EU nationals who do not require a visa to enter the Schengen area – including British travellers – will need to request prior authorisation to visit Schengen countries.A large number of travel providers – even including National Express coaches – have added “Brexit clauses” to their terms and conditions. These generally specify that they will not be liable for “consequential losses” as a result of Brexit-related issues1114 ‘Fast track’ lanes for passport control entering EU countriesBritish passport holders will not be able to use them, and must join the queue for third-country nationals.The ferry industry insists vessels will continue to sail.

In theory, mobile phone firms can impose whatever fees they think the market will bear.The impact on domestic manufacturers that mainly sell in the UK will depend on the share of the raw materials they import.Another likely problem for these domestic-focused importers is the pound. Most analysts expect a no-deal Brexit to result in another major fall in the value of sterling versus other currencies.How UK businesses are preparing for BrexitThis would push up their import costs. Some may have taken out hedges against such currency volatility. But those that haven’t will find their costs rise sharply. Smaller firms, in particular, are much less likely to have hedging protection.Liam Fox, the trade secretary, has this week floated the idea of the government abolishing all import tariffs entirely in a no-deal scenario. This could (notwithstanding delivery delays) mean a surge in the availability of cheap manufactured or produce imports from around the world. Even firms that only serve the UK domestic market and don’t import at all could struggle to cope with this sudden burst of cheaper competition.Another factor for domestic-focused firms to consider is the macroeconomic impact of no deal. If this inflicts a severe shock to the overall UK economy – resulting in lower consumer spending and a slump in investment spending by firms – that would probably hit the sales of most domestic firms, regardless of any border or tariff issues. If a no-deal Brexit harms the financial sector, domestic firms may find it harder to access bank borrowing.These firms could also be hit by a shortage of workers if a no-deal scenario results in an exodus of EU workers. Almost a tenth of workers in the construction sector – 200,000 – are EU-born. In retail, hotels and restaurants the share is 25 per cent.The important thing to remember about the UK economy is that everything is connected – no firm, whatever its main market, is an island.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

Thus, the post-crash recession of 2008 was less severe than it might have been.Under the Maastricht Treaty of 1992, the UK and Denmark were the\u0026nbsponly EU member states relieved of the requirement to join the euro once certain economic conditions were in place, for example on government borrowing and inflation (the “convergence criteria”).For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThat treaty was eventually subsumed into the Lisbon Treaty of 2007. The European Commission states: “The treaty does not specify a particular timetable for joining the euro area, but leaves it to member states to develop their own strategies for meeting the condition for euro adoption. Seven of the 13 member states who joined the EU since 2004 have already joined the euro area, most recently Lithuania on 1 January 2015.” The UK and Denmark’s “opt-outs” are still in force.The question now arises, then, of whether this special situation would continue of the Brexit process, under article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, were now paused or revoked (ie reversed).What’s behind the latest Brexit row over Gibraltar?The short answer to that is yes. The UK would remain, as now, a member state under existing terms. Including the euro opt-out.However, if the UK were to formally leave the EU at any point, even under a “soft Brexit” and remaining in the European Economic Area, the single market or customs union, it would still need to reapply for membership in the usual fashion if it wanted to return. Just as, say, Albania or Serbia are now, the UK would become a “candidate” for accession.This would require acceptance of the “acquis communautaire” – all the rules, regulations and laws of the EU as they currently stand. Any exceptions would have to be agreed by the EU.Created with Sketch.

But it is still beautiful, not only geometrically with its lines and curves against the fluidity of the ocean, but also as an emblem of a British seaside culture slowly fading.On the euro, the UK would have lost the opt-out, and be required to fix the pound’s exchange rate irrevocably to the euro, and to transfer the running of UK monetary policy – interest rates – from the Bank of England to the European Central Bank in Frankfurt. There the Bank of England would be represented along with the other central banks.In due course, when the convergence criteria had been met, the UK would then join the euro and abolish the pound, first in bank deposits and then in notes and coins. However, it is interesting that Sweden maintains that it is not obliged to join the euro, and would only do so after a referendum. It has been an EU member since 1994 and still uses the krona.The UK joining the euro would be a controversial question, as it was when it was a live issue in the 1990s.If history is any guide, and with acknowledged flaws in the eurozone’s governance, joining the euro would be a significant obstacle to the UK rejoining the EU, if the EU insisted on enforcing it. Critics would claim it would mean bailing out Greece or Italy at great costs. Supporters would point to how it would make cross-border trade and price transparency much easier.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

This is why we insist on the backstop.”\u0026nbspMs May has promised to put forward a fresh plan for maintaining an open border in Northern Ireland by next Wednesday, but Mr Tusk warned that any new proposals from the UK must be “believeable”.\u0026nbspHe said: “Give us a believable guarantee for peace in Northern Ireland and the UK will leave the EU as a trusted friend.\u0026nbspLive – EU council president says ‘we will not gamble with peace’“I hope the UK government will present ideas that will both respect this point of view and at the same time command a clear and stable majority in the House of Commons.”His stance was echoed by Mr Varadkar, who said\u0026nbsphe was “open to further discussions” with the UK but that the current withdrawal agreement remained\u0026nbsp”the best deal possible”.He said: “While we expect that the backstop will never be used, we agreed again today that it is needed as a legal guarantee to ensure that there is no return to a hard border on the island of Ireland while protecting the integrity of our European single market and customs union.“I think the events in London and the instability in British politics\u0026nbspin recent weeks demonstrates exactly why we need a legal guarantee and a solution that is operable, that we know will work and will last.”After their joint press conference, microphones recorded Mr Varadkar joking to Mr Tusk: “They’ll give you terrible trouble in the British press.”A laughing Mr Tusk replied: “Yes I know.”The comments sparked a furious response from Brexiteers.Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, said Mr Tusk has no manners, telling\u0026nbspthe BBC: “I think that what he has said is pretty unacceptable and pretty disgraceful.I\u0027m sure that when he reflects on it he may well wish he hadn\u0027t done it.The DUP’s Sammy Wilson called Mr Tusk a\u0026nbsp”devilish, trident-wielding, euro maniac”, adding: “Donald Tusk once again shows his contempt for the 17.4 million people who voted to escape the corruption of the EU and seek the paradise of a free and prosperous kingdom.

They will feel like they have been sold down the river.”Labour MP Chris Leslie added: “Seriously? Offering to help Tory Govt enable Brexit? It’s not just Labour’s conference policy in the bin.

In the end there is only one way out of this mess for both our country and the Labour Party – a People’s Vote.”But speaking on the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, the party’s shadow international trade secretary Liam Fox, however, defended the shift in policy away from the six tests Labour originally set for a Brexit deal, saying the offer was made “in a spirit of co-operation and compromise”.“It’s not about tests now,” he said. “What we are doing is saying we believe that these are the options that are available that would actually secure a majority in the House of Commons.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But if we are able to make progress sooner, then that might not be necessary.“We can’t know at this stage exactly which of those scenarios would happen.”There is\u0026nbspgrowing concern\u0026nbspamong ministers that there is not enough time to pass the necessary legislation before exit day,\u0026nbspamid reports that the February recess could be cancelled to give Ms May more time to win over the EU.Mr Hunt said a solution had “not been properly worked up” to replace the\u0026nbspIrish backstop – which aims to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland.\u0026nbspMPs backed a bid to\u0026nbspreplace it\u0026nbspwith “alternative arrangements” in a series of crunch votes on Tuesday.He said it was “difficult to know” if negotiations would run to the end of March, but added: “Whereas a week ago none of us really knew whether this was going to be possible, we are now in a situation where it clearly is possible.“There are lots and lots of hurdles –\u0026nbspno one is saying this isn’t going to be very challenging –\u0026nbspbut we do now have a consensus in parliament.“Providing we can do that, which I think we can, then I think there is a way through.”However his Austrian counterpart, Karin Kneissl, said it would be “very difficult” for the Brexit timeframe to be extended and warned that Britain could be heading for a no-deal exit.She said: “According to the Article 50 procedures, the deadline is 29 March,\u0026nbspso there is a time pressure because what couldn’t be reached by negotiation over the last years, it’s very difficult to imagine that there can be a tremendous breakthrough – a magic solution – in the next few days in order also to have this ratified in due time for the remaining EU members.”Created with Sketch.

If that\u0027s not possible by Feb 13, the government will table an amendable motion on Thursday.\u0026nbspThis comes off the back of a story in the Huffington Post, which revealed roaming charges could be brought overnight for Brits abroad in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspLiam Fox has warned MPs risk making the pitfalls of a no-deal Brexit more likely by voting against the Government\u0027s Withdrawal Agreement.The international trade secretary, asked about processing trade deals with minimal delays, told the Commons: In terms of the continuity of agreements we already have, the best way to ensure full continuity is to have a deal.All those who talk about the pitfalls of no deal would do well to remember that in voting against a deal they make those pitfalls all the more likely.Labour accused Dr Fox of giving away the shop before negotiations start after reports he is planning on scrapping all import tariffs post-Brexit.The cabinet minister replied: The government has made no decision on this, when we do so we will communicate it to stakeholders, the public and Parliament.Of course the best way to avoid this scenario is to have a deal with the European Union and whipping up fear about people\u0027s jobs is simply the humbug that has become the hallmark of Mr Esterson.Theresa May will use talks with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, Donald\u0026nbspTusk and other prominent EU figures to press for legally binding guarantees on Irish\u0026nbspbackstop.The backstop, which is intended to prevent the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland, would see the UK continue to obey EU customs rules after a transition period if no wider trade deal had been reached.Downing Street said that the PM will insist that the UK cannot be trapped in the backstop. She is\u0026nbspopen to different ways of achieving her objectives but they must be legally binding.The PM will say parliament has sent an unequivocal message that change is required but MPs have made it clear they can support her deal if the backstop is addressed.David Lidington, the de-facto\u0026nbspdeputy PM, said Donald\u0026nbspTusk\u0027s comment wasn\u0027t the most brilliant diplomacy in the world.He told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today: I think Mr Tusk was venting yesterday, but I don\u0027t think that will detract from what I expect to be a courteous and sensible grown-up discussion between the different EU leaders and the prime minister.Mr Lidington said he and Brexit secretary Steve Barclay want to sit down with Labour frontbenchers but its\u0026nbspkey Brexit policy on a customs union with Brussels was wishful thinking.If it\u0027s Keir Starmer or Emily Thornberry or anybody else, the idea is - if this goes forward - it would be me and Steve Barclay who would be sitting down and meeting them, he told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme.Let\u0027s hope those conversations can take place.Mr Lidington said a key part of any discussion would be to understand exactly where the Labour frontbench is coming from.He said: I would be saying to Labour, \u0027What is it that you don\u0027t like about what is in the Political Declaration at the moment?\u0027, because what we have there is an idea of a customs arrangement with the European Union that still allows us to have an independent trade policy on top of that, but while getting access - tariff-free and quota-free - for our goods and agriculture to the European market.I would be asking what on earth they mean when they say they want to be in a customs union with the EU but also for Britain to have a say in EU trade policy with other countries. That\u0027s not something that\u0027s allowed under the European treaties.This seems to be wishful thinking.Welcome to The Independent\u0027s politics liveblog, where we will be bringing you all the latest updates throughout\u0026nbspthe day.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That is her mandate and that’s what I expect her to take to Brussels.”Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald warned the prime minister that she risked breaking up the UK if she engaged in brinkmanship with the EU.She said: “We have told her that the British strategy of running down the clock and playing a game of chicken with Ireland and Irish interests is profoundly unacceptable and wrong.“We have told her that the days of Britain dictating to Ireland or Irish people, that those days are over and will not return.”She accused Ms May of acting in “absolute bad faith”, adding:\u0026nbsp“If British politicians cannot accept the specific needs of this country, of the Northern Irish, if British politics is incapable of acknowledging and upholding the Good Friday Agreement and the hardening of the border, then the only last option – the backstop of last resort – is a referendum on Irish unity.”Naomi Long, leader of the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, said\u0026nbspthe prime minister\u0026nbspgave no detail about what the “alternative arrangements” could be to replace the backstop in their meeting.‘We’re totally in the dark’ – Belfast locals on BrexitShe went on: “I am tired of people chasing unicorns. It has to stop, we don’t have time.“We need practical solutions that are going to actually address the realities that we are facing.”UUP leader Robin Swann said if Ms May cannot negotiate an extension and no deal is reached, then she must introduce direct rule for Northern Ireland.And SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said that his party had told Ms May that it is now time to “put up or shut up”, as the backstop was only viable solution to the border issue.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The country’s future is at stake, and it’s about time the national interest took priority.”But the political logjam over Brexit appears to be putting the government’s legislation on hold in the aftermath of Theresa May’s deal being crushed by a historic margin.And given the lack of an agreed deal at Westminster – or knowledge of what the deal will eventually entail – it is difficult for the prime minister to make progress with five Brexit-related laws, including the fisheries bill, the agricultural bill, and the financial services bill.\u0027Special place in hell\u0027 for pro-Brexit campaigners, Tusk saysThis is why in recent weeks cabinet ministers such as the foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt and the Commons leader, Andrea Leadsom, have suggested the government may need to delay Brexit by a few weeks in order to pass critical legislation – if Ms May eventually cobbles together a majority for an exit deal.Asked about the adjournment of the Commons at 3.27pm, the prime minister’s official spokesman said: The business of the House is set out in advance, there have been days recently where they have been working beyond midnight dealing with statements and with debates on Brexit.I think this week they have been dealing with some important domestic statutory instruments and other significant issues which are going to be debated in the coming days.Created with Sketch.Brexit and travel: all you need to know Show all 14Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.British passports that expire after 29 March 2019 will continue to be valid as UK travel documents, but will lose the power that comes with being a European Union passport – notably the right of free movement within the EU27.You will still be able to travel to the EU with your pet after Brexit, but it could well get more complicated depending on the status that the European Union decide to apply.

The first that person will know about it is when someone bangs on their door in the early hours of the morning to bundle them into an immigration enforcement van and take them to a detention centre.“Those we get to hear about are probably only the tip of the iceberg, but we do know that £21m was paid out by the Home Office in just five years to compensate for wrongful detention, and terrible mistakes are certainly what happened in the Windrush cases.”The committee said it had looked at the Home Office files of Windrush citizens who had been unable to prove their UK residence, and that there was “masses” of evidence, including records of national insurance contributions going back decades.Algerian man dies in London immigration detention centreGovernment plans risk ‘riding roughshod’ over rights of immigrantsSuicides in immigration removal centres kept ‘state secret’, MPs told“If there had been any independence in the decision making, these people would never have been detained, yet they were detained not once but twice. The papers in their files were ignored, and the pleas of their families were swept aside,” Ms Harman added.“After the right to life, the right not to be unlawfully detained is one of the most important human rights. It should not be the case that a person has fewer protections from wrongful detention as an immigrant than they would if they had actually committed a crime.”The MPs also said detainees should have better and more consistent access to legal aid to challenge their detention, and that a reinstatement of legal aid for immigration cases should be considered.Sam Grant, policy and campaigns manager for Liberty, supported the calls, describing indefinite detention as an “ineffective and inefficient waste of money and human life”.\u0026nbspBella Sankey, director of Detention Action, also backed the calls, saying\u0026nbspa 28-day time limit was “urgently” needed along with early judicial oversight and safeguards against “cat and mouse” re-detentions.“The JCHR has expertly laid bare the injustice and abuse inherent in our current system. Parliament will have the opportunity to take this historic step when it considers the immigration bill and we urge MPs of all parties to take it,” she added.UN backs calls for time limit on UK immigration detentionLeila Zadeh, executive director of UK Lesbian \u0026amp Gay Immigration Group, welcomed the report but called for the government to bring an end to the detention of LGBT+ people, saying it was “wholly inappropriate”“They run a significant risk of being locked up among other people who may display the same discriminatory attitudes and hostility from which they have fled. They also frequently struggle to be granted refugee status if they have to make their asylum applications from inside a detention centre,” she added.A Home Office spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp “Immigration detention is an important part of the wider immigration system, but we are committed to usingdetention sparingly and only when necessary. Ninety-five per cent of people liable for removal at any one time are managed in the community.“Any decision to detain someone is reviewed by a Detention Gatekeeper who acts independently from referring and case working teams to ensure an inidual’s suitability for detention has been fully assessed, and any vulnerabilities have been considered.“An inidual is only detained when there is realistic prospect of removal within a reasonable timescale. We do not detain people indefinitely, and the law does not allow it.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereAsylum and ImmigrationOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

However it notably drops Labour’s previous demand to secure the\u0026nbsp”exact same benefits” of the single market.There are also calls for “unambiguous agreements on the detail of future security arrangements, including access to the European Arrest Warrant and vital shared databases”.Additional reporting from agencies\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Here, leading Conservative Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg offers his view:THE EU has taken an almost religious approach to Britain’s latest move towards securing a Brexit deal.The compromise put forward by my fellow MP Kit Malthouse has been immediately dismissed and any prospect of further negotiation turned away. The mighty EU has spoken and will not be gainsaid.In negotiating the compromise, both Leavers and Remainers made concessions. This has led to criticism from their supporters, as I found in my weekly radio show on LBC.Callers felt that I had become a “snowflake” in my willingness to see £billion of taxpayers’ money spent without giving us any advantage in future negotiations.The legal basis for the EU demanding money is weak. A House of Lords report came to the conclusion that while there could be a moral obligation, under UK, EU and international law there was no valid or forceful claim.The only motive for paying is to secure a good future deal, rather than to pay a ransom for our freedom.Yet I have come to the conclusion that leaving on March  is at risk and exiting the EU is a prize worth paying for and on which thewill be great.Unfortunately, in spite of the Referendum result, the majority of MPs are reluctant to see the UK part from the EU and at the least want terms that mirror our membership.This may well not be the view of most voters, who seem to welcome the clean break and are not fearful of the scare stories.It is, therefore, crucial to ensure the fears of those who are far from enthusiastic Brexiteers are assuaged. This is where the Malthouse Compromise comes in.By offering money and making the prospect of a No Deal Brexit unlikely, possible moderate former Remainers are willing to avoid Parliamentary tactics that would frustrate our departure.They can accept the replacement of the backstop, which could keep us tied in to the EU’s rules and courts forever, with a routine trade agreement based on existing processes commonly used around the world.This would not hamper the development of a future relationship which would be discussed once we have left. Although in these discussions we would lose the leverage of cash, we would not be squeezed by the backstop.The second stage of the compromise is that the implementation period could be extended by one year. Currently the withdrawal agreement proposes a maximum of two years.In this time we would remain subject to EU laws and what follows, but it makes the prospect of not finalising a future relationship less likely, which gives comfort to those who are determined to avoid No Deal.In my view, an extra  months of vassalage after  years is an unwelcome but not unaffordable price to pay. Critics may ask why Brexiteers want to lessen the chance of a No Deal departure — and the reason is simple.Regardless of the folly of Project Fear, which becomes more preposterous by the day, the Parliamentary arithmetic means we must either lessen the prospect by compromise or it will be done by sharp practice in the House of Commons.This could lead to delay or even no Brexit at all. This would destroy any remaining trust of politicians in our constitutional settlement, it would show reckless contempt for voters, yet the Brexit-denying amendment put forward by Yvette Cooper last week was only defeated by  votes.As with all compromises, Malthouse is not perfect but is enough for each side of the argument in the UK to accept.The question remains, will the EU response be positive  So far, it has not.This has always been at the heart of the debate, and in a way a compelling reason for going. Is the EU a Mafia-style organisation that has to punish countries that do not subscribe to its religion Their response to the Malthouse Compromise and the PM’s request to re-open the text will answer this question. It must be clear to the EU that the current withdrawal agreement will not do.Defeated in the Commons by the largest margin ever achieved in the lower house on Government business, it is simply too one-sided and allows too great a triumph to the EU.If the EU were to insist on its inalterability requiring the punishment of a recalcitrant, freedom-loving nation then it will reveal its true and barbarous colours. It would be evident on its own that we are right to leave.How much better it would bethis were wrong and that in fact the EU is the civilised organisation it claims to be — respecting democracy, the nation state and constitutional procedures.

Her squabbling party has called a temporary truce. And nobody, including the EU, wants Jeremy Corbyn to take control.Even Labour MPs are rallying behind her — at a price. And working-class voters have given the Tories a healthy seven-point lead. They might even win a snap election.Played skilfully, this could win a deal that satisfies both Remainers and Leavers.Yet there are fears Mrs May will use it to revive her wretched Chequers plan, which sparked the resignations of Boris Johnson and David Davis, or the botched deal thrown out last month by a -vote margin.She has made a worrying start by apparently binning the No Deal card — the only one that truly scares the EU. Mrs May has no intention of playing this ace — and never had.There are other worrying signs.This showdown with EU hardliners requires fresh thinking and shrewd advice from seasoned players. Crawford Falconer, an ex-World Trade Organisation ambassador, was recruited by the Brexit department for precisely these skills.Indeed, he is the ONLY person in the Government machine who has ever negotiated a trade deal.Yet bafflingly, Mrs May is keeping this star player on the sidelines.Instead, she will fly to Brussels with Whitehall mandarin Olly Robbins, the pro-EU fanatic who plunged Britain into the backstop trap she is now under pressure to escape from.Robbins hates Brexit and has privately warned the PM this is Mission Impossible.Mrs May — herself a Remainer who has never grasped the case for Brexit — will be joined by trusted “deputy PM” David Lidington, a dyed-in-the-wool Brussels worshipper.In such company, even the inclusion in her team of a thundering Brexiteer Attorney-General Geoffrey Cox is only mildly reassuring.Mrs May is notoriously stubborn. She can also be devious.After nearly three years, even her closest political colleagues — who can be counted on one hand with a couple of missing digits — have no idea what her Brexit might look like.Voters are increasingly irritated by this foot-dragging.Why should we remain part of an organisation that wants to punish us by stealing Gibraltar, Northern Ireland and our car industry Nobody who watched the brutal humiliation of poor little Greece will be surprised. This tragic and insolvent nation should never have been admitted to the EU, still less the Eurozone.Only with the assistance of US banking giant Goldman Sachs — “The Vampire Squid” — got them in under the wire. Once inside, they launched a borrowing and spending binge which ended in tears in the  crash.Greece might have flourished as a cheap but lovely tourist economy. Instead, it is now being cruelly tormented by Brussels and lumbered with multi-billion euros debts it can never repay.Greece symbolises all that is wrong with arrogant Brussels — the catastrophic Euro, inflexible economic policies and mass unemployment for under-s.Above all, there is the sneering contempt of unsackable Eurocrats for the million people they rule from subsidised ivory towers.Theresa May is a poor negotiator who never truly believed No Deal is better than a bad deal.Without this implicit threat, Brussels will give little and demand much in . It would be a pleasure to eat my words and watch Mrs May play a blinder.She can use her good luck to land a historic victory. Or she can blink and condemn Britain to colony status, paying billions more into EU coffers while being led by the nose on trade deal promises that never materialise.In which case, forget about that snap election fantasy.The Conservative Party would never be forgiven by the .million voters who voted Brexit — or those who wish they had.SECURITY CHIEFS are dusting off Cold War plans anticipating a Soviet nuclear strike to whisk the Queen to safety in the event of . . .  er . . . a No Deal Brexit.Presumably The Mall will be cleared of traffic and used as a landing strip to fly Her Maj out before revolutionary Remainers string her up for supporting Brexit.The only question is whether she will go quietly.The royals refused to leave London even after Buckingham Palace was bombed during the Second World War.This Project Fear nonsense is even more insane than the idea that thousands will die of fruit shortages.To quote Corporal Jones: “Don’t panic!!”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Do they not want Britain to succeed Do they not see that their bizarre, condescending attitude is EXACTLY why they lost in  THE rocketing suicide rate amongst teenagers is nothing short of a national crisis.And the solution MUST involve the social media firms who are profiting from youngsters’ suffering.They have been given quite enough warning that they are not doing enough to protect vulnerable kids.They have said for years that they just need a bit more time, and that they’d fix the problem themselves.Well, they’ve failed.Government has no choice but to step in – and it needs a concerted effort from the Education, Health and Culture Departments.One more tragic death is one too many.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s the wild exaggerations of Project Fear II about No Deal anarchy.It’s the Remainer MPs who voted to trigger Article , then lied to voters about respecting the referendum result even as they plotted to reverse it.It’s the brass-necked Tory MP who claimed “Brexiteers were lying when they said Nissan was going nowhere” — long after it was clear the war on diesel was really to blame for the U-turn on the new model in Sunderland.Next to all that, an over-optimistic prediction or two and a slightly inaccurate bus slogan look small beer.Lies  Remain ultras should look in the mirror.TO Corbyn’s disgust, the Government has recognised a new leader in Venezuela instead of the hard-left loon Maduro who has let millions starve.What’s Jezza’s alternative  Do nothing. Leave them to whatever grim fate awaits.Why  Because any Western intervention, even the aid they now desperately need, will prove that his lelong ideology has failed catastrophically. Again.His cult know it too. So they have a new tactic: Pretend they were never cheerleaders for the political system that has destroyed a once-rich country.It is a pack of lies.For years they touted Venezuela as their economic and social dream.They’re on the wrong side of history. They must not be allowed to dodge blame by rewriting their own.WHAT possessed Tory chairman Brandon Lewis to hound a woman over a porn snap she allegedly “liked” on Twitter His every focus should be on raising funds and attracting new blood to a party whose flagging membership has an average age in the late s.Instead he foolishly thinks there’s political advantage in shaming a Labour candidate over a smutty pic.

Ever.You cannot ever even call in sick as that is not allowed.We are British, but generally cannot ever manage to hire British due to poor work ethics.Following the row, Jullian has stood by his views, claiming that the work ethic of Brits are inferior to those from Eastern Europe.Jullian said: Our experience of running a small, private, family-run coffee shop in Hove is that the very poorest type of employee is a British one. Full stop.The last candidate you want to take on - and we try ardently to hire everyone - is British.He added that Brits take advantage of the fact they have a benefit system and theyre not motivated to earn money.Jullian said his business has been hit with floods of bad reviews online from angry Brits after Victoria posted screenshots of their conversation on Facebook.A TUC spokesperson said: “If he’s looking for the title of Britain’s Worst Boss, it sounds like he’s going about it the right way.“It’s illegal to discriminate against job applicants based on their ethnicity.

There is a demon inside her, a devil!”In court Kobzeva - who faces up to  years in jailconvicted - told the judge that she had been drinking beer at the same time as taking medication before she attacked the child.She had gone to check on Nadya who was watching TV and “suddenly saw Gollum from The Lord of the Rings” who “stared” at her and was “loudly laughing”.She left the room fearing a delusion, drank more beer, then ed and “once again saw a laughing monster from the saga of the British writer”.The girl’s mother, Oksana Baleyko, , said: “She beat and kicked Nadya and finally grabbed a hammer from the balcony.”Kobzeva hit the girl repeatedly over the head.“The woman said she remembers nothing until she woke up only next day when she was already in jail.”Nadya told her mother that the neighbour tried to strangle her.Baleyko said: “Then Galina beat Nadya’s head against the floor, and grabbed a hammer and struck her on the head.“Doctors told us that she used a kne too because Nadya’s head was covered with stabs and cuts.“Then she tried to push Nadya out of the window but my daughter actively resisted and shouted.“Galina then beat her against a window sill and finally pushed her down from the balcony…”Medical documents highlighted in court show Nadya suffered concussion and head injuries including multiple cuts and bruises.After four months in hospital, she was given the all-clear in October.She was still in hospital in January for her sixth birthday.Oksana said she “trusted” the neighbour before the attack and the woman was always “friendly” with Nadya.Kobzeva was deemed mentally fit to stand trial.The next hearing is due on  February."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000467138663.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"couple save money refuse heating years","story":"Joanne and Jim Bell say theyve adapted so well to the chill that neither of them have fallen ill in that time.Despite freezing British winters the couple of Yelland, Devon have no intention of quitting.And they have saved thousands of pounds too.They recently spent £ attending live concerts by Neil Young and Bob Dylan with the money they saved on heating bills.Wildle lover Mrs Bell said the move was originally made in protest at the proleration of wind farms.But now their bodies had adapted so well it had become normal.She said: It feels uncomfortable when Im in other peoples houses now.Its too warm for me.Our heating bills used to be about £ a year so weve saved thousands over ten years.When it gets very cold we just wear plenty of layers and use hot water bottles.I dont notice the cold any more.Weve got two dogs and do plenty of walking which keeps you warm.It cant be that bad because neither of us has been ill in that time.Im a wildle lover and when I saw so many birds being killed by the blades of the wind turbines popping up everywhere I just felt I wanted to do something.Now I dont know any dferent - Im so used to it.Mrs Bell,  added: “Im not recommending it for everyone.If you have sick or elderly relatives you simply couldn’t do it – oryou have young children it wouldn’t be possible.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000402655327-e1528307444665.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"what brexit backstop plan theresa may eu irish border vote latest","story":"The Prime Minister spoke at the Northern Irish border on Tuesday February  to deliver a speech regarding the border. Heres the latest on the tricky talking point.The backstop plan is essentially a safety netthere is no Brexit trade deal.It would avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.Also, it would ensure that no tarfs, quotas, rules of origin or customs processes would be applied to UK-EU trade.But it is unclearthe UK would be able to strike free trade agreements with other countries while the backstop endured.And it is feared the UK would end up being trapped in the customs union. The PM is now hoping to negotiate a way around this.On January  the Prime Minister succeeded in a parliamentary vote which united her party behind a plan to rewrite the deal to address concerns about the Irish backstop.In dramatic scenes, Tory and rebel Labour MPs voted by a margin of  to  to back a plan - the Brady amendment - which requires the PM to replace the Agreements controversial backstop with alternative arrangements to keep the Irish border open after Brexit.But senior figures in Brussels, Berlin, Paris and Dublin resisted the demand from May as the clock ticks down to the UKs departure from the European Union on March .Speaking in Belfast yesterday, the PM vowed to back a joint bid for the  World Cup by all the countries of the British Isles.And she pledged that after Brexit, the UK will have a closer relationship with Irelandthan with any other European country.Mrs May also risked angering her MPs by suggesting she might not ditch the backstop after all.In a speech aimed squarely at winning goodwill from Dublin, the PM said: Our relationship with Ireland is deeper than our relationship with any of the other . It is uniquely rooted in ties of family, history and geography.The recent past has been a moment of reflection in the UK and Ireland as we have commemorated the centenary of a series of key events in our shared history.Today those ties of family and friendship between our countries are more important than they have ever been.And I believe there is a yearning in the hearts of all the peoples of these islands for a close and trusting relationship between all of us, and an absolute horror that we should take even a single step backwards in the progress we have collectively achieved.She proposed annual meetings between the British and Irish governments after Brexit to ensure the two countries work closely together.She promised to lobby Mrs May on the issue when they hold talks in Belfast tomorrow.She said: We will be reiterating our opposition to the current backstop. And the fact that Parliament has now backed that position means that she has a clear mandate to go back to Brussels.The current backstop is toxic to those of us living in Northern Ireland, and indeed for unionists right across the United Kingdom, because it would cause the break-up of the United Kingdom into the medium and longer term.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Personally, I didn’t.What I hope we’re all agreed on, though, is the fact that Danny’s too busy playing Danny Dyer, the professional geezer, to be a good listener or natural TV historian.It’s an act that worked, of course, when he was wondering, “Eleanor of Aquitaine, was she a looker ” but didn’t serve him so well when presented with a longbow.“Long, innit ”The Beeb clocked this before production started, obviously, so had paired him up with dozens of head-patting historians and actors who got him to dress up as every kind of medieval t**t you can imagine. Like Mr Benn on crack, it was.Armour, codpieces, nappies, tights, doublet and hose, and a gigantic white smock, bleached with human urine, which had one grovelling “courtier” wondering: “Has all the p*** been washed out, my Lord King ”A good question.We didn’t actually get the answer, though, until part two, on Wednesday, when, after a brief detour round his ancestors, Louis IX of France, William the Conqueror and Henry II, viewers got to the nub of things, with Professor Chris Given-Wilson explaining the agonising death of Edward II: “By thrusting a hollow instrument, like the end of a trumpet, up his fundament.”“’Old on a minute,” said a rattled Danny. “He’s been stabbed  With a trumpet ”“Into his fundament.” Long pause.“Don’t tell me it’s up his a**e ”Right up it, Danny, with a red-hot poker. News which didn’t just do his “nut in”, it seemed to derail the entire documentary.They ran out of direct royal ancestors shortly afterwards as well, and the BBC adopted its stupid default setting in such circumstances. It turned Danny’s Right Royal Family into a dance and cookery show, complete with demonstrations of both, from medieval experts.It was about this time I also sussed out what was going on in the background, with all those winsome historians. An audition.The BBC was using it to find its new face of history, though why any of the blokes turned up is a mystery. Auntie’s already made it clear: “The days of white, middle-aged men explaining stuff are over.”Danny, on the other hand, can be tolerated, because he’s their new performing Cockney. A novelty act who can be dressed up and patronised so much he ended this one doing some weird medieval can-can, with his family, in front of his lost ancestral pile.A trumpet wasn’t quite shoved up his fundament as they danced, but the p*** had very much been washed out of him, my Lord King.GREAT TV lies and delusions of the month. “I think it’s going to be a really great show.” Cheryl Tweedy, The Greatest Dancer.“We do TV shows and we’re national treasures.” Jedward, Celebrity Coach Trip.“People will remember my name and I love that.” Some t**t off Ship- wrecked.IF you’re to take anything from the news experts have claimed Monday, January  was the most depressing day of the year, it’s probably the fact the experts clearly never sat through what happened eight days later, on Tuesday, January .Britain’s Top  Dogs Live: .

Can she pull it off  Joan points to the spot and it’s one, two, three pups between her legs.”CHANNEL ’s Pure is a comedy drama about a woman who suffers from the sixth sense of seeing naked people and is so tormented by her condition she screams: “F***ing stop.

In a bombshell letter  days before Brexit, the Labour leader has shted his red lines and offered Theresa May a clear way to leave the EU -she backs a full customs union. It meansshe accepts his demands, Mrs May can get a House of Commons majority for Brexit. But firstly, thats a huge  that could split the Tories. Secondly, it throws a huge spanner in the works hours before the Prime Minister meets EU chiefs in Brussels today. And thirdly, its enraged some Labour MPs who want Jeremy Corbyn to stop helping the government push through Brexit - and back a second EU referendum instead. All that means its a long shot, and probably wont happen. But its still an important intervention in Brexit. So what is new today, how has Labour changed its position, and why are Remainer MPs angry  Heres our guide - and the letter in full.  Labours leader has written a letter to Theresa May, saying he WILL back her on a Brexit dealit meets five demands:A permanent, UK-wide customs union with the EU Close alignment with the EU single market Dynamic alignment on rights and protections, so UK standards keep pace with new ones in the EU Clear commitments on participation in EU agencies Unambiguous agreements on future securityMr Corbyn has already held talks with the Prime Minister and more are expected to follow. He promises to discuss his proposal with her in a constructive way to secure a sensible agreement. He says compromise is now needed to please both the EU and the House of Commons, which voted down the -page Brexit deal by a record majority last month. How has his position changed   Labour already backed a customs union. But this change in tactics is vital. Firstly, the letter means Labour has officially ditched its six tests a Brexit deal would have to meet before being backed. The tests were unveiled in March . They were based partly on Tory promises about Brexit, but included ambitions that were obviously impossible - such as securing the exact same benefits the UK currently has. They were derided as bollocks by Shadow Trade Secretary Barry Gardiner. Today the very same Mr Gardiner told the BBC: Its not about tests now. What we are doing is saying we believe that these are the options that are available that would actually secure a majority in the House of Commons. Secondly, it means Labour is putting calls for a second EU referendum firmly on the back burner - despite huge pressure within the party. Labour pledged to keep a second EU referendum as an option on the table thanks to a motion at the party conference last year. Remainers say Labour should campaigning for that public vote NOW, having failed to force a general election. But Jeremy Corbyn is against it. Thirdly, there is no mention in the letter of delaying Brexit. Labour has said extending the March  date may be inevitable. But this shows the party is still striving to help get a soft Brexit through as soon as it can. Why are some Labour MPs furious   Labour Remain-backers have voiced their fury at Jeremy Corbyn for - in their words - enabling Brexit. They want him to back a second EU referendum instead. And the words of Shadow Trade Secretary Barry Gardiner, who quoted Theresa May herself, wont help. He said: Jeremy is trying to set out what we believe is needed to make a success of Brexit. Labour MP Chuka Umunna blasted: This is not opposition, it is the facilitation of a deal which will make this country poorer. Labour MP Owen Smith said: “Backing Brexit - even on these terms - would still shrink our economy, cost jobs and lost investment, indulge nativist nostalgia and isolationism. Fellow Remainer MP Chris Leslie said: “Seriously  Offering to help Tory Govt enable Brexit  It’s not just Labour’s conference policy in the bin. When the jobs go  revenues for services dry up as a result, Labour’s leadership will have ZERO right to complain: they share responsibility.” Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi wrote sarcastically: Nice to be briefed about this @UKLabour @WelshLabour. If at ANY point you would like to consult MPs and also take the Labour Party conference motion into consideration... Just let me know... Cheers...  For the first time, it means Theresa May doesnt need to change the backstop - or appease Tory Brexiteers - to get her deal through. The backstop is an insurance clause that would trap the UK under EU customs rules from , in exchange for keeping the Irish border open. The Prime Minister is meeting EU chiefs in Brussels today to try and tweak the clause. Shes done that because Tory Brexiteers said otherwise, theres no way they would pass the Brexit deal. Yet EU chiefs say they wont change the backstop, leaving talks deadlocked. Now Labour claims it has a way out by offering that permanent customs union - arranged, crucially, through the future framework and not the -page exit deal that contains the backstop. If she backs it, Labour claims, Theresa May wont need Tory Brexiteer help to get a Commons majority. Barry Gardiner said: What were saying is actually you can do this another way. What you can do is say lets look at the future political framework, andthe future political framework were agreed now between the EU and ourselves to be a customs union, then actually theres no problem at that point when you get to the end of the transition period, because youre already in a customs union and therefore you dont need the backstop.  Theresa May has made clear she wants to be able to strike trade deals around the world. If the UK is in a full customs union with the EU, she cant do that. And Labour proposed a customs union before - only to be defeated in the House of Commons. Evenshe did fold and accept a customs union, the row over it could split Theresa Mays party for good. Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg once warned of a revolt the size of that over the Victorian-era Corn Laws. There is one important upshot though. If Theresa May refuses Jeremy Corbyns offer, he can reasonably pin the blame on herit leads to a No Deal Brexit.  Theresa May is meeting EU chiefs including Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels today. Theyre likely to brush her off, a day after saying Tory Brexiteers who had no plan have a special place in hell. Then shes travelling to Dublin on Friday night for dinner with Irish premier Leo Varadkar. Hes likely to brush her off too. But in between and afterwards, theres a window for talks with Jeremy Corbyn and his top team about the offer. David Lidington, her de facto deputy, said there would be a channel open to Labour. Shes unlikely to have a new deal ready by next week, meaning MPs will get a vote directing the way forward on February . That could bind her hands, delay Brexit, or just leave us in more deadlock as time ticks down to March .  Dear Prime Minister, Thank you for taking the time to meet last week to discuss the Brexit negotiation and our alternative approaches to finding a deal that can command support in Parliament and be negotiated with the EU. There is, as was demonstrated last week, a clear majority in Parliament that no deal must now be taken off the table and that there can be noto a hard border in Northern Ireland in any circumstance. We recognise that your priority is now to seek legally binding changes to the backstop arrangements contained within the Withdrawal Agreement, as we discussed when we met. However, without changes to your negotiating red lines, we do not believe that simply seeking modications to the existing backstop terms is a credible or sufficient response either to the scale of your defeat last month in Parliament, or the need for a deal with the EU that can bring the country together and protect jobs. As you have said many times before, the EU has been clear that any withdrawal agreement would need to include a backstop to guarantee noto a hard border on the island of Ireland. Labour has long argued that the Government should change its negotiating red lines and seek signicant changes to the Political Declaration to provide clarity on our future relationship and deliver a closer economic relationship with the EU. That would also ensure that any backstop would be far less likely to be invoked. The changes we would need to see include: * A permanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union. This would include alignment with the union customs code, a common external tarf and an agreement on commercial policy that includes a UK say on future EU trade deals. We believe that a customs union is necessary to deliver the frictionless trade that our businesses, workers and consumers need, and is the only viable way to ensure there is no hard border on the island of Ireland. As you are aware, a customs union is supported by most businesses and trade unions. * Close alignment with the Single Market. This should be underpinned by shared institutions and obligations, with clear arrangements for dispute resolution. * Dynamic alignment on rights and protections so that UK standards keep pace with evolving standards across Europe as a minimum, allowing the UK to lead the way. * Clear commitments on participation in EU agencies and funding programmes, including in areas such as the environment, education, and industrial regulation. * Unambiguous agreements on the detail of future security arrangements, including access to the European Arrest Warrant and vital shared databases. We believe these negotiating objectives need to be enshrined in law before the UK leaves the EU to provide certainty for businesses and a clear framework for our future relationship. We recognise that any negotiation with the EU will require flexibility and compromise. Our first priority must be a deal that is best for jobs, living standards, our communities, in the context of increased and more equitable investment across all regions and nations of the UK. That approach should guide how alignment with EU regulations is to be maintained in future, as well discussions on dispute resolution, the role of the ECJ, and competition and migration rules. EU leaders have been clear that such changes to the Political Declaration and a closer relationship are possiblesuch a request is made by the UK government andthe current red lines change. We believe that a close economic relationship along these lines would make it far less likely that any backstop arrangements would ever be needed. The Government’s failure to secure a deal that can command the support of Parliament means time has run out for the necessary preparation and for legislation to be finalised. Following last week’s rejection by the House of Commons of ‘no deal’, all necessary steps must be taken to avoid such an outcome. My colleagues and I look forward to discussing these proposals with you further, in the constructive manner in which they are intended, with the aim of securing a sensible agreement that can win the support of parliament and bring the country together.

Tory ministers are revoking the EU law which guarantees UK citizens pay the same for using their phone on the Continent as they do at home. That will leave mobile phone firms free to hike costs whenever they like after the UK leaves. Guaranteed free roaming launched across the EU just  months ago - and meant big savings. But that guarantee will be scrappedthere is no deal, thanks to an obscure law laid before Parliament this week.   The current system caps the costs charged between EU and UK phone operators, letting them pass on the savings to customers. But the Mobile RoamingRegulations admit these caps will have no legal forcethere is no Brexit deal. That means phone giants could see their wholesale costs spiral, making roaming packages unaffordable and forcing them to push up costs, the government warns. Under the new rules, customers will still be prompted once theyve spent pound to prevent massive accidental bills. Travellers will also be prompted when theyve hit % and % of their data allowance. But it will spell the end of guaranteed free roaming across the EU, notes on the new law admit.  Alex Neill of consumer group Which  told HuffPost UK: “Anyto sky-high charges for using mobile phones abroad would be a bitter blow for millions of consumers. “The government should seek to avoid these charges by securing a deal with the EU. Butthat is not the outcome, companies must be absolutely clear about any extra charges their customers could be facing. Back when warnings first emerged about an end to roaming, the government insisted firms would not hike charges because of market competition. But MoneySavingExpert revealed last week that just two out of  major UK phone firms have guaranteed to keep free roaming in a No Deal Brexit . Most said they had no plans to raise charges - but stopped short of giving a cast-iron guarantee.  Consumer groups lobbied the government to keep roaming free by law. But after careful consideration the government did not agree, because it would pass all the costs on to phone firms. That, in turn, could have pushed up the cost of mobile phone tarfs overall to compensate, an explanatory note to the new law says. Shadow Brexit minister Jenny Chapman said: “These proposals prove that it will be holidaymakers and businesses that are forced to pay the price for this government’s incompetence. “It’s unacceptable that these plans have been snuck out. Ministers need to start being straight with the British public about the consequences of no deal and take it off the table once and for all.  The anti-Brexit group Best For Britain branded the fiasco the Last Days of Roam and claimed business travellers could be forced to pay pound more per month. Lib Dem MP Layla Moran said: The cost of a hard Brexit on British travellers is becoming abundantly clear. Millions of people are facing higher costs to make calls and texts abroad because of the Prime Ministers botched Brexit plans. A Department for Culture, Media and Sport spokesperson said: “The Statutory Instrument removes references to the EU mobile roaming framework from UK law to ensure our laws are effective andin the event we leave the EU without a deal. “It gives mobile operators legal clarity as to which laws they are subject to following EU withdrawal.” "},{"url":null,"title":"theres not much going politics","story":"NewsTheres not much going on with politics and Brexit so MPs have taken a half dayThe House of Commons rose four hours early today at .pm because there wasnt much to doShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical reporter:,  FEB News\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email MPs took a half day today, because, you know, theres not much going on with Brexit and whatever.Business announced by the Government was thin on the ground for Wednesday, so theCommonsbegan sitting began at .am and ended at .pm. TheCommonsusually runs until .pm on Wednesdays. And with Brexit still  days away, its totally understandable that Ministers chose to take a leisurely approach. Thousands of pages of UK laws need updating to cope with Britains departure from the EU, and theyll need scrutinising by MPs by the end of March. But we guess thats a job for another day.  Labours Diana Johnson said the situation was bang out of order, writing on Twitter : Considering Brexit is just  days away this is totally irresponsible! SNP chief whip Patrick Gray said: Seemingly the Tory Government thinks theres nothing worth debating or discussing.Proceedings began with Cabinet Office questions followed by Prime Ministers Questions. Ten minutes were then used up by the introduction of a backbench bill, before a debate on two social security motions. The adjournment debate focused on prostate cancer and started at .pm rather than pm, as would normally be the case. Elsewhere in Parliament, MPs were involved in afternoon debates in Westminster Hall - their second debating chamber - while proceedings in the House of Lords chamber began at pm and were predicted to run until pm.   The Government last week announced it was cancelling the February recess for MPs, and legislation connected to Brexit still has to be approved. Valerie Vaz, Labours Shadow Commons Leader said: “Theresa Mays zombie Government continues lurching from one crisis to the next. While the Government has been locked in bitter infighting and chaos over their botched Brexit negotiations, the needs of the country have been completely neglected. “This Government has no vision, no new ideas and crucially no legislation to fill the Parliamentary timetable.Best for Britain supporter and Labour MP Virendra Sharma said: “This is not on. Parliament still has tons of legislation to get through before the end of March, including thousands of pages of statutory instruments.   “Brexit is the most important legislative and political process since the Second World War. It makes no sense to go home and avoid working on ensuring the country’s future when there’s so little time left.”Downing Street insisted there was a lot of work going on. The Prime Ministers official spokesman said: The business of the House is set out in advance, there have been days recently where they have been working beyond midnight dealing with statements and with debates on Brexit.   I think this week they have been dealing with some important domestic statutory instruments and other signicant issues which are going to be debated in the coming days.

Adrian Hoare, , is accused of doing nothing when -year-old Stephen Waterson allegedly squashed three-year-old Alfie Lamb during a trip in his Audi convertible last February. Testying at the Old Bailey, she said she was scared of Waterson - and felt little when he bragged about his important family. Waterson was previously accused in court of using the fact his father is ex-Tory minister Nigel Waterson to make himself untouchable. She said she called her son my little noodle and fatpants. Hoare said: Hewas good with him. They had a bond as well. She said that Waterson also had a nickname for Alfie, calling him Tarzan. Asked about another name used for Alfie and she replied: Little s***.  Katy Thorne, QC, defending Hoare, asked: What about the name little s***  She replied: It was just another name it was not to be nasty or horrible it was just another name. Hoare told the court that both her and Waterson had hit Alfie in the past but only little taps. Waterson told the Old Bailey he lied to police after the incident because he was worried that he would get in trouble because the driver of the car, Marcus Lamb, had been disqualied. He told emergency operators he had been driving by and stopped to help try and revive Alfie.  The couple then claimed Alfie had been injured in a taxi which had driven off. A message sent from Hoare to Waterson just hours after the incident at .pm on February  of last year was read to the jury. It said: They know that we are lying. Duncan Atkinson, prosecuting,said: Even before you had reached the hospital you did not know what lies she had told the police, you were trying to get her alone and away from the police. Waterson answered: No-one was allowed in the room with Alfie, Alfie was with doctors. I did not know what lies she had told the police.  Mr Atkinson said: You were trying to get her alone. Waterson asked him: Is it a crime to be alone with your partner  He added: I have already admitted lying in the beginning, I have pleaded guilty to it, lies were told, I did not want to get anyone in trouble. Waterson is accused of deliberately moving his seat back because he was annoyed at Alfies crying. Giving evidence at the Old Bailey, Hoare said she felt scared when her partner was annoyed or angry, adding: You never knew how he was going to react to things. The hairdresser told jurors how police had been called after an incident in Gravesend, Kent, the year before Alfie died. She said she had been at a friends house when she heard Waterson had been seeing another woman. I asked him over the phone what was going on and we started arguing. He had come down to Gravesend in the car and asked me to go and speak to him. I had gone to speak to him and he had said that to me to get in the car. He started driving stupidly and he was shouting at mehe did not carehe killed us in the car. He was driving at speed and he did not carethere was other cars coming towards him or anything, she said.  Katy Thorne QC, defending, asked: When he said he did not carehe killed us, who was us  Hoare replied: I had just found out I was pregnant at the time. He was saying himself, me and the baby. She went on: I was scared and I eventually got him to stop the car. He then took me back down to near where my friends car was and went back to her house to speak to the police. My friends had been ringing Stephens phone trying to get him to take me back to the house and saying they would ring the policehe didnt.  Ms Thorne asked Hoareshe knew Watersons family had some important jobs. Hoare replied: He used to put it in conversation, yeah. Asked how it made her feel, she said: Little compared to him but I didnt really have anything. Hoare described Alfie as like any normal three-and-a-half-year-old boy. The defendant, who had a troubled upbringing in Gravesend, said: He could be naughty. He would try to climb about. He had a good imagination. Hoare said she used to call Alfie her little noodle and fat pants, while Waterson used the nickname Tarzan.  On February  last year, Alfie was captured on CCTV running around and holding his mothers hand. Hoare said Alfie had been happy on the shopping trip but began getting tired and stroppy. On Watersons relationship with her son, Hoare said: There had been times that Stephen had told him not to do something or he would tell him to be quiet and Alfie would not listen so he had got annoyed with him sometimes. Hoare denied she had hit her son, but said both she and Waterson would tap his hand. She told how she met Waterson in  after she moved to Blackpool for a fresh start. Her previous boyfriend was jailed for setting fire to her house in Gravesend, jurors were told.  Waterson had a big personality and was nice but did not like her speaking to other people, she said. Hoare suspected he had been unfaithful with ious women during their relationship. But she said: When I confronted him with it, he said I was being silly, I was being paranoid. Hoare and Waterson, of Croydon, south London, have denied manslaughter and the trial continues.

Adam Lamb said the teen smiled at him and was chewing her sleeve as she walked past him in the street in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, on May , . He had closed a car door to make it easier for her to pass, reports Nottinghamshire Live. She smiled asto say thanks. She was chewing her sleeve and walked along Westfield Lane, he told the inquest. She was looking into the bushes asshe was going inside them and then she was gone. After a TV appeal, Mr Lamb dialled  the next night and passed on details, saying he believed she was aged between nine or .  Chief superintendent Rob Grfin, for Nottinghamshire Police, who is responsible for missing person teams, said police officers spoke to Mr Lamb, but he was among many callers who reported sightings although they did not know her. Unfortunately the officers didnt ask Mr Lamb to take them to the scene and conduct a more thorough search, he said. Mr Lamb was like many others who describes a person who generally fits the bill for Amber rather than I know Amber. The bushes were dense and Mr Grfin said officers would have been forgiventhey had not found her hanged. A pathologist said there was no evidence others were involved in her death.  The inquest was told Ambers mother suspected her of attention seeking on the night she left home. PC Nicola Roe filled in a missing person form while speaking to mother Kelly Peat. She was told Amber had been asked to empty a cool box, was not happy about it and left. Assistant Coroner Laurinda Bower, who is conducting the hearing at the Council House in the city, asked about her observations of Mrs Peat. She seemed matter of fact when she was describing the situation, the officer said. The coroner asked: Did that surprise you  The officer said: Not really, to be honest. She seemed not particularly emotional or upset, maybe frustrated.  She described her background, referred to Amber throwing temper tantrums, what she called attention seeking. Mrs Peat said Amber had gone missing before and ed home safely.The mother seemed well rehearsed in giving information the officer said. PC Roe told the coroner: They expected her back the next morning. The coroner askedshe knew the family went to Tesco and had their tea before alerting the police that Amber was missing. PC Roe answered: I dont remember being told that or discussing specics with them. The inquest heard Ambers case was initially classed as medium risk by Nottinghamshire Police. When she had disappeared before while living in Derbyshire, that force graded them as high given her personal circumstances the coroner said. The inquest continues.

Paying tribute, Ms Majors sister, Emily Major, , said: You can see from the pictures how beautul and stunning my sister was. She was a loving and caring parent and a brilliant mother to her three-year-old son. She had a really distinctive and infectious laugh. At the inquest, coroner Professor Paul Marks said the evidence showed Ms Majors death was an accident.   Ms Majors father, Mark David Major, said she had been looking forward to spending time on two booked holidays. He said: I think it was just an accident. She was just wanting to get her high. Ellie did not mean to take her own le and under estimated the strength of her tablets.The mum-of-one had been diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a type of arthritis effecting her joints, when she was aged  and was prescribed painkillers to deal with the pain.An inquest into her death atHull Coroners Courtheard Ms Major had attempted to end her own le by overdosing on drugs in March , which resulted in her losing custody over her son. But it had taken six months for her to be assessed by mental health experts because she was not a high risk - a decision which her family said had contributed to her poor mental health.   Ms Majors social worker told the hearing that the young mum had been “at the bottom of her list” because she was at a low medium risk. She told the hearing through tears: When I found out about Ellie’s death I was following up an appointment with her. I never accepted it, and that is what has thrown me so much. When I spoke with Ellie, she reassured me that her previous attempt to take her own le was impulsive and she was very remourseful. But Ms Majors heartbroken mother Marie Mitchell, , said it was beyond her she had been deemed a low risk. She said: How they can say there is not an urgent risk for a mum who tried to take her own le is beyond me - and her first assessment only happened six months later. Service manager at the Humber NHS Trust Jo Kent had put together a report and said no lessons had been learnt since Ellie’s tragic death.  Workers at the mental health teams said that Ellie had not attended planned meetings. The family also demanded answers over why Ellie was still being given eight dferent types of medication, despite her using the drugs to take her own le previously. Mr Major said he grew concerned about his daughter when he did not receive a WhatsApp message from her. She was found dead in her home in Hessle on August , . Police Officer John Norcross found “boxes and bags of prescription drugs” across the property. PC Norcross told the hearing: There was no evidence of third party involvement or anything suspicious.  Dr Ian Richmond, consultant histopathologist, said that the medical cause of death was multiple drug toxicity. Concluding the inquest as an open conclusion, coroner Professor Paul Marks said the evidence showed Ms Majors death was an accident. He said: The evidence heard today could make me believe up to the civil standard of proof, that I am persuaded by her fathers communication, this is probably an accident. The family said they would be looking to lodge a complaint with the NHS and take things further. Her heartbroken mother Marie said: It is better than what we were expecting, but we still have a lot of unanswered questions which we couldnt ask because the GP didnt have Ellies notes in front of him.

Sun lovers Laurel Cormack and David Crook say the luxury five-star resort in Corfu looked like a swamp. They had been looking forward to spending two weeks at TUIs Mayor Verde Grand Resort in Agios Gordios, which has a well-publicised private beach. However when the couple got there they found the usually golden sands littered with towering ft-wide smelly seaweed mounds buzzing with flies. David claims they were only able to spend half a day on the hotel beach and had to abandon their sunbeds due to the seaweed-choked waters and head to the crowded hotel pool.   The recruitment consultant blasted TUIs cavalier attitude to their complaints and for failing to inform guests of the natural phenomenon in advance so they could make alternative plans. TUI said they were sorry to hear of their disappointment and would be in contact with them again. David, from Southend-on-Sea, Essex, said: Were very much beach people and always book hotels with their own piece of beach with them. If were relaxing we prefer to sit on the beach rather than by the pool as it always gets crowded. The black seaweed was in very long strips andyou put your foot in it it would stick to your legs. In the water it was ft deep.   The seaweed was smelly and had a lot of flies around it, the water wasnt clear either. The holiday wasnt as good as it could have been as the one facility we paid for [the beach], the whole reason we picked that hotel, we werent able to take advantage of. When we booked the holiday online I was expecting the golden sands I saw in the brochure, not mounds of stinking seaweed. The -year-old said both he and his customer service assistant we Laurel, , were taunted by glossy promotional videos displayed in the hotel showcasing the resorts unspoiled beaches.  David said: The really irritating thing was in the main reception they had a big -inch TV with a continuous looped video. It kept showing all the bits of the hotel that wed booked the holiday for and werent able to use because they were seaweeded out. They were even playing in the lts and showing the same thing - we couldnt get away from them. Grandad-of-one David said that diggers were out at am scooping up the seaweed from the sand and dumping it in mounds on the hotel area of the beach instead of taking it away. David said: When we complained about it the TUI rep shrugged her shoulders and said theres nothing we can do, the hotel and local authority is doing all they can.  The diggers were there a couple of hours from am on a few mornings trying to clear the beach but as fast as they moved it the seaweed ed. They werent removing it though just piling it up, it was an eyesore. Apparently a couple of weeks before we were there there was a dredger that took away about  tonnes of seaweed. We werent there for that but you dont order a dredger and get diggers on the beachits not a problem. We could have used the less affected public beach further along but that would have entailed paying for sunbeds, parasols and snacks which defeats the object of going all inclusive. Our argument has always been never about assigning blame or responsibility for the seaweed. Its a natural phenomena, its not the hotel or TUIs fault and I never said it was.  What I was really incensed about was the fact that all theyre doing is hiding behind it being a natural phenomena. It first started at the end of March and we went in June - theyd known about this for three months. Do they not monitor their resorts for this type of event  Do they not noty customers  If wed had an informed choice we wouldnt have cancelled our holiday, but we would have just gone to a dferent resort not affected by it. I dont want a load of money back, I just want them to hold their hands up and admit its something they should have made people aware of.  I wouldnt want other people to go through the experience, its just wrong. David complained to TUI in writing and said he was disappointed with their response - even receiving a missive thoughtlessly sent out. David said: I had an email from one TUI rep again explaining it was a natural phenomenon and that she was sorry about the incontinence this has caused. My first thought was that the email hadnt been put through spell check or checked for any autocorrects it was just speedily bashed out with little or no thought. Ive also tried speaking to them on the phone and on one glorious occasion was on hold for  minutes listening to a continuous loop of the same song - by the end of it I was losing the will to live. Dad-of-two David said the experience had put him off booking a TUI holiday in the future. David said: The cavalier attitude TUI took has meant that we will never use them again and nor would we recommend them. The amount we paid might not be a lot of money to a lot of people, but its a big chunk of money for us. Were not wealthy people were just normal working people - its our two weeks of rest and relaxation. TUIs whole attitude really disappointed me, its just left a really bad taste in the mouth. I never said it was their fault, all I was saying was do you not monitor your resorts for this kind of occurrences to let people know so they can make an informed choice about whether they want to proceed with it or not  A TUI spokesman said: Were sorry to hear of the Cormack partys disappointment and we will be in contact the customers directly once again to discuss in further detail.

Now Jacky Rom, from Romford in Essex, is desperate to trace the man caught up in the mix-up, because he was much nicer than the man she ended up meeting. Jackie had arranged to meet a man on dating app Plenty of Fish.When she arrived at the Fox and Raven in Chelmsford, she was excited to be greeted by a man with a twinkle in his eye, Essex Live reports.But sadly for her it turned out the mystery man was supposed to be on a date with someone  - and the mix-up only came to light when their real dates turned up. Now Jacky is desperate to find the man she thought she was meant to be dating.  Jacky, who has a -year-old daughter and has been single for nine months, spent Monday morning preparing for her first ever blind date, dressing to impress. She said: When I pulled up in the car park I saw a guy behind me and thought he looked nice, I did think it was a bit funny that he didnt say hello. I went inside and ordered a drink and sat down, when he walked in he came over to me straight away greeted me with a peck on the cheek and said I thought you were a red head. When he said that I didnt think much of it, because I have always had dferent coloured hair, I just thought I was pleased with my choice.   He had a twinkle in his eye and he was a gentleman, even though I wasnt what he expected when he saw me he said its ok, it doesnt matter. He then went over to the bar and got himself a drink, at which point my actual date walked in. It was only a matter of minutes that Jacky spent with the man she mistook for her date but she said: It didnt even occur to me he was the wrong person I didnt even think of that I thought oh a nice guy for a change. My actual date was no where near as nice as the other man, but we all at that point had realised what had happened and laughed about it. When the red head turned up shortly after the four went their separate ways and continued their dates.   Jacky, who is an author, said: It was so annoying, we were sat there chatting away and I was not giving him my full attention. I was thinking about pretending to go to the toilet and instead running outside and putting my business card on his car windscreen, because I knew what car he had as he followed me in. But after about  minutes they just left and I couldnt do anything, I didnt knowthey had had a good date or not. Jacky has been single for nine months and downloaded Plenty of Fish around a month ago to seeshe could find love, and this was her first ever blind date. She said: Its a shame I had the coffee with the wrong one. I would like the chance I missed. Now, having recovered from the embarrassment, she wants to track down the mystery man. The four shared a moment of awkwardness before laughing it off. Jacky described the man as being around  foot tall with an unusual haircut.

In April , Beth, who was later diagnosed with stage  bowel cancer. suffered tremendous pain while she was on the toilet. She told thethat she thought she was constipated while going to the toilet but was shocked to see blood.  I felt something was stuck, when I went to wipe it away there was a lot of blood and I could feel something fleshy, she said. She was taken to Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow by her husband for emergency check-up to be polyps, which are abnormal tumours that are often found in the bowels. Medical experts examined and confirmed that it was bowel cancer and it reached stage four. A month later, the mother-of-two started her gruelling six-month chemotherapy treatment.  Sadly, Beth had to undergo more surgery as she suffered from peripheral neuropathy, a damage to the nerves that are outside the brain and spinal cord. She remembered: I thought it was going to mean treatment was over. But three weeks after my reversal I developed a rectal, vaginal fistula - thats a hole between the two. Everything was coming out of the wrong place, it was awful. “Then I had to have my bum sewn up.” In November , a CT scan revealed spots on her lungs, meaning the cancer had spread.  Beth had to get back on chemotherapy in the hope that the treatment could prevent further spread and keep the cancer at bay extending her le. Following three more months of chemotherapy, she had her lungs operated on at The Royal Brompton. And Beth was finally declared cancer free. She told added: Right now Im back on chemotherapy to try and keep the cancer away as long as possible, but Im feeling OK as I am on a less aggressive treatment. I get tired and a few other relatively minor side effects, but thats a small price to pay to keep me here for a bit longer. Beth has got together with Bowel Cancer UK and Coloplast to help others talk about their symptoms with their GPs in attempt to raise awareness about bowel cancer. Bowel Cancer UK also advises the British public to familiarise themselves with warning signs.

He winces with pain as he plumps his grubby duvet and lies down, zipping the flap shut behind him Because in , roofer Steve broke his back in three places falling off a building, and sleeping on a wet, cold street is agony. “After the fall I lost my job and my home,” he croaks through a sore throat . “I came home to the Rhondda then ended up here on the streets six weeks ago. “I went to a hostel one night but got pick-pocketed while I was sleeping and the place was full of druggies.The second time I had night terrors and a member of staff woke me up by slapping me, hard.

There were some , homeless people in Wales last year – a rise of % in  months – with , in the capital. But the number of rough sleepers in Cardf doubled in three years, to around . Last month a Tory councillor was suspended, though later reinstated, for demanding their tents be “torn down” as they were harming local businesses. And since “tentgate” made headlines, even more people have appeared under canvas on the city’s streets.But Cardf has some of the best homeless services in the UK, with hundreds of places in council and charity-run hostels and outreach teams offering support. Every night there are least  surplus bed spaces. So why does anyone need to sleep in a tent or doorway   Rough sleepers say they feel safety on the streets and maintain their independence. Charities blame the lack of social housing, rent increases, welfare reforms and the Universal Credit debacle – along with an “explosion” in spice use and substance addiction in Cardf, and an increase in mental health issues.  Those they do help into accommodation cannot always maintain it, leading to what council outreach workers call “a revolving door of homelessness”. But tent dwellers like Steve dream of having a real front door again. So does Donna. She and her husband Paul, , have been living in a tent in the pedestrian shopping area for three weeks.  They were evicted on Donna’s th birthday, when their landlord suddenly sold up. Paul has recovered from a stroke and a heart attack and beaten bowel cancer, and both he and Donna have mental health issues. “We’ve been to a hostel, but never again,” she says. “It was filthy used needles in the shower, people openly taking drugs and robbing each other. It’s no good for you. “Sleeping in doorways is far too dangerous, so a tent is the best solution.  “It keeps you warm and dry and out of the way of the shop owners trying to make a living.” She invites me in to her immaculately kept tent. We sit on a brightly coloured patchwork blanket surrounded by all her belongings, lined up neatly or packed in bags. There is even an air freshener in the corner and a pint of milk keeping cool by the door. “I take pride in keeping it nice,” she says. “I sweep it all out every day. Everything’s got to be tidy.  “And we’re on a the waiting list for accommodation, so hopefully it won’t be long before we’re out of here. I just want to get back behind my own front door again.” But for now, like Steve and the other tent dwellers, a zipped-up a flap of canvas will have to do.

Larissa was left virtually bedbound when her symptoms were at their worst and even having a shower became too painful and left her skin red raw. She has released a graphic photo diary showing how bad her reaction to ditching the creams really was as she admits there wee times she wouldnt leave the house because she was so worried people would stare.  But now the -year-old now manages her eczema holistically - and wants to use her horric experiences to encourage doctors to think twice before prescribing steroid cream.Larissa, who lives with her partner, Robbie Taylor, , in Portsmouth, Hampshire, severe reaction came after she developed topical steroid withdrawal . She had decided to wean herself off steroids because, over time, they had become less and less effective. TSW is a little-known condition causing painful and traumatic reactions when people try weaning themselves off steroid creams.   Larissa said: “When I stopped using the creams, Robbie and I had just bought our first house together. “It should have been this wonderful time, but instead I was bedbound with the pain. I’m only in my s, but I felt like I was . “I knew how important it was to push myself to get out and see people or do things, but I just wanted to hide. I was so worried people would stare, and when it’s something like skin that you can’t even cover up, it’s all the more soul-destroying.”  Larissa, who teaches navigation, was first diagnosed with eczema when she was just nine-months-old. With doctors hoping she would eventually grow out of it, she intermittently used small doses of prescribed steroid creams throughout her childhood. Larissa said: “I’d find that sunshine and sea water were a massive help. “I remember my eczema being particularly bad on my joints and how I’d get told off for scratching in class. “But, now I think back, it’s nowhere near as severe as dealing with TSW.”  Instead of easing, her eczema became more severe as an adult, although stress was the only trigger she could identy. Larissa said: “I look back now and try to figure out patterns, examining what was happening in my le at particular points and trying to work out why that’d make it better or worse. “The major trigger I found was stress. I tried my best to minimise it in my le, but sometimes, it’s out of our control. “There is an awful lot of pressure in le now. People are so busy and want to do everything as fast as possible. Then there’s also things like social media, and how it makes us compare ourselves to others.  “They sound like little micro-stresses, but they can all add up without you realising.”As her skin condition became more severe, Larissas use of steroid cream increased until eventually, by around , she was applying it every few hours having been told to use as much as she needed.But the more she used, the less effective it became. Larissa said: “You see that word steroid and know it’s not something you want to be using every single day. “By the end, I was getting no relief whatsoever from the creams.  “I was still having to bandage my wrists and arms every night to minimise scratching in my sleep, and had to be incredibly careful about what products or materials I put on my skin. “I used to love cosmetics, and have this whole vanity case of lovely makeup that I can’t use. I could only apply moisturiser to my face, or use prescribed shower gel. “It made it even harder that there was nothing I could do to cover up my skin.” At the end of January , she ditched the steroid creams for good, but was completely unprepared for the severe reaction to come. By March, Larissas skin – particularly on her face – felt tight, red and raw, asshe had been burned. Then, after posting photos to some online eczema support groups for advice, a fellow sufferer mentioned TSW for the first time. She became convinced this was what was cuasing her problems. Larissa said: “I contacted some friends that work in medicine and they sent me over some studies to read. “The condition is such an unknown, especially as controlled studies are virtually impossible, as they’d mean withholding eczema treatment from somebody who really needs it.  “But the only change I could think of that had sparked this was coming off the creams. “I made an emergency dermatology appointment, but things went downhill very quickly. It got to the point where even showering would leave me in tears, as it was so painful and my skin was so raw I couldn’t even wear underwear.” Eventually, her entire body affected, Larissa had no choice but to start a course of the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin. She has also been seeing a naturopath to discuss alternative therapies, as well as a hypnotherapist and cognitive behavioural therapist to deal with the emotional turmoil. Larissa said: “People don’t understand, and think it sounds silly to be saying this about a skin condition, but there were genuinely times when I wondered how I was going to get through,the rest of my le was going to be like this,” she admitted. “Everyday things that you take for granted were so dficult, like undressing for a shower. Not only was it painful – I also didn’t want to have to look at myself. “Thankfully, I am feeling much stronger, though the not knowing why this happened, and living with something so unpredictable is still very tough.” Larissa, who has now moved on from taking cyclosporin and is beginning a course of an antibody called duplimab, is urging doctors to treat eczema patients such as herself holistically, rather than simply prescribing steroid creams. She said: “There is a time and a place for steroid treatments. Everyone is dferent and they can help some people, but we also need to be looking at triggers like stress and diet. Every journey is dferent, and iniduals need to do what they can to help themselves. “There is, in my mind, a clear link between mental health and skin conditions. Stress is a huge trigger, and you are bound to feel low when there is no end in sight and every little thing you do is a huge decision about whether it’ll make your skin better or worse. “We are getting better at talking about mental health but we still need to be changing our approach and looking at things as a whole.” "},{"url":null,"title":"third salisbury novichok assassin may","story":"NewsThird Salisbury Novichok assassin may still be in UK after aborting escape planIt is believed a third man flew into the UK at the same time as the agents who attempted to murder Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, but there is no record of him leavingShareCommentsByJoshua TaylorDeputy news editor:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video skripal-poisoning-suspects-say-were-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A third Salisbury Novichok assassin may still be at large in Britain, according to reports.The Russian intelligence officer is believed to have travelled to the UK under a  name on the same day as the two hitmen who tried to assassinate Sergei and Yulia Skripal last year.The third man, travelling under the name Sergey Fedotov, was reportedly booked onto the same flight home as Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov - the two ex-Russian soldiers wanted over the murder plot.But Fedotov changed his travel plans at the last minute and did not board the plane, according to a security source.

The strong winds are expected to hit the morning rush hour today and more blustery weather is forecast into the weekend. Forecasters have told drivers to be careful of tricky conditions on roads as transport could be affected. The QEII Bridge at the Dartford Crossing has been closed for public safety due to overhead winds of over mph and strong crosswinds, Essex Live reports. Southbound traffic on the M will instead have to travel through the East tunnel, which has a height restriction of five metres. This is expected to cause long delays around the Dartford Crossing and surrounding roads today. The Met Office has put a warning for wind in place. The warning covers Wales and southern and central parts of England. More than  homes in Cornwall were blacked out as the mph winds sent trees crashing across power lines this morning.   The M motorway is closed after a serious road traffic collision between junctions  and  in Leicestershire. The northbound section of the road is not expected to re-open until after rush hour after an accident involving a lorry and other vehicles. The fire service said it is expected to stay shut for a signicant amount of time. In further travel disruption, the M Severn Bridge in South Gloucestershire was closed in both directions earlier this morning but is now reopened.  Overnight winds reached mph on the Isle of Wight, and mph on the Isles of Scilly off the coast of Cornwall. Meteorologist Mark Wilson told motorists they should take care. He said: Be mindful that there could be some tricky conditions on the roads, for example there will be strong winds that could affect transport, like high-sided vehicles crossing bridges, so there could be delays. While winds will ease off into breezy weather mid-morning, leaving sunshine and showers, gusts are due to pick up again by midday on Friday, with a warning from then covering most of the UK and remaining in place until Saturday evening. This will be accompanied by a warning for persistent heavy rain in Scotland, where as much as mm is forecast to fall over high ground.   Temperatures will stay mild on Thursday, with highs of Cin Scotland and Cin the south of England, Mr Wilson added. But today will see rain, snow and strong winds slowly clearing, followed by sunny spells and blustery showers, mainly in the west. Showers could be heavy at times and wintry over the hills, the Met Office said.  Friday will be very windy and rainy with -mph gusts and a risk of flooding carrying over into Saturday morning. The Met Office warned: Heavy rain will move eastwards through Friday, with frequent heavy showers following. Melting of snow will also contribute to the risk of #flooding. Strong winds are expected to last into Saturday with scattered showers. Sunday could be drier and less windy, but the south could see further wet and windy weather.

But when they pulled over the truck, at the wheel was frail and doddery -year-old great grandfather Leo Sharp. And in the back they found  kilos of the drug. The decorated war veteran uttered three words: “Oh my God.” Sharp’s extraordinary transformation from a renowned plant grower to one of America’s most successful drug couriers has now been turned into a film, The Mule, directed by and starring Clint Eastwood. In  alone, Sharp delivered more than a ton of cocaine – enough for . million people to each snort a line – making himself million.  But his criminal career came to an end when, on his th birthday, he was sentenced to three years in jail. Sharp’s lawyer, Darryl Goldberg, argued during the OAP’s trial that he was suffering from dementia and turned to crime over money worries. Mr Goldberg says: “I don’t think state troopers and highway patrolmen were suspicious of an elderly man driving cross-country. “He was an older man. He was entrepreneurial and adventurous and he was likely suffering from dementia and the hallmark of dementia is poor decision-making. “So when you put them all together it is a recipe for him making the very wrong decision in a moment of perceived financial weakness and perhaps that contributed into his desire to pursue something like this.” Sharp’s story started very shydferently, however. Chicago-based lawyer Mr Goldberg, recalls: “He was a Bronze Star recipient in World War Two, his time in the Army was a le story in itself.  “He fought in Italy at the famous battle at Monte Battaglia. If you read the description of the battle it is fascinating as bayonets and flame throwers were used in hand-to-hand combat. It is remarkable that people survived. His service sparked the travel bug in him and he was quite the world traveller.” After the war Sharp started a travel business and at one point even launched his own airline. But a passion for flowers brought him rock-star status among fans of daylilies – small trumpet-like flowers that come in an array of colours. On a farm in Michigan City, Indiana, he cultivated more than  dferent ieties and would attend conferences across the US dressed either all in black or white, where fans would queue to meet him. Neighbours recalled buses pulling up outside his -acre farm, packed with growers wanting to buy his plants. But the coming of the internet caused his customers to buy online where. With his business failing, it is believed one of his Mexican farmhands introduced Sharp to the notorious Sinaloa drug cartel, headed by the ruthless Joaquin Guzman, known as El Chapo. The kingpin, currently on trial in New York, shipped an alleged  tons of cocaine. Yet elderly Sharp quickly emerged as the cartel’s most effective mule. In his beaten-up Lincoln truck he would transport  to  kilos of cocaine from the US-Mexico border and drive sedately up to Detroit.  Members of the cartel sneered at him behind his back for his advancing age and gave him the nickname El Tata – The Grandfather. He sometimes got confused when he tried to find the secret stash houses, so cartel members would be sent to meet him at motorway exits and guide him to warehouses. When he wanted to quit, they responded by putting a gun to his head and threatened his family. His lawyer Mr Goldberg enjoyed hearing the stories of his well-shytravelled client. He said: “He was a gentleman farmer, he did not live an extravagant le. “Despite the shycognitive decline he knew what he was getting into. “There came a point where he was less enthused about the process and that’s where they threatened him. He had a gun put to his head. He was the largest mule in Detroit and based on the numbers, he was monumentally substantial.” Drug Enforcement Agents in Detroit were astounded at the quantities of cocaine flooding the city, led by the legendary El Tata – a name constantly mentioned on the wiretapped phones of gang members. Special agent Jeff Moore, played by Bradley Cooper in the film, had spent a year trying to trace El Tata but to no avail. But thanks to the wiretaps, they knew the drug runner was making a delivery to Detroit in October . The truck was spotted near Kalamazoo and soon a host of unmarked police and DEA cars were trailing the mysterious mule. El Tata was driving erratically and at one point cut across traffic to leave the highway, sparking fears he knew he was being followed.  But he was just picking up French fries and a drink from a drive-through. At .pm a State Trooper, who was in on the operation, pulled him over for a routine traffic stop. Out of the truck stumbled a scruffy old man, cupping his ear so he could hear the officer’s commands. The trooper’s dashcam records the old man saying: “What’s going on, officer  At age , I want to know why I’m being stopped.” A drug-snfing dog was brought in and immediately drew attention to the back of the truck. When police said they were going to search, Sharp replied: “Why don’t you just kill me and let me just leave the planet.” In the back were five duffel bags containing  kilos of cocaine.  Sharp was later given three years in a jail specialising in the medical care of long-term inmates and as part of the deal had to hand over , and a property in Florida. “He said he was sorry for what happened” Mr Goldberg says. “He was quite matter of fact and nonchalant about it. He told the judge at sentencing, ‘I’m terribly sorry but it happened and I can’t change it’.” Sharp served just one year of his sentence and died after  months of freedom in December . He is buried alongside the military heroes of the Second World War, Korean and Vietnam wars in a shymilitary graveyard in Hawaii. Mr Goldberg says: “I enjoyed spending time with him. I found him fascinating on many levels. There was a lot of knowledge and wisdom to be shared and he had three shyincredible le stories built into one.” The Mule is out now.

She said: The negative comments are nothing I haven’t heard all my le, or called myself for fun anyway. I get the typical insults - fat cow, Shamu, like the killer whale, or lard a*se. “Im a very positive person, so I generally ignore it, or leave a playful comment back. “Body positivity is such a controversial topic and no matter what I say, there will always be people with their swords drawn, ready to fight me on this, so I’ll keep it simple - everybody and every body is beautul. There shouldn’t be any shame in celebrating that, from hairy legs to flat tummies and back rolls to saggy breasts.”   Amanda says she has been chunky all her le but that her partner, who she doesnt want to name, is a fat admirer and is supports her %. After managing to shed seven stone she realised she had only lost the weight to fit in with those around her and was more comfortable being big. Amanda said: Being fat makes me happy, physically and sexually. Introduced to feederism by a friend in , Amanda is known as a gainer, or feedee - someone who likes the physical act of getting bigger, so either increases their size by overeating or by using padding to make themselves larger. There are also feeders, who like to watch others getting bigger and encourage their weight gain. She said: I was shy about feederism at first.  But, as time went on, it felt more like my calling and slowly but surely, I fell in love with the community.Starting out on Feabie, a social network for feedees and feeders, Amanda then moved onto the micro-blogging site Tumblr, before setting up her own Instagram .Before long, she had amassed almost , followers. And, while she wont reveal exact monthly income, she says that she makes most of her money through paid promotions on Instagram and Patreon where people can set up their own subscription services. Working on a three tier system, she charges for access to all her videos and photos, for the additional benefit of her Snapchat, for a FaceTime call and for all of the above, plus extra adult content.  Explaining the types of videos she creates, Amanda said: “I do stuffing videos, where I eat massive amounts of food, funnel feeding videos, where I funnel down liquids through a tube and weight gain shake chug, where I down large amounts of liquid in little time, so my belly looks even more swollen. “This is all as well as other fat fetish content, including fantasy talk or playing with my belly.” Typically, Amanda films two to three videos a day for her Patreon supporters and those who have submitted specic requests. She also live streams via Instagram, so her fans can feel more connected to her.  Usually eating around , calories a day, this can rise to as many as , when she is filming, depending on what she has been asked to eat. Amanda said: I get tonnes of interesting questions and requests when it comes to food. I feel the most popular food people enjoy seeing me eat is Taco Bell, burgers and fruit. One guy paid me to eat  pears and crack open a coconut to drink its milk while half naked on camera. I love creative and interesting ideas, so my job is never boring. Personally, I don’t find it dficult to maintain my size for my followers.  I’m naturally a bigger girl, so as long as I continue to eat well, I easily stay fluffy and gain for my fans. While she has endured the odd aggressive, demanding customer, the majority of Amanda’s fans are very respectful - unlike internet trolls, who flock to her page daily, leaving nasty comments. Undeterred, Amanda has vowed to keep thriving in the fetish market, considering herself as a champion of body positivity. She said: “You really start to flourish as a person when you choose to be yourself, despite all the forced perspectives and idealised characters you’re told you should be, in order to truly love yourself. “As long as you’re being true to yourself, nothing  matters.” "},{"url":null,"title":"voice mirror government serious tackling","story":"NewsopinionVoice of the Mirror: If the Government is serious about tackling rough sleeping it should follow this approachThe Mirror has spent this week talking to homeless people across the country - it is clear the safety net which should be there has been torn to shredsShareCommentsByVoice of the Mirror:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB Newsopinionthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video mirroronthestreet-campaign-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, combinedPrompt :true, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, combinedPrompt :true, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWherever you go in Britain, from town centres to small villages, you will see people sleeping rough on the streets. This is a national scandal staring at us in plain sight. The figures are damning: the number of people living in the streets has risen by % since the Conservatives came to power, more than  die sleeping rough each year, , households are homeless. But statistics never tell the full story. That is why the Mirror wanted to give voice to those who have fallen on hard times. Their stories are of people who have struggled with addiction, people with mental health problems and people with nowhere  to turn. They are scared, lonely and destitute. Many tell of how they have been assaulted, had their tents stolen and let down by the services supposed to support them. There are also stories of great kindness and compassion. The volunteers who get up at the crack of dawn to check on rough sleepers in their area, the charities which provide vital support and the health workers who have mended broken lives. Above all, we heard time and time again from people who never thought they would be in this position.  As one homeless person told us: “people are a tissue-thin slice away from disaster, they just don’t think about it.” In a country as rich as Britain this shouldn’t be the case. We are seeing the consequences of a government which stopped caring. The safety net which should be there has been torn to shreds. You could point to the Universal Credit or the shortage of accommodation or the lack of drug treatment services or the paucity of mental health provision. All are responsible for the rise in rough sleeping and all flow from the cuts imposed by this Tory government. What makes this so shameful is there is a better way. The Housing First strategy pursued in Scotland is transforming lives by giving people a secure home and support for addiction or mental health problems. If the Government is serious about tackling rough sleeping it should follow this approach. We have given those on the streets a voice. Now we need to give them hope.

That happens with late goals but we still have to take confidence because it still was a good performance.“I came in two weeks ago and we had five new boys on the deadline.“They’ve only trained once so it was always going to be hard but in periods of the game you could see we can all play together and how it can come off.“Hopefully, we can show more of that in the upcoming games.“It’s always disappointing to concede a last-minute goal but I think the boys worked their socks off. The performance might not have been as good as against Motherwell and Hearts but every one of us certainly put everything in.“Unfortunately, a strike like that happens and you can’t do anything about it.”Despite only signing for the Dark Blues on January , Dales has already featured five times for the club and is set for his sixth turn-out in tonight’s clash at home to high-flying Kilmarnock.It’s been a non-stop start to le at Dens Park for the -year-old who is enjoying le already in the Scottish top flight and is hoping to experience his first victory in dark blue in just over  hours’ time.He added: “I think I’ve settled in quite well.“It’s definitely dferent up here, it’s a lot quicker, up and down all the time but I think that suits me.“That’s my game, to be dynamic, so I think it probably suits me more up here than down in League One.“I’ve only been here a couple of weeks and I’ve already played four-and-a-half games in two weeks.“Some of the others have played five so it has been pretty thick and fast butwe can put another good performance on again I think we can get the three points.“It’s a great opportunity to do that as long as we work as hard as we did on Saturday. If all the lads put in % like that I don’t see why we can’t get the three points.”Despite coming in from mid-table League One side Scunthorpe to join Dundee’s push to avoid relegation from the Premiership, Dales says he’s up for the challenge.“Some people prefer to go into a promotion-chasing team but, for me, there’s nothing wrong with being in a relegation battle.“I’m up for that and I think every single player in the changing-room is definitely up for it.“With the quality we have and,we can keep showing that for most of the game, there’s no reason why we can’t get to where we should be.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c5435fee7f0d9.26716581.jpg ","title":"dundee united loan signing charlie seaman wants to return to bournemouth with medal","story":"Dundee United loan signing Charlie Seaman has come to Dundee United to develop as a player and get first-team experience.And he also aims to be heading back to parent club Bournemouth this summer with a Scottish Championship medal in his pocket.In capturing the -year-old full-back from one of the surprise success stories of the English Premier League over the past few seasons, Tangerines boss Robbie Neilson stressed the deal was exactly what it said on the tin – a loan.The end of the season will see Seaman head back to the south coast and be expected to challenge for a top-team place with the Cherries.However, while his time in Scotland will be a learning experience, the former West Ham youth wants success as well.“Hopefully, coming here and learning dferent things will help me for when I go back for next season,” he said.“I can learn dferent styles here so I am really happy to be in Scotland with United.“The boys here love to play football and that’s good because it’s that way down at Bournemouth.“Every side of the game, though, on the ball, off the ball I am trying to learn, it’s what I’m here for. Defensively I am trying to be better and I want to be better offensively as well.“I came here to get experience of first-team football. I was waiting for my chance at Bournemouth but I felt I could get it here sooner, get some games for the rest of the season. Hopefully I will be more readyI get the opportunity when I go back, or wherever it may be.“There is a job to do for the team as well and our goal at Dundee United is to win this league. Yes, it would be nice to be finishing the season with a medal for that.”Seaman’s time north of the border hardly got off to the perfect start and, within hours of his arrival, he was tasting defeat as United went down to Ayr.His temporary manager was disappointed with the team performance at Somerset Park but did make a point of saying the new arrival had put in some good work.The young full-back took encouragement from that but has admitted he did not necessarily agree with Robbie’s assessment.“I was happy to make my debut last week, obviously disappointed with the loss, but it was good to get out there and experience something dferent,” he added.“I didn’t think I started the game too well but I thought I grew into it. Still, personally, I don’t think it was one of my better games by any stretch.“It was my first game at the club, my first playing a dferent style of football and my first playing in dferent weather conditions and stuff like that.“It was all a learning curve, something to take from that game into future games.“I came up Thursday night, so I only had a day here before the game but I have high expectations and I like to set high standards.“When I don’t reach them, I’m disappointed.”The aim now is to show up well as he makes his home debut as Morton visit Tannadice and United try to get back to winning ways to keep in touch with leaders Ross County.And Seaman does admit this week has given him more time to do his homework on the opposition, saying: “Before Ayr the gaffer gave me a lot of clips of Ayr to watch so I had a fair idea of what they were going to do.“I was relatively ready for the game in a tactical aspect but I did only come up on Thursday night.“For this game against Morton we have been getting information throughout the week.

I actually don’t have any relatives here in Dundee because they all moved to America but I’m sure they will be over soon to watch me in person.”And the former DC United man admits being in an environment where the population live and breathe football is a special feeling.His grandad’s love of United and the fact dad John, a former USA skipper, spent a big chunk of his career in England, means that’s not come as a surprise.“Over here everyone talks about football all the time and it’s the culture. It’s everywhere, which I love, and it’s all over the city.“There are so many competing sports back in the US that are big but football is getting bigger and at the final this year in Atlanta you saw , people there and that is great to see. The game is going to keep growing there and you will see more and more players coming through but here it’s on a dferent level.“I knew what it was like over here, I got it from my dad from when he was here. My mum and dad talked about it a lot, how everyone is immersed in the sport.“I get in taxis here and they are talking about it and all the people are. I love that.”For Ian, though, just being able to experience le in a football-mad country is not going to be enough.He’s come to United to progress his career and that means helping get them back to the Premiership and making a name for himself at that level.With the squad Robbie Neilson has put together, that’s a goal he’s convinced he will achieve.“There’s a lot of new guys in the squad and I thought you saw us start off well against Morton,” he added.“You also saw glimpses in the second half where we had to finish off the game and get that third goal and we didn’t.“However, I think in the first half the guys were moving the ball around well and getting into good positions.“Pete Pawlett was coming inside for us and Pav Safranko was stretching them. That got us the space to play and I think we got a bit away from that in the second half but it will come.“If we keep going and show our class we will finish off games a bit better.“I think, like the manager has said, there are a lot of good players who have good experience so when they get in, they just gel.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c5ac61f76f544.56248025.jpg ","title":"free cash folk throughout dundee perthshire and fife in line for cold weather payment are you eligible","story":"People throughout Dundee are in line to receive cash after the recent bout of cold weather.The Government#s Cold Weather Payment scheme dishes out £ to people living in an area where the average temperature has been C or below for seven consecutive days.Every person living in the DD postcodes endured these conditions between January  and February , it has been confirmed.Folk in Perthshire and Fe are also in line to receive a windfall due to the cold weather.Click here to seeyou are eligible."},{"url":null,"title":"high quality housing proposed on ruinous site in dundee","story":"A private developer is seeking permission from Dundee City Council to demolish a former vehicle repair centre to pave the way for “high-quality” housing.Sidlaw Building  Joinery Services, from Tealing, is hoping to build two apartments at  Gray Street in Lochee.A spokesman for architect Peter Inglis, who is agent for the developer, said: “This application seeks permission to provide high-quality housing in the Lochee area of the city.“At present the site is occupied by a disused vehicle repair workshop which has fallen into a ruinous state.“The scale and character of the dwellings will complement and enhance the character of the area.“And they will also sit comfortably alongside existing neighbourhood dwellings.”He said the site had held planning consent for a single, detached, two-storey house since ."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b55a5de25ccc.jpg ","title":"revealed stunning line up of iconic acts to perform at rewind festival in scone palace","story":"A stunning line-up of some the biggest pop stars from the s has been revealed for this year’s Rewind festival.Iconic acts from the one of the most influential decades ever will grace the stage at Scone Palace this summer.Among the big names heading to Tayside include Roxy Music’s Bryan Ferry, Paul Young, The Stranglers, Midge Ure and Lulu.Tickets for the weekend festival, which will take place from Friday July  to Sunday July , go on sale today.Bryan Ferry will close the festival on Sunday night, fresh from being inducted into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as part of Roxy Music.Described as one of Britain’s most influential musicians, Bryan has sold more than  million albums across the world.Event organisers are promising to take the festival to “new heights” with their most musically erse line-up yet.Katt Lingard, festival event manager, said: “Following our milestone th anniversary last year, we are excited to take Rewind into the future with a celebration of not just s artists but also legends whose influence spans far beyond the decade.“We are welcoming a host of fantastic artists who will be performing at the festival for the very first time like Bryan Ferry, Foreigner, The Stranglers, Lulu and Lisa Stansfield.“It’s going to be a fantastic three days at Scone Palace with something for everyone.”She added: “Foreigner make their debut, headlining on the Saturday.

That could change in Saturday’s Scottish Cup visit to St Mirren and at the very least he will provide experienced cover for Benjamin Siegrist.Charlie SeamanIt was a dficult start for the Bournemouth kid as he made his debut in the defeat at Ayr United just hours after flying north to begin his loan. The -year-old, however, did reasonably well at Somerset Park and looked good as he made his home debut in Saturday’s win over Morton.Mark ReynoldsThe vastly-experienced Aberdeen defender showed his ability and know-how as he strolled through his debut against the Ton, despite injury meaning that was his first competitive outing since last May. Reynolds was handed the captain’s armband and showed leadership qualities that could prove vital in the coming months.Mark ConnollyThe arrival from Crawley Town is another centre-half and Saturday saw him show instant signs of being able to form a solid partnership with Reynolds. The Irishman is a no-nonsense defender who looks perfect for the physical requirements of the Championship.Calum ButcherBack for a second spell at United having previously played at Tannadice under Jackie McNamara, the midfielder was brought in to add bite in that area of the park. He lasted an hour at the weekend and in that time won his tackles and had a big influence on those around him in the middle of the park.Ian HarkesThe -year-old American was something of a surprise arrival but with his energetic box-to-box running has shown why Robbie Neilson wanted him. The former DC United team-mate of Wayne Rooney covered a lot of ground and, as he showed in the Scottish Cup win at Montrose, also has a goal in him.Morgaro GomisAnother who is ing to United, in his case for a third spell in tangerine. Gomis blotted his copy book by picking up a red card in that defeat at Ayr. Now , the  Scottish Cup winner is unlikely to start every game but will provide good cover in central midfield.Peter PawlettThe manager spent most of last month working to secure the services of the former Aberdeen man who played for him at MK Dons. Pawlett wasted no time showing why with a superb debut against Morton that saw him grab his first United goal. His pace, use of the ball and movement off it means he will be a very big player.Cammy SmithThe third of the arrivals who have played for United before. Smith has fitted in well since joining up from St Mirren. He goes about his work in quietly but his knowledge of how to win promotion from this ision makes him an asset.Aidan NesbittAnother who played for Neilson at MK Dons. The former Celtic kid has signed until the end of the season and so far only one of his five appearances have been as a starter.

found sleeping rough in below zero temperatures and snow.He said: “At the moment we are aware of around six people sleeping rough, despite the appalling conditions.“On Monday night alone I gave out hot drinks to five people we found rough sleeping in the city.“One lad had been ejected from a hostel on Friday and due to rain on Sunday night his blanket was soaking wet and he was very low in spirit.“Thanks to donations received from our supporters we were able to give him a thermal mat, sleeping bag, gloves, hat, blankets and hot drinks which had an immediate effect on his morale.”Mr Norman said that in the early hours of Monday morning the charity’s outreach team found a lad sleeping rough in the West End of the city.“As he was freezing cold we got him into our warm van, gave him a hot chocolate and sleeping bag.“We contacted Dundee City Council’s homeless services and due to complications which we can’t ulge they were unable to offer immediate support.“We arranged for him to attend a crisis meeting with homeless services and hopefully something will be sorted out for him.” vw, px\"   vw, px\"  Mr Norman said temperatures hit -C during the week.On Friday volunteers handed out three sleeping bags, hot chocolate, gloves and hats.The following night he said that thanks to the city council homeless services they were able to get a young man off the streets and into emergency accommodation.“He was given shelter for three nights but his case had to be reviewed by a housing officer after that.” vw, px\"  He said the charity’s street outreach team have been making regular welfare checks on beggars – ensuring they have warm clothing, a hot drink and a place in a hostel or a friend’s address.He said: “Once the temperature goes below zero, everyone is entitled to emergency homeless accommodation.“I would like to see a unit of around six beds available at very short notice during extreme winter weather for anyone who needs somewhere to get out of the cold.“No-one should have to sleep rough in winter conditions like this.”Councillor Helen Wright, who is a member of the Integrated Joint Board of Dundee Health and Social Care Partnership, said: “I would happily back a call for a unit of this type.“We have a duty to provide accommodation in extreme weather conditions.”The Tele reported last week that registrations for homelessness increased in Dundee last year."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever

Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13926204.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18355078.jpg","title":"ayr united 2 inverness 3","story":"NewsAyr United  Inverness : John Roberston hails Somerset Park among best grounds in worldThe Inverness gaffer was full of praise for the old fashioned surroundings as his side clung on in the face of a stirring fightback.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsNathan Austin puts Caley - up \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJohn Robertson hailed Somerset Park as one of the best grounds in the WORLD after Caley held off a storming Ayr fightback. Inverness were three up and on easy street after a crazy opening  minutes which saw United gt-wrap the game. But a Lawrence Shankland inspired comeback almost grabbed a share of the spoils for Ian McCalls title contenders. A relieved Robertson said: Had it finished - you wouldnt have been surprised. Somerset Park is one of these grounds that sucks you inyou give them a snf. Its a good throwback and their fans make it intimidating and a good atmosphere for teams when you lose a goal. Its brilliant...one of the best grounds in the world to come and play your football. In the past we might have lost a game like this so Im delighted.  Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.  But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending. And were the team with the best defensive record in the league. I think a draw would’ve been fair but it’s just one of those nights.

Now the proposition has got a whole lot dferent. Pet Heaven, a crematorium for family animals, has just opened in Ayr. And businessman Forbes Robertson believes it is the answer for many families who want to give their four legged - or two-legged in the case of birds - friends a splendid send-off. No expense has been spared in an -month project at the former commercial garage site in West Sanquhar Road. Area MP Bill Grant performed the official opening ceremony last week. The lavishly decorated gilded interior includes a parlour where families can pay their last respects. Entrepreneur Forbes, who has business interests throughout the area, revealed up to  people can attend the pet funeral services . Mourners can watch as their pet recedes behind the final curtain at the close of the service, similar to what would happen in a human ceremony at Masonhill. As yet Pet Heaven cannot handle horses, but the biggest of dogs to cats, hamsters and birds. There is a tea and coffee service as well as any choice of music desired and a book of remembrance in the reception area.  Much of the interior decoration has been gathered by Forbes, a keen antique hunter and auction room collector. The company will offer a collection service as well as provide a selection of remembrance urns for ashes. It seems no expense is spared by some dog lovers in the UK and recently a couple spent pound on a full funeral including a horse drawn glass hearse. Forbes said: “People sometimes care more about their animals than humans. “A farmer who contacted me askedhis dog goes before him, the animal would be cremated here and I will store the ashes. “He told me his lawyer would be in touch as he wanted buried with his dog. “Pets are loyal, they don’t steal from you and are there first thing in the morning and last thing at night.” MP Bill Grant said Pet Heaven was a signicant investment for the area. He said: “I am sure this will be welcomed by pet owners from all over the southwest, pet owners who have lost their best friend. “To have a dignied departure for that pet who has been their friend - in some cases for  years - is a great service. “The set-up Mr Robertson has here is wonderful and I think he can be proud of it. “That last journey for pets will be full of dignity and respect from Pet Heaven and its staff. “Indeed my family had a wee dog Blackie for  years and I don’t mind admitting, then a senior fire officer, that I cried unashamedly for an hour at the loss of our companion”.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrPetsSanquharAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"piping hot performance ayr stars","story":"NewsPiping hot performance from Ayr starsAyr Pipe Band Society took to the stage to support the world-renowned bagpipe band Red Hot Chilli Pipers.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  FEB NewsAyr Pipe Band Society gear up to support Red Hot Chilli Pipers at Ayr Town Hall \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPiping stars joined together to wow crowds at a top show in Ayr’s Town Hall.

their own lives and lestyle choices, and as long as you keep within the law, the state should have no place in telling you what you can eat or drink.A motion put forward by Councillor Scott called for

most money was declared Candlemas King or Queen and they ruled for six weeks.They had the power to make one whole afternoon a week a playtime and to excuse anyone they wished from any form of

It was a cold day but my friend, who is skilled in bushcraft, had brought his portable fire pit with him.We searched for drtwood and sat by the fire, roasting marshmallows and warming our hands. It was a short walk but dramatic rock formations loomed above us, making it feel like a real adventure. The kids climbed them and explored the rocky beach, where once there had been an open-air bathing pool.On our , we went through a small tunnel-like arch. I stopped for a moment, suddenly taken by the view. The ruins of Dunbar Castle were beautully framed by the archway. Locals call this archway the keyhole and I reflected that the term is a perfect name.When we look through a keyhole, our vision is narrowly focussed. Such was the effect here. It cast a visual spotlight on what is left of what was once a mighty fortress.The kids trundled on before me, noticing smaller wonders: a frozen worm on the path, a sea shell and interesting-looking stones. But I stood for some moments, taking in the view beyond and thinking of what stories those old stones of the castle could tell.Many people pass this way every day, both locals and visitors. Itrsquos a section of the John Muir Way. I have often been with my family to Dunbar Leisure Pool and the harbour and town. But somehow I had missed this short but spectacular nearby walk until this day.Dunbar Castle is now but a fallen-down ruin. Indeed, itrsquos dficult to imagine what it once was. But the weathered sandstone castles on the shoreline built by nature still stand defiant, somehow reminding us of their greater permanence in the face of human transience. But as I stood looking at the ruins, the keyhole focussed my thoughts as well as my vision.History is also viewed through a keyhole, a very narrow one. The lives and events of the castle were lived in most part unrecorded by it. The spotlight of history has illuminated only brief moments, and even then the characters have been only those deemed lsquoimportantrsquo.There are moments where the view through the narrow keyhole of history has included insights to untold stories. The bravery of Black Agnes, as she defied the siege in , is one of those. With her husband away, she was in charge of this important fortress during war with England. She refused to give up the castle, even in the face of bombardment and attempts to starve her small garrison into submission. Her mocking of her besiegers by dusting down the battlements with her maids after a bombardment is an image seared in legend.But itrsquos a chink of light on a huge untold story we are led to believe by historyrsquos silence that women were insignicant players in events. For sure they were oppressed and put down by a system that centred on male power, but they are half of humanity and at least half the story.As the actions of Black Agnes reveal, even with such constraints put on them, women were there, part of events and often refusing to accept their assigned role.The le of Mary Queen of Scots has always been for me an example of this. Yes, she was privileged and powerful by birth, but because of this history took notice of her.Despite all the political and religious challenges she faced, it was her womanhood which men deemed her main failing. And so she was judged by dferent standards. Had she behaved with the morals of her father she would not have lasted five minutes in power. But no one raised an eyebrow because he was a man.But more than this, even though Mary was the monarch, her royal authority was deemed diluted and even less legitimate merely because she was a woman.So she understood she needed to find a husband to bring her royal authority to full strength in a country full of powerful and bullying misogynist men.She chose the dashing young Darnley, and the fact that he turned out to be dross was not, in my opinion, Maryrsquos fault. How easy it is to blame a woman for a manrsquos failings. She was taken in by him it was he who was the failure, not her.Thatrsquos what Irsquove always maintained, despite the protestations of my tutors at university. And her third husband Bothwell, well he was a disappointment as well.It is the stones of Dunbar,they could speak, who could tell us of the truth of his forced union with Mary. She had been taken there by him in April . The circumstances of this still remain debated. Was she abducted by him as later claimed, or did she go willingly It was also claimed she was raped and forced to marry Bothwell soon afterwards to save her honour . This idea has been disputed by some because Mary is said to have miscarried with twins while imprisoned at Lochleven Castle some months after, suggesting a relationship with Bothwell even before Darnleyrsquos murder.

The doorsquocot is a clue that once a residence of some signicance stood here. It was called Dolphingstone Castle. Nothing now visibly remains of the castle, but around  years ago ruins were still to be seen.It was at one time an elegant mansion, but before that, on the same site, an older castle once stood ndash now all gone, and the structures of modernity are hemming in what is left of this ancient site. A wave of new housing laps at its walls to the west, the A traffic roars past on its south, and roads surround it on other quarters.One wondersthis small slice of East Lothian history will survive the developers. I hope it does. It is a small, historic fingerprint and gives a mysterious glimpse into our countyrsquos past, in an area now being carpeted with thousands of new houses.Earlier maps suggest that Dolphingstone Castle was surrounded by woodland. So perhaps the planting of a small wood or orchard within the old walls could create an island of both nature and history amidst the tide of urbanising development in this area.Up above on the ridge of Falside Hill to the south, the restored Farsquoside Castle looks down on the developments below . It sits like an eagle perched on a high ridge, observing the land below.How dferent the landscape it surveys would have been in  when, according to an old story, a small force of hand-picked warriors descended from the castle under the cover of darkness.It was just past midnight when they left, guided by a slither of moon. It was a raiding party, bent on revenge and heading for Preston Tower in what is now Prestonpans.Tradition tells us a feud had existed between the houses of Farsquoside and Preston for some years. The cause of the feud was the breaking down of walls between the two estates and the animals of each side grazing on the land of the other. Regular, and sometimes violent, clashes had taken place.But then Hamilton of Prestonrsquos livestock had been poisoned, or so it seemed. They had drunk from a burn which flowed from Farsquoside and it was assumed the water had been deliberately poisoned. Hamilton of Preston Tower, making no investigation, sent his men on a raid of violent retribution.Farsquoside Castle was attacked and blood was shed. This was the act which the select band of warriors who had set forth from Farsquoside were to avenge.In darkness, they filed down from the ridge on a path now known as Whinney Loan. This took them down to where the new houses are now being built on the southern edge of Wallyford.From here, great care was needed lest they be seen or heard. Dolphingstone Castle lay ahead and although their grievance was not with the occupants of Dolphingstone, early discovery could ruin the element of surprise.So the raiders veered north of Dolphingstone, by way of Prestoungrange, and at dawn, with the smell of the salt pans in their noses, they set about their vengeful work.Screams and running bairns alerted the occupants of Preston Tower. Armed men were ready, for this raid was expected, although not from this direction.The walls of Preston Tower held the attackers at bay but the people of the village suffered the worst of the slaughter. What senseless violence: neighbours separated only by the brae of a hill had been whipped up into a hateful frenzy against each other. Gradually the raiders melted away, back up the hill, with blooded swords.But hate builds on hate and the reckoning was not slow in coming. The very next day, Hamilton of Preston led a force westwards. It arrived by the walls of Dolphingstone Castle and then rounded past them to head up the hill towards Farsquoside, crossing where now the A speeds by.No attempt at surprise was required, this was to be an open fight. The Lord of Farsquoside had arranged his men along the top of the ridge, looking down on the approaching force of Hamiltonrsquos men. The order to charge was given and the men of Farsquoside poured down the slope.The leaders of both sides were in the thick of the fighting. It was the Lord of Farsquoside who fell, pulled from his horse and hacked to death by Hamiltonrsquos men.Seeing the death of their leader, the men of Farsquoside fled back to the castle. But the Lady of Farsquoside, in shock and rage at the death of her husband, rallied the men. She led them out of the castle in a furious charge as the sun began to set, forcing Hamiltonrsquos men to flee back to Preston.The battle, or skirmish as some would call it, was over, and the feud had reached its bloody climax. Soon after it was discovered an infectious disease had stricken the cattle, not poisoned water. Cattle on both sides had been equally affected. No one was to blame.How easy it had been to make enemies out of neighbours based on  assumptions. We are told Hamilton attempted to make amends. But the dead could not rise and the Lady of Farsquoside was said to be devastated at the loss of her husband. We can be sure others of lesser status suffered no less.This feud was over little remains to record it except tradition passed down, captured and retold by th-century writers such as P MrsquoNeill and Robert Seton, from whose works this account is garnished.Preston Tower still stands in Prestonpans, in a ruined but still defiant state. Farsquoside, much restored, is a visual delight still keeping watch atop the ridge. But only those feint hinds of Dolphingstone Castle remain, most of it lost to time and mystery just like the details of this story.But all the more reason to preserve and value them, I think."},{"url":null,"title":"betting-businesses-told-to-monitor-gambling-habits-of-people-on-benefits","story":"East Lothian Councilrsquos licensing board has approved a new gambling policy which puts the responsibility for policing the risks of betting in the hands of new licensees.Among the issues that new applicants will have to prove they have addressed before being given a licence will be monitoring ldquogaming trends that may reflect benefit payments, ldquoidentying and reporting attempts to launder money on premises and ldquoprotecting vulnerable people and those with gambling dependencies.Approving the new draft policy, which will govern the boardrsquos licensing decisions for the next three years, board members raised concerns about a lack of legislation to stophigh streets in deprived communities becoming lined with betting shops.Councillor Lachlan Bruce, Preston Seton Gosford ward member, called for current laws which prevent local authorities from refusing a licence to betting businesses because of overprovision to be changed.He said that it was impossible to walk down some town centre streets without being confronted by gambling premises offering promotions and deals.Mr Bruce told the meeting: ldquoThere are high streets in East Lothian where [betting shops] seem to be every  yards.ldquoThere is an issue where it is impossible to avoid gambling premises.The board was told that the Gambling Act  precluded using overprovision as a reason to refuse a licence for a betting shop.The councilrsquos new policy will put the onus for local risk assessments on applicants who want to open licensed gambling premises ranging from bookies to casinos, bingo halls, tracks and travelling fairs.Board member Councillor Jane Henderson, North Berwick Coastal, spoke of the dangers of gambling addiction, saying: ldquoGambling is an extremely destructive situation and sometime it does not get the headlines other things do.ldquoBut it crosses all walks of le and we, as a board and as iniduals, have a moral duty to recognise it is as much an illness as anything  and anything we can do to help should be taken very seriously.Councillor Willie Innes, council leader and Preston Seton Gosford ward member, cautioned that only a minority of people who gambled were affected by addiction and for others it was simply an activity they enjoyed.He told board members: ldquoWhen I first joined the council, gambling was a backstreet activity with premises down back alleys and it took us a long time to persuade the industry to come onto the high street.Mr Innes said that the new policy, which set out additional risk assessment requirements for applicants, sent ldquoa clear message to both the industry and those concerned about it."},{"url":null,"title":"prominent-cockenzie-campaigner-larry-tomlins-remembered","story":"Larry Tomlins, who was chairman of Cockenzie West Tenants and Residents Association, was involved in campaigns to reduce speeding and upgrade local park facilities in his community.The grandfather-of-two was an active supporter of the recent fight to implement speeding restrictions outside new housing at The Chimneys, Cockenzie, and helped oversee the trial and subsequent introduction of  miles per hourspeed limits in the Whin Park area of the village.Mr Tomlins, , grew up in Ayrshire and moved to Cockenzie more than  years ago, where he raised his family with we Ann.A consultant engineer, he ran his own successful business and still found the time to be an active member of his local community.He was a founding member of the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association, which helped improve Whin Park for local families.Ward councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell said: ldquoLarry made a huge contribution to the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association and the wider community.

Black Agnes held off the English who surrounded Dunbar Castle for months by eating frugally and arranging for food to be smuggled in by boat. The th-century equivalent of a Tesco delivery, it slipped under the noses of the English in the dead of night.The perils that face us as a no-deal Brexit looms are historic in quite another way. When Britain opted to leave it was a vote, we were told, for that nebulous but comfortingly empowering idea of ldquotaking back control. Now, as the military has been put on standby to impose curfews, requisition buildings, impose travel bans and crush any sign of unrest or revolt, we could not be further from the conceit of taking things into our own hands. Quite the reverse: almost everything is beyond our control, from the fast-rising cost of imported goods and materials, to the foods available to buy, to the terms and conditions on which our new relationship with Europe will depend.The threat to medicine supplies is alarming enough. When food shortages are also widely anticipated then the entire scenario begins to look like the summer of , as the country battened down the hatches, built Anderson shelters, printed ration books, and dug in for the long and gruelling haul.

To be honest, it feels a bit over-anxious to listen to scaremongering about emptying shelves, like waving a white flag long before all hope of relief has faded. Yet it is probably sensible to be prepared, even though stockpiling has a bad reputation, suggesting panic rather than a strategic emergency plan.Lettuces, apparently, are going to be like gold dust, but of all the problems Brexit promises, this surely is the least worrying. Some in these parts survived without salad their entire lives and lived to be .

That is exactly what she is doing. For the last two years she has put Scotlandrsquos constitutional issues to the side and pushed for Scotland and the UK to remain within the customs union and single market. All and any analysis I have read has given that outcome as being in the best economic interests of the UK and Scotland, but Ms Sturgeon, the Scottish Government and Scotlandrsquos Parliament have all been dismissed with contempt.The May Government is only interested in the Tory party and the DUP. The EU has proved extremely flexible in dealing with Mmember territories in or out of the EU, so it was possible Scotland and Northern Ireland could have had a dferent status to England Wales but was never asked. Indeed it has been reported that London insisted to the EU that Scotland be denied sharing in any dferentiation on offer to others.Mr Redfern advocates for what he calls the ldquoMay compromise: trouble is that Theresa May changes the parameters of her deal on a daily basis. Donrsquot believe me ndash ask her own Tory MPs. It is the Tories who have led us to this clf edge, and it will be the Tories who tip us into the abyss. Scotland voted to stay in the EU but has zero status or leverage within the UK ldquoUnion. Ireland is respected and her interests are being protected in the EU Union. The dference is stark and should be an example to any Scot with an ounce of gumption.GR Weir, Mill Street, Ochiltree.ROBIN Gilmourdraws a somewhat simplistic comparison between Irelands long struggle for freedom from British rule and the UKs vote to leave the European Union.He is correct to state that the Republic of Ireland, over hundreds of years, fought against domination by Britain and eventually won its independence. However, Britains partition of Ireland, designed to keep the bulk of the Unionist population and heavy industry under the UK flag, sowed the seeds for future conflict in the north of Ireland.Our present vexatious issue with the Irish protocol has only arisen because the UKs decision to depart from the EU leaves Northern Ireland as, obviously, thanks to the partition of , the only part of the UK that shares a border with an EU country.The Irish Government and the EU are trying to work together with Theresa May and her Government to avoid future loss of le and conflict in Northern Ireland by ensuring that there is no hard border, now, and in the future.The only obstruction to Britain arriving at a solution at present appears to be from those who see the people on the island of Ireland as an irrelevance and a hindrance to a clean break with Brussels,despite  per cent of people in Northern Ireland voting to remain.Mr Gilmours exasperation displays an age-old condescending British attitude towards the Irish that I had hoped had evaporated into the mists of history. As he himself says, Ireland is an independent sovereign nation on a par with Britain. As such, it must be accorded equal importance and respect.Owen Kelly, Dunvegan Drive, Stirling.Read more: Donald Tusk: Theres a special place in hell for people who promoted Brexit"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9392397.jpg?type=article-full","title":"major-13m-facelift-to-restore-glasgow-railway-bridge","story":"New Clyde Bridge was built between - as part of the Edwardian expansion of Glasgow Central and links Scotlandrsquos busiest station to the west coast mainline and routes across Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire, Ayrshire and Inverclyde.The A-listed structure will undergo extensive refurbishment and repair works with engineers blasting off old paint, inspecting and repairing the steel beneath, before repainting the bridge in its existing colour scheme.Work will be delivered without disrupting the , trains which cross the bridge each day and the project is due for completion by December .Matthew Spence, Network Railrsquos route delivery director for Scotland, said: ldquoThe work we are doing will ensure this landmark bridge can continue to play its vital role in keeping Scotlandrsquos railway moving for decades to come.Paolo Benedetto, group managing director, Taziker Industrial, said: ldquoTaziker Industrial is delighted to have secured the contract to refurbish the Clyde Bridge in Glasgow.In the past  years we have worked closely with Network Rail in Scotland to successfully deliver a number of refurbishments of key structures and contribute to the continued smooth and consistent operation of Scotlandrsquos rail network.The bridge, which is also known as the Caledonian Railway Bridge, will be refurbished in stages with engineering work starting at the southside of the river later this month.Each section of the bridge will be scaffolded and wrapped in special encapsulation material before an engineering survey is carried out to identy those parts of the steel structure in need of repair.

months, following a fire in the old building back in .Temporary accommodation on site was made for the nursery children.The new library space at Kinellar SchoolThe new school is built on the same site as its predecessor. As part of the build, the project team used the opportunity to improve facilities in the village by redeveloping a derelict tennis court and constructing an enclosed children’s play park as well as additional parking for use by the school and local community.The school’s social staircase is already becoming a well-used architectural feature alongside its many other bright and airy flexible learning spaces, including the glass fronted library and learning area upstairs.Its teaching wings benefit from cleverly designed acoustics, modern set up and technology offerings in all  classrooms, and are on two levels, with lightwells connecting them.Specially commissioned artwork is also an important feature of the new school.Local artists worked with pupils to design and create a number of pieces, including a large Oak tree in the dining area symbolizing growth with leaves painted by every child.  Aberdeenshire Provost Bill Howatson said: “A great team effort has led to the delivery of an extremely high quality building on time and on budget, and we’re thankful to everyone who has played their part in that. data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Erasums students question what will happen after Brexit\"  What is the future for Erasmus students after Brexit  viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"“It stands testament to what a community can achieve by working together, right from those dark early days after the fire when local people rallied round to offer soup and sandwiches to staff, to the lovely reception pupils received from the community in Kintore.”Chair of Education and Children’s Services Committee, Councillor Gillian Owen said: “It’s not only wonderful to see the pupils at Kinellar enjoying their new school but also to reflect on what a fantastic learning experience this project has given them. In addition to the educational opportunities – working with artists, the community and the construction team – the pupils have also learned important lessons when it comes to being resilient and flexible.”Head Teacher Pamela Farquhar added: “As much as we loved our time at Kintore it is nice to be back home.“The new school was made possible thanks to Anne Gibson who sold her land to Aberdeenshire Council.“Her husband was a former head teacher here so the school has a special place in her heart.”"},{"url":null,"title":"kintore flats plans raise objections","story":"Councillors will next week debate proposals for  new affordable flats in the heart of Kintore which have attracted a host of objections.Langstane Housing Association has tabled plans for four property blocks featuring  one-bed flats and six two-bed flats on vacant waste ground on Forest Road.But  objections have been raised on the grounds of insufficient parking and road safety, increased traffic and congestion on Forest Road and the scale of the development and the adverse impact on the amenity.In a report to Aberdeenshire Council’s Garioch Area Committee which meets on Tuesday, director of infrastructure services Stephen Archer says that “on balance” while the development may have an amenity impact on the neighbouring properties, it will fall within acceptable standards.He says: “The proposal for  affordable flats would make a positive contribution to affordable housing provision in Kintore.“It is accepted that any development on this site will alter the outlook from neighbouring dwellings, however, the use of the site for a flatted development is considered compatible with the infill nature of the site and settlement location.”Councillors will be told that the pre-application consultations and discussions during the determination of the application to reduce the potential impact on the neighbouring properties has resulted in the final layout and design.But in its objection, Kintore Community Council slams the proposal, particularly in terms of inadequate parking spaces.Chair Fiona Cooper states: “The proposed parking for the development of  spaces for  residents is insufficient and would result in overspill parking on the oppositie side of the road which would obviously have a major affect on existing residents.”In terms of the scale of the development, the community council recommends a maximum of two-storeys, with Mrs Cooper adding: “The proposed development by reason of size is out of character and would have an unacceptably adverse impact on the amenities of the properties immediately opposite the site and the surrounding area by reason of overlooking and having a visually overbearing impact.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..!

A no deal Brexit would result in the introduction of tarfs, estimated to cost UK wine importing businesses over £ million a year.ldquoThe introduction of no deal Brexit tarfs would be a double blow for wine businesses after the Chancellor elected to single out wine for a duty rise at the Autumn Budget.From February  the duty on a bottle of wine went up by p, but add a tarf to the duty rise and VAT and this means an average priced bottle of wine, which today costs £., will cost £. in the event of no deal.Read more: How will Brexit affect your travel plans  This is an extra p a bottle more than consumers paid before the referendum result when an average priced bottle of wine was £..There could be some positive benefits for British vineyards however.It is believed that British wines will seem less expensive than its European counterparts as retailers wonrsquot be forced to hike prices because of rate or tarfs.However, British vineyards could be hit with the lack of skilled workers from the EU and vital agricultural funding streams. data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Brian McKandie\"  Murder trial jury to consider verdictviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Martial law could be introduced to prevent riots after Brexit\"  What is martial law and why might it be introduced after Brexit  viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"The WSTA also wants confirmation that funding that was before provided by the EU will be picked up somewhere .Tamara Roberts, CEO at Ridgeview in East Sussex, said: ldquoAs we prepare for Brexit, it will be critical that the government does all it can to help English wine grow and that includes continued access to funding streams.ldquoComplete confidence in the quality of our wines has allowed us to expand production but so has access to funding streams, some of which derive from EU structural funds.At the moment, while the future is uncertain as to what will happen with Brexit come March , it may be worthwhile buying a bottle or two extra of your favourite European tipple.

New laws have been introduced as cars have been damaged by them, he said.\"It is not just a case of putting them down,\" stated Mr MacLeod. He argued that enforcement is the key to tackling the problem.\"If you had a traffic warden in each town again that would help,\" he added.Community councillor Colin Johnston said something should be done to address the issue of traffic and parking in the town.Struan Mackie, another Thurso and Northwest Caithness Highland councillor, stressed that it takes time to process traffic orders and pointed out that the mph plan for Wick began over two years ago.He also pointed out that the county is going to get traffic enforcement officers which should help deal with some of the parking issues.Mr MacLeod commented: \"You have got to watch you do not overdo these things.\"But Mr Potts said: \"Parking has been an issue for a long time.

The planning application also covers landscaping and future restoration of the site.The application process is being handled by consultants AECOM.The council-owned quarry currently supplies stone and aggregate materials for Council roads and building projects as well as the local construction industry.  It extracts Devonian Flagstone which is highly suited to a range of crushed aggregate products, in particular as roadstone and aggregates, used for producing asphalt for road construction and maintenance, with the quarry being the only active producer of asphalt in Orkney.The activity at the quarry generates an income for the Council which is reinvested to provide and protect some of the vital services we provide in Orkney.The current quarry area is heading towards the end of its use and an expansion would safeguard supply of materials. Current output ranges between , and , tonnes of rock per year andapproved, the ha expansion will release approximately  million tonnes of additional resources, sufficient for another  years of production.Full details are available on the Council website at http:www.orkney.gov.uk Council C long-term-development-of-cursiter-quarry-in-firth.htmPersons wishing to provide comments on the proposed development can do so by writing to AECOM at fraser.blackwood@aecom or by post to Fraser Blackwood, APEX ,  Haymarket Terrace, Edinburgh, EH HD by  February .OIC says that, at this stage, comments made to Aecom are for the purposes of assisting with the scheme design and EIA process and as such are not representations to the Planning Authority.

These moves are hugely intensive and provide a short-term boost for local workers and the economy. Such projects also develop the expertise and credibility of Scotland’s already impressive pool of financial services talent. : Nicola Sturgeon: Real and growing risk of no-deal BrexitHowever, that fact remains that much high-value work generated by exporting financial services to the EU is draining out of the Scottish economy permanently.On the other hand, there are new opportunities emerging as a direct result of the Brexit effect – for example firms are bringing some foreign operations back to Britain. Whilst the inward surge is not expected to match what is being lost, we are seeing a trend of UK and foreign firms relocating parts of their business to the UK to ensure they can continue to support their UK customer base. This includes many UK insurers who had previously set up offshore subsidiaries.The driver for larger UK firms moving operations to the EU is to satisfy their European customers, who are seeking assurances that there will be no disruption to their services in the event that no withdrawal deal is reached.However, some customers have raised concerns about whether they will get the same levels of consumer protection as offered in the UK – such as the protection of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.We are advising a range of organisations, including a number of high-growth, financial technology businesses, who are planning their international growth strategy with Brexit in mind. We are seeing particularly high levels of activity in the payments industry. Many expanding fintech businesses in Scotland have an ambitious global outlook.: Brexit: Queen to be evacuated in event of no-deal, reports claimIt would be much simpler for them to grow abroadthe EU wasn’t to suddenly become a ‘foreign’ jurisdiction. On the other hand, many of these firms already have processes in place to manage a truly international business. For those companies, the potential barriers to exporting financial services to EU are relatively simple to plan for.International trade in financial services is particularly restricted by the requirement of firms to be authorised to undertake regulated activities. This is why Brexit is a serious issue for the financial sector to contend with. Currently we are part of a common regulatory regime, so any firm authorised to provide financial services in one EU member state can effectively get permission to conduct business in any other member state, using a mechanism known as ‘passporting’. When we are no longer in the EU, UK firms will lose their rights to passport their permissions to the EU. UK firms will be subject to the same restrictions as other firms from where across the globe.The UK will be eligible to apply for equivalence in a limited number of regulated activities, but this process is not automatic. It requires the approval of the European Commission, which could take considerable time and be subject to political obstacles. If an equivalence is approved for the UK, there would be a requirement to maintain close alignment to the EU financial services regulations. The Commission has the discretion to withdraw their approval at any time, which would provide little certainty for UK firms.On the flipside, any EU firm wanting to trade here will have to satisfy the UK’s own rules. Even though no deal has been agreed at the moment, the UK Government has thus far given assurances that regardless of what happens we’ll continue to give EU firms the opportunity to continue trading whilst applying for UK permissions up to March . They must noty the UK regulators in advance of Brexit to get the temporary permissions, but this gives more certainty to EU firms trading here than the other way around as it stands.If we are looking for positives where there are some short-term benefits of a weaker pound, which helps keep inward investment into the UK on the radar as an appealing prospect, but there is a bigger foreign exchange risk for the future should our economy and currency value begin to erge signicantly from mainland Europe.We have been helping our clients to review their businesses in order to better understand how Brexit will affect them. In some cases, depending on their set-up, it turns out after a thorough analysis that there are few specic risks.However, the process has been useful as a prompt to look at their operations in detail to see where there could get more general business efficiencies and opportunities.

If anything, it should be amplied.It turned into a trilogy. There was a Great Book of Skye Two in , and now we have the #Great Book of Skye Three#.That was perhaps predictable. In the first volume, Cailean Maclean commented that he had two problems in persuading Norman Macdonald to prepare the book. The first problem was to get him to start the second was to get him to stop.Three books and , pages later, the prof has stopped — or so he says.The three volumes comprise a Dictionary of Skye Biography. The lives of almost , people are profiled and illustrated inside their pages. They have all #been Skye born or bred or are people who have had an intimate connection with the island. They have all been noteworthy in one way or another… #There has never been more than , people living in Skye at any one time, and for much of history — particularly recent, recorded history — its population has been much smaller than that.Nobody, however, will be too surprised that Norman and Cailean uncovered and portrayed over a thousand eminent Sgiathanaich. Without wishing to kickstart Norman once again, the miracle is that they enumerated so few. The island, like almost all Hebridean islands, has been a breeding ground of talent and character.The only other qualication for entry in the Great Books of Skye is that you must be dead. You, dear reader, however, accomplished you might be, will not be able to read your entry unless metaphysics permits you access from your celestial cloud. These are obituaries, not panegyrics.That lends a sombre tone to certain pages of the Great Book of Skye Three. There are people featured here who, we are sharply reminded, were alive when volume one was in preparation.Here, for instance, is the smiling face of Dr Vicky Ann Galbraith, who was born in Portree in  and who died at home in Aird Bernisdale of brain cancer in .Vicky Ann was achievement personied. A leading scientist for Roche Pharmaceuticals, she also played for Scotland#s national women#s rugby union team on  occasions. Following her fatal diagnosis, she raised thousands of pounds for cancer research by leading sponsored walks from Portree to Glasgow, up the West Highland Way and where.Here is Thomas William Mackenzie. You may have known him as Tommy. He was born in  and he died last March. He was, in the GBS abbreviated subheading, a #printmaker, etcher and gallery owner, Chieftain of Skye Highland Games, boat race devotee, tug-of-war revivalist, shinty enthusiast, and half-marathon runner.#That just about covers it, as a dictionary of biography is forbidden to indulge itself and cannot add that for very many people, Tommy Mackenzie was the face and personality of modern Portree.These volumes, these hefty Great Books of Skye, are a leisurely parade along Wentworth Street and then out to the peninsulas, pausing to wave at or pass the time of day with Victorian land reformers, clan chiefs, bards, teachers, surgeons, fishermen, and climbers. It#s a verbal Skye equivalent of the cover of #Sergeant Pepper#s Lonely Hearts Club Band#.Sir Harold Boulton was not a Sgiathanach. He came from Hertfordshire and was educated at Harrow and Oxford.In  he married into the Highland quality via a Dingwall military family. Boulton already had an interest in Gaelic song and music.He enters the Great Book of Skye because, in the late th century, Boulton seems to have heard a Gaelic rowing song and put his own, English, words to the tune.Those lyrics and that tune have become internationally known as #The Skye Boat Song#. Norman Macdonald digresses wonderfully on Boulton#s creation of a supposed Jacobite anthem.We are still left with the dilemma of the bonnie boat#s journey. The original Gaelic version may have celebrated a voyage from Torrin to Loch Coruisk. For most of the th century, it was assumed to refer to Charles Edward Stuart#s post-Culloden flight by sea from the mainland to Skye.As Charles never made such a journey directly by sea, pedants have more recently suggested that Boulton must have been referring to the Pretender#s actual sea voyage It really, really, does not matter. We are in the realms of mythology. Charles may as well have been sailing from Papua New Guinea. Harold Boulton invented the whole damn thing — the misty isle#s most famous song is a Victorian concoction — and in recognition of that, he deserves his entry in the Great Book of Skye Three.And finally, here we are back in Portree. William Cowie was born in Kiltarlity in  and became an agricultural advisor in Skye in the s. The brother of a professional footballer, Cowie devoted himself to shinty and became one of the greatest players of his era.Fittingly, he married in  a grand-daughter of the captain of the Skye shinty team which had won the inaugural MacTavish Cup in .William and Margaret Cowie had two sons, Ross and William. He died too young, at the age of  years, while playing badminton in Portree Drill Hall.William Cowie would, therefore, have been shy of his th birthday had he led his natural course to June  and a day in Fort William which would have caused him, more even than the rest of Skye, unimaginable pride.It is tempting to say of all three Great Books of Skye that they are for dipping in and out rather than reading as a single narrative. The trouble with that suggestion is that once you#ve dipped in, it is very hard to dip out again.As a trilogy, they are a phenomenal publishing achievement. They should take their place, alongside the inevitable Tommy Mackenzie print, in every home in Skye."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/INDOOR-SHINTY-19-P4-7-FINAL-2.jpg","title":"skye schools indoor shinty competition all the action in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineYoung shinty players fromthroughout Skye gathered to take part in two indoor tournaments for primary school teams last weekend.Portree High’s Fingal Centre hosted competitions for P-P and for P-and-under teams.On a fast and furious day of excellent shinty action teams fromBun-sgoil Ghàidhlig Phort Rìgh won both competitions.Broadford were runners up in the P- competition, with North West taking second spot in the P-under tournament following an epic final."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SEALL-Logo-main-300x193.jpg","title":"skye charities work to be showcased at skeabost","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA multi-charity event will be held in Skeabost on Saturdayto highlight the work of several good causes across Skye.The event will be held at Skeabost Memorial Hall from  am until  pm and will provide information on the work carried out by a iety of charities in the area, as well as insight into the costs and challenges they face.to raise awareness of the event, which will support Skye and Lochalsh Young Carers the Skye and Lochalsh Foodbank Crossroads Care # Skye and Lochalsh Macmillan Cancer Support Skye Dance Bloodwise, and Rotjanas Hands, which Mr Williams set up with his we nearly  years ago.He said: “I have been an independent fundraiser for many years – I am a trustee of Rotjanas Hands – formally known as Hands Across the Water – which I set up alongside my we following the Indonesian Tsunami .”He added: “For me, it has always been important to share particularly when we are so fortunate and others not so.

Guest speaker, Sue Gray, Permanent Secretary, Department of Finance, will also be on hand to provide an insight into wider Programme for Government objectives.Murray Bell, President of Causeway Chamber of Commerce, the largest independent business network in the Causeway Coast and Glens Borough, discusses some of the priorities and the strength in a unied approach.“For  years the Chamber has been helping businesses of all sizes to grow their network, knowledge, influence and reach. Sitting at the heart of the local business community, the Chamber has a large and active membership from sole traders to multinational companies across all sectors totalling more than , employees. “Our relationships with others have helped us to achieve goals beyond those we could ever achieve alone. Across our network, we connect businesses locally, nationally and internationally, with other businesses, with decision-makers and with opportunities. As a respected, recognised voice for business, our opinions are regularly sought by policymakers and politicians and through our networks we have helped businesses of every size, in every sector, to thrive.“The Causeway Coast and Glens area finds itself in exciting times, with plenty of opportunity ahead, from the organic growth of tourism, to the arrival of the Golf in . We also have Northern Ireland’s first Enterprise Zone located within our region and we need to continue to promote and connect the right people to make the most of this opportunity. “To prosper we need to focus on Skills, Infrastructure and Growth. Skills shortage is consistently raised as one of the biggest issues facing our members. There are job vacancies across our towns and villages, and employers cannot fill these because of the shortage of the appropriate skills in the local economy. In many other sectors, we need to promote enterprise and apprenticeship models for schools, colleges, and universities so that students and leavers can build up their knowledge of business, better preparing them for work or to set up their own business, and we need our businesses to be ready to take on and train new people.”Murray adds: “Our Causeway Coast and Glens area, according to recent figures, is the second highest council area in terms of renewable energy production, and we need to build on this towards energy parity and then beyond to energy export. However, we suffer from poor transport and energy infrastructure and we are raising this regularly and know that our local representatives are doing the same. “We need better transport links across the Borough and we need high-quality road and faster rail infrastructure that connects Coleraine to Belfast and Derry-Londonderry, allowing people and goods to travel here and move around.”Explaining the growing importance of technology-based businesses Chamber member, Gary McClarty, Chief Executive of Coleraine based MCL InsureTech says:“Over the last ten years MCL InsureTech has become one of Ireland’s leading online insurance companies. We are passionate about everything online and we are constantly embracing new ways of working to give customers the best possible online experience. We have the technological know-how and expertise to create innovative online loyalty services that will enhance the lives of customers who choose us as their online car insurance partner. “We also market test our IT solutions in a real-time environment, enabling us to continuously improve the end result for both the consumer and business user. Our unique online insurance proposition has already enabled us to capture around € million of the motor insurance market in the Republic which equates to nearly one in every twenty vehicles. We intend to replicate this success in the Northern Ireland market and it is crucial that we can recruit skilled iniduals to help us achieve our objectives.” As part of a major expansion plan in Northern Ireland MCL InsureTech is to create  new jobs in the next  months, with a further  new jobs envisaged over the next three to five years. MCL InsureTech operates three dferent insurance brands ItsWomen.ie, BoxyMo.ie and plus.ie, as well as an IT solutions company DotSys Ltd and a media buying business B Connected Media.Staff numbers at the organisation have more than tripled over the last decade, up from  to .Hospitality and tourism is also another growth sector and ‘A Causeway Welcome’ is a new initiative being developed by Causeway Chamber to support members.

A number of local experts collaborated on the design to ensure the end result was a hotel that was sympathetic to its surroundings. With the number of tourists to the North Coast on the increase, we wish to provide accommodation and leisure facilities to meet demand. It is hoped that groundworks will start in , creating up to  jobs locally.“With two world class golf courses on its doorstep, the Merrow has the potential to become an ideal location for golfing enthusiasts. Portstewart has an excellent links course and is frequently described as one of Northern Ireland’s hidden gems, while Royal Portrush, which will host the  Open Championship, is only a few miles away”.Mark Donnelly from Merrow Hotel and Spa explains the signicance of using a local architect to design the proposed development: “The concept for the design of the hotel was to propose a low-lying building, predominantly three storey, set within its landscape that reached out to the coast and the NW circuit, wrapped around sun-filled courtyard spaces and that could become a focal or signature building for the area. The sea views of Inishowen, North Donegal, and the Scottish islands of Islay and Jura are also an important influence in the design. The objective was to create a building that is of its time and its place, without being ostentatious.” To find out more the Chamber’s priorities and forthcoming plans, spaces are still available for the President’s Business Lunch.

I was born in , my family have been resident in Ballymena for generations, Allen, obviously, on my fathers side and Gribben on my mothers. My parents moved into the Demesne Estate shortly after it was built, first living in Carnduff Drive and then after a few years moving to Glenshesk Drive where they lived the rest of their lives.  I attended Ballymena Boys Secondary School. Music lessons were pretty much a non event. Every exam time each student would be hauled up to the front of class to sing a song and was awarded a C grade. My standout memory of music lessons was hearing the music teacher playing an album of Holsts Planet Suite to himself, this at least started a le long love of classical music.  In my early teens Glam rock was the big thing but apart from Bowie, T Rex, Rod Stewart etc I seldom listened to the charts.  I was more into album bands like Cream, Taste, Hendrix, early Fleetwood Mac, Pink Floyd and especially Led Zeppelin. Of course I followed the usual links from these back through Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, Howlin Wolf to the Delta greats, Robert Johnson, Son House and Charley Patton.  First real early Blues album I heard was by Leadbelly and then Robert Johnson : The King of the Delta Blues , album which has been a major influence on my playing ever since.  I started playing bass guitar when I was about twelve then switched to six string. FLAMINGOMy first paying gig was at The Flamingo playing bass with local rockers Angel when I was fourteen.  After discovering the joys of Blues and Booze, I could be found many a night after closing time, sitting around a fire in the woods at the back of my old school, playing guitar and singing the Blues with friends.  Many Friday nights were passed in The Bridge, Dunloy listening to South Bound Train and most Saturdays were spent in The Pound or The Harp Bar in Belfast, catching as much live music as I could.  This was during the dark days of the Troubles, with bomb warnings and check points an everyday normality but somehow music lovers seemed to live in a world apart, music clubs being one of the few places religion didnt encroach on.  I have played in ious bands throughout the years, including Angel, AGS, Harpers Hill Blues Band, The Flood and BIDDY EARLY as well as playing as a solo Delta Blues player, playing slide guitar harmonica.  Lately I have seriously got into electric Blues Harp, being influenced by Sonny Boy Williamson ii, Little Walter, Paul Butterfield, John Myall, Walter Horton etc. I currently play Blues Harp with The Matchstick Men, Irelands premier Status Quo tribute act, and I also regularly sit in with Legal Tender and Blues Taxis. I can be found most first Saturdays of the month at the excellent BT Blues and Rock Club sitting in on Harp with the featured bands. For the last six years I have been host of BIDDY EARLYS Open Mic at the BT Club, one of the Provinces most successful Open Mics which I also founded. I have finally decided to call an end to it at the start of this year to concentrate on my own music.  I play ious instruments guitar,  string guitar, slide guitar, bass guitar, banjo, mandolin, auto harp, Appalachian mountain dulcimer and of course Blues Harp.  Yeah, after all these years, Ive still got the Blues, once your hooked, thats it for le! - see BB King, John Lee Hooker, Buddy Guy etc.  As for other local promoters of the Blues, theres the afore mentioned BT Blues Club which Looi Burns has been doing an excellent job of running for many years and of course local bands like Legal Tender and Blues Taxis.

Nowadays even the most hard to wake sleepers have bleepers, bells and even the dulcet tones of Alexa at their bedside to ensure they get up for work in time.But in times gone by, it wasn’t just a case of a verbal shot across the bows from the bossyou turned up late for work - back in the so-called ‘good old days’ it could mean the loss of a day’s pay or maybe even your job. And back in the hungry s when every day was a grind to put the most basic grub on the table and keep a roof over your head, it was women like the lady opposite who you relied on to get you to your work on time.Our pictures show one of the last of the ‘knocker-uppers’ who rose well before the crack of dawn every day in le to go round the doors to give people their morning alarm call.Known as ‘The Lady With The Map’, Mary Millar plied her trade in Kells and Connor.A knocker-up was a job in Britain and Ireland that started during and lasted well into the Industrial Revolution, when alarm clocks were neither cheap nor reliable.Most had given up the role by the begnning of the s but Mary was still performing her morning task up until the outbreak of World War .  The knocker-up used a baton or short, heavy stick to knock on the clients doors or a long and light stick, often made of bamboo, to reach windows on higher floors. At least one of them used a pea-shooter!In , the knocker-up would be paid a few pence a week. The knocker-up would not leave a clients window until they were sure that the client had been awoken.A knocker upper would also use a snuffer outer as a tool to rouse the sleeping. This implement was used to put out gas lamps which were lit at dusk and then needed to be extinguished at dawn.There were large numbers of people carrying out the job, especially in larger industrial towns. Generally the job was done by elderly men and women but sometimes police constables supplemented their pay by performing the task during early morning patrols.The pictures, re-discovered by areporter on a research task at the Local Studies Department of Ballymena Library appeared in the Belfast Newsletter in January of .

Only one in ten of these people survived to be discharged from hospital. However, with CPR and defibrillationwithin  to  minutes of collapse, survival rates can rise to % and above.Ambulance response times to cardiac arrests are typically longer than this, as in Northern Ireland they average  minutes. Andthis is why communities across the Northern Ireland have formed these community first responder schemes.Volunteers are trained, and dispatched at the same time as the responding ambulance crew, by NIAS.The Braid Valley is now joining this movement.Leonard Wharry, the scheme coordinator, explained: We aim to go live in early summer with a scheme covering Ballymena, Broughshane and the surrounding rural areas.Were raising money for defibrillators and other equipment, but our priority is to recruit and train volunteers. People who live and work locally, who can make themselves available to respond and who meet our other requirements.”If you are interested in finding out more about the Braid Valley Community First Responder Scheme, the scheme organisers, NIAS and Dalriada Urgent Care are hosting an open evening at  pm on Wednesday February  at:NIAS North Division HQ –  Antrim RoadBallymena.

A no deal Brexit would result in the introduction of tarfs, estimated to cost UK wine importing businesses over £ million a year.ldquoThe introduction of no deal Brexit tarfs would be a double blow for wine businesses after the Chancellor elected to single out wine for a duty rise at the Autumn Budget.From February  the duty on a bottle of wine went up by p, but add a tarf to the duty rise and VAT and this means an average priced bottle of wine, which today costs £., will cost £. in the event of no deal.Read more: How will Brexit affect your travel plans  This is an extra p a bottle more than consumers paid before the referendum result when an average priced bottle of wine was £..There could be some positive benefits for British vineyards however.It is believed that British wines will seem less expensive than its European counterparts as retailers wonrsquot be forced to hike prices because of rate or tarfs.However, British vineyards could be hit with the lack of skilled workers from the EU and vital agricultural funding streams.

At only four-days-old Dáithí travelled to London where he underwent open heart surgery. Six days after that he underwent his second open heart operation.Máirtín described the stay as a “hard week” for his family and told the Andersonstown News that although Dáithí’s hearthasn’t declined, there had been slight damage done to his kidneys due to the high dosage of medicine the Ballymurphy toddler has to take.“It was a hard week for Dáithí, it was a hard week for us as well,” explained Máirtín. “There were constant needles, test after test for Dáithí but we got through it. The staff were amazing and the cardiologist seemed happy with Dáithí’s heartbut noticed some kidney damage.“Dáithí takes medicine for his heart, to help him go to the toilet he takes aspirin, around  doses of medicine in total a week. The hospital will be keeping an eye on it. Dáithi’s heartis okay at the minute and he is stable.“I know I speak for Seph and I when I say it was tough for us. When we first went over last year we have been educating ourselves ever since around organ donation and it’s got a lot more real. We were speaking to the surgeon who is going to be taking Dáithi’s heart out and eventually putting in a new one hopefully, it’s a lot more real,” he saidSince the family’s ‘Is Deontóír Mé Yes I Donate’ campaign began back in July, launched by Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey, there has been an increase of four per cent in the number ofpeople in the north who have opted into the organ donation register.Máirtín stressed how transplant is not a cure, but a last resort when all other options have been exhausted.“Seph and I came back from Newcastle saying we had to up the campaign, we have to keep raising awareness. When we were over we had to sign consent forms for the heart surgery for when Dáithí receives his gt, for the surgery to go ahead. You are basically siging a consent form with a list of risks and the first thing that it states is ‘death’ in capital letters and that’s jumping out of the page.“I did a radio interview this week and we were asked ‘so you are basically waiting for someone to die’ so that Dáithí can receive his gt – I said my son is dying, that’s the reality of it. We are desperate to help save his le and truly believe that awareness is key.”“Dáithí had his tube out for three months there and people thought he was fixed because he looks so well, people don’t always think he is sick.”An avid Paw Patrol and Liverpool FC fan, Máirtín and Seph spoke of how their son will continue to wait on the routine list. “He is stable enough to be at home,” explained Seph. “We asked the medical team over in Newcastle what are his chances of getting a heart on the routine list and there was little to none. It’s not impossible but it doesn’t happen that often. There are quite a few children around Dáithí’s weight and age that are unfortunately on the urgent list. We want to be at this stage because it means we are getting more time.”“You don’t want him to get worse but he is going to get worse,” added Máirtín. “While organ donation as a whole is up, hearts for children are down the last two years and that list is going up. As I said transplant is not a cure, transplant give you time. Everybody is dferent the first transplant baby in the UK is now in her ’s. The anxiety that Seph and I have will probably never go away. The last two years have been some of the best and worst times of our lives. We love Dáithí so much and will do anything to get as much time with him as possible.“We have put down hurdles, the first was getting to Newcastle, the second was getting Dáithí assessed, the third was getting him accepted onto the organ list and the next one is getting him a new heart. There will be lots after that but we’ve been taken it one wee step at a time. We would rather be on that rocky road than no road at all,” he said.A family health morning will take place on Saturday February  from -pm as part of Heart Awarnesss month at Glór na Móna.To register to become an organ donor visit: www.organdonation.nhs.uk register-to-donate register-your-details "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"catherine mcevoy to be named musician of the year","story":"FOR anyone who is familiar with Catherine McEvoy’s music it will come as no surprise to learn that she is to receive the Musician of the Year accolade at the upcoming TG Gradam Ceoil  in Belfast’s Waterfront Hall. As one of the leading concert flautists in Irish traditional music, recording success, TV and radio appearances and a considerable teaching contribution has marked her distinguished career. While Catherine is no stranger to critical acclaim, she says that she was “completely shocked” by the announcement of the award, which comes at a time in her le when she least expected it.Over the last  years Catherine has balanced her own music career alongside a teaching career at St Joseph’s School for Children with Visual Impairment and ChildVision in Dublin. By providing lessons and music therapies to students with multiple disabilities and visual impairment, she gives children a  for their talents and helps equip them with skills to improve their quality of le. The positive impact of Catherine’s work is undeniable but, admittedly, it allows her little time for her own music. Despite being a professional Catherine says she deals with her hectic schedule by treating her own music as a hobby.“I wouldn’t have loads of time for my own music, but I was never a full-time musician,” she explains.“Music was always a hobby for me. I would do some teaching at home, and I would do the Willie Clancy Summer School, and I would do some stuff in the States too. The funny thing about the trips away is that they’re almost like a holiday. “When you’re a professional musician you are under a certain amount of pressure all the time, but I’m lucky in the sense that I’m not because I still play my music in the way I want to play it – it’s something that I’ve always done and I love doing it. It’s still a hobby for me even though it takes up most of my le. I’d love to do a lot more playing for myself than I am, but sometimes work can get in the way.”In her family le, Catherine is also surrounded by music. Her husband Tom also plays the flute, while her three grown-up children, Jane, Ruairi and Fergus are accomplished musicians in their own right, but surprisingly, having grown up in Birmingham, Catherine says she herself hadn’t heard Irish traditional music until she was -years-old. However, it was in those musically formative years in the city that followed that she picked up the distinctive traditional music style of her parents’ native Roscommon, which she would become renowned for in the years to come.“My dad was more into football and my mum was a good ballad singer, she would’ve sang at parties and that,” she says.“I remember listening to Elvis and Clf Richards – we had those sort of records in the house when we were very very young, but not particularly traditional music. “It was only later when I was around eleven that I heard traditional music. I thought ‘oh, I like it’. Then my brother was away in boarding school learning classical fiddle and then he got into The Dubliners and started buying their records. That’s when the whole thing took off. “There was a prolic music scene in Birmingham, as there was in London, but it doesn’t get such a high profile. A lot of the big musicians gravitated towards London, but there was still a lot of great musicians in Birmingham, many of them from Roscommon, and there was lot of great musicians passing through. “Funnily enough I heard an interview with Finbar Furey recently where he was talking about playing in folk club in Birmingham run by a man called Mick Hipkiss – the Skillet Pop Club, and we actually used to play there. I remember seeing Finbar play there, and Christy Moore. I also remember the night when Mick Hipkiss announced this new group that had just been formed and were getting on the road called Planxty – that was back in the early s.”She continued: “A lot of County Roscommon players would travel to Birmingham. One of the first lady flute players I saw play was a woman called Peggy McGrath from County Roscommon and I was really taken with her style – that really spurred me on as well.“The Roscommon style, or the Sligo-Roscommon style, is a rhythmical, flowing sort of style as opposed to what they would call the Northern style,” she explains.“It’s slightly smoother and quite up-tempo. It’s something that I inherited. I wasn’t that I consciously decided to play in that style, it’s just because that was the flute playing that I heard. I’m self-taught and what you hear is what you learn.”Although Catherine says she inherited the Sligo-Roscommon style, she has made it her own indelible skill and fluency. Her recognition as the TG Gradam Ceoil  Musician of the Year undoubtedly encompasses a le-time of achievement, but having picked up a serious injury in her hand just over two years ago, she says it comes following a particularly low part of her career. While her musical ability has suffered as result of her injury, in some ways, the award could not have come at a better time.“Two years ago I had aspontaneous rupture in my right hand in part of my tendon, so I’m very lucky that I can still play,” Catherine says.“It took a lot to get over that I initially thought I wouldn’t be able to play again. I’ve actually had to change my hold on the flute slightly. Obviously the older you get the harder it is to recover, but it has taken a lot of mental anguish to get back to level of playing that I would be happy with. I’m probably only back to about  per cent – I’ll never be  per cent, which is sad in away because I had this idea of retiring and going off into the sunset playing for the rest of my le. I had just gotten over it, and then they go and give me a Gradam Ceoil.”She continued: “It was the biggest shock I ever got in my le. It was massive boost, especially coming from a very low part of my le two or three years ago and sort of clawing my way back. “There are probably loads of other people out there who deserve it, but it’s a great thing and I’m really honoured. I’m delighted and to get an award for something that you’ve been doing for most of your le, something that you get pleasure out of doing, is a great bonus.”She adds: “It’ll be wonderful. It does come with a certain amount of pressure because it’s live TV. I’m the type of person who doesn’t really know how to handle the limelight, but I suppose a lot of Irish people are like that. But it is great, and I’ve had so much good will, which sometimes you don’t realise because you live in a bubble where you think people aren’t thinking about you and then you are showered with all of this good will. That’s nice, and the traditional music community are great.” Gradam recipients, who represent the crème de la crème of traditional music and song, will be joined in live performances on stage by their own special musical guests, including Irish fiddler Paddy Glackin, Michael McCague and multi-instrumentalist Sinéad Egan, to name but a few. A range of VIP guest presenters will also take to the stage last year, actor Stephen Rea and President Michael D. Higgins were amongst the VIP guests at the event.Tickets for the February th TG Gradam Ceoil Awards , priced from £., are available from www.waterfront or +  ."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"ulster u21 club football tournament","story":"Carryduff -St Brigid#s -From David Mohan in CregganDANIEL Guinness was the toast of Carryduff on Sunday as his late point sent his side through to the final of the Ulster U Club Football Tournament at Creggan at the expense of South Belfast neighbours St Brigid#s.This unique local derby between the champions of Antrim and Down lived up to the pre-match hype as the teams served up a thrilling game with some fine scores and plenty of drama with the result in doubt right up until the last kick of the ball when Rory Brolly#s late effort from distance sailed wide as he tried to find an equaliser for the Malone club.In the end, Carryduff probably just about deserved their win as they were a little better in front of the posts with Ronan Beatty notching six points and having a hand in others to take the man-of-the-match award, while Owen McCabe was also in top form for the Down side.St Brigid#s had big games from Patrick Finnegan and Peter Webb, but they just found their scores a little harder to come by, although they certainly couldn#t be faulted for effort as they stuck to the task and almost forced extra-time at the end.Carryduff were first on the board from a Rory Anderson free after three minutes, but St Brigid#s enjoyed a fine spell with Webb kicking a magnicent score in response off his left boot, while Peter Henvey, Rory Brolly and James Smith added points in quick succession to move the Antrim champions three clear after just eight minutes.They would have to wait another  minutes to add to their tally as Carryduff settled into the game and they were on terms soon after when Josh Connery sold a couple of dummies to make a little space and he drilled a fantastic low shot into the net.John McGough followed with a pointed  and Carryduff almost had a second goal straight away, but Pearse Laverty#s shot flashed across the face of goal and wide.Ronan Beatty opened his account from a free on  minutes to make it - to -, while St Brigid#s ended a barren spell with Webb kicking another beauty.The teams went score-for-score for the remainder of the half with Beatty and Connery to the fore for Carryduff, while Webb and Smith raised flags for St Brigid#s as the Down side went in at the break leading - to -.A Laverty free two minutes after the restart extended the gap to three for Carryduff two minutes after the break, but St Brigid#s were level on  minutes when Patrick Finnegan was trailed back inside the area as he was about to pull the trigger and a penalty was awarded. Up stepped Peter Henvey and his shot was well-struck high into the net to tie the game at -.Carryduff made the perfect response as from the restart, they moved straight upfield with Beatty getting on the ball, finding Ciaran Sherry who broke through and squared for Darragh Connolly who rose to palm into the net and restore his side#s three-point lead.Beatty and Owen McCabe added points as it appeared Carryduff were set to pull away, but St Brigid#s refused to break as John Blaney and Rory Brolly kicked scores to get them back to within three.Beatty and Finnegan traded points while Beatty added another from play to make it a four-point game with seven to play, but St Brigid#s were far from done.Five minutes from time, substitute Paul Bradley gathered Peter King#s long ball and waited for movement inside. He spotted James Smith in space and played a high ball that Smith rose to meet and brilliantly palm to the corner of the net.Again, Carryduff went upfield and found the net when Beatty put Connolly in on the right, but while his shot was destined for the net, substitute Eoin Rooney decided to make sure of it by getting his foot to it. However, Rooney was well inside the small square before the ball and the effort was correctly ruled out for a square ball.St Brigid#s took full advantage as they swept upfield and Smith thumped over a great point to level with three to play.Once more, Carryduff were able to respond. This time, Guinness created space  meters out and his shot curled just inside the post with the referee # standing right behind the shot # overruling the umpire who waved it wide.St Brigid#s still had time to save themselves, but they couldn#t engineer a score as Carryduff broke away and almost sealed their win, but Rooney#s shot crashed off the crossbar to give the Antrim champions one last chance. But with the whistle in referee Martin Conroy#s mouth, it was now or never and Brolly had to shoot from an unfavourable distance, the effort tailing right and wide as Carryduff held on.CARRYDUFF: D Ross L Toal, G Henderson, C Cunningham J McGeough , D Coogan, D GuinnessP Laverty , J ConneryR Anderson , O McCabe , P Loughran D Connolly , R Beatty , C Sherry.

The Prime Ministers official spokesman told reporters in Westminster: \"The conditions for a border poll are set out in the Belfast Agreement. It remains the Northern Ireland Secretarys view that the majority of the people of Northern Ireland continue to support the current political settlement and that the circumstances requiring a border poll are not satisfied.\"Ms McDonald said Theresa May did not commit to saying in what circumstances an Irish unity poll might be called. The  Belfast Agreement states that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland may call such a referendumat any time it appears likely that the majority of voters in Northern Ireland would wish to leave the United Kingdom and enter into a united Ireland. The exchange between the Prime Minister and Sinn Fein leader came during a series of meetings with political parties at Stormont House in Belfast. Ms McDonald said that a majority here voted for the United Kingdom to remain in the European Union, and that by the region being taken out of the EU with the rest of the UK, the principle of consent - a key principle of the Belfast Agreement - has been damaged. \"Nobody in Ireland has consented to Brexit, the people of the north of Ireland voted to remain,\" she said. \"The Good Friday Agreement, the central premise of it as regards to constitutional arrangements, is the concept of consent. We believe that in attempting to coerce the north of Ireland out of the European Union against the democratically expressed wishes of the people, that the concept of consent has been damaged. \"We also know from polling data north and south that public sentiment is of a view that in the event of a crash Brexit, that peoples preference would be for Irish unity. \"The only way that anyone can act in a democratic fashion is to respect consent, to respect the democratic wishes of the people of the north of Ireland and to use the Good Friday Agreement, its provisions, to guide us in the time ahead. \"Sothere is a Tory crash, and Mrs May has conceded as much on the floor of the House of Commons, in that event, not alone will there be pressure for a referendum on Irish unity, there will be absolute democratic imperative to call such a referendum.\"When pressed over how Mrs May had responded to this during their meeting, Ms McDonald said that neither the Prime Minister or Secretary of State Karen Bradley committed to saying when oran Irish unity poll would be called. She said: \"But that is the secondary consideration, the primary issue here is the concept of consent which is hardwired into the Good Friday Agreement, the fact that the people of the north of Ireland have not consented to Brexit, the fact that business, farmers, academia, community sector, trade unions and political system almost unanimously regard Brexit as damaging and negative, almost unanimously regard the backstop as the absolutely bare minimum and the bottom line. \"The exception to that consensus is the DUP. The DUP cannot rule the roost on these matters, actually the people need to be in the driving seat, just as they voted against Brexit. In the event of a crash, I think the democratically correct thing to do, the compliant thing to do as regards the Good Friday Agreement, is toto the people again, and in a structured way, to allow for the debate for the conversation for the transition and to put the question on Irish unity. \"Mrs May is a unionist, she takes a dferent view.\""},{"url":null,"title":"unionists vote down bid to celebrate pride 2019 with town","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, unionist councillors voted down the motion, which would also have resulted in a council presence at the annual Belfast Pride Parade in August. Members of the DUP and Ulster Unionists rejected the plan and said they would not be taking lectures on equality from Sinn Fein. Last August, Sinn Fein spearheaded an attempt to fly rainbow flags on the councils premises to show support to LGBTQ+ citizens during Pride.Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon was set to make history by becoming the first council in Northern Ireland to fly the Pride flag above its three civic buildings.But the DUP invoked the call-in mechanism, which allows decisions to be reconsideredat least % of councillors request it.The DUP said strict procedures on flying flags and emblems hadnt been followed properly.The council then sought legal advice, which both the DUP and Sinn Fein claimed justied their stance. The row meant Pride Day last August passed without the flags in place. People taking part in the Belfast Pride parade set off from Custom House Square in central Belfast. Michael Cooper PA WireSinn Fein council group leader Darren McNally told the Ulster Gazette newspaper it was disappointing but not surprising that both unionist parties had voted against lighting up the civic buildings. He said: \"We have a erse community and the onus is on us to ensure we not only represent minority groups such as our LGBT community but that we make them feel valued, included, welcome and safe. \"Lighting up the civic buildings on Pride Day and an official presence at the parade is a forward-moving gesture - small but signicant - which would send out a clear message that ABC council are here for our LGBT community at a time when they are subject to hate attacks and left feeling isolated. \"In amending our original motion of the flying of the Pride flag, we were recognising that some parties are on a journey with regards to this particular issue. Other unionist councillors have supported similar motions in other councils.\"However, UUP councillor Jim Speers hit out at what he called the \"mischievous\" motion. He said: \"Sinn Feins actions go counter to the good working relationships we need at ABC Council. \"They are the last party that should be giving lectures on the need for equality. For a party which was linked to an organisation which terrorised this community for over  years to be talking about equality is disgusting.\"The DUPs Gareth Wilson accused Sinn Fein of \"blatant electioneering\". He added: \"Given the ious and well publicised anti-DUP messages associated with the event in question, our party grouping decided unanimously to decline support for this latest Sinn Fein motion.\" "},{"url":null,"title":"brusselsbound pm may is left in no doubt over bitter brexit divisions","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive.Despite a number of protracted attempts to secure the site and hopes that a deal could be agreed, it was bought by supermarket giant Lidl.While widely regarded as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor leisure facility and while there are some politicians who would like a swimming pool as part of any new development in the resort, this seems unlikely given there are local authority pools in Downpatrick, Kilkeel and Newry.It was previously suggested that the sale of the Annesley Buildings would free up the site for a new hotel and, signicantly, generate funds to help provide new leisure provision in the resort. But that now looks unlikely.As part of the drive to signicantly enhance leisure provision in the resort, council officials are continuing to work alongside education officials to develop a major new sports hub.Shimna Integrated College is planning to redevelop its King Street site which would include the creation of additional sports facilities at nearby Donard Park.It has been suggested that the proposed sports facilities could potentially be developed by the Department of Education in partnership with Newry, Mourne and Down Council with pitches and a sports pavilion forming the new sports hub which could also used by the community.While discussions are ongoing, the local authority still has to address the issue of no meaningful indoor sports facility in the resort to cater for both residents and visitors and is turning its attention to the Annesley Buildings site.Senior council officials have admitted that their initial thoughts about using the location for a town centre hotel have changed, confirming they are working to make a final decision on the way forward. It is also being suggested that the most likely outcome is developing a new leisure-cum-community facility at the Central Promenade site.A feasibility study on the redevelopment of the town centre site for a new hotel was completed several years ago which suggested a two or three-storey extension extension would be acceptable.The new hotel was viewed as a key ingredient in the plan to deliver highly ambitious proposals outlined in the Mournes Gateway proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in Newcastle.Other proposals include a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes and a visitor centre at the site of the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain.It has emerged that work on the high profile tourism project is progressing with moves to establish a board to deliver its ious elements, with membership including representatives from the local council, Tourism NI, Forest Service, Mourne Heritage Trust and National Trust.Over the next month, work is scheduled to start on tendering for consultancy and architectural services, alongside the recruitment of environmental and traffic management services.

Scrum half Conor Gibson was on hand to move the ball quickly to Hutley, who put Luka Walsh in space for the first score of the game.Omagh bounced back well, again using the wind effectively, and their pressure gave way to a penalty which they successfully struck to close the gap.As they continued to apply pressure, the home side had a chance to take the lead on the  minute mark, but their kick drted to the right hand side of the posts.With  minutes left in the half, Down High extended their lead. Having forced Omagh deep into their own half, Luka Walsh capitalised on Omaghrsquos decision to play out from their own quarters when he intercepted the ball to score his second of the day. Hutley slotted over the conversion. Down carried a - lead into half-time.With the strong wind now on their tails and a reasonable points buffer, Down High controlled the game well. Omagh continued to apply plenty of pressure, but the Down defence was hungry and with the exception of a few indiscretions they soaked up the Omagh onslaughts.With  minutes left the game took a critical turn when Hutley slotted agoal to take the Down lead to -.As would be expected from the men from the west, they didnrsquot lie down, but they were forced to chase the game.

However, the book kept me from thinking dark thoughts. Soon, all I wanted was to hold a copy of the book in my hand.Maureenrsquos dream came true in the autumn of  when her haunting story was finally published.Maureen, who is the mother of five grown-up children, explained some of the background as to why she put pen to paper.She added: ldquoI was initially setting out to piece together my family tree and the computer screen flashed up information on my great aunt Brigid. I was so fascinated with what I read that I could see the story unfold in a book and in turn I felt the plot would work well on screen too.Research took Maureen to the Presentation Convent in Co Kildare, which Brigid entered at the age of .Maureen said: ldquoI met with such a warm and friendly welcome from the community of sisters, that it gave me the desire to pursue Brigidrsquos story further. I travelled to Australia shortly after and I received the same, warm and friendly welcome from the sisters of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Wagga Wagga.On herMaureen set about sting through a mountain of information and carefully crafted the remarkable story of her great aunt. The book was published in July  and was officially launched a few months later to a rapturous reception in Murphyrsquos Bar in Downpatrick.A chance meeting which her web designer, Michael McLaughlin, had had a year later led to a further development.She said: ldquoMichael was working on a display in Eclipse Cinema in Downpatrick for another movie when he struck up a random conversation with Colin McIvor.ldquoAs they chatted Michael mentioned that he had recently read a book written by a Downpatrick woman which he thought might make a great movie.ldquoWithin days Colin, with the backing of Northern Ireland Screen, was in my house and we were signing contracts on a movie deal. That was in July last year and since then the whole thing has snowballed.ldquoIt has been a pleasure putting the whole thing together. I wrote it like a novel which makes it easy for the reader to follow the story. My story is entirely based on fact.As Maureen describes the plot her face lights up. She believes her great aunt would be delighted at her revealing the long-lost tale to a new generation.ldquoBrigid had trained as a teacher and in  there was a great demand for priests and nuns with skilled trades in Australia and so she was shipped off to the mother house in Wagga Wagga.ldquoBrigid proved herself capable and popular with the children she taught for six years. But a bad day in front of a teaching inspector led the convent demoting her to refectory duties.ldquoTwo weeks turned into two years of hard labour that took their toll physically and mentally on poor Brigid. Requests toto her former duties were denied and feeling she had no real means of complaint, it left Brigid desperate.ldquoOne day she wandered outside the convent walls. Tears welled up in her eyes as she called at a strangerrsquos home. Her afternoon of tea and warm company by the fire ended all too soon and Brigid was sent back to the convent, seen by a doctor and put to bed, Maureen added.The story really begins in earnest at this crossroads in Brigidrsquos le. Drawing on every ounce of courage she had, Brigid leapt from her bed that night and made a hasty escape barefoot in her nightgown on a foggy winterrsquos night in .This night set the scene for a religious storm unprecedented in Australiarsquos history. Brigid found refuge in the home of Protestants who refuse to disclose her whereabouts to the Catholic authorities.A bishop swore before a magistrate that Brigid was insane and a warrant was issued for her arrest. She was hunted down like an outlaw and the local media attention created a level of sectarian tension rarely unseen in that part of the world.Later, when there was no apology from the bishop for the arrest and slur on her character, Brigid turned to the courts for redress. But taking on the bishop meant taking on the Catholic Church.Maureen had a challenging time presenting Brigidrsquos story.She said: ldquoIt was a scandal at the time but I had to be careful to write it from both sides and let people judge for themselves. Itrsquos all I can do.Maureen says she is looking forward to the filmrsquos premiere.She added: ldquoIt will be the culmination of not just my five years of writing and telling the story, but all the hard work and effort that my family have put into supporting and helping me and, of course, the efforts of the film company, the director and the actors.Colin spoke of his enthusiasm over Maureenrsquos forthcoming film.ldquoI am thoroughly delighted to have optioned such an amazingly powerful book and to have met the inspirational Maureen and her family through the process, he said.He is currently adapting the book into a screenplay. ldquoI believe the film will offer a fantastic role for a strong female lead and supporting cast, he said. ldquoTo be able to bring this beautully written, dramatic and deserved piece to the silver screen some day would be just fantastic.Log on to Maureenrsquos website toon the forthcoming movie premiere at www.theextraordinarycaseofsisterliguori..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 30%2C 1979  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash A Strangford man had a narrow escape from death when he turned up for work on Monday morning at the new Abbey Lodge Hotel, outside Downpatrick.A muffled explosion during the night had ripped apart a section of the hotel mdash which was due to open in three weeksrsquo time mdash but no alarm was raised and workmen were unaware of the danger when they reported for work.One of the men, Mr Francis Black, from Strangford, passed through the lounge and noticed a black bag and two yellow tins. He thought it was some material left for him to carry on with a job and picked it up.Mr Black failed to notice several wires leading from the bag, but an examination of the contents told him something was wrong. He put it down and it was discovered later that the contents were competence for a lethal fire-type bomb.By then Mr Blackrsquos colleagues had discovered the damage caused by another bomb and a warning was raised. Police and firemen rushed to the scene and the main Downpatrick-Crossgar Road, beside the hotel, was sealed off as army bomb disposal experts raced from Lisburn.An army officer successfully defused the second bomb and workmen moved in to assess the damage, which was confined that bedroom section of the hotel.The hotel owner, Mr William Polly, said: ldquoDoors, windows, the gable and the roof have all been damaged and this includes a total of eight bedrooms. It will mean that an entire section of the building containing the bedrooms will have to come out.

These premises will be our new premises with dedicated areas for Lowden acoustic guitars and new electric guitar ranges, said George.ldquoWe are currently planning out the logistics of our move from Down Business Park. This will require attention to detail and be orchestrated stage by stage to minimise any disruption to our ability to complete and ship our guitars to waiting customers.Lowden Guitars successfully managed to keep news that it was working with Sheeran mdash one of the worldrsquos biggest music artist, who has sold  million albums and has had more than  billion streams mdash under wraps for considerable time.

But a starting price for a Lowden was three grand. When yoursquore , three grand may as well be a million pounds.ldquoThe dream of any kid who likes music is to have a guitar and the dream of any musician is to have a signature guitar.George realised that he needed to make a range that was something special and revealed that he sought inspiration from the North Coast.ldquoEvery guitar that I design and make I have to feel afterwards proud of it, I have to feel that I have achieved something with it. That itrsquos not just a normal guitar, he explained.ldquoThe main aim was to design and make a guitar here at an affordable price noticeably better than anything  at that price range. So I went up to the North Coast and spent a week at the Giants Causeway walking and thinking and drawing. Then having designed it, of course I sent it off to Ed and the rest is history.Sheeran has previously bemoaned that fewer youngsters seem to be interested in guitar-playing these days.ldquoThere are fewer guitar bands and fewer artists using guitars now, and not as many kids picking up guitars, he added.ldquoThat is something I would like to change by getting these great quality guitars, made in Ireland, into kidsrsquo hands and encouraging them to learn and progress.The Sheeran by Lowden acoustic guitar range features eight inidual models across two small body sizes familiar from the Lowden range, known as the S and the Wee Lowden.The guitars have been designed for uncompromising tone and playability and are made using sustainably-sourced wood including naturally fallen trees and reclaimed spruce.George says that the new range combines years of hand-crafting and traditional luthier methods with new construction technology.ldquoItrsquos taking everything I have learnt over the last  years, cherry-picking from that a few traditional methods of working by hand and introducing those into a whole series of new groundbreaking procedures for guitar making so that the end result is a guitar made in Ireland but one which really sings and which I hope inspires many young musicians and older ones as well, he added.The first orders should be shipped in March.

However, the Irish government, facing a growing revolt on the matter from TDs, says the bill would breach EU law and is opposing it. The Control of Economic ActivityBill  does not specically mention Israel but would make it an offence for a person to “import or sell goods or services originating in an occupied territory or to extract resources from an occupied territory in certain circumstances”.The bill passed through the Upper House of the Irish Parliament, the Seanad, by - and - in two votes in November. Last month, a further vote in the lower house, the Dail, saw it supported - with three abstentions. It has a further three stages to go in the Dail after which it would have to be signed by the Irish president to become law. Some observers suggest it is unlikely he would, due to government opposition.DUP MLA William Humphrey said: “It seems bizarre that the European enthusiasts in the Dail would try to pass a bill boycotting Israeli goods when such a move is not compatible with EU trade law.“Israeli technology and goods are embedded completely in our everyday lives and those proposing boycotts ignore the practical and economic realities of such a move. “If the Republic of Ireland wants to turn its back on the opportunities of working with Israel I would extend an invitation to the Israeli legislators to come to Northern Ireland. I know many businesses would welcome the opportunity such a visit would bring.”In a speech to TDs on January , Irish Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney said the bill would place the Republic in breach of EU trade law.“Trade is an exclusive competence of the European Union,” he said. “We are not in a position to raise a barrier and declare that it is prohibited to bring to Ireland, for sale or personal use, goods which enter the EU legally, and are freely circulating where in the single market.”The bill will not signicantly impact on Israeli settlements, he said. However, it could lead the Republic into legal challenges, signicant EU penalties and paying damages to those with economic interests in the Israeli settlements.Brexit: DUP will vote against any backstop, says Sammy WilsonPolice called to deal with agitated male carrying alleged offensive weapon Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Such legislation would also undermine the Republic’s credibility to influence Middle East issues at EU and UN level, he said.And it could create conflicts for US companies in the Republic and Irish companies in the US, he said, because the US Congress has been considering legislation which forbids companies based in America from cooperating with Israeli trade bans. “For these reasons, no responsible party of government could support this bill and this government must and will oppose it,” Mr Coveney said.Opposing the bill in the Jerusalem Post, Irish Jew and former Irish minister for justice and defence, Alan Shatter, said none of the proponents of the bill in the Irish Parliament had mentioned ongoing terrorist attacks on Israeli civilians or the support by Hamas and Hezbollah for Iran’s “genocidal objective of destroying the Israeli state”.Although not much emphasized, he said, it is also clear from the bill’s terminology that it applies to any goods or services originating from any Israeli presence in east Jerusalem and on the Golan Heights.In addition, he said, Sinn Fein’s enthusiastic support for the bill is “payback for the training given by the PLO in terrorism and bomb making” to the IRA.And slamming Fianna Fail’s support for the bill, he noted that in the s the party “denied residential visas to many German Jews trying to escape Nazi Germany and, postwar, to Holocaust survivors”. He believes that the bill’s passage “may grind to a halt”the government considers it too expensive to implement and designates it as “a money bill”. If enacted, Mr Shatter added, it may also have no immediate effectMr Coveney declines to implement it, although this could be reversed by any minister of foreign affairs who might succeed him.try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES:  things you should never EVER say or do to someone from Northern IrelandHas PSNI officer Bobby Singleton become an unwitting sex symbol Ian Ogle daughter: UVF gang that murdered Dad are still planning to kill my brotherVIDEO: Police investigation into fight at Belfast International Airport, AldergroveIN PICTURES: the funeral of Ian Ogle          ..

I think he’d be wasting quite a lot of someone ’s money.”New Presbyterian moderator calls for ‘common sense’ over Irish language act Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES:  things you should never EVER say or do to someone from Northern IrelandHas PSNI officer Bobby Singleton become an unwitting sex symbol Ian Ogle daughter: UVF gang that murdered Dad are still planning to kill my brotherVIDEO: Police investigation into fight at Belfast International Airport, AldergroveIN PICTURES: the funeral of Ian Ogle          ..

I wanted to do something which would allow me to combine the flexibility of family with work and give me a good balance. I also wanted to develop and use my skill sets.”From her initial idea, Eveva was born – setting her up as a virtual assistant. “I saw a niche in the market for this type of work with small businesses and self- employed people who simply do not have the time to manage the tasks themselves,” she explained.“I offer a range of services, particularly in digital marketing, where I manage email marketing campaigns and social media pages for clients. I joined a few local networking groups, where I have since met my first clients and I am now starting to see referrals come through.” she explains.Eve turned her vision into a reality after taking part in the Go For It Programme, which is delivered free of charge by a team of experienced business mentors through Northern Ireland’s wide network of enterprise agencies. “Often it is hard to know where to start that was my experience before starting the Go For It Programme. The support and guidance offered through it helped me fine tune my business idea from concept to working reality. “Workspace Enterprises helped me with practical things in the early stages like setting out a business plan and doing a detailed analysis. It was great for helping me to budget and forward plan,” said Eve.Brexit: DUP will vote against any backstop, says Sammy Wilson Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES:  things you should never EVER say or do to someone from Northern IrelandHas PSNI officer Bobby Singleton become an unwitting sex symbol Ian Ogle daughter: UVF gang that murdered Dad are still planning to kill my brotherVIDEO: Police investigation into fight at Belfast International Airport, AldergroveIN PICTURES: the funeral of Ian Ogle          ..

But also we recognise that it has been politicised in many ways, and we think that discussion needs to be depoliticised for the benefit and the good of the whole of our land.“I think we need to be sensitive, particularlygetting an Irish language act was too costly and bureaucratic and we need to measure that against hospital beds and all those aspects. So from that point of view, I think we need a little bit of common sense in the discussion.”He went on to add: “I think we just need to be careful within the breadth of what that encompasses.“Certainly we’ve to value the Irish language in a way that those who do think it’s important [are able to] recognise that and can see that.“But I think there have to be constraints and there has to be a bit of common sense in just how much it actually costs, and that I suppose is the other angle other people come at it from.”Lord Trimble raises £k in two days in legal action over backstopBrexit: DUP will vote against any backstop, says Sammy Wilson Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES:  things you should never EVER say or do to someone from Northern IrelandHas PSNI officer Bobby Singleton become an unwitting sex symbol Ian Ogle daughter: UVF gang that murdered Dad are still planning to kill my brotherVIDEO: Police investigation into fight at Belfast International Airport, AldergroveIN PICTURES: the funeral of Ian Ogle          ..

He decided to put together a calendar of his work together to help raise money for the Alzheimers Society, as his father died from the disease in .The -year-old was encouraged to put together the calendar after posting some of his pictures in a local Facebook group.He said: \"I was surprised by the positive response and all the encouraging comments my first set of photos received, said Phil, ldquoWhen I posted another set of photos people started suggesting putting them together in a book or a calendar.\"Mr Lewis said the idea stuck and he asked the group to vote for their favourite photos which would be included in the calendar, before working with local graphic designer Ceri Legg who designed the layout and Beacon Printers, who printed the calendars.Around  calendars were printed altogether which were on sale in shops throughout the town, but have now fully sold out.ldquoI was really worried at first as the number  was suggested to me by the printers, and as soon as I picked them up I start feeling anxious about how exactly I was going to sell  calendars,\" said Mr Lewis.\"I thought that  would have been a more realistic number. I was completely taken aback by the huge response.\"I had people contacting me from all over the world ndash Australia, Spain, Texas, askingI would post calendars to them. This is on top of the response from local people.\"I spent most of my evenings in that first week doing deliveries all over Penarth,\" Mr Lewis added.Through the sales, Mr Lewis has raised more than pound, for the Alzheimers Society.He said: \"It seemed like the right thing to do really, as Penarth is a very community-oriented town so doing a calendar for charity fits with the outlook of the people of Penarth.\"Now, Mr Lewis is looking at printing more calendars this year to help raise further funds for the charity.\"If the idea of this calendar had never been suggested then my photos would have ended up just sitting on my computer,\" he said.\"Irsquom just glad that this hobby that I really like has ended up being put to good use by raising this money for charity.To get in touch with Mr Lewis about purchasing a calendar, email philip.lewis@live article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The Seconds, Thirds and Fourths are all at home, taking on Stroud , Whitchurchand Gwentrespectively, while the th XI takes to the road to play the other Gwent side in De Cymru  at Cwmbran Stadium .Penarth Hockey Club always welcomes new, old and ing players, umpires, supporters, friends and helpers regardless of age and ability.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We tell client’s stories through engaging content written by former journalists – grab their customers’ attention with stunning design, maximise conversions by using the latest digital marketing expertise, and develop websites which are living, breathing, online stores or shop windows. As content director, my role is to bring almost  years’ experience in journalism, political communications, corporate PR, crisis management and digital content crafting to Grofuse. How did the business start and how has it grown The business was created by a fusion of expertise to achieve sales growth, including experienced digital marketers, PR consultants, web developers, software developers, graphic designers, illustrators and motion designers. I co-founded the company with expert digital marketer Denis Finnegan who has spent  years fuelling online lead generation for businesses. Growth has been swt over the last  months. We’ve employed an effective combination of marketing efforts and created fans of our existing clients.What is your background I’m a seasoned hack, having worked in print journalism for almost  years followed by a few years as a political communications adviser. I spent a brief period teaching English and history at secondary level before entering a newsroom. The working environments were poles apart in terms pace, excitement and... language choices. As a school pupil and university student, I worked on building sites, supermarkets, farms, bars, bread delivery vans, a bakery and even a bacon factory kill-line. However, I had never encountered such flurries of expletives as I did in newsrooms. Great places to work. High pressure, tight deadlines and great target-setting – a superb way to fuel productivity in any work environment.What do you do dferently from your competition and what are your strengths Clear communication with our clients is our greatest strength. We listen intently to what our clients’ goals are, take time to learn about their products and gain full understanding of their ideal customers. We start with a blank canvass and devise bespoke digital strategies to fuel each client’s business growth by engaging their target market effectively and delivering genuine sales leads that are easily quantiable.Who are your main customers Our customers operate across a wide range of sectors. We are currently working with clients across the UK and Ireland, US, France and Spain. Do you have a target in mind in terms of where you want the business to grow We are currently focusing the bulk of our efforts on the island of Ireland with a particular focus on Dublin and Belfast. What challenges have you faced The somewhat ‘snake-oil industry’ reputation of digital marketing sometimes poses a barrier to speaking with decision makers who in the past have invested with little . However, once we’re given an opportunity, we like to let the results do the talking. Who most inspires you Those who thrive in the face of adversity and have strong growth mind-sets. The type of person with the right measure of accountability, skill and relentlessness to inspire their teams to achieve targets. It’s a mind-set akin to that of a top athlete whose body is screaming ‘slow down’ in the business end of a race but whose mind interprets that as a cue to go faster. My we Martina – a former operations manager with Lidl Ireland who co-founded and runs leading human resources consultancy, HR Team – has these qualities in abundance. She inspires me in everything I do.Where do you see yourself in the next few years I love living and working in the North West. Whatever people like to call Derry or Londonderry, it’s a very special place with a lot of talent and a big future in driving the cross-border regional economy. With our headquarters at Catalyst Inc and plans underway for satellite offices in Dublin and the UK, we want to ensure our agency plays a part in shaping that economic prosperity with the provision of more high-quality jobs for the area.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/js_1.jpg","title":"uncertainty interconnectors and the future of ni energy post brexit","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business With a potential ‘no deal’ around the corner on Brexit, what will that mean for the future of Northern Ireland’s energy policy – especially on renewables, the I-SEM all-island market and power generation  John Simpson takes a closer look On the last working day before Christmas , the System Operator for Northern Irelandpublished draft proposals of how the electricity systems and grids on this island may operate in -. Subject to confirmation by the all-island Single Electricity Market Committee, the auction for electricity generators to be awarded capacity contracts, on an all-island basis, has identied electricity capacityof , MW which will be in place for the year starting October ,  – , MW of that all-island total is attributed to Northern Ireland.This is a critical series of draft decisions which will reassure the large conventional generators about their contracts and will impose the discipline of revenue limits constrained by the capacity auction. The draft decisions also point to the expectations in terms of the capacity earmarked from renewable sources, from inter-connection with the Scottish grid and the capacity adjustments that may follow from demand-side adjustment contracts.SONI has not been as open and transparent as should have been possible. Readers must make the assumption that ties location to where capacity payments are identied in sterling and euro.The SONI statement lists  generator names ,  of which are identied as DSUswhich leaves  others. Eight are shown as part of the AES capacity in Ballylumford and Kilroot: four are small capacity generators, six each have capacity of over MW , and the last capacity source linked to Northern Ireland is the Moyle Interconnector.SONI does not present the capacity awards in a way that allows readers to identy the location of each successful unit.The Utility Regulator has agreed that the available Northern Ireland capacity should include  MW from the Moyle Interconnector which represents over % of locally available capacity. This is a judgement that might be queried. Is the interconnectora guaranteed source of capacity  If, at a time of peak demand in Northern Ireland, demand in the grid in GB had no spare capacity, presumably the capacity might not be available for supply to Northern Ireland. The regulator and SONI are well placed to judge the probability of this outcome and might argue that it is a minimal risk.There are some interesting features stemming from the assumptions made in setting the framework for the capacity auction. First, Northern Ireland has been treated as meriting some contract iations because of locational constraints. This is a reflection of the limited capacity of the electricity grid on the whole island to send electricity to the places where there is demand. Both the Dublin area and Northern Irelanddid not attract auction bids adequately to supply these area locational constraints. For Northern Ireland. the easy explanation lies in the absence of the long awaited north-south grid expansion from to the planned distribution hub in Co Tyrone.The capacity auction allowed for the acceptance of bids with prices which are higher than the main auction prices which would match supply and demand across the whole island. Because of the locational deficit, some Northern Ireland bids now show capacity payment prices above the all-Ireland ceiling of £, per MW which applies to most of the successful bids.In the quotation from AES for the two large fossil fuel burning units, the proposal is that they should attract payment prices of £, and £, per MW. At first sight this appears to allow a premium of nearly % on the payment price for each MW. This seems more than a marginal cost and points to the possible cost savingsthe proposed new north-south link had been operational.This answer for the older high capacity units at Kilroot is a further reflection of the doubt about the continued viability of these units. It will be remembered that a year ago, these same two units were deemed unsuccessful in the auction but, at a late stage when faced with a request for a derogation to be allowed to close these units, the initially agreed settlement was revised.A year ago, the first capacity auction under the rules of the newly instituted I-SEM, was accepted with a capacity supply of near to , MW for all of Northern Ireland. Now, in early , SONI has concluded that for security of supply Northern Ireland should contract for just under , MW. There is no obvious major uplt in demand in Northern Ireland so that, quietly, the suggestion is that the arithmetic in late  may now be thought to have been slightly too risky.The capacity auction is a fundamental building block of electricity supply policy for Northern Ireland. However, on its own, the allocation of capacity and the possible scope for investment in new generating capacity must also be seen in the context of increasing,market forces allow, the proportion of electricity supply that is supplied from renewable sources. The distribution of generating capacity is still dominated by fossil fuels. Northern Ireland’s capacity is nearly % from gas andcoal. However, the statistics showing the proportion of electricity supply from renewables points to average consumption from renewables of nearer to -%. Because of the iability in the contribution of wind based renewables, it would be hazardousgreater security dependence was allocated to renewables.In turn, the caveat about the possible role of renewables points to the possible value of further investment in energy storage for which no major scheme has been launched. If Kilroot power station survives for a further three to four years, then the experimental electricity storage capacity on that site may become an attractive asset.There are several continuing questions about Northern Ireland’s security of electricity supply. Will Kilroot be given further stays of execution after   Will the North South interconnector eventually be built  Will the proposed large natural gas burning power station be built in Belfast  Will the politically unpopular investment in anaerobic digestion plants be tackled  Will the Brexit settlement, or lack of it, damage the continued operation of the all-island single electricity market  But... it seems Kilroot has been given a temporary extension of its role in keeping the lights on.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
