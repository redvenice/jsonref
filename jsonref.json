While he acknowledged there should be less harm to civilians, he said they shouldn\u0027t be living near such an important foreign compound. Afghan security forces pushed back Taliban fighters from both cities, but a suicide bomber detonated his explosives on Monday in Kunduz, killing at least six policemen and wounding 15, officials and the Taliban said.Trump has made little secret of his desire to bring the 14,000 U.S. troops home from Afghanistan, where American troops have been deployed since a U.S.-led campaign overthrew the Taliban in 2001.But there are concerns among Afghan officials and U.S. national security aides about a U.S. withdrawal, with fears Afghanistan could be plunged into a new civil war that could herald a return of Taliban rule and allow international militants, including Islamic State, to find a refuge."},{"url":null,"title":"Katie Price holiday Turkey ex builder","story":"Share this articleKatie Price is on holiday with ex con who was jailed for £90,000 fraud and tax evasion"},{"url":null,"title":"Man dressed astronaut moonwalks potholes resembling craters Indian street","story":"Share this article          The glare of the streetlights creates a spooky glow over the man in the astronaut suit as he pretends to walk over the craters on the moon The minute-long video was shared on Twitter with on user commenting:  \u0027ISRO can train their astronauts in these roads so that we have a successful Moon mission in 2022.\u0027  "},{"url":null,"title":"PICTURED Bahamas resident brings 97 dogs home shelter Hurricane Dorian","story":"Share this article          Her Facebook post has more than 1,300 shares and nearly 600 comments from users across the country         Philips (pictured) runs the shelter on her own accord, with no help from major animal rescue organizations and no government fundingThe Facebook post has more than 3,100 shares and nearly 300 comments.    People who\u0027ve heard about her efforts have donated crates for sick and frightened dogs.Philips told ABC Action News that she\u0027s lost power and some water has begun leaking into her home.   Hurricane Dorian made landfall in the Bahamas on Sunday and has already left the islands in destruction.

This, of course, would defeat Labour’s policy and lead to a fresh housing crisis.         British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher hands over the deeds to the council house belonging to the King family of Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, 25th September 1979. One of the first families to buy their house from the local authority Universal Basic IncomeLabour policy:Workers would all receive a basic income, regardless of any other wealth or income.Labour is not yet committed to such a policy nationally, but Mr McDonnell announced in May that, as Chancellor, he would set up pilot schemes in Liverpool, Sheffield and the Midlands.What would it cost?According to the Institute for Policy Research at Bath University, a nationwide universal basic income set at the level of current benefits would cost £288billion a year, increasing public spending by over a third.This would inevitably lead to taxes being raised – cancelling out the financial benefits of universal basic income for many.What would the reality be?Finland experimented with a basic income for 2,000 unemployed people in 2017 and 2018, in the hope that it might help reduce the country’s nine per cent unemployment rate – roughly twice that of Britain’s.However, the Finnish government suspended the test after initial results showed that it did not increase recipients’ chances of finding a job.          Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn (centre) with members of his shadow cabinet following a shadow cabinet meeting at the Lowry Theatre in Salford today with the party expected to face a general election in daysNationalising UtilitiesLabour policy:Renationalising utilities was a prominent policy of Labour’s 2017 general election manifesto, which said it would save households an average of £220 a year in energy bills.What would it cost?A recent study by the Centre for Policy Studies said buying the shares of privatised utility companies would cost £306billion – £185billion for gas and electricity, £86.3billion for water, £4.5billion for the Royal Mail and £30billion to buy out private finance initiatives which have been used to build new schools and hospitals.What would the reality be?Labour’s belief that every household would save £220 a year is based on the assumption that nationalised industries would be more efficient or equally so as private firms. Yet many nationalised industries such as Rolls-Royce and Jaguar Land Rover struggled in the 1970s but enjoyed a huge rebound in fortunes after being privatised.Income tax risesLabour policy:TO raise income tax for the top 5 per cent of earners –those on more than £80,000 a year. Tax on annual income between £80,000 and £123,000 would rise from 40 per cent to 45 per cent. Income over £123,000 a year would attract a rate of 50 per cent.How much would it raise?Labour claims these tax rises would raise £4.5billion a year. However, the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies disputes this, in the belief that the more people are taxed, the less their incentive to work and the greater their incentive to avoid tax – or even emigrate. It is quite possible, says the IFS, that the higher rates would earn nothing extra at all for the Treasury.What would the reality be?In the 1970s, James Callaghan’s Labour government introduced a top rate of tax of 80 per cent. It resulted in a brain drain and a net outflow of 500,000 migrants in the late 1970s.Abolish Tuition feesLabour policy:Students not to pay university tuition fees, with the reinstatement of maintenance grants.What would it cost?In 2017, Labour priced the policy at £11.3billion a year, its single largest spending commitment. But analysis by the Financial Times shows the cost has since soared to £16.2billion partly due to the rise student numbers.What would the reality be?Unlikely to substantially increase the number of students from lower income homes, as Labour intends, as more school leavers from this social class are already going to university than before the Tory-Lib Dem coalition increased tuition fees to £9,000 a year.         According to the government, Tony Blair\u0027s 1999 promise that almost half of young people should go to university by the age of 30 was fulfilled in 2018 (file photo)Wealth taxLabour policy:IN 2012, Mr McDonnell advocated a policy advanced by Left-wing economist Greg Philo for a one-off levy of 20 per cent on the assets of the wealthiest 10 per cent of the population. He said this would pay off most of the national debt.How much would it raise?Hardly anything. The very rich predominantly have jobs that are highly mobile and many would leave Britain to work abroad. This would mean that those hit by a wealth tax would be those who cannot emigrate and who are among the top 20 per cent – who have assets of over £380,000. It is fair to say that such people are not exactly the ‘super-rich’.What would the effect be?A few years ago, France’s Socialist government introduced a wealth tax – only to see wealthy iniduals flee the country. The policy has since been reversed.Four-day weekLabour policy:MR McDonnell has said he’s considered cutting the standard working week from five days to four – claiming it would boost productivity and work-life balance.What would it cost?No direct cost to the public purse – though the country’s whole economy could suffer if it failed in its stated purpose of increasing productivity and overall output fell. Also, extra staff would surely have to be hired to make up the slack.What would the effect be?In 2008, the US state of Utah experimented with a four-day week but abandoned the idea after none of the promised savings materialised."},{"url":null,"title":"Air traffic controller helps Max Sylvester land plane time Perth","story":" The traffic controller calmly directed the trainee pilot to circle the airport so he could get familiar with the runway.As he began to land, the controller instructed Mr Sylvester to make slight movements so he would land safely.

The couple decided they wanted to pay for a downstairs extension in April 2017 as they began to plan ahead for family life.They now have two children together, Bella, aged three and Max, one, born in July last year - and wanted to make sure their home was big enough for his arrival.Commercial manager Mrs Spencer became pregnant with Max in late 2017, and Oaks Construction Kent started work on the extension in January 2018.The work was expected to cost an estimated £37,000 including an additional 20 per cent for additional spend if needed, giving the Spencers a £45,000 budget to transform their home.It would include the demolition of the existing conservatory, with associated groundworks in the back garden, to build a 6m sq ground level extension, compromising a large open plan kitchen-diner, and a playroom for the children.The couple were told the work would be completed by April 2018, a full three months before Mrs Spencer was due to give birth to Max.

I have no idea what he did with the money, but he didn\u0027t use it on our home.\u0027Mr Spencer said the alarm bells began to ring loud and clear by April when little work had been done.         Despite the family being awarded £31,000, they are yet to receive a penny from the builder         Mr Spencer said he agreed a payment plan with Mr Patrick for the work at his home in Kent         Mr Patrick\u0027s van is pictured after he finished collecting his tools during the building workThe father said he confronted Mr Patrick about the lack of progress that month.

I wanted to try to settle this amicably and I asked him to meet up with me so we could come up with a plan to get my money back.           How Mr Patrick left the roof of the Spencer family\u0027s ground floor extension\u0027He completely ignored us and I was so angry that someone had come into my home, destroyed our family home and left my family and kids penniless. It put a massive stress on our family.\u0027 Mr Patrick downed his tools and walked away from the job completely on May 20.Mr Patrick said he felt as though he had no choice but to let other builders finish the job for him.Mr Spencer - angry at how the work was over running - said he agreed to pay Mr Patrick\u0027s sub-contractors to finish the work if Mr Patrick was unable to carry on and get the work done on time.Mr Patrick confessed about his money woes and despite saying he would have \u0027done my best\u0027, couldn\u0027t promise the project would be fulfilled.Mr Patrick said: \u0027That year we had several jobs on and unfortunately we were still owed £6,000 by someone else. That put us on the back foot.\u0027I tried to do everything I could but things got a bit sticky. I was asked to leave Ricky and Emma\u0027s. I had to walk away otherwise the work wouldn\u0027t get done at all.          The extension to the property in Tonbridge was finally finished in August last year         The extension at the home was finished four months after the initial expected completion date \u0027My sub contractors finished the work for Riki and Emma. If I had the money from the previous client I would have been able to finish the work. \u0027But it worked out that when I was asked to finish the job, I had no money.\u0027Mr Spencer said he felt as though he had no option but to take legal action against the firm.After taking Oaks Construction Kent to the small claims court, the business was ordered to pay the Spencers £31,145 in debt repayments and court costs.But Mr Patrick has since liquidated his bankrupt business, meaning despite months of waiting and trying to claim what is rightfully theirs, Mr Spencer said he hasn\u0027t received a single penny back in repayments from Mr Patrick or his company.He said: \u0027We have been told he has nothing to take. We took it as far as the High Court and they just said all he had was £2,000.

It was either that or try to get more money out of him.\u0027So far the family paid have £5,000 in court fees in a bid to get their money back.On top of the £50,000 already spent, the Spencers had to take out £8,000 in loans, spend £18,000 on credit cards, borrow £7,000 and extend their personal overdrafts to fund work to complete the unfinished extension.Mr Spencer said he leaned on traders known to the family, such as independent plumbers, roofers, plasterers and electricians, to finish the job Oaks Construction Kent walked away from.The extension was finally finished in August last year, four months after the initial expected completion date and a month after Max was born.The couple were however able to move back into the property six weeks prior to the job being finished, two weeks before Emma gave birth.          The front room of the house in Kent is pictured after the extension was eventually completed         Another view of the completed extension in Kent is pictured after it was eventually doneIn total the Spencers spent six months living away from the family home with Mrs Spencer\u0027s parents.         The couple wanted to work to be finished a full three months before Mrs Spencer was due to give birth to MaxMr Spencer said: \u0027The effect it has had on us financially has been horrendous. We will be suffering for another five years at least. It\u0027s going to take us years to pay our debts off.\u0027It\u0027s clear we won\u0027t get any of the money back.

He could not say more than that it is a “savage and beautiful novel, and it speaks to us today, all around the world, with particular conviction and power”.“The bar is set particularly high for Atwood and she soars over it,” he said. “I can’t wait for everyone to read it.”This is the sixth Booker nomination for the Canadian author, who won the ’ prize in 2000 for The Blind Assassin. She is set to face off against another former winner, Salman Rushdie, who is nominated for Quichotte, a retelling of Cervantes’ Don Quixote set in today’s US. Rushdie’s 14th novel has not gone down well with critics the Observer felt it was “rarely as funny as Rushdie thinks it is”, while the New York Times said his books were “increasingly wobbly, bloated and mannered”.Judge and editor Liz Calder, who published Rushdie’s 1981 Booker winner, Midnight’s Children, denied there had been any bias at play and said they had not worked together for decades. “It is barely even a friendship,” she said. “It was once.”Florence said: “If you are going to make a tilt at one of the greatest works of literature, you better hope you can play at Cervantes’ level,” adding that Rushdie’s novel is “a hell of a ride”.The giant underdog of the shortlist is Lucy Ellmann’s Ducks, Newburyport, published by tiny, Norwich independent Galley Beggar Press. A 1,000-page monologue of an angst-ridden homemaker in Ohio, the British-American author’s book unfolds in a single sentence and s love, climate change, gun violence and the condition of the US. Judge and composer Joanna MacGregor called the book an example of “radical literary form and voice” and, despite its hefty size, praised it for flowing “with dazzling light and speed”.British novelist Bernardine Evaristo is nominated for Girl, Woman, Other. Following 12 characters, most of them black British women, the novel sees some stories overlapping to make connections between disparate humans. Judge and author Xiaolu Guo called it “impressive and fierce … there is never a single moment of dullness”.Nigerian novelist Chigozie Obioma makes the shortlist for An Orchestra of Minorities. Narrated by a chi, a  spirit in Igbo myth, the novel follows Nonso, an ambitious Nigerian graduate who becomes trapped in Cyprus after falling for an education scam. Judge and journalist Afua Hirsch called it “a crucial journey into a heartache that is both mythical and real”.Turkish novelist Elif Shafak is nominated for 10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World, described by Calder as “audacious and dazzlingly original”. Set in Istanbul, the novel portrays in the final moments of a murdered sex worker’s life as her brain slowly shuts down.Florence said he had previously felt that Booker judges had said “deeply daft things about the need for cracking stories and relatable characters and stylistic adventure” in fiction.“Now find I agree with absolutely everything they’ve said,” he said. “Is it too much to want a book to be adventurous, to be formally inventive, to have an emotional and intellectual core that grips you and sends you to new places, and deep into yourself, to understand how the world might be? I don’t think it is.”Four of the six shortlisted books are published by imprints of the giant conglomerate Penguin Random House. Prize rules stipulate that imprints that have never been longlisted can only submit one book a year, while previously nominated publishers can submit up to five. Florence denied that PRH’s dominance suggested the rules needed reworking: “Given their bidding power, and the range, scale and quality of their editorial talent, maybe this is a great year for PRH but two or three books should be their minimum target grade.The winner, who takes home £50,000, will be announced on 14 October at a ceremony in London.The Testaments by Margaret Atwood (Vintage, Chatto \u0026amp Windus)Ducks, Newburyport by Lucy Ellmann (Galley Beggar Press)Girl, Woman, Other by Bernardine Evaristo (Hamish Hamilton)An Orchestra of Minorities by Chigozie Obioma (Little, Brown)Quichotte by Salman Rushdie (Jonathan Cape)10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World by Elif Shafak (Viking)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f85f3531a6cfde772f17f423068c5c6a66db1ef/131_390_5485_3291/master/5485.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c37e29ca9887a65fefbce18478327c77","title":"uk construction builders brexit uncertainty","story":"Builders say Brexit uncertainty has made clients cut budgets, especially in commercial sector Britain’s building industry suffered by the biggest fall in new work in more than a decade as Brexit uncertainty gripped construction firms before the deadline on 31 October.New orders contracted for a fifth month in May with commercial construction, which includes offices and shops, leading the decline as competition for work intensified and property developers delayed decision-making.The measure of new orders on the IHS MarkitCIPS UK construction PMI survey slumped from 44.6 in July to 40, the lowest since March 2009 when the UK economy was in recession following the financial crash. Anything below 50 signals contraction.The purchasing managers\u0027 indices, or PMIs, track services sector companies, manufacturers and building firms around the world.They measure activity, output, business confidence and hiring levels, to produce a health check on how these sectors are performing.PMIs are compiled each month from interviews with \u0027purchasing managers\u0027 at thousands of companies. They produce a single headline figure – anything above 50 indicates a sector is growing, while a figure below 50 shows a contraction.Economists watch these surveys closely as they look ahead to coming months, while the official data, such as gross domestic product and retail sales, tends to be more backward-looking.\u0026nbspThe headline index, which measures total activity in the sector, showed construction fell for a fourth consecutive month, again led by office building and general maintenance. It fell to 45 in August, down from 45.3 in July and well below the 48.4 expected by City analysts.The level of new work has declined since April in line with official figures, which last month showed the sector contracted in the second quarter of the year.In spite of the contraction and weak outlook, firms hung on to staff and maintained recruitment plans. The survey reported evidence of a widespread shortage of staff since the Brexit vote that prevented employers from making staff redundant.Analysts said a Brexit deal was unlikely to revive the industry before the end of the year following a e in confidence in construction industry boardrooms.IHS Markit economist Tim Moore said: “Construction companies noted that rising risk aversion and tighter budget-setting by clients in response to Brexit uncertainty had held back activity, particularly in the commercial sub-sector.“Commercial construction activity fell at a steep and accelerated pace during August, which more than offset the softer rates of decline in house building and civil engineering work.”Likening the industry to an oil supertanker, Duncan Brock, a spokesman for the Chartered Institute of Procurement \u0026amp Supply, said a turnaround would not come until 2020, even if the current Brexit conflict could be resolved amicably.“The reality is, if a revival of confidence and a flood of new orders return to the construction sector in the coming weeks, much like a large tanker turning in a dock, there is little room for the sector to improve in the last quarter of the year. It’s likely September’s data will be even more discouraging,” he said.Brock added: “As Brexit creeps closer and confusion still reigns, this will undoubtedly heap more pressure on the UK government to create much-needed clarity in the market. The commercial sector particularly has been devastated by reluctant clients fearful of taking a wrong turn in a confusing landscape and delaying project starts, resulting in the fastest drop in new orders since March 2009.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36fad6fad6b289758f9dea6b3905b23d0b6a830d/0_0_3694_2216/master/3694.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34d9ba46ed16d95845e6fb58410d77f2","title":"pound plunges snap election uk construction recession sterling markets business live","story":"Sterling has hit its lowest point since October 2016 flash crash, amid fears of a no-deal Brexit next monthKaren Ward, chief market strategist at JP Morgan, thinks investors should keep away from the pound or risk getting badly burned fingers.She believes the pound could rise back to $1.40 if Britain was to leave the EU under a withdrawal agreement, but could plunge to $1.10 in a no deal scenario.So given this “binary outlook”, it doesn’t make sense to hold large one-way positions in sterling assets.“MPs return to parliament today on the back of the latest slide in the British pound, which reflects an increase in market jitters around the potential for a no-deal exit.A general election appears increasingly likely, although the events of the last few years have taught us that there is frequently an unforeseen twist in the Brexit tale. If the UK population are indeed sent back to the polls, this will only add to political uncertainty given the complexities in forecasting the result of an election that will clearly be dominated by Brexit.Back in Westminster, government efforts to placate the group of Conservative MPs opposed to a No-Deal seem to have floundered.The group, including former chancellor Philip Hammond, have met Boris Johnson, but say the PM only gave an ‘unconvincing’ explanation of how a new deal could be agreed in time.That suggests they are likely to support today’s emergency motion which tries to block a disorderly exit.The opposition Labour party, meanwhile, is indicating it won’t vote to trigger an early election until it’s certain that no-deal is off the table. That could make it hard for Johnson to swerve around the Fixed Term Parliament Act.....Investors should also keep a close eye on Edinburgh today, where judges are hearing a court case on whether parliament should be suspended for five weeks.The case was brought by a group of parliamentarians, who argue that Boris Johnson has acted illegally and unconstitutionally by proroguing Parliament ahead of the UK leaving the EU on 31 October.The hearing began dramatically, with the production of a handwritten note showing that Johnson had approved a plan to shut the Commons down back in mid-August. That is well before the plan was made public.If the court rules against the government, it could impose an interim interdict , or injunction, stopping the proroguing of Parliament. That could give MPs more time to vote for a deal, or to block no deal.The pound is changing hands at $1.201 to the US dollar as City traders grab a lunchtime sandwich.This minor recovery from this morning’s slump comes as opposition MPs look for a way to block no-deal on 31 October, before giving their approval for an election.The BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg has the details:In theory, the pound is a global reserve currency, alongside the euro, the yen, and of course the US dollar.In practice, it is behaving more like an emerging market currency - volatile, vulnerable to political crises, and prone to slumping at the first sight of an alarming headline.This chart shows how sterling volatility has spiked in recent days - back towards levels seen before the 2016 referendum, and in the run-up to the March deadline.That means investors have been taking steps to protect themselves from a juddering lurch in the value of the pound.Trevor Greetham, head of multi asset at Royal London Asset Management, says the threat of a general election just before the Brexit deadline is spooking the City.He’s spotted that the pound is now almost as volatile as the stock market, which is “a very unusual state of affairs for a developed economy.”Greetham predicts more volatility: “It’s very hard to know where sterling will be a few months from now. A disruptive No Deal Brexit could see the pound weaken much further. On the other hand, a delay in Brexit with increased prospects for a deal, or even a referendum with remaining in the EU as an option, could see the pound recover sharply.A General Election would create a further layer of uncertainty for sterling. We learnt in 2017 that opinion polls can shift dramatically during an election campaign. There is little prospect for a new deal with the EU under the short timetable currently available so the markets would probably be forced to factor in a No Deal Brexit under a majority Conservative government. A majority Labour government, on the other hand, would usher in a range of market-unfriendly policies. Arguably the pound would rally most on a hung parliament with centre parties including the Liberal Democrats needed to form a government.After a torrid morning, sterling has suddenly bounced back off the mat.The pound is now back over $1.20 against the US dollar, shaking off much of its earlier slump.But it’s still down on the day, at $1.203, and still at risk of closing at its lowest level since the 1980s.The sudden bounce came as MPs submitted their request for an emergency debate to rule out a no-deal Brexit. This move was expected, of course, but investors may still be encouraged that the ‘rebel alliance’ are moving fowards.Wall Street titan Goldman Sachs has warned its clients that a no-deal Brexis is a growing risk.Its base case scenario is that a variant of Theresa May’s deal is approved by MPs. But it also believes there’s a possibility that Britain will never leave the EU at all. In a new report, Goldman estimates that:Over in Brussels, the European Commission is confirming that the UK side haven’t yet provided ‘concrete’ proposals to replace the Irish Backstop.....At least the two sides are talking, though....The pound would plunge below parity with the euro if there is a No Deal Brexit, predicts Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe.He says the “fragile support” created by Boris Johnson’s trips to Paris and Berlin last week have been obliterated by the political drama back in Westminster.“No-deal risk remains the be all and end all for sterling.One pound is worth €1.096 right now, meaning one euro is worth 91.2p, close to last month’s 10-year low.The slump in the pound since the Brexit referendum has helped overseas investors to cherry-pick UK assets.Foreign companies spent £18.4bn buying UK companies in April-June, up from £10.8bn in January-March, according to new figures from the Office for National Statistics.These charts show this ‘inward investment’ jumped after the 2016 vote (which sent the pound down from almost $1.50 to below $1.20 today):Rob Donaldson, RSM’s head of corporate finance says sterling’s weakness is turning UK companies into prey, rather than predators: Given the persistent weakness of sterling overseas acquisition by UK companies is challenging whereas inbound investment from abroad is, despite some of the obvious uncertainties for the UK economy, encouraged by the relatively low multiples in the UK particularly when sterling weakness is taken into account.‘Meanwhile UK domestic activity is relatively strong as consolidation is more attractive than new investment, which has been weak.‘In the absence of any change in Q3 we would expect these trends to continue for the rest of the year, absent a chaotic “Halloween” Brexit.There’s every danger that the pound will end today at its weakest closing level in 34 years.That would hang over MPs heads as they vote tonight on whether to block no deal by seeking another Brexit extension, a move that could trigger an election next month.The pound is struggling back from the three-year low hit this morning, but it still below the $1.20 mark.The slump in UK construction this year shows there is a desperate need for clarity about Brexit, says Duncan Brock of the Chartered Institute of Procurement \u0026amp Supply.He says building firms are suffering badly, because nervous clients aren’t happy about making major sending commitments in the current uncertain climate.“The sector fell deeper into contraction as continuing uncertainty and a weakened UK economy took a sizeable bite out of this month’s construction activity. Inevitably business confidence followed suit, dropping like a brick to its worst since December 2008 and close to the lowest depth seen in the previous recession. “As Brexit creeps closer and confusion still reigns, this will undoubtedly heap more pressure on the UK Government to create much-needed clarity in the market.The commercial sector particularly has been devastated by reluctant clients fearful of taking a wrong turn in a confusing landscape and delaying project starts, resulting in the fastest drop in new orders since March 2009. Newsflash: Britain’s construction sector has been hit by a collapse in orders, as Brexit worries hurt building firms.Data firm Markit has just reported that builders suffered the sharpest fall in new business since March 2009 - when Britain had fallen into recession after the financial crisis.Housebuilding, commercial construction and major civil engineering firms all suffered, with business optimism hitting its lowest level since December 2008.Companies reported that Brexit-related uncertainty was encouraging “risk aversion”, and encouraging clients to set tighter budgets. This means building firms are running short of work, if they can’t find enough new business to replace completed projects.This dragged Markit’s construction PMI index down to 45.0 - below the 50-point mark which shows growth.Tim Moore, economics associate director at IHS Markit, said “domestic political uncertainty” is hurting the construction sector......and there could be worse to come.“Concerns about softening demand for new projects resulted in a fall in business optimism across the construction sector to its weakest since December 2008.This provides an early signal that UK construction companies are braced for a protracted slowdown as a lack of new work to replace completed contracts begins to bite over the next 12 months. Yesterday’s manufacturing PMI showed that factory output fell at its fastest pace in seven years last month -- raising fears over the health of the UK economy.The euro is also suffering from the threat of a disruptive Brexit.The single currency has fallen to a 28-month low against the US dollar at $1.092. That’s a reminder that No Deal is seen as bad for both sides.Kit Juckes of French bank Société Générale says Brexit uncertainty is “reaching new heights” and is dragging the “terrible twins” of sterling and the euro lower.Juckes says we face 48 hours of uncertainty, which could be followed by six weeks of uncertainty (and markets, they say, really don’t like uncertainty).The first question that will be answered - today - is whether the rebels can indeed get control of the order paper again. At the moment, it isn’t clear when we might find that out (today is, after all, the first day back for MPs after their summer holidays!).To further muddy waters, a judge in Edinburgh’s Court of Sessions will also be asked for a ruling on whether the Prime Minister is acting illegally in suspending parliament for 5 weeks ahead of the Queen’s Speech on October 14. If we can survive today’s uncertainty, we may move on to a vote tomorrow which will then determine whether the rebels have succeeded in the plan to force the PM to ask for a delay. Whether that vote passes is uncertain, since while there are enough Conservative rebels to win the vote if the opposition supports it, there may be some Labour rebels from Brexiteer constituencies who support the Government.But, if that vote passes, there will almost certainly be a vote as the PM seeks elections instead. Could he win the two-thirds majority needed to force elections? Gain, that’s not certain and after that, there is the biggest uncertainty of all, which is what happens at an election in October. The Conservatives have performed well In opinion polls, at the expense of the Brexit Party, but may not have the4 seats to win outright majority.Shares in UK-focused companies are falling this morning, hit by the threat of a disorderly Brexit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/581a2797722fb41694bef0d79b5bc9b95b94ebad/0_234_3960_2376/master/3960.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab6fc84be2a120ac945e317422626104","title":"co living the end of urban loneliness or cynical corporate dormitories","story":"With communal space and amenities all shared in what are sometimes vast complexes, co-living is billed as a solution to the housing crisis – but others say it’s simply an attempt to cash in on itIn the industrial chic lobby of the Collective, a huge apartment block in the northwest London neighbourhood of Willesden Junction, a set of posters advertise its events series for residents. There’s a crystal-pendant-making workshop, a talk on the politics of body hair and another on mental health awareness. The most popular class to date, according to Jade Coles, the Collective’s head of events and experiential marketing, was on how to make a ceramic dildo. “That one sold out in eight minutes,” she says.The 550 residents who call this building home pay a monthly rent starting at £1,085 to live in rooms that are hotel-sized but which benefit from a number of communal amenities, like the events. There’s a cinema room, a co-working space that converts into a music venue, another co-working space, a library that feels like a co-working space, a restaurant and a bar. There’s no fee to join, and you can leave with one month’s notice.Benjamin Webb, 37, has lived at the Collective for eight months and likes it enough that he is now a “community ambassador”. He says co-living offered him a sense of freedom after two decades renting in London.“I was looking for flexibility rather than being sucked into the cycle of letting agents, paying £2,000 each time you move and being locked in a contract,” says Webb, who works as a PA in the finance industry. “The Collective gave me that flexibility, but what kept me there – and I’ve extended my original contract – is the community and all the other things that come with it.”Indeed, the Collective doesn’t market itself as apartments. It calls itself a “global living movement”, and is one of a growing number of “co-living” developments that cater to a distinctly millennial market.In Berlin there is Quarters, a co-living developer that now has properties in New York and Chicago and has just announced a $300m expansion to build many more across the US and Europe. WeWork, the co-working behemoth, now runs WeLive: fully furnished apartments available for flexible rental in New York and Washington DC. The chic “digital nomad community” Roam has set up co-living and co-working hubs in San Francisco, Miami, Tokyo and Bali (with a new location in London and another in New York coming soon). It sells a dream lifestyle, that of a modern, flexible, “creative” worker who has bid farewell to the deskbound nine to five and instead jets around the world, dropping in to work remotely from exotic locations.Each company presents its accommodation as a solution to the urban housing crisis. Here, at last, is a way to provide affordable homes for younger people cut out of the market, while at the same time pooling resources, fostering community and catering for an increasingly mobile generation. With 4.8 million Britons now self-employed, co-living is pitched as a utopian response to a rapidly changing society.But what from one angle looks like a revolutionary proposition can just as easily be seen from another as a cynical ploy by property developers to cash in on a generation living in the “age of loneliness”, locked in a perpetual struggle to find a place they can call home.Vlad Calus, 23, co-founder of social media startup Planable, sees it the second way. He moved into the Collective with a business partner two years ago. “People were nice and friendly but we were shocked to see these ‘boxes’ being called rooms,” he says. “Unfortunately, co-living places are trying to squeeze every living space into the same building, which makes it unliveable for the long-term.”Collective living has other downsides. Post-grad student Emma Kay, 32, who was among the first people to move in when the Collective opened three years ago, found herself unnerved by some of the ways the building operated, such as when she bought a drink from the bar and took it outside.“The next day I got an email saying they’d seen me on CCTV with a glass in the smoking area and if I did it again there would be consequences,” she says. “It felt quite uncomfortable knowing whatever you do is being watched, and if you break the rules for a minor offence you’d get in trouble.”To Matthew Stewart, a researcher and designer at the University of Westminster, co-living led by developers cannot be a radical alternative because it lacks the social intent of collective living. He points to bolder suggestions proposed by modernists almost a century ago to address the interwar housing shortage, such as the work of Karel Teige, a Czech theorist whose 1932 book The Minimum Dwelling proposed restructuring living space around community and collective domestic labour.“The Collective make similar claims about solving the housing crisis but it doesn’t stand up,” Stewart says. “Teige was talking about a mixture of different ages, generations, classes – it wasn’t targeted at a specific group. It was more about democratising housing, rather than just having these enclaves of millennials who are being charged a lot of money. ”Yet the Collective is far from the only vision of what “co-living” might look like. Marmalade Lane, a 42-home multigenerational “oasis”, was unveiled this May in Cambridge. A unique collaboration (between the K1 Cohousing Project and Cambridge city council, and delivered by developer Town, eco-house builder Trivselhus and architects Mole), Marmalade Lane was created through a participatory design process that involved its future residents.It has a mix of homes, ranging from four-bedroom houses to one-bedroom apartments, with a central “common house” providing a focal point where the community can eat together and socialise. Everyone can also make use of communal laundry, gym, meeting rooms and garden, and the organisation is managed by its residents using consensus-based decision-making.It’s the latest in a type of collective living that has its roots in the family-oriented housing coops of 1960s Denmark, an arrangement that has come to be known by a slightly different moniker: “co-housing”, rather than co-living. The idea is to structure and organise housing in such as a way as to put communities, rather than developers, in the driving seat.“Co-living is purely a new way for developers to squeeze profit from an already broken housing market,” says Hannah Wheatley, researcher on housing and land at the New Economics Foundation.“Co-housing in its purest form is about communities being control of their housing.”In Barnet, North London, the Older Women’s Co-Housing project (Owch) has built a collection of 25 flats, all occupied by women older than 50. They are committed to participating in a community that shares space, resources and mutual support. As well as being an alternative to the existing home ownership model, Owch caters imaginatively for an ageing population, which is a growing need in many western cities.Josie Pearse, 64, shows it off with pride. There is a communal courtyard and an allotment, where a group of women are just getting ready to “scatter some seeds”. The women fought to have assured tenancies for the eight social tenants, of which Pearse is one. “There’s power in this collective,” she says. “We’re kinda class warriors here.”Although they were committed from the start to creating inclusive housing, the members of Owch were a relatively low-income group. The community was built with help from Hanover Housing Association, which found the site and funded the development, before selling it to 17 Owch buyers and Housing for Women, a charitable housing provider.Maria Brenton, one of the founding members of Owch and the woman who proposed the idea back in 1998, is critical of new developer-led co-living projects that use the same language of community and inclusion as the co-housing movement.Nevertheless, demand for co-living remains high. The Collective has received $800m to fund growth across the UK, US and Europe and now has 8,000 units operating or under development. It has just opened what it claims is the world’s biggest co-living development in Canary Wharf, with 705 rooms, a swimming pool on the 20th floor and a golf simulator. The smallest rooms are available from £100 a night (though a cursory glance at the booking system suggests rates are often £150 or more), £1863pm for a three month stay and £1430pm if you stay for 12 months. Its New York location (a converted hotel) is only available for short stays.This focus on the higher end of the market might not be surprising given the Collective’s CEO is Reza Merchant, a 29-year-old who was educated at the £20,000-a-year Merchant Taylors’ School and was able to launch the Collective after borrowing £1.8m against his parent’s home.Despite the lack of social tenancies or facilities for families, he maintains the Collective is a project rooted in providing community for average city dwellers.“We’re very different to a conventional property developer,” says Merchant, who has said his inspiration for the Collective draws on experiences at Burning Man festival. “If our driver was pure profit, we wouldn’t be doing this. There are much easier ways to make money.”Yet even if its approach “stems from a place of love”, as Merchant claims, it’s difficult to reconcile this service philosophy with the reality of what is on offer: a high price for short-term convenience.If the Collective feels like accommodation, rather than a home, there may be a third way. Noiascape is another co-living developer that says it wants to sensitively use architecture and design to rethink the kind of “share house” in which 1.1 million Londoners already live – most of them Victorian terraced houses, which were not designed for renting, let alone for large groups of people to subide into rooms.Building on research showing that, other than for sleeping, private space in the home is used at very low intensity (particularly in the “pre-family” demographic), the company has designed 10 homes for 2-4 people in London in converted terraced houses. The flats are designed to cater for the modern renter. Decent joinery and inbuilt storage spares residents having to buy flat pack furniture, while the living spaces, which all flow into an outdoor area, are designed to encourage communal dining and social interaction, as well as providing flexible work space during the day. Double height ceilings maximise the sense of space and light.Noiascape’s latest project, High Street House, will be a block of 10 self-contained studio flats built into an existing building, ranging from 25sqm to 37sqm with prices from £250 to £350 per week, including all bills and utilities. Another, which will accommodate 100-200 people, is in pre-planning. These properties will also contain shared spaces for events, exhibitions or working, and residents will be able to access any of these amenities across the Noiascape “network”, no matter which property they live in.Director Tom Teatum disputes the view that the “space standard” equates to quality. He argues that while coliving is easy to dismiss, it presents a “real opportunity that’s yet to be found”. By creating a new housing topography that caters more efficiently for people who require less space, he suggests that those 1.1m Victorian houseshares could ultimately be released back into the market, to be used for the families for whom they were originally designed.“If we see a shared space – and a network of shared spaces – as being part of our rent - it transforms how you live,” says Teatum. “It’s a move away from the idea that your private space is the end of your living experience.”This re-balancing of private and shared space within our housing arrangements is at the essence of what might feel wonderful – or dreadful – when we make a choice about how we want to live. Back at Owch, Pearse, who previously lived in a property with no central heating and a coal fire, is showing off her bright, open living space decorated with colourful ornaments, watercolour sketchbooks stacked to one side. The balcony looks over the communal garden where neighbours can be seen chatting beside a sundial on the lawn.“The thing I love most about this place is coming home,” she says.Kay, on the other hand, moved out of the Collective after a year to move in with her boyfriend. “It wasn’t the communal experience I imagined,” she said. “Co-living might work in smaller set-ups but there it was too big for any real community. It just felt like a hotel with rich students getting their accommodation paid for.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/270441dbf5e4ed56c324e2b5afac70678d59d6f6/0_149_4848_2910/master/4848.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f1b8c13818f20442cb977eb26a7d32e","title":"afd germany reformed eu immigration parties europe","story":"With anti-immigration parties flourishing, Europe’s inequalities and injustices must be tackled to counter the extremists As migrants from Syria poured into Germany throughout the summer of 2015, Angela Merkel responded with the reassurance: “We can manage this.” The phrase came to define Merkel’s chancellorship, setting her apart from the rest of the European elite for its humanitarian commitment to the refugee crisis.For the far right, Merkel’s welcoming response symbolised all that was wrong with Europe. They declared her out of touch with ordinary, working people. Across European capitals moderates were also incandescent . Some rejected the approach in principle, advocating “securing” EU borders instead. Others saw it as a well-intentioned but muddled gesture, a gift to the far right.On the surface it might now appear that those who warned the far right would capitalise on Merkel’s openness were correct. The Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party has, after all, gained significant electoral support – an unprecedented phenomenon in Germany’s post-war history.Founded in 2013 as a conservative, Eurosceptic party opposed to the euro, the AfD has moved steadily to the fascistic right. Highly inflammatory rhetoric, previously rare in the country’s democratic politics, has been normalised. “We will hunt Mrs Merkel,” said the party leader, Alexander Gauland, following the 2017 national election, “we will take back our country and our people.”Events this week have again underlined how the party is a dominant force in the states of the former East Germany. In the Saxony and Brandenburg state elections on September 1, the party achieved its best ever set of results, coming second place in both.They were denied victory in Brandenburg only by a better than expected result for the Social Democratic party (SPD). The AfD cleverly triangulated the slogan, “We are the people”, raised by the protesters who brought down the Berlin Wall in 1989. They have turned this expression of democratic resistance into a totem of opposition to multiculturalism, and in the run-up to the state elections they even compared contemporary Germany with the GDR, urging people to bring down the “corrupt” system.It is too simplistic however to put the rise of the AfD down to Germany’s relatively liberal response to the migration crisis. This view accepts too many of the far right’s own arguments about why people are turning to them.As we show in our new report, there are significant regional differences in the support for the party across Germany. We found that neither a high unemployment rate nor a higher proportion of foreigners in a neighbourhood correspond to a greater willingness to vote for the AfD. States and regions with high levels of immigration are not strongholds for the party. Among every other group of voters in the German federal republic there is strong opposition to the AfD. All major parties have categorically ruled out a formal coalition with the party. In this sense, its rise has been contained to a degree, especially among West German voters, where the party wins on average half the share of votes it picks up in the former East German states.Migration is a crucial factor in AfD support, but not in the way politicians assume. AfD voters are concentrated in regions that have experienced large waves of outward migration since reunification. Young people in particular moved westwards, leaving ageing populations and economic stagnation in their wake. These towns of the forgotten Germany have proved to be fertile ground for the AfD.The AfD’s rise should profoundly concern all Europeans. Nearly a third of the party now align with the extreme-right platform, the Wing, whose leaders play down Nazi-era atrocities and argue that foreign “intruders” are overwhelming ethnic Germans. The strength of the party lies in its ability to unite these extremists with more conservative, neoliberal members in one fragile but stable party of the German right.Misdiagnosing the reasons for the AfD’s growth carries huge risks. Having lost a million voters to the AfD, Merkel’s party, the CDU, has responded with a rightwing turn on migration, cutting benefits and facilitating detention, deportation, and criminalisation of migrant and human rights activists. Merkel has overseen this policy shift, announcing in September 2016 that she would no longer use the “we can manage this” slogan.This week’s state elections show that the approach is failing. The starting point for an alternative is recognising that Germany’s regional inequalities are unacceptably high and have fuelled the rise of the far right. Increased investment in the east of Germany to create jobs and growth can be at the heart of a new policy to address the roots of the AfD’s support. The creation of the eurozone, which regulates fiscal investment and monetary policy, also makes this a Europe-wide issue. Indeed, reforms to the EU are not an optional luxury for a strong counter-extremism strategy. They are an essential foundation on which a better, more socially just, Europe can be forged.• Titus Molkenbur is a research consultant, and Luke Cooper a research associate, both at the LSE Conflict and Civil Society research unit"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7eef2f85edb18442eaeffae02d664f754f268612/18_234_4340_2604/master/4340.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d28b615f69bcb6e61900c38558933f6f","title":"dover no deal brexit car park","story":"My hometown could become a post-Brexit car park, our lives and businesses utterly disruptedAs someone who was born and bred in Dover, the threat of a no-deal Brexit has always felt particularly urgent. My hometown would be one of the first to feel the impact, a guinea pig for potential chaos. People in Dover won’t be watching the news to see what happens on 1 November, they will be seeing it with their own eyes. As the risk of leaving the EU without a deal has become increasingly more likely, the concern for my hometown has increased.This is why Sunday night’s Sky News report felt so alarming. An analysis – commissioned by the Department for Transport itself – suggests that in the event of no deal, lorries and freight vehicles could be delayed for up to two days at Dover, with the best-case scenario being two to three hours. At the moment it is two to three minutes.This would in effect turn Dover into a car park. The small amount of funding promised by the government will do little to fix the disruption to people’s lives. People would struggle to get to work, to the town centre, to go about their lives in a normal way. Local businesses would suffer. Residents would have to plan every journey with the potential for it to take 10 times longer than usual. As always, the people bearing the brunt of the disruption would be the worst off. They are the kids I went to the local comprehensive with, the family who raised me on the council estates of Dover. Those in lower-paid, insecure work are more at risk of losing their job if the potential pile-up of 8,000 vehicles causes them to be late. The leave campaign worked so well in places like Dover because it played to the desire for change. Now the only changes people from my hometown will see are ones that will make their lives worse, not better.People in Dover deserve certainty, clarity, reassurance and representation. They are getting none of that at the moment. Boris Johnson and the Brexit elite are doing their utmost to shut down debate. Now Dover’s future rests on the shoulders of the MPs who will try on Tuesday to prevent no deal.

A seven-year old boy named Lachino Mcintosh drowned as his family attempted to find safer ground than their home on the Abaco islands. Dorian is reportedly the strongest hurricane to have ever hit the Bahamas and the second most powerful Atlantic storm on record. Five deaths have been reported so far, and more are likely. The Bahamian MP and minister of foreign affairs, the Honorable Darren Henfield, offered a bleak update form the area he represents to reporters: “We have reports of casualties, we have reports of bodies being seen.”Rising temperatures don’t make hurricanes more frequent, but they do help make them more devastating. Each of the last five years have seen Category 5 storms pass through the Atlantic, brewed over hotter than usual waters. How many more people have to die before political leaders treat climate change like the global catastrophe it is?Donald Trump has been rightly criticized for golfing as Dorian devastated the Bahamas and drifted toward the US. But it’s as good a metaphor as any for the way elites across political lines have approached the crisis they have helped create and continue to fuel. One of the cruelest realities of global warming is that the people whohave done the least to contribute to it tend to be among the first and worst hit. Nations like the United States have amassed tremendous wealth both by burning fossil fuels and exploiting land and labor from the places most threatened by rising temperatures through slavery, colonialism and their living legacies. Similar inequalities play out within nations, including in the US, where most people’s own carbon footprints are dwarfed by those of the billionaires and fossil fuel executives best equipped to insulate themselves from heavy weather.Internationally, climate-vulnerable countries have for decades made the case that more ambition is needed, focusing policymakers’ concerns on to issues of equity. The Bahamas is part of a group within the UN known as the Alliance of Small Island States (Aosis), comprising countries already being hammered by climate impacts who have got comparatively few financial resources to deal with them. The Aosis chair and Males energy minister, Thoriq Ibrahim, argued at COP 24 last year that it would “be suicide not to use every lever of power we have to demand what is fair and just: the support we need to manage a crisis that has been thrust upon us”.That support has not been forthcoming. In its special report released last year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found that keeping warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius – a level already dangerous for low-lying states – would require an annual investment in decarbonization of $3tn through 2050. And that’s just to mitigate warming. Trillions more will be required to adapt to the climate impacts already locked in, ensuring that when hurricanes like Dorian do hit they do less damage. Repairing the loss and damage of storms and other disasters is expected to cost $300bn a year by 2030, jumping to $1.2tn a year by 2060. As the world’s largest historical emitter of greenhouse gases and its biggest economy, the United States has both the ability and an outsized responsibility to decarbonize rapidly and make it possible for countries do the same – a climate debt.Back in 2009, industrialized nations pledged to mobilize $100bn toward mitigation and adaptation efforts by 2020, a response to persistent demands from climate justice organizers. As of last September, only $3.5bn had actually been allocated to the fund and just $10.3bn pledged to the multilateral body that’s supposed to be the main vehicle for dispersing that money, the Green Climate Fund (GCF). Before he left office, Obama promised $3bn toward the GCF. Just $1bn of that ever materialized before Trump withdrew that vow. That’s a fraction of the estimated $15bn a year the federal government spends subsidizing fossil fuel development. At the end of August, the US Import-Export Bank approved $5bn in financing for a natural gas project in Mozambique. We have more than enough money to fight the climate crisis, at home and abroad. It’s just going to all the wrong places.Greenhouse gases don’t fit neatly within borders. Efforts to curb them can’t either. Like other wealthy countries, the US has a responsibility to pay its fair share for the damage it’s caused to the planet – not through predatory loans or disastrously managed charity but through solidarity. Bernie Sanders’ plan for a Green New Deal pledges $200bn to the GCF, makes climate a centerpiece of American trade and foreign policy and ends fossil fuel financing through institutions like the Import-Export Bank. An extensive, recently released blueprint of a Green New Deal for Europe lays out a rapid and just transition away from fossil fuels, accounting for the emissions rich countries export abroad through trade and the need for a thoroughly democratic response to the climate crisis that doesn’t let the governments who have engineered this crisis call all the shots on how the world handles it.It’ll be tempting, as Dorian drifts toward Florida, for observers in the US to forget the death and destruction it has left behind elsewhere. That would be a mistake. Jeff Bezos’s escape plans notwithstanding, we’re all stuck on this warming planet together. Whether human civilization stays intact amid all this worsening weather depends on recognizing our shared humanity – and designing policy accordingly. Platitudes for the planet won’t cut it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3807860d5d6c5661f1565f152e16b59ec375a6a/0_21_4440_2664/master/4440.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7ddb3e75c98ea8c7da3e8fd7eab84df","title":"should labour back general election brexit","story":"If rule number one of opposition is “Never turn down an election” then rule number two ought to be: “Don’t label an opportunity to replace the government as ‘pointless’” – particularly if you’ve spent the past four years railing against Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, arguing that the left enjoys the comfort of opposition, and would rather be a party of protest and rallies than a serious party with aspirations of government.Oh, how the tables have turned. There is absolutely no justification for a Labour MP wanting to keep Boris Johnson in No 10, but by refusing to back a general election that is precisely what they’re doing. The EU27 will not agree to any meaningful changes to the withdrawal agreement unless the government changes and the negotiating principles change with it. So to stop a no-deal Brexit – even if article 50 is extended – we will in all probability have to win some version of a public vote: either a general election that elects a Labour government, or a second referendum with an option to remain.Devoid of any serious or coherent domestic agenda, the Conservatives are seeking to engineer an election defined by Brexit – a proxy second referendum. But Theresa May tried this in 2017 after she triggered article 50, and she lost seats. Because general elections are about much more than a single issue, they are about the future of the country. Labour can move the agenda on from Brexit, just as it did in 2017. The government may well be trying to engineer an election at what they assume is the best time for a Conservative victory – but that is always the way with these things. It is no reason to retreat. Any panic is unwarranted – this is a political impasse which requires a political solution. It’s exactly what elections are for.So if the objective is to stop no deal, a general election on 14 October that puts Corbyn into No 10 is the path of least resistance – a far less uncertain prospect than a second referendum with no deal on the ballot, a vote that would be defined purely by a single issue and the principle of respecting democracy. Under all circumstances, Labour MPs must back a general election as soon as possible.• Matt Zarb-Cousin is the former spokesman for Jeremy CorbynI will not dance to Boris Johnson’s tune. He wants chaos at any cost, but what our country really needs is for us to stop no deal, resolve Brexit, and then allow the public to decide the future direction for the country in a general election – not the other way round.Johnson knows that if no-deal Brexit were to stand on its own as a general election proposition, it may well fail. But if we allow him to hold a snap election in the next month, he can mix up the Brexit question with questions over Corbyn, while at the same time offering huge public spending incentives on policing and health. This could succeed in returning him to Downing Street, a victory for his no-deal Brexit, despite a majority of the public being against it.Brexit is the biggest issue our country has faced in the last 70 years, and it needs to be debated and voted on as a standalone issue.The ballot we need at this present time is not a general election but a referendum: a public vote on any deal (or no deal) that Johnson intends to deliver. Only after the country has decided on Brexit, based on facts not promises, should we move to a general election. Only after the country has resolved Brexit can we openly and honestly discuss how our country should be run and which party is best placed to run it. A pre-Brexit election would not permit this, which is why I will not vote for a general election at this moment.Let the public decide on Boris’s deal, and then let’s fight an election on manifestos that will allow us to discuss openly, outside the shadow of Brexit, the issues of our NHS, social care, housing, jobs and the many challenges facing our economy and country.• Peter Kyle is MP for Hove and Portslade"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e5953626c25cb9a0fe9eab659805220ef6d924d/249_0_2803_1683/master/2803.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2b04086b16918d7943768ac1e0d4acb","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of smoky","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘smoky’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘smoky’.Share your photos of what smoky means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 4 September at 10am.

Campaigners are concerned that schools are not obliged to inform parents that their children will undergo the test.The government says the assessment will be stress-free and provide data about a child’s language skills and ability to count at the start of their school career. It can then be compared with test results at the end of primary to reveal how much progress a child has made, so that schools can be held to account.It is part of an overhaul of state school accountability aimed at better charting progress of pupils from entry until key stage two tests at the age of 10 and 11, with key stage one tests previously taken at age seven being scrapped as part of the changes.Among the more critical responses, one headteacher said: “The time spent doing these new assessments would be better spent getting to know the children, ensuring that they are settled, building resilience and confidence.”“Ridiculous!” said another. “There is nothing wrong with the way in which early years staff assess the children on entry in the reception class at the moment. They don’t need a formalised way of doing this.”The study’s findings were based on 288 self-selecting survey responses and 20 in-depth interviews with primary school headteachers conducted by Dr Alice Bradbury, from UCL’s Institute of Education. Bradbury said: “There was some very negative language used in relation to this policy, which suggests that some headteachers feel very strongly that this policy will not benefit schools or children.”Nancy Stewart, of More Than a Score, which campaigns against what it sees as over-testing in England’s schools, called on the Department for Education (DfE) to scrap the assessment. “Heads agree with education experts and parents: this scheme is a waste of everyone’s time and a waste of £10m. It is simply another way for the government to judge schools, using unreliable and unfair testing methods.”Parents, campaigners and some teaching unions have fought a sustained battle against the standardised reception tests. In April, families took part in the “march of the four-year-olds” to hand in a petition at No 10 Downing Street, signed by 68,000 and calling on the government to scrap the tests.In July, families opposed to the tests went to the high court in London to try to stop the assessments, claiming they would cause distress and could damage children’s future learning. The court however refused permission for a judicial review of government policy.A DfE spokesperson said: “The reception baseline assessment is a quick check of a child’s early language and ability to count when they start school to help inform teachers. Nine in 10 schools already carry out on-entry checks. We have been listening carefully to feedback we have received throughout the development process to ensure we get the experience right for pupils and schools.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/650159db4de1b1abcbcf26b36561b7a03b8ac006/634_105_3048_1829/master/3048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e1c55a0c0a47952cc65590af69f7c45","title":"twiggy a woman in a black tuxedo with bow tie looks fabulous","story":"The model, actor and singer on her love of trouser suits – and why she was the first well-known woman to wear broguesI’ve been wearing tuxedos for as long as I can remember.

I wore it very masculinely, with a shirt and an undone bow tie, but with a little bit of femininity from the diamanté belt.I spend my life in either skinny jeans or trousers. I love trouser suits, and the tux is just the dressed-up version of that. I just think they are elegant and really comfortable to wear. Every time you get invited to a black-tie do, it’s so easy for men – they just put on a tux and bow tie. Meanwhile, women go through the agonies of choosing a frock. I do sometimes wear dresses but often I think: ‘Oh, I’m just going to wear a tux.’ I think if you get a very beautiful woman in a black tuxedo with bow tie they look fabulous.On the cover of my first album, Twiggy, in 1976, I wore a white tuxedo and I had very long blond hair. It was my first pop album and that tux was made for me by Tommy Nutter, who was one of the great tailors and also one of my best friends. I used to go to Tommy and he’d make me a female equivalent of the suits in men’s stores, to better fit my shape. I’ve still got a few of them, although I can’t get into them any more – I was quite minute in those days! I claim to be the first well-known woman to wear brogues. I think I’ve probably got about 50 pairs now, all in different colours. You used not to be able to get brogues for women anywhere, so I went to the Prince of Wales’ shoemaker in Savile Row and had two-tone white and brown ones made for me because I was a huge fan of Fred Astaire. They have got satin ribbon laces and they are beautifully handmade. I’ve got them on a shelf now – they are kind of like works of art.

No arrests have been made and inquiries are ongoing.”The deal depended on the club being allowed to play this season, something the English Football League, concerned about Dale’s ability to finance those debts and the team’s costs, refused to sanction.This resulted in Dale missing several deadlines to either prove he could meet his obligations or sell the club to someone who could, with the EFL finally running out of patience last Tuesday, making Bury the first club to be expelled from the league since 1992.Greater Manchester Combined Authority has joined forces with local MPs and a Bury fans group in an attempt to save the club.GMCA, led by Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham, MPs James Frith (Bury North) and Ivan Lewis (Bury South), plus supporters group Forever Bury, has urged the EFL to reinstate the club.“We are establishing a working group to develop a proposal to the Football League that would allow Bury to be admitted to League Two for the start of the 2020-21 season, subject to the submission of a credible plan to rebuild Bury FC before the end of this year,” GMCA said in a statement.“First, we will work to develop a clear proposal to the English Football League, by Friday September 20, that will allow us the opportunity to work towards re-entry to League Two,” the statement continued. “Second, if the EFL agree to that proposal, we will then work on a credible plan to rebuild the club, which all signatories to this statement will feel able to endorse. Third, if that credible plan fails to emerge within in the deadline then we accept the EFL’s right to impose their original decision.”Bury said they were “dismayed and astonished” by their expulsion and Dale claimed he had shown that the club had received another takeover offer from “a credible bidder”.GMCA added: “We are pleased that Steve Dale has agreed to give us a short period of time to identify a suitable new owner for the club – we ask in good faith that the current owner allows us the opportunity to take forward this proposal … We firmly believe it is better to work to save Bury FC as a trading entity rather than the club be forced to start again from scratch next season.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27fe8418a3ee15e91b0d170e7a104eb6f04255d6/0_153_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11c579d963950f5f7140de122a87d8d7","title":"neymar psg barcelona griezmann de jong ligue 1","story":"Having spent €200m on Griezmann and De Jong this summer, Barcelona could not afford Neymar. But they will be backBy Adam White and Eric Devin for Get French Football News“Se queda,” “il reste” and “he stays” are words that have become synonymous with Neymar and the ever-swirling transfer circus that engulfs him, despite it never really being wholly true. Ten days after Gerard Piqué posted his famous “se queda” tweet in 2017, Neymar proved him wrong. Now, after a summer in which Barcelona tried to bring him back, he has stayed put in Paris.Given the fanfare surrounding Neymar’s initial €222m arrival from Barcelona in 2017 – a moment the decision-makers at PSG saw as signalling a shift in the power base of European football as well as a huge PR triumph – the prospect of effectively conceding that the endeavour had ended in failure was more than unpalatable for the club. Yet, unusually for PSG under QSI ownership, the club have handled the undulating saga surprisingly deftly.Leonardo, who returned to the role of sporting director at the club this summer, has been surprisingly open about negotiations and PSG’s supposed willingness to sell, continually drawing attention away from manager Thomas Tuchel and his relationship with the player. When Neymar failed to report for pre-season training, Leonardo made it clear that PSG were not going to stand in his way. “It is a financial question,” he said. “Neymar can leave PSG if there is an offer which suits everyone. But up to now, we do not know if anyone wants to buy him, or at what price. PSG want to count on players who want to be here and build something big. We do not need players who are doing a favour to the club by being here.”Leonardo has maintained that stance throughout. “Barcelona always knew what we wanted,” he explained this weekend, contributing to the sense that PSG have remained in control of the situation. “They submitted their first written offer on 27 August. We’ve never had a written agreement with Barça.”Understandably, Tuchel has always been keen for Neymar to stay. A PSG with the Brazilian in form and at the fulcrum of the attack has been his objective since he replaced Unai Emery last summer. Fostering and maintaining a positive relationship with “Ney” has been a priority for the manager throughout. Tuchel explained before the visit of Toulouse last month that Neymar had recovered from the ankle issue that kept him out of the Copa América and would play if the situation between player and club was “clear”, as he tried to draw a distinction between his relationship with Neymar and the club’s.With Tuchel remaining cordial, Leonardo has played bad cop. Not only did the sporting director impose sanctions on Neymar for returning to pre-season training late – “Paris-Saint-Germain deplores this situation and will take the appropriate measures as a result,” read a club statement – but he has also been keen to assert his own authority and demonstrate that no player is bigger than PSG. “I am going to speak to you in French,” Leonardo told the squad earlier this summer. “If some of you don’t understand me, all you have to do is take lessons.” Leonardo, himself a World Cup winner with Brazil, continued to draw Neymar’s ire on to himself, admitting this weekend that his bond with the player “is not the most simple relationship I have had in football,” all the while allowing Tuchel to remain relatively distant from proceedings.Tuchel’s players have also repeatedly underlined a positive relationship with Neymar. Marco Verratti did his best to include a plain-clothed Neymar in on-pitch trophy celebrations after PSG beat Rennes in the Super Cup in August, even if Kylian Mbappé did then rather awkwardly shove his strike partner away from the podium. Mbappé, however, went on to offer unequivocal support: “I want Neymar to stay with us. I do not want him to leave. I have said this to him. Everything is going well between us.” Thiago Silva later concurred, saying: “Neymar is irreplaceable. He is a key player. I hope he will stay.”Whether by design or not, PSG hedged their bets well. Any deal would have to be on their terms, thus avoiding a major loss of face or reputation, while those who work with Neymar on a daily basis were always there to suggest he would be welcome to stay, allowing for what should be a relatively seamless reintroduction to the team. It seems a truce will now remain in place until next summer after Neymar told his entourage over the weekend he would stay in Paris for another season.Relations with PSG’s vociferous fanbase may not be so easily soothed, however. At their first home game this season, PSG ultras unveiled ant-Neymar banners and chanted that he is a “son of a bitch” – much to the anger of the player’s entourage according to L’Équipe. His bond with the fans has been weak for some time. Earlier this summer, Neymar explained that, alongside Brazil’s triumph at the Olympics in 2016, his best memory as a footballer was beating PSG when with Barcelona in the famous “remontada” at Camp Nou, before going on to say his best dressing room moment was directly following that 6-1 win. His answer may have been honest, but it lacked tact and PSG supporters were, characteristically, unimpressed.Apparently the fact he feels disliked in France has contributed to Neymar’s his desire to leave, but whistles and the continued mistrust of some PSG fans is something he will have to deal with, in the short term at least. While those feelings may eventually dissipate – especially if he drags PSG to European success or a domestic treble – how that dynamic plays out in the immediate future may shape much of PSG’s season and any ensuing second round of negotiations.Neymar’s desire to leave Paris remains clear for now. With both Barcelona and the player keen on a re-coupling, Catalan newspaper Sport reported that Neymar was willing to use a chunk of his own money to force the deal through. L’Équipe later suggested that he was willing to contribute as much as €20m.Even so, had Barcelona upped their cash offer and had winger Ousmane Dembélé been keen to join Ivan Rakitic and promising teenage French defender Jean-Clair Todibo at PSG, Neymar may have become a Barcelona player once more. There remains at least a theoretical willingness from all parties for this deal to be concluded at some stage.

I can’t remember who said it, or exactly how old I was, but it has lived with me ever since.“What do you call a black man in a suit? Guilty.”Some will dismiss this as a bit of fun or, dare I say it, banter, but they tend to be the people who aren’t being targeted by the setup and punchline, nor have to deal with the way similarly flippant wisecracks, comments and judgments have an insidious effect on those who are. In other words they tend to be white people, and when they stray into this territory it’s only right to lead them back on to safer, fairer ground.Which is why I’m writing about Graeme Souness. I’ve never met the former Scotland midfielder and am willing to accept from those who have that he’s a thoroughly nice guy his bark is worse than his bite, and all that. But the problem is that on Sunday he said something that – and there really is no easy way to put this – sounded like racial stereotyping.A couple of days on, the memory still lingers, the sense of jaw‑dropping shock as Souness spoke about Moise Kean during Sky Sports’ coverage of Everton’s 3-2 victory over Wolves and why Juventus allowed the 19-year-old striker, who scored six goals in 13 Serie A appearances last season, to join Everton for an initial €32m (£29m) last month. “At 19, why have they sold him?” the 66-year-old said. “Personally, slight alarm bells are going off in my head.” Those alarm bells were clearly very loud because in the space of just over a minute, Souness went on to suggest Juventus may have sold Kean because his “off‑the-field activities are not the best”.This was the precise moment Souness needed to stop, take a breath and head in another direction. Instead he ploughed on and went on to make a comparison between Kean’s move from Juventus to Everton and that of Emmanuel Adebayor from Arsenal to Manchester City that was, as David Squires references in his latest cartoon, outright weird. The two deals occurred more than a decade apart, involve four clubs and two players at different stages of their career.Souness’s claim that Arsène Wenger sold Adebayor to City because “there’s something not quite right with him” was also incorrect given the then Arsenal manager wanted the Togo striker to stay, while there have been no suggestions that Juventus sold Kean because of what he was getting up to in his spare time. The striker has been left out of Italy’s latest squad, alongside Nicolo Zaniolo, for turning up late to a team meeting ahead of Italy’s encounter with Belgium at the recent European Under-21 Championship but, according to informed voices, the reason for him leaving Juve are football-related. As the Italian football journalist Gabriele Marcotti tweeted in response to Souness’s comments, the Serie A champions allowed Kean to swap Turin for Merseyside because he had one year left on his contract and, having declined to sign an extension, they did not want to lose him for free next summer.It was an error-strewn, conclusion-jumping bit of punditry from Souness and once the comparison with Adebayor had been made it was hard to escape a rather depressing conclusion. You know, that thing about certain people looking and acting the same.Souness would no doubt dispute this and more than likely be horrified by the suggestion that he cast aspersions on Kean’s character purely because of his race. In doing so he may also point to his record as a manager when it came to signing and fielding black players, most notably Mark Walters during his time at Rangers.For its part, Sky Sports has declined to comment but, in defending Souness, the broadcaster did point out that his comments on Kean were part of a wider discussion that saw José Mourinho, in his role as a fellow Sky pundit, speak entirely positively of the player and therefore all Souness may have been doing is offering a counter-argument. Perhaps, but that does not take away from the skin-crawling nature of what he said or the simple fact he should not have gone there.More than likely this was a case of unconscious racism, something many of us have been guilty of from time to time. But the difference is that Souness is a prominent figure saying what he said on a prominent platform – millions will have heard his remarks and, unchecked, they can spread like wildfire in a global culture already burning with resentment and ision.So it’s right that the error of Souness’s way is pointed out. Some may even call for his head, arguing he has previous given his somewhat sustained attacks on Paul Pogba, but that feels over the top and unnecessarily reactionary. Rather, this is a moment for a sense of perspective and to make another call for everyone in the media to show an extra level of thought, kindness and fairness when discussing black footballers. As Raheem Sterling pointed out with his Instagram post last December, there is, and has been, too much damage done.So if you’re reading this Graeme – seriously, have a think the next time you decide to speculate on the character of a footballer, and especially those for whom accusations of a lack of professionalism are too deep-rooted and lasting to be lazily aired on an otherwise lazy Sunday afternoon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e41aa1f8f210f98850e24f7779f4d580d3973e2/997_257_887_532/master/887.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4aee1a14436f997d068e4029493c98b7","title":"tell us who do you share your home with","story":"As part of a new series in the ’s Weekend magazine we are looking for interesting pairs who live togetherWe’re looking for unusual partnerships – two people who live together in a way that shows the changing nature of the traditional household – for our new series that seeks to reflect how the place we call home can now include extended family, friends and even strangers.In the first piece in a series talking to pairs of people who live together we met the McPhersons, a grandmother and grandson living together who tell us their story.

Who knows: future historians may yet see it as a key turning point in the lead-up to the second English civil war (2020-27).“We set out to get as much publicity as we could – don’t get me wrong,” says Roger Whiteside, Greggs’ CEO. “But we soon found ourselves holding a tiger by the tail.” It was a beast that Whiteside had been cultivating carefully for some time, as part of what has been a highly successful six-year strategy to transform the 80-year-old Newcastle-upon-Tyne-based bakery into a 21st-century “on-the-go” brand. Its shares have doubled in value over the past year.Part of that strategy involved selling more coffee (Greggs is now Britain’s third-biggest coffee retailer, ahead of Starbucks), part of it involved selling sandwiches (it is now the second-biggest player in the ready-made sandwich market) and part of it involved expanding its range to cater to modern tastes and choices: low-calorie porridges, gluten-free brownies and a sausage roll that would appeal not only to vegans but also to “flexitarians” trying to reduce their meat consumption. “It took us a long time to do that,” says Whiteside. “Almost two years of recipe testing.”The snack was launched with all the fanfare of an Apple product. “It was sort of a parody of all those iPhone launches,” Whiteside recalls. “We thought it might only last a few weeks. But it was selling out within minutes of arriving in the shops. And what was interesting about it was it had a sort of double effect. People arrived looking for that product. But once they were in Greggs they saw what else we did.”The vegan sausage roll is now one of Greggs’ five bestsellers, but sales of all of its ranges have increased to the point that Whiteside was able to distribute a £35m special idend to shareholders in July. The company is looking into vegan versions of its other bestsellers.One way of looking at this is that veganism is great for business. Another is that vegan sausage rolls are a great marketing tool for pork sausage rolls.The phenomenon is not confined to food. Dr Martens boots have strolled in and out of fashion many times in the past few decades, but the brand is proving a hit with eco-conscious teenagers – and celebrities such as Kristen Stewart, Jessica Alba and Gigi Hadid. The fact that you can buy vegan sparkling-pink 1460s and cherry-red chelsea boots made from polyurethane plastic seems to speak to the company’s core mission, which its CEO, Kenny Wilson, defines as “empowering rebellious self-expression”.Chris Elliot, an analyst for Edge by Ascential – which collates pricing data for supermarket and other retailers – makes a comparison with recent trends for “organic”, “locally sourced” and “artisanal” products. “In the same way that you’d see prominent organic displays in the supermarkets a few years ago, you will now see prominent vegan displays.”Suddenly, you can’t move for vegan sofas, vegan face cream, vegan things that you didn’t realise weren’t vegan in the first place. Take beer: “There were always lots of beers that were vegan, but never felt the need to tell you. That is, it didn’t seem relevant,” says Elliot. “But now, if a beer is vegan, you will definitely see a vegan label on it.” There is a certain amount of consumer education going on. For example, most people don’t know that it is common practice to strain beer through a substance made from fish entrails. Recently, I noticed a flyer in Bristol advertising “vegan massage” – it made me a little sad to think of all the charcuterie massages I have been missing out on.Mark Coxhead is the founder of the Protein Works, a fitness-supplement e-commerce company based in Cheshire. Like Moliere’s bourgeois gentilhomme, who is delighted to learn that he has been speaking prose all his life without realising it, he recently cottoned on to the fact that he was perfectly placed to take advantage of the vegan trend. “We’ve been around for six years now and we’ve always had soya protein shakes and pea protein shakes alongside our products that were derived from dairy. But they never sold very much until the whole veganism trend took off – then we really noticed a surge.”He decided to revamp the range to get ahead of the demand, reformulating recipes so that they tasted as good as the non-vegan equivalents and coming up with new lines. “We’re also making the messaging more prominent,” he says. “We might have called it a soya protein shake before. Now we’ll call it a vegan protein shake.” The vegan range now accounts for one-third of his sales.But most people I speak to seem convinced that this is only the beginning. While veganism was previously associated primarily with animal welfare, now there are other compelling reasons to consider: health, climate, annoying Piers Morgan. For many, it is something to aspire to, as opposed to an all-or-nothing proposition.“If you understand what’s going on in people’s heads, you can understand what sorts of decisions they’re making a lot better,” says John Clark of Coley Porter Bell, a branding agency that works with companies including Nestlé, Unilever and Tesco. “We learn by association. Brands are networks of associations in our heads. What we’re trying to do is manage those associations.”He cites the evolution of health-food packaging. “It used to be that healthiness was associated with going without. If you look at old Weight Watchers branding, it was often pale and minimalist. Now, health is much more associated with balanced diet. It’s wholesome, vibrant, fun. A lot of the vegan brands pull on that. They’re very colourful now.” He designed the packaging for Marks \u0026amp Spencer’s Plant Kitchen range and went for a turquoise palate “to instil a feeling of discernment and modernity. We took a lot of inspiration from food trucks and street food for the typography and the graphics. People then begin to associate ‘veganism’ and ‘health’ with that world.” The cost of vegan food still raises eyebrows, given that peas, rice and lentils are normally cheaper than beef, prawns and chicken. “There’s no denying that the vegan crowd is younger and more affluent,” says Elliot. But he cautions against cynicism. Vegan products usually involve much more processing than meat products – and there are also economies of scale to consider. “Imagine how many Tesco beef burgers are manufactured every day. The cost-per-unit ends up tiny. The cost-per-unit of vegan burgers is much higher.”Back at Greggs, Whiteside is careful not to make too many claims about the company’s world-saving credentials. He concedes that vegans may not be delighted at the thought of regular sausages piggy-backing on their Quorn-based pastrymates. “If you’re a vegan who wants everybody to be vegan, well, yes, you might want to go to establishments that only sell vegan,” he says. “One of the fastest-growing trends in the market is vegan-only retail. But those companies will end up catering only to vegans – and vegans don’t make up most of the market.”Rosemary Ferguson and Gizzi Erskine had a social media hit earlier this year with a three-month stint selling vegan Filth burgers at a pop-up in east London – but the endorsements of the Beckham family haven’t translated into permanent restaurants. The Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton will be hoping for more luck when he opens his first vegan restaurant later this year.Whiteside won’t say which vegan products Greggs is working on, but he admits it is “not easy”. “The test for us is that it has to be as good to eat as the non-vegan version.”The doughnut is not vegan – surely that would be an easy win?“Not as easy as you’d think,” he says. “Even if you can come up with the recipe, you need to separate out the production to ensure there’s no cross-contamination.”None of this is cheap or easy. But, as Clark points out, the companies that try to make a quick buck from veganism will soon get found out. “You will quickly get a backlash if people think you’re ‘greenwashing’. Token efforts tend to get a lot of flak on social media. And if it just doesn’t taste very good, it won’t work, either.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2c502c01a682d5259e3261fbcabd9c473ad4dbf/0_187_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4dc3be98fdf458a002ac6261d4e279e1","title":"u neck massage device electric shocks head relaxation","story":"A wraparound pulsing collar fit for our overstimulated pleasure centres?

Factual in a lumpen sort of way – this being a U-shape that fits around your neck – it also sounds like an obscure insult. It is as hard to wrap your head around U-Neck’s name as it is easy to wrap U-Neck around your head.The device buzzes and pulses through two metal plates covered in raised dots, built into the section hugging the back of my neck. It is strong, like someone accelerating a remote-control car inside my skull, or ringing a phone I’ve just swallowed. I’ve experienced similar with other massage devices, though U-Neck does employ a greater variety of rhythms and intensities (up to 550 permutations are possible).However, the collar has another trick up its, er, sleeve. I become aware of it while playing with the remote. It starts with a shiver on the nape of my neck, like a devil licking me. An inexplicable prickling, and then the sensation grows broad and intense, like tattoo needles up the back of my skull and over my ears. Whereas the vibration massage was localised, this sensation spreads. When I reach to touch the plate to see what is going on back there, I find my hand shooting away. It is electricity: there is electricity on my skin. I’m viscerally alarmed. I don’t even like taking a jumper off after 6pm because I’m scared of static.

Are our pleasure centres so overstimulated that in search of relaxation we will knowingly give ourselves electric shocks to the head? I find the sensation painful, until I realise I am on maximum intensity, too much for me. I’m not trying to tranquilise a rhino. I turn it down to half that, and am more able to appreciate one of the most unusual sensations I’ve ever known. It really is like nothing else. Relaxtricity? It is reminiscent of that trick where a friend pretends to crack an egg over your head, and you feel it oozing down your scalp. But it is also sharper than that: a million-pin tingle, which some people may love.It never feels dangerous, and U-Neck meets EU health and safety regulations. (Can’t wait until we shred that, so copycats can sell live wires wrapped around a boxing glove.) In fact, electrotherapy has been around for years, claiming to help with neck and back pain, and headaches. Medical research suggests these claims are at best extremely limited. Is it relaxing? I’m too weirded out to say. I don’t like the slight but involuntary muscle contraction, together with the heat generated by the collar. When I take it off, my neck is numb and hot to touch.I guess if you don’t have a friend, or an imaginary egg, this is a pretty good substitute for one of those things. But consumer electronics still can’t match the torquing power, dexterity and sensitivity of a trained masseur’s hands. This latest offering does bring exciting new tricks to the table – I just hope it’s not a metal table. I’m no U-Neckrophile, though sensation junkies will get a kick out of it.Even if U-Neck didn’t sound similar to “eunuch” and “U-bend” it would still be weird.U-neckessary, but not bad. 35 This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

It means a family with a dog and two cats would face a yearly animal rent of over £1,400. Another in Cheltenham is asking £50 a month for “four legged friends” with exemptions for fish or hamsters. Several landlords are seeking pet rent only for “clawed” pets.“In certain letting agencies it seems to be a standard term in agreements,” said Darren Baxter, a renter currently searching for a new home in York with his partner, two children and cocker iel Padfoot. “It seems exorbitant given the potential damage a pet can cause. We went to one place where they wanted a reference for the dog. That was ridiculous.”He said it was another example of how people who cannot afford to buy are disadvantaged in terms of being able to enjoy some of the basics of family life.One letting agent said the new practice had only emerged since June, when landlords were banned from charging cleaning fees at the end of a tenancy or demanding an additional pet deposit as a result of total deposits being capped at five weeks’ rent. Before the Tenant Fees Act 2019, which was supposed to save renters across England £240m a year, landlords often asked for pet deposits of around £150, repayable at the end of the tenancy. Pet rents now mean they have no choice but to pay more.“The only way to do it is to charge higher rent,” said Carolina Misiukiewicz, administrator at Eliot Oliver, an estate agent in Cheltenham. “It’s a new thing for us. In our experience we haven’t taken extra for hamsters or gerbils and definitely not fish.”Dozens of adverts for homes demanding pet rent can be seen on the rental websites Rightmove and Zoopla, along with many more refusing to take pets.Half of UK adults own a pet, with 11 million owning cats and almost 9 million owning dogs, according to the veterinary charity PDSA. At the same time more and more families are having to rent. A quarter of families in England rent privately, reaching nearly 1.6m last year, more than double the number recorded in the government’s English Housing Survey a decade earlier."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7ddc19fc1f04cec884333460d98ee1dd98580a0/1164_264_575_345/master/575.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4bef1f7aa194b48077cfff42b0ab4b5b","title":"prom 58 review bbc scottish symphony orchestra ilan volkov","story":"Royal Albert Hall, LondonThe playing was alert and incisive in a wide-ranging programme that included Tchaikovsky and a new work by Linda Catlin SmithIlan Volkov stepped down as the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra’s principal conductor 10 years ago, but he has kept up his connection with the orchestra ever since, regularly returning as a guest. His concerts are always worth exploring: it’s hard to think of another conductor who is so wide ranging and just as likely to programme a work by John Cage as a Bruckner symphony.So it was no surprise to find him beginning his prom with the first performance of a BBC commission from Linda Catlin Smith, before going on to Janáček, Szymanowski and Tchaikovsky.The BBCSSO clearly enjoy working with Volkov, too the playing was consistently alert and incisive. Their account of Tchaikovsky’s Second Symphony, was as thrillingly febrile as anything I’ve heard in the Albert Hall this year. Szymanowski’s Love Songs of Hafiz – one of the handful of pieces that pin his music on to the coat tails of modernism – was full of iridescent beguilement, with Georgia Jarman as the effortlessly soaring soprano, and the narrative of Janáček’s symphonic poem, The Fiddler’s Child, getting its first outing at the Proms, was laid out as clearly as in any of his operas.Catlin Smith’s Nuages was something of a disappointment, though. An 18-minute essay in delicate orchestral colours and textures, its dappled effects didn’t project the distinctive musical personality that comes through so strongly in Catlin Smith’s chamber music, even though Volkov and the orchestra presented it with every bit of the care and refinement the intricate scoring demands.• Available on BBC Sounds. The Proms continue until 14 September.• This article was amended on 3 September 2019. It was Tchaikovsky’s Second Symphony that was performed, not his third as we stated in an earlier version."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eaf5d2aec2f80f1304a6f9e8a4a8e6ec158a76f0/0_1380_7300_4380/master/7300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c1940d8487468b10fe47b829d261a3a","title":"the man who gave birth podcast","story":"Freddy McConnell is a  journalist and trans man who in 2016 decided to begin the process of conceiving and delivering his own child.

Boris Johnson’s Conservatives would start any election campaign with an advantage.Johnson’s strategy since entering Downing Street has been to try to unify the leave vote by taking a hard Brexit approach, while hoping that Jeremy Corbyn cannot unite remain voters to the same degree.2. This could translate into a Conservative majority – although not all pollsters agree.Electoral Calculus estimates, based on an analysis of polling from 26 July, when Johnson became prime minister, to 31 August, that the Conservatives would win an overall majority of 62.But this forecast rests on the assumption that Johnson can make real inroads into traditional Labour seats in the Midlands and north with his Brexit “do or die” strategy. Other pollsters are more sceptical.Polling conducted by Focus Data, on behalf of pro-EU Conservatives and released overnight, concludes that the Conservatives would only end up with 311 seats, well short of the 326 needed for an overall majority in the Commons, although Labour would also lose ground with 242.The date on which the Commons returns from summer recess.Sajid Javid\u0026nbspis expected to start a fast-tracked spending review, promising a cash boost for schools, hospitals and policing. The swift timing of the review comes after his first major speech by the chancellor was\u0026nbspabruptly cancelled by the Treasury\u0026nbspwith less than 24 hours’ notice.Prime minister Boris Johnson has asked the Queen to prorogue parliament during this week. MPs were due to have a recess period anyway for the party conference season. However, proroguing parliament will severely limit the time MPs have to legislate against no deal or hold and win a vote of no confidence in the government.\u0026nbspThe Labour and Conservative party conferences are due to be held on consecutive weeks.This is the date that Johnson is proposing parliament returns for the Queen’s speech setting out a legislation programme for his government.EU leaders meet for the final European council summit before the UK\u0027s extension is due to expire. They could possibly agree a new deal at this point - with just about enough time for Johnson to try and get it through parliament.The six-month article 50 extension will expire, and prime minister Boris Johnson has pledged that the UK will leave the EU with or without a deal on that date.A possible date for a general election if Johnson has been unable to force through his plans, although the date could be sooner if an election is called as a result of the parliamentary showdown between the prime minister and MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexitin early September.More interestingly still, if the pro Brexit DUP retained its 10 seats that would leave pro-Brexit parties on 321. The combined opposition, meanwhile, could reach the same figure: taking Labour’s 242 plus 52 for the SNP, 21 Lib Dems, four Plaid, one Green and Lady Sylvia Hermon, the independent MP for North Down, who has said she is against no deal. A parliament as ided as the current one.3. Last time, Theresa May lost a 21-point lead, but it is not as clear that Labour can pull off the same comeback again. May started the 2017 campaign looking like a winner, but she turned out to be a hopeless performer, while Labour’s anti-austerity and pro-nationalisation policies proved an unexpected hit with the electorate.That could change rapidly however. Johnson’s decision to suspend parliament early has not proved popular and his uncertain, fast talking address outside Downing Street showed that he too can be rattled.4. Nigel Farage could end up as kingmaker and the Brexit party’s final share will be critical.Squeezing its vote is critical, or Johnson risks a repeat of the Peterborough byelection on a national scale, where Labour won because the leave vote was split.It has become a feature of contemporary politics to be dismissive of polling. The reality is that the dynamic of an election campaign has become critical, particularly one that will be set against the backdrop of the Brexit crisis.In 2015, English voters were successfully frightened by the idea of a Labour-SNP coalition – an idea that was pushed out by the Conservatives at a point when voters believed the outcome would be a hung parliament.In 2017, Labour outperformed expectations in an election where Brexit was not the issue. This time, Brexit is the dominant issue and Corbyn has to pick up remain voters currently inclined to the Lib Dems and simultaneously rouse Labour’s traditional working-class base if it is to succeed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5645aef0f35dc3721bc3c8a8d431dafc142cbc8/0_178_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72db51359a86485d1a8c4de5cbff74fd","title":"parliament returns for brexit showdown today in focus podcast","story":"Jonathan Freedland joins Anushka Asthana to discuss a pivotal week ahead in British politics.

We held each other’s gaze. On the “stage” of an upstairs room in a grimy little pub, his partner – it may have been Andy Zaltzman but this was 15 years ago – finished his opening patter. Oliver didn’t notice it was his turn to speak. “Would you like to continue?” asked maybe-Zaltzman.“Hey, what? No,” said Oliver. “We can’t just move on as though nothing has happened. There was a connection here.” Looking at me, he said: “I’m not imagining this, am I?”Sitting in the front row at comedy gigs has interesting consequences. I’ve had the story of how my parents met told through improvised rap by Abandoman. I’ve had my head enveloped by a giant artificial sunflower to the theme music from Stranger Things, symbolising death by Demogorgon. I’ve been serenaded by countless comedians, including Yasmine Day (Tiffany’s I Think We’re Alone Now), Terry Alderton (Cyndi Lauper’s True Colours) and Rich Hall (singing his own Fix the Porn). But with Oliver it was a brief moment in which two guys just said to hell with it, stared into each other’s souls and found acceptance.Most people steer clear of the front row as if the chairs were electrified – but comedians need you to sit there. Not to make fun of you, but because, unless you’re laughing at every single joke, they need to know what you liked, so they can improve. In the words of the brilliant Sophie Duker, they need to know “what’s funny – and what you’ll tolerate”. Standing in the stage lights, they probably can’t see your face if you sit further back. At a recent Funny Women workshop for fledgling comedians, Rachel Creeger gave this advice for new comics dying on stage: find the one smiling face in the crowd and focus on delivering to them.Choosing the gig helps a lot. The Quantum Leopard comedy club has a no-hate policy. You can show you consent to getting chatted to by wearing one of their green stickers. Just leave it off if you don’t want to be bothered. They fill their front row, no problem, with maybe two-thirds wearing stickers.Getting asked up on stage can be a more intense experience. Comedy duo Siblings have a radar for choosing suitable punters for this. In last year’s show, Acting Out, their “school assemblymurder investigation” sketch started with a low-key improv exercise with the audience, dressed up as a group recitation of the improbably long school motto. They chose their culprit – the audience member responsible for the killings – soon afterwards and used that same audience member for every subsequent moment requiring audience participation, no matter what the sketch, until the reason for their fixation was dramatically revealed in the ultimate scene. The random audience member went from patsy to taking a crucial role in the show’s gothic finale. It was risky but almost magical to watch.It helps if your patsy is delighted to be on stage but capable of hiding it, as in my case when they happened to pick me from the audience. (OK, I improvised a little towards the end, but mostly I just did as I was told and it was a lot of fun.)Occasionally, I see something wonderful that seems to contradict the common notion that audiences don’t like participating. In his Edinburgh fringe show, David McIver, dressed as Death, urged audience members to touch his scythe – and thus die. As each soul was claimed, the audience was rewarded with a tale from Death’s story book. The audience accepted participation – and their own deaths – as the price for each charming tale, and didn’t stop volunteering for the scythe, one after the other, in a weirdly heartwarming display.At most comedy nights, nobody in the audience needs to die. I couldn’t give John Oliver a good answer to his question but it didn’t matter – the show went on, and it was a good one. Next time you’re called on at a comedy show – only if you’re called on – I hope you’ll enjoy being part of a connection that you won’t get with a flat screen: a brief, random, miraculous and unique connection.

We are exhausted by the prospect of signing up to yet another subscription service. We are exhausted by the punishing promises of franchises being run even further into the dirt in the form of sequels, spinoffs and series. We are exhausted and baffled and defeated by the trailer for The World According to Jeff Goldblum.However, as much as it resembles the smiling face of cultural monopoly, Disney+ does have one thing going for it. According to reports from Disney’s D23 conference, it will release new episodes of its shows weekly. The Mandalorian will play out across eight weeks. The Loki series will run over six. In an age when consumers are used to being given everything they want at once, Disney+ is bringing back the lost art of patience – and it can’t come soon enough.The Netflix model of bulk-releasing seasons was a fun novelty at first, but there are signs that people are growing tired of it – especially people who like talking about television. The amount of eggshell-walking it has created – with people tiptoeing around juicy plotlines for fear of spoiling things for their busier friends – has become absurd. The recap ecosystem has suffered, too. How do you cover a show that arrives in one piece? Do you burn through several episodes a day with little time for decent reflection, as the AV Club did recently with Glow? Or do you take your time and give proper attention to one episode a week, even though the show will be a distant memory for most viewers once you have crawled to the finale? It is a minefield.Similarly, what is the maximum amount of buzz that a new Netflix show receives these days? A week? Three days? The final series of Orange Is the New Black – consistently named Netflix’s best original programme – should have been a major publicity-grabber. Instead, the whole thing dropped at once and was buried by Glow the following week, which in turn was buried by Mindhunter. We have been trained to salivate over the hot new thing at the expense of all else, even if what came before is only a matter of days old.Furthermore, the biggest success stories of recent times have been released weekly. Game of Thrones took its time, with each new episode dominating the cultural conversation (for better or worse) more than the last. Bodyguard hinged on suspending incredible tension across several weeks in a manner that wouldn’t have worked if it had been dumped at once. Even something as everyday in its subject matter as Fleabag snowballed as it continued, with each episode drawing a more breathless reaction than the last.This has to be the main reason why Disney+ will keep things weekly. It is a clever way to maintain a stranglehold on culture. While this approach is bound to be more successful for some shows than others – you can expect suffocating global hype around the Marvel series, whereas anyone who recaps The World According to Jeff Goldblum can expect a swift kick in the pants – it is a sign that Disney+ won’t rest until it has become the world’s most dominant streaming platform.There may be another, finance-driven reason for the weekly drop – good luck watching a full two-month season of The Mandalorian with your free trial, suckers – but it seems as though the key goal is becoming unavoidable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/302da68a5498169c99fc32662883c2fbf92dc778/0_0_2000_1201/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b4b28ffe931d317ec600e954523dbd6","title":"burning boat california coast santa barbara los angeles","story":"Five crew members escape but 33 passengers and one other crew member missing or deadTwenty-five people have died and nine remain missing after a boat was engulfed in flames and sank off the coast of Santa Barbara and Los Angeles.The US Coast Guard said five crew members escaped from the 23-metre (75ft) commercial scuba ing boat but 33 passengers and one other crew member were missing or found dead after the fire early on Monday morning.As the recovery effort progressed, 25 bodies were found and nine people were unaccounted for, presumed dead, as of late on Monday evening. The Coast Guard official Matthew Kroll said the first bodies recovered had signs consistent with drowning.The boat was docked near Santa Cruz Island at the time of the fire.The first four bodies recovered were identified as two adult males and two adult females, but authorities said they would need to carry out DNA tests to identify them. Officials had no other details to share about the missing people, saying the passengers came from across southern California and probably farther away.Nyx Cangemi, a Coast Guard official, told the  that by the end of the day authorities had recovered 20 bodies, and the other five had been seen inside the boat but could not yet be reached.The Los Angeles Coast Guard responded to a mayday call at approximately 3.15am reporting that a vessel was on fire.Monica Rochester, a Coast Guard official, said: “We will search all the way through the night and into the morning … We all should be prepared to move into the worst outcome.” The congresswoman Julia Brownley, who represents the area, was on the scene and met with authorities, who had sent out helicopters and was conducting shoreline searches for the missing people.“What’s happening here is just about deployment and search and rescue,” she said. “They have a mission.”Audio of a frantic mayday call captured someone onboard shouting, “I can’t breathe,” before the call was cut off.A nearby “good Samaritan” pleasure craft picked up the five crew members who were able to escape the ship.Rochester said the five were awake on the bridge of the vessel when the flames were spotted and were able to jump off. The passengers reported missing were asleep below deck.While firefighters brought the blaze under control, the vessel sank 20 metres off shore in more than 15 metres of water, the Coast Guard said.By Monday afternoon, only a portion of the bow was sticking out of the water.The Ventura county fire department released dramatic pictures on Twitter on Monday morning, showing the boat engulfed in smoke and flames.A Coast Guard senior official, Aaron Bemis, told CNN the fire kept appearing to be extinguished and then burst back into flames, possibly because of the amount of fuel on the ship.The vessel, named Conception, was a ing tour boat owned by a company called Truth Aquatics, a boat rental service that offers ing tours off southern California.The boat was being used for a three-day ing tour of islands, including Santa Cruz Island, according to the Truth Aquatics website. Passengers boarded the boat at Santa Barbara Harbor on Friday night, and the vessel had been due to return to Santa Barbara late on Monday afternoon. California Diving, a local publication, described the boat as “California’s crown jewel of live-aboard e boats” when it was built in 1981.Rochester said the boat was in “full compliance” with regulations.The US Coast Guard was “working deliberately with the vessel owneroperator, who is with us at the time working on a plan to conduct further assistance for his vessel”, she said.Authorities set up a family assistance point at an event center in Santa Barbara. Officials said they did not have much information they could share, but were there to provide support.“People are coming in wanting information,” said Suzanne Grimmesey, an official with the Santa Barbara department of behavioral wellness. “There are a lot of unknowns across the board.“We are hoping to help them cope with what they are experiencing. We have clergy, we have chaplains, we have Red Cross, we have hospice care.”People in Santa Barbara placed flowers and candles at the harbour where the Conception used to dock.Orlando Aldana, who lives in the city and often comes to the harbour, brought 34 candles to the makeshift memorial to honour each victim. “These will be lit up all night for them,” he said.He said he was still struggling to process the news: “It’s the last thing that you think would happen. I’m just praying for all of them.”The Associated Press contributed to this report."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af34e0f255923d3164578a3e2eda2046f79d9215/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e753024da361e03b76dd48120c101803","title":"from game of thrones to loving noses life as a self employed sculptor","story":"It takes a meticulous eye for detail to become a sculptor, but for Lydia Smith to make a living out of her art she needs to be equally diligent with her business planningSculptor Lydia Smith splits her time between her personal sculpture projects, running workshops, and the sets of films and TV shows for which she has sculpted props – such as Game of Thrones and Tomb Raider. The 24-year-old artist behind Lydia Smith Sculpture says the secret to fitting it all in is her constant companion: a paperback diary.I think with my hands. I always wanted to use clay and do 3D stuff but I wasn’t allowed. I completely fell in love with sculpture, and figurative in particular, when I started my art foundation. Making something 3D makes so much more sense to me than drawing. My hands just know what to do.One of my tutors told me: “Use a model to make a sculpture, but don’t make a sculpture of the model.” I’m attracted to models who have different angles in their faces and good noses, I love noses. I ask people I know to pose – raise their arms, twist a bit, look in different directions. Depending on what I’m trying to achieve with the mood of the piece, I might elongate or shorten limbs, or twist the torso more to give more drama.I worked on Game of Thrones season eight. There’s quite a lot of polystyrene sculpture used for trees, or castles, or rock formations. Little animals on the King’s Landing set were sculpted out of clay. The time pressure of working on set and never knowing if designers will change their mind is a challenge. My colleague and I had an hour to clad a whole piece and sculpt some rock detail into it, we were completely exhausted by the end then the designers came back and said they now didn’t need it until the next week.It’s part of my ethos to bring sculpture to younger people. I run portrait sculpting and torso sculpting workshops. You just don’t get the opportunity to do it in schools because of all the processes involved, you have to know your anatomy and there are just so many different techniques. It’s just so involved. Most people would have no idea how much stuff goes on behind the scenes of creating one sculpture.Health and safety is a massive part. We use knives and electrical equipment, so I have masks for breathing protection and eye goggles and gloves, which we wear when operating heavy machinery and moulding and casting. I have insurance to cover injuries, to cover my tools in case someone breaks in, and I have it to cover my apprentice, who was working for me one day a week.I’m trying to make my studio as eco-friendly as possible. I make my sculptures on armatures. I mould them and then get them cast in bronze, plaster, and a material called jesmonite. They’re non-toxic, so it’s more eco-friendly than resin. That’s something I’m trying to really bring into my studio, because there’s so much waste within the whole process.This year, I had five months off where there was no film work. Having that time off really pushed my personal work forward. It was really quiet and it enabled me to do some courses in Athens and in Spain. I’ve got five sculptures on the go at the moment, and I did two ice sculpture competitions over the Christmas break. But five months of no pay and all of a sudden it becomes: “I really need to find another film.”I always ask the question and I’m a little bit ballsy. I got my first actual job by wandering around on my tea breaks with my portfolio and breaking into art departments so I could speak with art directors. I love networking, I’m a network addict and I’m always paying attention to what might be next, even though I’m already doing something.I don’t know where I would be without my diary. If something is not in my diary I will just completely forget what it is film work, my personal stuff, my social life, gym, everything. I’m a very visual learner so everything is on this bit of paper, written down, rubbed out, scribbled out, different colours.I’m the most scatty person ever. To run my business as a sole trader I have a business account that everything goes into, I have an app to scan all my receipts and my invoices that calculate all my tax and expenses for the end of each year. A couple of years ago to get my head around it all was hard, but now it’s fine. I’m always on my emails, I always sit down at the end of the day and run through them to flag up the ones I need to reply to.I want to have a public sculpture somewhere someday. Ideally I want to be running workshops to teach people. My own personal goal is to have my artwork in exhibitions in galleries, and for people to commission me to do portrait busts and figures, and then drop in and out of film work whenever I get asked to come in.Lydia Smith takes care of business.

You know you should get stuff done but you find yourself weighed down by the tyranny of your to-do list.And, of course, the more you put something off, the larger the looming shadow it casts. This is particularly insidious when it comes to dull-but-essential tasks, such as admin.And if you’re running a small business, it can be even harder to discipline yourself, especially if you’re working on your own or from home. Moreover, the burden of business admin can feel particularly oppressive, sapping your ability to focus on growing your company.The internet is full of life hacks and tips to help you break this cycle of inertia. But all-too-often the suggestions feel like just another thing to add to your to-do list. Likewise, techniques for improving your time management can sometimes seem a bit, well, time-consuming.Happily, however, there are a number of quick-and-easy tips that you can implement immediately – whether it’s advice for beating procrastination, resisting unhelpful impulses or countering your phobia of finances.For instance, when it comes to tackling the urge to check your social media, try thinking about how bad you’d feel in the near future having failed to complete the task at hand.Or if you’re trying to avoid procrastinating, tell someone else your intended goals for that particular day. This will make you feel more accountable – after all, it’s harder to break an intention that you’ve declared to others than it is to break a promise that you’ve made to yourself.There are also practical techniques for tackling some of the peskier admin tasks that tend to linger on people’s to-do lists – such as nailing your tax return, managing your web presence, and getting the correct kind of business insurance.1. Beat procrastinationProcrastinating doesn’t mean you’re workshy. It’s more likely to mean you’re just trying to stop yourself from feeling bad – either because you have to do something you’d rather not, or you’re worried you won’t be able to complete the task. So, try to focus on the positive outcome instead.2. Control your impulsesIn a world increasingly governed by instant gratification and the addictiveness of our smartphones, the ability to control our impulses is essential to getting things done. But try to think of this as a two-stage process: first, resist the temptation by making it harder to act on that initial urge – for instance by locking your phone in a drawer so you can’t check social media. And, second, maintain that resistance by consciously forming new positive habits.3. Overcome your financial phobiaAdmin avoidance can stem from a general anxiety about financial literacy. According to Brad Klontz, a financial psychologist and author, one way to combat this is to find yourself a financial mentor: “A great way to challenge your beliefs is to find someone who’s a step or two ahead, pick their brains, and become a student of their money mindset.”4. Tackle time managementOne simple trick is to try to become more aware of the value of each moment. “Remember every task comes with a cost,” says podcaster and author Ellen Hendriksen. “Be mindful about what task you are choosing to spend your time on, because that is time not doing other tasks.”5. Find your flowBeing “in the zone” or achieving a “flow state” can give us the focus and energy to perform at our best. One trick is to insulate yourself from tasks that might otherwise distract you by scheduling time in the week to do all the bits of admin that would otherwise intrude.6. Tooling yourself upThe popular idiom holds that a bad worker always blames their tools, but perhaps the opposite is also true: a good worker will always give them credit. Having the right kit helps you signal to yourself your intention to do a job well. In short, if we have good tools, we’re more likely to look forward to using them.7. Nail your tax returnAdopt so-called “microproductivity” methods by breaking this annual round of torture into a series of smaller tasks. These can then fit into those little moments of spare time we occasionally find ourselves with. For instance, try to view each figure that you need to obtain as a distinct task to be completed on its own.8. Manage your web presenceOne byproduct of ramping up your web presence is you can be inundated with demand that you can’t meet. “You turn your advertising off then,” says Jimmy McCann, head of digital strategy at Search Laboratory, which helps clients with online advertising. “It would also be worth having an overflow network to pass stuff on to and get a kickback.”9. Prepare a loan pitchSometimes a business needs a cash injection – whether it’s for upgrading equipment or premises, or just a bridging loan to help with a short-term cashflow problem. However, asking for money and demonstrating an ability to repay it can be stressful and time-consuming. Try to minimise the anxiety and avoid the possible pitfalls by being realistic about your projections – that way you can give a solid timeframe for repayments.10. Get insuredIt can be tempting to put off taking out business insurance. It can linger at the bottom of your to-do list because of the complacent attitude that “it won’t happen to us”. Part of the problem is that many people don’t appreciate the sheer number of possible hazards that exist in the workplace and their potential fallout – whether from accidental damage, disruption or injury. Often, it’s the anticipated complexity of sorting out cover, rather than the cost, that puts people off. But getting the right cover can be simpler than you’d think.For expanded advice on how to overcome common obstacles to getting things done, go to thewhats-stopping-you"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f0d957ba498b52d9c5cd513be6778602e37fcea/0_47_3072_1844/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11901c00b0ffdc6f0b1e6b6656731e6e","title":"m5s online vote whether form italy coalition","story":"Country could face fresh elections if members reject pact with Democratic partyMembers of Itay’s anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) are voting online on whether to support a proposed coalition with the Democratic party (PD).The two parties unveiled a shared policy programme on Tuesday to serve as the basis of a new coalition government, putting an expansionary 2020 budget at the top of their agenda.The traditional foes have agreed to form a new administration to head off snap elections after the previous administration comprising M5S and the far-right League collapsed last month.About 30,000 voted in the first two hours, according to the organisation that runs the M5S platform. A no vote would probably result in an early election.With voting under way, the parties published a 26-point programme that would underpin the planned government. At the top of the list was a commitment to use the forthcoming budget to help stimulate economic growth, but also a promise that it would not endanger public finances.Italy has the second-largest debt burden in the European Union as a proportion of economic output, and the pact called for greater flexibility from Brussels to overcome the “excessive rigidity” of existing budget rules.Emphasising social justice, the two parties pledged to introduce a minimum salary, avoid a planned VAT sales rise and boost spending on education, research and welfare. The programme also called for a web tax on multinationals and the creation of a public bank to help boost development in the south.“This is a very delicate moment for the country. It must be tackled by focusing on the interests and needs of citizens, of the community that we all form together,” M5S said in a blogpost on Tuesday, calling on its supporters to back the coalition deal.The M5S senate whip, Stefano Patuanelli, said on Monday that if a majority of participants in the polls voted no then Conte would have to tell the president, Sergio Mattarella, that his attempt to form a government had failed. The M5S leader, Luigi Di Maio, told a meeting of his deputies that everything depended on the Rousseau vote.Web-based direct democracy has been one of M5S’s core principles since it was founded in 2009 by the comedian Beppe Grillo and Gianroberto Casaleggio, an entrepreneur who died three years ago.In its early years, the movement used its website and Grillo’s blog to debate and hold votes before Rousseau, a purpose-built platform named after the 18th-century Swiss-born philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, was developed and introduced in 2016.But the system has been plagued by hacking attacks during key votes, and in April Italy’s data protection authority fined the company that runs the platform €50,000 (£45,000) for failing to protect users’ personal details.M5S has held dozens of online votes on key decisions, including one to elect Di Maio and another on whether to enter its previous coalition with the League. The most recent online ballot was on whether to vote in parliament to defend the League’s leader, Matteo Salvini, from prosecution for preventing migrants disembarking from an Italian coastguard ship.Italy was plunged into chaos last month when Salvini withdrew the League from its fractious alliance with M5S, as he sought to exploit his party’s popularity to bring about snap elections and become prime minister.The dramatic move threatened to create a fully far-right government. But Salvini, whose tactics have dented his popularity in recent weeks, had not banked on M5S teaming up with the PD. Though the two parties are longstanding enemies, they are also the two largest parties in parliament.If Conte fails to form a new government, Mattarella is likely to call for new elections.Some M5S figures have criticised the decision to put the coalition to an online vote.“The vote on the platform is part of the history of our movement,” said Roberta Lombardi, a former M5S parliament whip, in an interview with Fatto Quotidano. “But it doesn’t seem easy to communicate the meaning and the points of such a complex agreement in just a few days. Also because the president of the republic is in a hurry to find a solution.“The voting on the platform is not, in this delicate moment, the most appropriate tool, given the timing,” the M5S deputy Michele Nitti wrote on Facebook. “I am surprised the decision to do so was taken, despite the concerns that emerged after the last meeting with the colleagues of the Movement.”In a statement to the Adnkronos agency a few days ago, another M5S deputy, Flora Frate, asked Di Maio to withdraw the vote on Rousseau because “binding Mr Conte via the result of a vote on a platform run by a private company, without any guarantee of transparency, is absurd”.Massimiliano Panarari, a politics professor at Luiss University, in Rome, said: “The vote on Rousseau is part of the M5S tradition and was presented as an example of direct democracy, even though it is far from it. “Submitting the agreement between PD and M5S to the vote seems an affront to the institutions and to the same democratic representation, after President Mattarella formally commissioned Conte to find an agreement to form a new government.”Reuters contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1eacf32dfbe2dbf598c649f5cf17d81f7865b99/0_223_4004_2404/master/4004.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=781d8f32acb4dcff1fbe5b81bf14d00a","title":"more cubans seek asylum in mexico amid clampdown on legal path to us","story":"US-bound Cubans used to encounter far fewer obstacles on the migration passage, but that’s changed due to crackdownsYatsel Jerez Ramón has been in Mexico for six weeks, and so far, nothing has gone well for the Cuban migrant trying to reach the United States.On his first night in Tenosique, a small city in the southern border state of Tabasco, Jerez, 37, narrowly escaped a police raid at his hotel. The following day, a man posing as a state lawyer convinced him to hand over $500 to obtain a humanitarian visa with which, Jerez was told, he’d be able to safely continue his passage north.Jerez was travelling with several other Cubans, and together they also forked out $2,000 for an amparo – a legal petition used to temporarily suspend deportation if detained by immigration agents.“We arrived blind,” Jerez told the , “trusted in what people said, but everyone took advantage of us.”Armed with the visa and amparo, Jerez boarded a bus heading north hoping to reach the US border within the week, but didn’t get far.Jerez was detained at the first checkpoint leaving Tenosique after immigration agents who boarded the bus said the visa was fraudulent, and taken to the overcrowded National Migration Institute (INM) detention centre.Here, according to Jerez, he was threatened with prosecution – and eight years in jail – for false documents if he dared apply for asylum, rather than agreeing to deportation. The amparo was proclaimed useless.For Jerez, going back to Havana wasn’t an option: “I just want to continue on my journey to the US. But I’m scared of being deported, so even if it takes months, seeking asylum in Mexico seems like my only option to reach the border.”Jerez is among a rapidly growing number of Cubans turning to the Mexican asylum system amid a clampdown on alternative legal routes.Historically, US-bound Cubans encountered far fewer obstacles on the migration passage due to unique legal protections and economic and educational advantages compared with Central Americans.But, a crackdown by the US and Mexican governments has left tens of thousands of Cubans trapped in Mexico, facing the same dangers and hurdles as migrants from elsewhere. In April, Cubans spearheaded a mass escape from one overflowing detention centre in protest at delays and inhumane conditions.The Cubans’ plights can be traced back to Barack Obama’s second term, when reducing migration was a key issue in bilateral discussions that eventually led to the historic diplomatic thaw between the old foes.Mexico was instrumental in implementing this deal to curtail Cuban migration, according to Rodolfo Casillas, a migration scholar at the Latin American Faculty of Social Sciences (Flacso): Mexico detained 14,000 Cubans during 2015 and 2016 as rumours about a change in US policy prompted a surge in Cubans leaving the island.In 2017, just days before leaving the White House, Obama revoked the “wet foot, dry foot” policy which treated all Cubans arriving on US soil as political refugees, authorized to stay and legalize their status. Since then, Cubans have been obliged to enter the backlogged and time-consuming US asylum process like everyone else.Now, the impact of Donald Trump’s policy is hitting Cubans in Mexico: in the north, thousands are waiting in line in border cities like Ciudad Juárez to present their asylum cases at ports of entry.En route, 5,512 Cubans were detained in the first six months of this year, compared with 504 during the whole of 2018. (710 have been deported this year, compared with 156 in 2018.)In the south, in cities like Tenosique and Tapachula, those without the means to pay people smugglers are trapped since the exit pass – which allowed select nationals including Cubans and Haitians to traverse Mexico legally – was revoked in early 2019 amid the threat of crippling trade tariffs by Trump.“The tap has been turned off,” said Ramón Márquez, director of the La72 migrant shelter, where 228 Cubans sought refugee in the first seven months of 2019, compared with 23 in 2019.“Mexico’s only policy objective is to avoid conflict with Trump,” said Casillas from Flacso. “This means stopping the flow of migrants, whatever it takes, which is fuelling people smuggling and asylum cases.”In Tenosique, most Cubans can be found renting cramped, very basic digs, looking for a safe route out of the boiling hot city where violent crimes against migrants have long been tolerated by authorities.Yilesy González, 40, from the city of Cárdenas, sold the family home and left Cuba with her husband in mid-July, leaving behind their two children with her mother. González says that life had become intolerable since 2017, when authorities discovered the makeshift boat they’d built to sail across the Caribbean Sea to Honduras.The couple share an airless rented room with six others on the outskirts of the city, who are all waiting for appointments with the Mexican refugee agency. They don’t have family in the US to help pay for a coyote (guide). “We’d be happy to stay in Mexico, but not here, somewhere with jobs, so we could make a life.”Josep Herreros, a UN refugee agency protection officer in Mexico, said: “The dramatic increase in Cubans seeking asylum reflects changes in migration policies in Mexico, rather than changes in their home country.“There must be safe legal paths to migration, so that asylum is only used by those who need international protection.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbaa9fa2307998d56eb6a21c4ee652065bcd1280/0_185_4143_2486/master/4143.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d9af720378fffcb1cf90456f45ae625","title":"spanish pm unveils progressive policies to head off snap election","story":"Pedro Sánchez hopes to win over anti-austerity alliance and end political impasseSpain’s acting prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has announced hundreds of progressive policies intended to persuade the anti-austerity Unidas Podemos alliance to back his efforts to form a government and avoid the country’s fourth general election in as many years.Sánchez’s Socialist party (PSOE) won the most seats in April’s general election but fell short of a majority in congress and has refused to govern in coalition with the far-left grouping.Sánchez has instead suggested a “shared progressive programme” designed to end the standoff and win over Unidas Podemos, unveiling on Tuesday 370 policies including proposals to clamp down on excessive rent rises, introduce low-emission zones in towns and cities, and expand free public nursery education.Speaking at the launch in Madrid, the acting prime minister called for a government built around a “shared, progressive agreement” and an openness to society.“It’s not just because it’s the route people called for when they voted at the polls,” he said. “It’s because society is asking us to show we can overcome the political impasse that the country’s endured since 28 April and give Spain the opportunity to have a progressive government right now.”Voter anger over economic woes and corruptions scandals leaders to a hung parliament. The two main parties - the ruling People’s party (PP) and the Socialists (PSOE) - suffer big loses at the expense of newcomers (leftwing) Podemos and (rightwing) Ciudadanos. Neither the PP nor the PSOE manage to secure a majority in parliament to form a new government, so …… another election is held in June. Voter turnout is the lowest since the transition to democracy in 1975. The PP’s vote share increases, but parliamentary deadlock continues. PSOE leader Pedro Sánchez refuses to allow PP leader Mariano Rajoy to form a minority government, citing the corruption scandals swirling around the PP.Years of simmering discontent among PSOE members with Sánchez\u0026nbspboil over and he is ousted as leader after powerful factions rebel against his refusal to allow Rajoy to form a government.With Sánchez gone, the political paralysis is broken and Rajoy returns as PM after the PSOE abstains on an investiture vote in parliament.Sánchez regains the leadership of the still-ided PSOE, his hardline anti-Rajoy stance bolstered by a slew of corruption scandals involving former senior PP figures in Madrid’s regional government.Rajoy becomes the first serving Spanish PM to testify in a criminal case. He emphatically denied any knowledge of an illegal funding racket in the PP.The president of Madrid’s regional government, PP\u0027s Cristina Cifuentes, resigns after video footage emerged of her apparently being caught stealing two tubs of face cream seven years previously. Rajoy had refused to heed calls to sack Cifuentes after an earlier scandal involving false claims about her academic qualifications.The PSOE calls a vote of no confidence in the scandal-plagued Rajoy administration, and it passes through parliament with the help of regional parties and Podemos. Sánchez is sworn in as PM the next day.\u0026nbspSánchez is unable to get his 2019 budget passed through parliament after the Basque and Catalan nationalist parties who had supported him against Rajoy vote against it. Yet another election is called.Another inconclusive election sees the PSOE increases its vote share, as the PP vote plummets and the far-right Vox party enters parliament for the first time.\u0026nbsp Speculation immediately turns to how the\u0026nbspPSOE will secure the majority needed to form a government.\u0026nbspSánchez also took aim at the conservatives and pro-independence Catalan parties who overcame their bitter enmity to trigger the snap election by rejecting his government’s 2019 budget.“We haven’t got to where we are today because of disagreements between progressive parties but because pro-independence and conservative parties pooled their votes to topple a progressive government,” he said.Iglesias gave the policies a cautious welcome, telling Spanish TV that while they “sounded good”, he and his colleagues would need to study them in detail before making any decisions.Even if Sánchez manages to win over Unidas Podemos – which is far from certain – he would still need the pro-independence Catalan Republican Left party to abstain during the investiture vote.Tensions between Catalan separatists and pro-unity parties remain high and are likely to rise still further when the supreme court delivers its verdict next month in the trial of the 12 regional independence leaders accused of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds over their alleged roles in the failed bid to secede from Spain two years ago.The Spanish Socialist Workers’ party\u0026nbsp has governed Spain since\u0026nbspturfing the conservative People’s party out of office last year in a vote of no-confidence. But it has struggled to achieve its ambitious agenda as it is a minority government, holding only 84 of the 350 seats in the Spanish congress. Opponents accuse it of being weak and beholden to the Catalan separatists parties on whose support it relied to win power.The rightwing party governed from 2011 until last year, when it was finally undone after a court case laid bare the corruption at its heart. In the case,\u0026nbspMariano Rajoy became the first serving PM to testify in a criminal case. He was succeeded as party leader by Pablo Casado, who has dragged the party much further to the right in the hope of seeing off the challenge from Vox.Along with Podemos, the young, the centre-right Citizens party achieved a breakthrough in the 2015 election, ending decades of PSOE and PP duopoly. The party has also shifted further to the right in recent months, and made the Catalan crisis a key focus. Its tough line on regional independence and rigorous defence of Spain’s national unity paid off in the 2017 Catalan regional elections, in which Citizens were the single biggest winner.\u0026nbspThe anti-austerity party, born of frustration and the indignados movement, looked set to leapfrog the PSOE and become the dominant leftwing political force in the 2016 general election. But mixed messages, internal squabbles and an alliance with the United Left – a coalition that includes the Communist party – saw it do far worse than expected. Podemos has helped to shore up the Sánchez government, but public internal spats have blunted its message and weakened its image.Vox, led by the pistol-carrying Santiago Abascal, ended four decades of Spanish exceptionalism in December when its performance in the Andalucían elections made it the first far-right party to win seats in Spain since the country’s return to democracy following the Franco dictatorship. Abascal has talked of a \u0027reconquest\u0027 of Spain – a reference to the long campaign against Moorish rule, which concluded in 1492 and also led to the expulsion of Spain’s Jews. Vox, which was formed by disgruntled PP members five years ago, has raged against \u0027supremacist feminism and gender totalitarianism\u0027, and the party has complained that existing domestic violence laws are unfairly weighted against men.If the manoeuvring and horse-trading fail to yield a government by 23 September, another general election will be held on 10 November.Although Spaniards are weary after voting in three general elections since December 2015, two recent polls suggest a repeat poll would benefit the PSOE.A survey for El Mundo found that the Socialists would again finish first, taking 145 of the 350 seats in congress – 22 more than they managed in April. Unidas Podemos, meanwhile, would win 40 seats, meaning the two parties would easily secure a majority.Another poll, for El Español, predicted the PSOE and Unidas Podemos would take 176 seats between them.The current impasse, however, does not bode well for a deal, and voter fatigue could cause a decrease in turnout.Sánchez came to power in June 2018 after using a vote of no confidence to turf the scandal-mired conservative People’s party (PP) out of office. The PP suffered its worst ever results in April’s election as its support collapsed and it lost 71 seats.The party’s corruption woes show no sign of abating. On Monday, a judge investigating illegal political financing summoned two former PP presidents of the Madrid region – Esperanza Aguirre and Cristina Cifuentes – to answer questions over alleged corruption.Another election could also hurt the centre-right Citizens party. The party, led by Albert Rivera, was leading the polls last year until it refused to back Sánchez’s no-confidence motion.Its liberal credentials have also been undermined by its decision to enlist the help of the far-right Vox party to take power in Andalucía and Madrid.El País’s poll predicts Citizens would drop from 57 seats to 34 in the event of another election, while El Español’s suggests it would lose 19 seats."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4006164.1567495869!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"teenager goes blind after years of no fruit or vegetables","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLack of fruit and vegetables in the diet can cause sight loss, according to research just published.A teenager has gone blind after several years of a diet completely lacking in fruit and vegetables, a medical journal has reported.Researchers from Bristol Eye Hospital said the boy first presented to his doctor aged 14, complaining of tiredness, according to a case report published in the Annals of Internal Medicine.Aside from being labelled a “fussy eater”, the Bristol boy took no medication and had a normal body mass index (BMI). Tests showed he had low vitamin B12 levels and macrocytic anaemia – a condition bringing larger-than-normal red blood cells.He was given B12 injections and dietary advice, but when he returned a year later he had developed some hearing loss and impaired vision, though still no cause was found.“By age 17, the patient’s vision had become progressively worse, to the point of blindness,” the report said.Investigating the boy’s nutrition, physicians found vitamin B12 and vitamin D deficiencies, a reduced bone mineral density, low levels of copper and selenium, and a high zinc level.“The patient confessed that since elementary school, he had avoided foods with certain textures and only ate French fries, Pringles, white bread, processed ham slices, and sausage,” the report said.“By the time his condition was diagnosed, the patient had permanently impaired vision.”The report cautioned that nutrition-related optic damage should always be considered by doctors finding any patient with unexplained vision symptoms.“The risks for poor cardiovascular health, obesity and cancer associated with junk food consumption are well known, but poor nutrition can also permanently damage the nervous system, particularly vision,” the report said.“It is rare in developed countries. The condition is potentially reversible if caught early. But if left untreated, it leads to permanent blindness.” – PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4005490.1567447108!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"we re cousins genetic map of britain and ireland shows common ancestry","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLead author Dr Edmund Gilbert, who is based at RCSI, said the work was helping understand the role of genetic variation in human disease. File photograph: Getty A complete genetic map of Britain and Ireland, generated by scientists for the first time, provides proof of common ancestry going back hundreds of years.The addition of a genetic map of Scotland by geneticists at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and the University of Edinburgh completed the data.The map identifies “genetic clusters” – common genetic characteristics in particular regions – using genomic analysis, and provides evidence of Ireland’s strong links to southwest Scotland and the Hebrides going back to the sixth century. All told, there are 43 distinct clusters identified across Britain and Ireland.The study provides scientific evidence of what is known from history, explained professor of human genetics at the RCSI School of Pharmacy and Bimolecular Sciences Gianpiero Cavalleri, but also is vital to identifying the emergence of genetic diseases in populations, and to perfecting treatments for the inidual after their personal “genetic variants” are factored in – this was indicated, for instance, in how epilepsy arises.“The discoveries made in this study illustrate from the perspective of DNA, the shared history of Britain, Ireland and other European regions. People are well aware of historical migrations between Scotland and Ireland but seeing this history come alive in the DNA is nonetheless remarkable,” he added.The study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Science on Monday, found strong genetic connections between the Scots and Norse Vikings. Moreover it sheds light on the Gaelic component to the Icelandic gene pool, including direct links to Ireland.The researchers investigated the DNA of more than 2,500 volunteers with extended ancestry from specific regions across Britain and Ireland. “The new data from Scotland means this is the first time the genetic map of the UK and the Republic of Ireland can be seen in its entirety,” said Prof Cavelleri.Scotland is ided into at least six clusters of genetically similar iniduals linked geographically the Borders, the southwest, the northeast, the Hebrides, Orkney and Shetland. The southwest and Hebrides “share particularly strong affinity for clusters of Irish ancestry”.These clusters are at similar locations to Dark Age kingdoms, such as Strathclyde, Pictland and Gododdin.“It is remarkable how long the shadows of Scotland’s Dark Age kingdoms are, given the massive increase in movement from the industrial revolution to the modern era. We believe this is largely due to the majority of people marrying locally and preserving their genetic identity,” said Prof Jim Wilson of the University of Edinburgh’s Usher Institute.The results suggest these kingdoms may have maintained regional identities that extend to the present day. The modern genetic landscape of Britain and Ireland also mirrors “splits in early languages”, classified as “Q-Celtic” (ie Scottish, Irish and Manx Gaelic) and “P-Celtic” (Welsh, Cumbric, Cornish, Old Brythonic and Pictish).Norse VikingsShetland is located between Norway and mainland Scotland and was found to harbour the largest proportion of Norwegian-related ancestry, a consequence of the Norse Viking migrations that began in the eighth century. Ancient settlers in Iceland shared the greatest genetic affinity with those on the western Isles of Scotland and the northwest of Ireland.Lead author Dr Edmund Gilbert, who is based at RCSI, said the work was helping understand the role of genetic variation in human disease.“Understanding the fine scale genetic structure of a population helps researchers better separate disease-causing genetic variation from that which occurs naturally in the British and Irish populations, but has little or no impact on disease risk,” he added.The collaboration illustrates how citizens can contribute to science.

Photograph: Jacob KingPA Wire When US vice-president Mike Pence touched down in Shannon on Monday, he was on familiar territory. The 48th vice-president of the United States has visited Ireland several times in a personal capacity.Like millions of Americans, Pence traces his lineage to Ireland. He was particularly close to his maternal grandfather, Richard Cawley, who emigrated from Tubbercurry, Co Sligo in 1923, settling in Chicago.Cawley married an Irish-American woman called Mary Maloney, whose family had emigrated from Doonbeg, Co Clare. Though Pence grew up in Indiana with his five siblings, he spent many holidays in Chicago with his grandparents.At the annual St Patrick’s Day breakfast at his residence earlier this year, Pence paid tribute to his grandfather. Standing alongside Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, he recalled how he thought about his grandfather when he was sworn in as vice-president.“People often ask me what I felt on Inauguration Day when I raised my right hand. As I looked out at that vast throng of Americans and took that oath, I thought about my grandpa. He was proud to be an American, but I can still hear that Irish brogue in my heart.”Like many Irish-Americans, Pence was raised in a Catholic family, but, as a young adult, he became an evangelical Christian. Religion appeared to start to play an increasingly important part in his life, while his politics also shifted right.Having studied law, he worked as an attorney, and as a conservative talk-show host in the 1990s. He ran unsuccessfully for a congressional seat twice, and was eventually elected to Congress to represent Indiana in the House of Representatives in 2000.Running mateAfter three terms in Washington he was elected governor of Indiana in 2013, a post he held until 2017 when he was picked by Donald Trump to become his running mate.Trump’s choice of Pence was a surprise, but was widely seen as an effort by the thrice-married New Yorker to prove his conservative credentials to the Republican base. Pence had established his reputation as a reliable conservative while in Washington and in the governor’s mansion in Indiana.“I was Tea Party before it was cool,” Pence said in 2011, a reference to the right-wing movement that emerged from Republicanism in the 2000s.During his time in Congress he opposed gay marriage and moves to extend rights to LGBT people, while he also advocated cutting funding for Planned Parenthood, a US abortion provider.But it was as governor of Indiana that his views attracted most controversy. In 2015, he signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which allowed businesses to act according to their religious beliefs. It was perceived by some as being a reaction to the introduction of same-sex marriage in the state in October 2014. Within weeks, an Indiana restaurant became the first business to announce it would not cater for a same-sex wedding, citing the law.There was a huge backlash from corporate America, with business titans such as Apple chief executive Tim Cook denouncing the move.Pence was forced to amend the act, and the controversy was expected to harm his re-election chances as governor, before he was named as Trump’s running mate, taking him out of the race.Pence has defended his stance, arguing that the act was not intended to discriminate against LGBT people. He has also distanced himself from allegations that he supports gay conversion therapy, following calls during his 2000 congressional campaign for federal money to be directed to groups that promoted “safe” sexual practices.Raised eyebrowsOther comments by the former governor have raised eyebrows.He once said he would not dine with a woman who was not his wife. He also told an interviewer in 2002 he does not consume alcohol at an event unless his wife is present.Over the past tumultuous 2½ years of the Trump presidency, Pence has successfully kept a relatively low profile. While the White House has seen an unprecedented churn of senior officials, the 60-year-old evangelical remains a steady and loyal figure in the Trump administration. He is often pictured at arm’s length from the president, a smiling, serene presence, just out of the foreground, a visual reminder of the delicate power dynamics that characterises the Trump-Pence relationship.As a former member, Pence is regularly dispatched to Congress to negotiate thorny legislative issues, from budget discussions to foreign policy votes.But, just as was the case for his predecessors, Pence is only one step away from the presidency.For many Democratic voters, the prospect of a Pence presidency, given his strongly conservative views, is just as alarming as four more years of Trump in the White House."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4006328.1567511216!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pence meets varadkar amid controversy over doonbeg stay","story":"US vice-president Mike Pence is greeted by President Michael D Higgins and his wife Sabina at Áras an Uachtaráin where Mr Pence and his wife Karen signed the visitors’ book before a meeting in the State Drawing Room.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar  and his partner Matthew Barrett  welcome US vice-president Mike Pence and Second Lady Karen Pence  to Famleigh House in Phoenix Park, Dublin. Photograph:  Paul Faith AFPUS vice-president Mike Pence has arrived in Dublin for the second leg of his visit to Ireland, amidst controversy about his decision to stay in President Trump’s Doonbeg golf course during his visit.Mr Pence was greeted by President Michael D Higgins and his wife Sabina at Áras an Uachtaráin on Tuesday morning where Mr Pence and his wife Karen signed the visitors’ book, before a meeting in the State Drawing Room.The US vice-president greeted the press before signing the guest book. He wrote: “In the memory of a great Irishman, Richard Michael Cawley (MrPence’s maternal grandfather) and on behalf of the United States of America — we are delighted to be back in Ireland.”Mr Pence and Mr Higgins were expected to discuss multilateral co-operation to address climate action, Brexit and its impact on Ireland as well as human rights and equality issues.Mr Pence and his wife Karen were greeted by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and his partner Matthew Barrett at the front door to Farmleigh, the Irish state guest house in Phoenix Park in Dublin, and exchanged pleasantries.Speaking to reporters travelling with Mr Pence about the decision to stay in Mr Trump’s property, the vice-president’s chief of staff Marc Short said that the Trump hotel was a facility that “could accommodate the team,” despite having to travel between Shannon and Dublin for the official elements of the trip which comprises meetings with the President, Taoiseach and US ambassador in Dublin.He said that Mr Trump had suggested that Mr Pence stay at the hotel, but he said it wasn’t a “request” or a “command.” “It was a suggestion.”He said that the decision to stay in Doonbeg had followed normal protocol and had gone through the State Department for sign off an approval.“If you’re going to stay in the Doonbeg area with a footprint of our size, that is the one facility that can accommodate that,” Mr Short said.Trump’s business interestsAsked if lower cost options had been considered, he replied: “We always explore lower cost options.”Mr Trump’s business interests have been a source of controversy since his election as president, with critics arguing that he could be in breach of the emoluments clause of the US constitution which prohibits US presidents from accepting any “present, emolument, office or title” from a foreign state or king while in office.Several cases have been taken in the United States against the president, focusing in particular on the decision by foreign governments to stay in Mr Trump’s Washington hotel, located close to the White House, when on official business.The potential conflicts of interest surrounding the US president surfaced in recent weeks after Mr Trump suggested that his resort in Miami could be used as the location for next year’s G7 summit.While the US is covering the accommodation and travel expenses for the vice-president’s visit, there will be logistical and security costs from the Irish end.It is estimated that the visit of President Trump in June cost millions of euro in garda security.Mr Pence is due to meet Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in the early afternoon in Farmleigh before attending a gathering at the US ambassador’s residence nearby in the Phoenix Park with business leaders. He will return to Shannon and Doonbeg later on Tuesday. – Additional reporting from PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4006145.1567512379!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hurricane dorian pounds relentlessly at bahamas","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA road is flooded during the passing of Hurricane Dorian in Freeport, Grand Bahama, Bahamas on Monday. Photograph: AP PhotoTim AylenHurricane Dorian came to a catastrophic day-long halt over the north-west Bahamas, flooding the islands of Abaco and Grand Bahama with walls of water.At least five people died and 21 injured people were airlifted to the capital by the US Coast Guard, Bahamas officials said.“We are in the midst of an historic tragedy,” prime minister Hubert Minnis said. “The devastation is unprecedented and extensive.”By Tuesday morning, the storm’s top sustained winds had dipped to 193kmh, making it a Category 3 hurricane, but it remained almost stationary. It was centred 25 miles north-east of Freeport — roughly the same distance from the city as at 9am on Monday. Hurricane-force winds extended out as far as 72kmh in some directions.“This is unprecedented,” said Jeff Masters, meteorology director at Weather Underground. “We’ve never had a Category 5 stall for so long in the Atlantic hurricane record.”Hundreds of thousands of people in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina were ordered to evacuate before the storm rolls up the eastern seaboard, bringing the possibility of life-threatening storm-surge flooding even if the storm’s heart stays offshore, as forecast.Several large airports announced closures and many flights were cancelled for Monday and Tuesday.Winds of 298kmhThe US Coast Guard airlifted at least 21 people injured on Abaco Island, which Dorian hit on Sunday with sustained winds of 298kmh and gusts up to 354kmh, a strength matched only by the Labour Day hurricane of 1935, before storms were named.Scientists say climate change generally has been fuelling more powerful and wetter storms and the only recorded storm more powerful than Dorian was Hurricane Allen in 1980, with 306kmh winds, though it did not make landfall at that strength.Abaco and Grand Bahama, neither much more than 12 metres above sea level at their highest points, are home to about 70,000 people.Bahamian officials said they received a “tremendous” number of calls from people in flooded homes.One radio station said it received more than 2,000 distress messages, including reports of a five-month-old baby stranded on a roof and a woman with six grandchildren who cut a hole in a roof to escape rising floodwaters. At least two designated storm shelters flooded.Dorian killed one person in Puerto Rico, at the start of its path through the Caribbean.Mr Minnis said many homes and buildings were severely damaged or destroyed, but it was too early to say how much the rebuilding effort would cost. Choppy brown floodwaters reached roofs and the top of palm trees on Monday.Parliament member Iram Lewis told The Associated Press his greatest fear was that waters would keep rising overnight and that stranded people would lose contact with officials as mobile phone batteries died.“It is scary,” he said, adding that Grand Bahama’s airport was six feet (almost two metres) underwater and that people were moving shelters as floodwaters kept surging.West-northwestThe US National Hurricane Centre said Dorian was expected to start moving slowly to the west-northwest overnight while continuing to pound Grand Bahama Island into the morning.The centre said the track would carry the storm “dangerously close to the Florida east coast late on Tuesday through Wednesday evening and then move dangerously close to the Georgia and South Carolina coasts on Wednesday night and Thursday”.While it was expected to stay offshore, meteorologist Daniel Brown cautioned that “only a small deviation” could draw the storm’s dangerous core towards land.By midnight local time (5am Irish time), the storm’s top sustained winds had dipped to 209kmh but it remained almost stationary. It was centred 40km north-east of Freeport.A mandatory evacuation of entire South Carolina coast took effect on Monday covering about 830,000 people.Georgia Governor Brian Kemp ordered mandatory evacuations for that state’s Atlantic coast, also starting at noon on Monday.Authorities in Florida also ordered some mandatory evacuations. – AP"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons september 2019matt cartoon september 3","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Order The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Brexit latest news: Boris Johnson could use \u0026#39nuclear option\u0026#39 of expelling Philip Hammond  if he rebels in tonight’s crucial votePapuan independence protests continue after alleged shooting of three studentsComment: With a Brexit election brewing, why are Labour Remainers so coy about facing the people?Santa Cruz boat: 25 confirmed dead and nine unaccounted for after fire broke outHurricane Dorian thrashes Bahamas and kills at least five as it barrels towards USDoctors accuse SNP of complacency as consultant and nurse vacancies in Scottish NHS rise to record levelRoyal Marines veteran sparks French ire for abandoning rowing machine up Mont Blanc in charity climbHS2 could be delayed by seven years and cost £22 billion more than forecast, says head of firm behind itIran oil tanker at centre of diplomatic row with UK \u0026#39goes dark\u0026#39 off Syria after being released by GibraltarComment: All the Great British Bake Off series ranked, from worst to bestTeenager \u0026#39first in UK\u0026#39 to go deaf and blind due to junk food diet, report reveals\u0026#39A snap election is inevitable\u0026#39 -  readers on what Boris Johnson needs to do to deliver BrexitMoney launderer who claimed he had won lottery 123 times forced to pay back £470,000 Welcome to Welford Park: the stunning Berskshire location where The Great British Bake Off is filmedMichel Barnier wrong to say EU will not shift ground on Irish backstop, says Stephen BarclayFive Star Movement supporters vote on whether to form government with old enemyDuke of Sussex defends private jet use saying it\u0026#39s essential for his family\u0026#39s safetyComment: Boris Johnson has cleverly laid the groundwork for a \u0026#39Parliament v the people\u0026#39 electionHow a battered trunk unlocked my family\u0026#39s Holocaust secrets We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 3 september 2019","story":"A striking red yacht slices through a serene Arctic landscape punctuated by craggy glaciers.

Users will be able to switch it on and off directly from the Quick Settings menu.Arguably the biggest change to Android 10’s design is the removal of the back button. Alongside the Home and app tabs buttons at the bottom of the screen, the back button has been a stable of the Android OS since its inception.\u0026nbspIn its place comes a gesture-based method of navigation, which requires users to swipe the screen from the left or right to go back, depending on the settings.As with any major change, the removal of the back button is likely to prove isive among long-term Android users.\u0026nbspGoogle appeared to accidentally reveal the release date of Android 10 in August, when two separate customer support agents let slip its arrival during online chats with customers.When asked when the new operating system would be rolled out for the Google Pixel 3a smartphone, both agents said it would arrive on 3 September, 2019.AFPGetty Images)Google does not officially comment on rumour or speculation, however Android updates suggest it will first be launched on Google’s Pixel range of smartphones.It is expected that all versions of the Pixel, Pixel 2 and Pixel 3 will be the first to receive the new mobile operating system, despite the fact the original Pixel phone is outside of Google’s stated two-year support window.Other manufacturers that make use of Android, such as Samsung and Sony, will then receive the new OS in the coming weeks and months.\u0026nbspBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The next leg of the journey involves something we’ve always been interested in: the connection between our associates and our customers.”The behind-the-scenes app is called R-World and it is highly useful. First there’s a section called TB Inspo, short for Thomas Burberry Inspiration, which has information about the store that\u0026nbspthe sales associates use. “The sales associates have played an important part in developing aspects of the way the app has grown,” Morris says. “So, there are certain features and functionality that we have, which we just wouldn’t have thought of ourselves as a central product team.”“Well, certainly in TB Inspo we didn’t think the daily news component was very important. And the associates told us ‘No, you absolutely need that.’ When we introduced it, associates’ usage increased dramatically. And it’s not that that information wasn’t available elsewhere, it was, but just not in a way that was easy for them to engage with. So suddenly, with something that looks kind of like an Instagram feed, you can just look, engage for a minute each morning and learn three key things.”R-World is also a stock management tool. Associates can launch a camera function in the app to scan barcodes on a scarf or a trenchcoat and instantly discover what the stock levels are, plus in which of the multiple storerooms the stock is. No longer does an associate keep a customer waiting while searching through more than a dozen distant rooms.“Stock management can be quite difficult as an associate, when people are asking things for you, you’re hunting back of house, it’s not very easy. Having a scanning functionality that works in low light conditions and has live information means you’re able to spend more face time with the customer. If an associate is gone for 10 minutes, then then they’ve broken the moment. Things like that make that core relationship more seamless.”The R-World app also lets associates check client details and sends a birthday email, if the customer has been happy to share their date of birth.R-Message is a messaging component, you’ll be unsurprised to hear, that is going live now for customers in the Manchester store and to be rolled out to other stores. It’ll appear in the regular Burberry consumer app, but only for selected customers, based partly on spend and purchase frequency. It means that sales associates will be able to send messages to the chosen clients in a personal and direct way.So, an associate could follow up on a sale with a message asking how the purchase worked out and offering a few other options, building what Burberry calls a digital rail of images that the customer can choose from. It all appears seamlessly in the app and the customer can buy any item directly if they wish. The texting that happens is as sophisticated as in other apps, showing when the customer or associate has read the message and so on.Apple worked in depth with Burberry’s app development team to help create both the customer and staff-focused apps, as it does with many companies. Its experts are available to businesses of any size, who can ask for advice about mobile strategy, building apps and more. Apple also publishes two books aimed at enterprise, available without charge to help get customers started.Apple’s work with Burberry was also free of charge. Sure, it doesn’t hurt that Burberry has bought a large number of iPhones from Apple – every sales associate has one to use, for instance – but it remains an impressive level of help.Apple works with companies such as SAP, IBM, Cisco and more to create ways of helping organisations build and distribute apps. The Burberry apps use SAP – and since more than three quarters of global transactions involve an SAP system, you can see why. SAP and Apple jointly created the SAP Cloud Platform SDK for iOS as a way of rapidly building apps.Apple releases strange new iPhone updateMorris recognises, though, that for all this help, it’s down to Burberry to assess just how to use the app, to make sure the associates aren’t, say, getting in touch too often.“Generally, people are fondly disposed to what they see as a luxury company. The relationship is important to them. But you shouldn’t be expecting people to interact with you every day.I think with tools like this, it’s working out what the right frequency is to speak to people. So, I think if you start with your top tier customer, this is someone that’s engaged with you, the associates here will already be talking with them on the phone and other mediums. This just gives them more ability to manage that in a seamless way. But I do think that this is about augmenting the human connection. It will be that balance of the Associate who has the relationship with this person and then has the right information we can put into their hands to help them manage those tasks.”It’s early days, then, and the app, and how it’s used, will change with time. As Morris says, “I think we’ll just have to see how it develops because it’s personalised and it’s about that inidual relationship. So, I think we’ll learn what the right balance is as we develop.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Market analysts have previously predicted that bitcoin will reach record highs if the UK leaves the European Union without a deal.Economic turmoil in Argentina, combined with an escalating trade war between the US and China, also helped to bolster bitcoin’s price, according to\u0026nbspMarcus\u0026nbspSwanepoel, CEO of cryptocurrency firm\u0026nbspLuno.“After lacklustre trading over the weekend, bitcoin went against the market trend yesterday, quickly breaking through the $10,000 level and reaching $10,500,” Swanepoel told\u0026nbspThe Independent.“Today the focus will be on Europe and the Brexit developments in the UK, as well as the deepening crisis in Argentina.

It has nearly trebled in price since the start of the year but still remains a long way of its record price of close to $20,000, which it hit in late 2017.The prospect of an economically damaging Brexit, together with increased trade tariffs between the world’s two largest economies, has helped contribute to bitcoin’s resurgent price.China’s state-backed cryptocurrency could displace banksSome investors are even beginning to see the cryptocurrency as a safe-haven asset, similar to gold.This is thanks to its finite supply – only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist – and the fact it relies on a borderless and decentralised infrastructure that is less prone to the effects of a single country or market.Nicholas Gregory, CEO of blockchain firm CommerceBlock, recently told\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspthat bitcoin had “rediscovered its mojo” in 2019 thanks to an increasingly unstable global economy.“A no-deal Brexit could see a massive and unprecedented breakout,” he said.“Not only will a no-deal departure from the EU create turmoil and volatility across two major fiat currencies, it will also trigger an identity crisis for the global system as the contingency and vulnerability of major global fiat currencies is laid bare.”\u0026nbspBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Any reading below 50 indicates decline.IHS Markit, which compiles the monthly survey, said production had been stifled by “political uncertainty”\u0026nbspand “global trade tensions”.New orders fell steeply across consumer goods industries, with manufacturers linking the slump to weaker domestic and global economic conditions, low market confidence,\u0026nbspand Brexit concerns.The amount of export trade also fell at the fastest rate for seven years, with some firms reporting that EU-based clients were “routeing supply chains away from the UK” due to Brexit.

Investment continued to peter out and heightened concerns about the UK’s political situation and the strength of the global economy acted as a drag on activity.“As Brexit planning intensifies, some firms were resorting to more inventory building whilst others were unravelling their stocks. With some supplies impacted by port delays and poor supplier performance, a creeping dread is descending on the sector that there will be more of these obstacles to come.”Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, said: “The current high degree of market uncertainty, both at home and abroad, and currency volatility will need to reduce significantly if UK manufacturing is to make any positive strides towards recovery in the coming months.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The statement effectively says: Mr Gove your pants are well and truly on fire. You might struggle to get replacements given the mess you and your colleagues propose to create at UK ports, too.\u0026nbspNow, trade bodies exist to lobby for their industries. Part of that involves them making noise, and providing cover for their members by saying things they are reluctant to say themselves.\u0026nbspBut their statements tend to be tempered by the fact that they also like to maintain good relationships with government for the purposes of doing the all-important behind-the-scenes business.\u0026nbspWhat prompted the BRC to more or less abandon this and take the gloves off in such a fierce manner?\u0026nbspUK retail sales fall sharply, adding to recession fearsRetail sales over past year weakest on record, survey showsUK retail sales slide for third consecutive month in July – CBI surveyPartly it was born of frustration.\u0026nbspThe BRC has done a lot of work on the impact of no deal across the retail industry, with a view to assisting its members who will have to deal with it. Needless to say, it doesn’t like what it sees. It doesn’t like it at all.\u0026nbspThe work has been hampered by a huge number of unknowns faced by its members. What will the tariff schedule for goods coming in ultimately look like? How long will the delays at customs be? Will hauliers be willing to send trucks to the UK during the initial chaos when it might pay them to look for work elsewhere?\u0026nbspOctober is a particularly bad time for this to occur for food retailers because there are lots of things the UK can’t grow in the autumn. If you want tomatoes, you’d best get your tins in.\u0026nbspThere is also an issue with EU migrant labour. Workers from this pool pack and clean incoming produce. We now know that free movement won’t end on 31 October\u0026nbspafter all. But will that labour hang around, given the growing list of problems with the “settled status” created for them?The problem that organisations like the BRC face is that raising issues like these ones with government isn’t getting them\u0026nbspanywhere, either in public or behind the scenes.\u0026nbspBoris Johnson’s administration isn’t listening to anyone other than its own extremists. It it is playing a deadly game of poker with the British people and British business. Governing doesn’t seem to matter to it.\u0026nbspThere is one final calculation at work in the BRC getting its punches in now: the blame game. The statement confers upon the BRC the right to say: “See, we told you so. We raised all these issues, we did the work and yet you ignored us.”Johnson and co will do their utmost to try to deflect being called to account for their actions in the aftermath of a no-deal outcome. Some £100m is being splurged on the “get ready” campaign with that in mind. The intention seems to be for ministers to claim that they warned business but weren’t listened to. The BRC’s statement makes clear that this won’t wash. Retailers have already done their utmost. They’re still at it. They are stockpiling where they can. They are working with their suppliers. They have carefully reviewed their supply chains.\u0026nbspThey have, in other words, done everything they can given the unknowns they face.\u0026nbspHowever much Mr Gove and his colleagues twist and turn, any shortages, any foul-ups, will be on them and them alone.\u0026nbspAnd they must be called to account.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Anything below 50 indicates that the sector is contracting. Similar figures for construction and the UK’s dominant services sector\u0026nbspwill follow later this week.\u0026nbspTo put it in context, these are the worst numbers in seven years.PMI survey reveals biggest slide in UK construction output since 2009UK manufacturing suffers sharpest contraction in over six years – PMIServices growth falls for first time since September The assumption in the City was that, with Britain’s car plants having ended the temporary shutdowns imposed ahead of the last no deal Brexit cliff edge in the Spring, there would be a modest improvement. That it hasn’t happened looks ominous.\u0026nbspBut, but, but look at Germany, tends to be the stock response of Brexiteers when confronted with figures like this. This is a cynical attempt to deflect attention from the problems they have created and the damage they are doing to the economy.\u0026nbspIt is, however, quite true that the figures were also\u0026nbspimpact by a generally chilly economic climate.The global \u0026nbsppicture is not a pretty one\u0026nbspand it is affecting manufacturers across the Western world including, yes, Germany.\u0026nbspBut I would draw your attention to a very good point in response to the figures\u0026nbspmade by Simon French, the chief economist at broker Panmure Gordon.\u0026nbspHe says that while it is true that the 7-year low in UK manufacturing is generally in line with the (weak) global picture, EU and Chinese PMI numbers have started to stabilise in stark contrast to the UK (and the US) which are still trending downwards.\u0026nbspIn economics, the trend is just as important as the bare numbersWhich, of course, brings us to back Brexit, and the uncertainty it is wreaking. It inevitably serves to make a shaky global situation worse for British industry and the people who work in it. Behind the numbers are real people with real livelihoods which are under threat. That should not be forgotten.Created with Sketch.

It takes two of these in a row to tick that particular boxAt\u0026nbspthe moment, it’s a little early to be speculating. It’s worth noting that the PMIs are heavily influenced by sentiment and while they are often a good pointer, the picture they paint isn’t always reflected in the official GDP data.Manufacturing is also dwarfed by services in the UK. You can expect the PMIs for the latter to be very closely watched.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Investment continued to peter out and heightened concerns about the UK’s political situation and the strength of the global economy acted as a drag on activity.“As Brexit planning intensifies, some firms were resorting to more inventory building whilst others were unravelling their stocks. With some supplies impacted by port delays and poor supplier performance, a creeping dread is descending on the sector that there will be more of these obstacles to come.”Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, said: “The current high degree of market uncertainty, both at home and abroad, and currency volatility will need to reduce significantly if UK manufacturing is to make any positive strides towards recovery in the coming months.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The plant, which makes steels used in electrical transmission, had been up for sale since May 2018.Henrik Adam, chief executive of Tata’s European operations, said: “This is necessary, enabling us to focus our resources, including investment, on our core business and markets, helping\u0026nbspus build a long-term sustainable future in Europe.“Continuing to fund substantial losses at Orb Electrical Steels is not sustainable at a time when the European steel industry is facing considerable challenges.

The Canadian site, which employees nearly 300 people,\u0026nbspis to\u0026nbspbe bought by Japanese firm JFE Shoji. The smaller Swedish plant, which has 100 staff and manufactures advanced steel for electrical vehicles,\u0026nbspis to be retained by Tata.But the company said its Newport factory had been “loss-making for several years” as it struggled to compete in a fast-moving market “in which customer requirements have outstripped the site’s capability”. Converting the factory to produce steel for electrical vehicles would cost more than £50m, Tata added.An\u0026nbspengineering steels service centre in Wolverhampton is also set\u0026nbspto close after Tata was unable to find a buyer. Up to 26 jobs are at risk, including at a sales office in Bolton.British Steel subsidiary sold to French firm, protecting 400 jobsSteelworkers trade union Community called the closures “devastating” and urged the government to intervene. Union leaders believe Tata had committed to safeguarding jobs as part of a 2017 rescue deal under which workers accepted reduced pension benefits.Roy Rickhuss, Community general secretary, said: “This is shocking news, which makes a mockery of the understanding we reached with Tata around the jobs guarantee. There has been no consultation about this proposal either at UK or European level and company management should hang their heads in shame in the way this has come about.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when the government wants to decarbonise the economy and support a switch to electric vehicles, losing the UK’s only producer of electrical steels would be a grave error.”Jessica Morden, MP for Newport East, said the closure of the plant was “tragic”.

As more such constellations arrive in space, the danger will be vastly increased and will not be able to solved by\u0026nbspmanoeuvring out of the way.The move was forced after ESA\u0027s experts in space debris found that there was a high risk of collision between the two active satellites. They found that it would be safer for the ESA satellite, known as\u0026nbspAeolus, to increase its altitude so that it could fly over the dangerous constellation.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month - August 2019 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.When stars like the Sun grow advanced in age, they expand and glow red.

Soon after they had been calculated to potentially crash, the satellite phoned home as usual and send down the science data it had collected, assuring engineers that the collision had been avoided.SpaceX launches Boeing-made satellite into orbitAt the moment, ESA says such manoeuvres are very rare between active satellites. For the most part, satellites have to move out of the path of dead satellites or pieces left over from previous collisions.But space agencies including ESA have repeatedly warned that megaconstellations such as those sent into space by Starlink could pose a vastly increased danger. Those constellations are projected to include thousands of satellites.When there is such a high degree of danger, it will become impossible for engineers to manually spot potential collisions and move satellites out of their way.Instead, ESA plans to make this process automatic, relying on artificial intelligence to move satellites out of danger.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The lander has to shut down throughout the day because its parts could be damaged by the heat of the Sun when it comes directly overhead.As that was happening, one of the team members spotted something strange in one of the panoramic photographs sent back by Yutu-2. They postponed the rover\u0027s nap and instead drove it to the crater to examine it.It was there that they\u0026nbspfound that it was a shining substance that stood out from the soil around it.

Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke).

The Canadian site, which employees nearly 300 people,\u0026nbspis to\u0026nbspbe bought by Japanese firm JFE Shoji. The smaller Swedish plant, which has 100 staff and manufactures advanced steel for electrical vehicles,\u0026nbspis to be retained by Tata.But the company said its Newport factory had been “loss-making for several years” as it struggled to compete in a fast-moving market “in which customer requirements have outstripped the site’s capability”. Converting the factory to produce steel for electrical vehicles would cost more than £50m, Tata added.An\u0026nbspengineering steels service centre in Wolverhampton is also set\u0026nbspto close after Tata was unable to find a buyer. Up to 26 jobs are at risk, including at a sales office in Bolton.British Steel subsidiary sold to French firm, protecting 400 jobsSteelworkers trade union Community called the closures “devastating” and urged the government to intervene. Union leaders believe Tata had committed to safeguarding jobs as part of a 2017 rescue deal under which workers accepted reduced pension benefits.Roy Rickhuss, Community general secretary, said: “This is shocking news, which makes a mockery of the understanding we reached with Tata around the jobs guarantee. There has been no consultation about this proposal either at UK or European level and company management should hang their heads in shame in the way this has come about.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when the government wants to decarbonise the economy and support a switch to electric vehicles, losing the UK’s only producer of electrical steels would be a grave error.”Jessica Morden, MP for Newport East, said the closure of the plant was “tragic”. She added: “This is devastating news for the highly skilled workforce and their families. The Orb steelworks has been at the heart of Newport community since 1898.“What is particularly tragic is that this the only UK plant with the potential to produce electric steels for motors and with investment, vision and government backing this could be the key part of the supply chain for electric vehicles.”The government said the closure was “a commercial decision for Tata” but it would remain “in regular contact with the company, unions and other partners throughout this process”.Last week a subsidiary of British Steel, which collapsed in May, was bought by French-owned Systra Group\u0026nbspin deal which protected 400 jobs in York.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

With the connivance of the Speaker John Bercow, they will almost certainly succeed.Having gained this power, they will set about binding Boris Johnson’s hands. They will try to legislate to ensure this country cannot leave the European Union without a deal.Do they have the numbers to pull this off  Probably, yes.The ranks of Tory rebels have been swelled by the arrival of former Cabinet ministers such as Philip Hammond and David Gauke, and the Government’s decision to prorogue Parliament means that plans to wait until the end of September to act have been dropped.One former minister says the “prorogation scandal has tipped things over the edge”.If they have the numbers, do they have the time  This is more doubtful.No’s decision to prorogue Parliament means they would have to get a bill through both Houses in just over a week. With Bercow’s help, it will be possible for them to rush it through the Commons quickly. But it will be much harder to do that in the Lords.One Brexit-backing former Secretary of State tells me: “Our lot down there will do their best to talk it out.”Eventhe rebels can get a bill passed, the Government’s actions this week are designed to show that they won’t simply comply with it. They want the rebels to think they can’t succeed unless they change the government. “The aim is to force a binary choice between Corbyn and our Brexit plan,” is how one of those at the heart of things explains it.Those close to Boris Johnson believe this is their best chance of getting things through. They calculate that, ultimately, the Commons will not be prepared to take the risk of making Jeremy Corbyn prime minister.This is a high-risk manoeuvre. But so far, the thought of putting Corbyn in No even temporarily has proved too much for all but a couple of the Tory rebels.At the same time, Boris is trying to reassure Tory MPs that he really is trying for a deal. I understand that next week, Amber Rudd — the Work and Pensions Secretary who campaigned for Remain in  — will join with him as part of an effort to persuade Tory MPs not to back the rebel legislation, and to give him time to secure a deal.I am told she was “disappointed” by his decision to prorogue but remains convinced he is genuine about getting a deal and that the EU will offer concessionsParliament backs the Government next week.The biggest problem with the extension the rebels want is they can’t say what it is for. The reason is they can’t agree on what its purpose should be: Many want to stop Brexit altogether, others just to block No Deal.An extension without a purpose would do nothing but prolong the uncertainty and keep this country in limbo. It is time to get on with it.Why, because No think most voters just want Brexit done, so they want to be talking about the public’s priorities.They think they win whenever Boris is seen on the news discussing these issues. The polls suggest the PM is having some success with this approach. One Secretary of State puts the current Tory poll lead down to BoJo being: “Very effective at giving them hope of a non-Brexit dominated world.”Of course, another reason why the PM wants to keep hammering home his domestic priorities is that we are going to end up having a general election in the next few months.l IN another sign that a general election is coming, I am informed that the Scottish Tories will not select their new leader until AFTER such a poll.The decision to stick with an interim leader following Ruth Davidson’s resignation suggests the  hierarchy north of the border doesn’t think there is  time to have a proper leadership contest before any general election.We will clearly all be heading to the polling station sooner, rather than later.ANY Tory MP who votes for the extension legislation next week will not be allowed to stand as a Tory candidate at the next election.I understand No have decided to treat next week’s votes as they would a confidence vote, with anyone not backing the Government being immediately disqualied from standing for the party again. They hope this will keep some Tory waverers in the Government lobby next week.It would mean thatformer Cabinet ministers such as Philip Hammond voted for the legislation, as they intend to, they would be barred from standing for the party again, ending their time as Tory MPs.  It is hard to think of a precedent for so many Tories going from being Cabinet ministers to being ineligible to stand for the party.This upping of the stakes will certainly have an effect on some Tory MPs. There will be those who are reluctant to end their careers in the party over this issue.This approach is not without risk, though. There is a danger  MPs will still rebel  then decide  they have nothing left to lose, increasing not only the chances of them voting down the Government in a no-confidence vote, but also backing an alternative prime minister.Currently, only about ten per cent of Home Office grants to charities go to those with an income of less than £million a year, compared to the sixty-odd per cent which goes to those with an income of £million plus a year.The new Home Secretary, Priti Patel, has been impressed by the efforts of charities such as OnSide, which work to keep kids off the street.One ally of the Home Secretary says that more police and greater stop and search powers are, “only one side of the coin”,  in terms of dealing with kne crime and that “there are lots of kids with nothing to do and that’s a big reason so many are falling in with the wrong crowd and getting into trouble.“There are some great small charities out there giving them a purpose beyond a le of crime, and they deserve more support.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Now, though, there is -hour access.Another news story this week revealed that nine out of ten teens aren’t getting enough sleep or exercise. It doesn’t take a genius to link the two issues.Social media — and reality TV — also reveal a new emphasis on appearance that has changed so much in the past  years, for adults as well as children. It’s just that children are more susceptible to that pressure.Other things have changed too — not least our approach to parenting . We are much more child-focused, which isn’t a bad thing necessarily.But telling our kids they are the best, no matter what they do, risks them thinking they are the best without doing anything at all to be so.Yes, we can help boost our children’s self-esteem. But what we should really do is help them boost their own self-esteem by doing things that make them feel good about themselves.Obviously, more families now have two parents in the workplace. That is a good thing but perhaps some working parents feel the need to compensate for their absence in ways — such as too many screens and “treats” — that aren’t necessarily brilliant for their children’s mental health.I write as a mother of two who worked more or less throughout my children’s young lives.I’m proud to say we all made it through in one piece.Obviously, I am no parenting expert. And I’m not claiming to have the answer to the world’s ills.But over the years, I’ve identied three golden rules I believe build a foundation for happy kids.The first is sport. I passionately believe that being part of a team, having regular exercise, being out and about and maintaining a routine offers kids stability and boundaries.It helps children feel good about their bodies and their abilities, boosting their self-esteem.The second is friendship. I am talking about proper friendship — not Facebook “friends” you never meet. When kids leave their phones at home and develop real friendships, they find people they can talk to and have fun with.Never underestimate the importance of fun. The third golden rule is probably the most important. Keep talking.There are too many tragic examples recently of young people who felt it necessary to take their own lives. I believe a problem shared is a problem halved. No matter how bad something is, talking always helps.I don’t remember ever reading about suicide when I was younger — especially not suicide in young people. Now it is the biggest cause of death among people aged  to  and it affects three times more men than women. That is a scary statistic.The causes are complicated but we need to keep channels of communication open with our kids. That way,they are unhappy, we will know about it. Andwe know about it, we at least have the potential to help.Remember Alfie Patten  For a while, in , he was known as the nation’s youngest father at the age of just .Then he found out, later that year, that it was another boy who had made his -year-old girlfriend pregnant. So Alfie was off the hook.That should have left him with the feeling that he had dodged a bullet.It could have spurred him on towards getting a good education and a job, to building himself a future.The adults in his le should have encouraged him to do just that.Instead, this week he turned up at Lewes Crown Court to be sentenced after being convicted of criminal damage.The court heard he is now a jobless alcoholic who lives at home with his mother and has a history of criminal offences.He already had a -month suspended prison sentence hanging over his head after being convicted on June  of shoplting, theft and possession of an imitation firearm.This is a good reminder that suspended sentences do not work. Alfie Patten clearly needs a bigger wake-up call than a suspended sentence or he risks ending up dead from alcohol and drugs.I saw a bench in my local park the other day that said: “Die with memories . . .  not dreams.”So true. But this guy, who is creating all the wrong sorts of memories, is a nightmare.Well, I don’t know about you but I am filled with relief that the heatwave – and even summer – is over.The cooler weather is perfect timing for going back to school and back to work, so we can all concentrate again. Hot weather is great when you are lying around in swimwear next to a pool . . .  notyou are sitting in a classroom or office.I  loved the photos of Dame Joan Collins, , lined up with the other stars of the Charlotte Tilbury makeup campaign.What a lady. Joan, is classy, funny and damn stylish. Or as my nan would’ve said, well turned out.Another day, another story about taxpayers’ money being wasted in foreign aid.This week it emerged that classrooms in nearly  schools in Pakistan – paid for by us – have been closed because they were badly built and unsafe.The buildings were erected as part of a £million aid project and their closure has left , children taking lessons outdoors or in overcrowded rooms.So, presumably, back where they were in the first place. On the upside, this has prompted some MPs to call for an inquiry about how our annual foreign aid budget – around £billion – is spent.On the downside, this is an example of yet more foreign aid money that has fallen into the wrong hands and ended up being wasted.In the meantime, British schools are crying out for investment.So why are we spending money on Pakistani schools and not our own Meanwhile, in the UK, overseas patients have left the NHS with more than £million in unpaid bills for treatment, it emerged this week. That cash could pay for , nurses, , heart bypasses or nearly , junior doctors.Two London hospitals are owed £million each, including almost £, from one patient alone.Apparently staff are reluctant to chase payments, with doctors’ leaders saying their obligation to charge overseas patients is “racist” and deters vulnerable groups from seeking help.To me, that sounds completely bonkers.I don’t understand why you are not asked to produce your NHS number – we all have one – when you get to hospital.Every other country asks, so why not us It’s a national service, not an international one.Former Big Brother contestant Kate Lawler is campaigning to remove the taboo facing women who don’t want children.She said she considers her two dogs, Baxter and Shirley, as her family and she’s very content with that.She’s right, of course. Whether or not you want children comes down to personal choice and it should be fine for women not to want them.The only problem with her situation, though, is that her fiancé is “desperate” for children, which doesn’t sound so good.I think the most important thing when choosing whether or not to have kids with someone is the pair of you both being on the same page. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He described the object as m long, pink, shaped like a pig with  rotors on the back.“Given the reporter’s description of the object, the Board initially wondered whether this was a vexatious time-wasting report and so contacted the reporter to confirm the details.“However, the reporter was adamant that he had momentarily seen a large pink object with rotors that had appeared to be in formation, and that he had perceived that it had then accelerated ahead. “The report said that the pilot had described the pig as being on his left and close to Pocklington airfield, therefore suggesting he may have “mistaken another aircraft as being closer to his than was actually the case.”It added: “Other than that, perhaps the sighting was an advertising blimp that had broken its moorings, or a toy balloon of some sort that he had encountered and perceived to have accelerated away.“Whichever, the Board could not positively determine the nature of the unknown object.”A spokesman for the Wolds Gliding Club which is based at Pocklington airfield said that the aircraft involved was not from the club.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The message is clear: Useful work is no longer done here.If Remainer MPs block Boris Johnson’s Brexit plan this week, we should place similar signs around the Palace of Westminster.Parliamentarians will have turned the place into a toxic waste ground which no longer fulfils a decent .It will have become an eyesore, a municipal liability, an assembly which no longer represents its voters and has become a poisonous threat to them. It will stand as sad testament to the misjudgement of its management in latter days.If Speaker John Bercow, former Chancellor Philip Hammond and other dead-set Remainers such as Sir Keir Starmer refuse to enact the  referendum result, the British Parliament — supposedly the fount of modern parliamentary democracy — will have lost its centuries-old claim to give voice to the people. The consequences of that would be enormous.The word “Parliament”, first used in these islands in the early s, comes from the French “parler” .The th Century Parliament was where leading men of England could let the king know how they felt about his laws and taxes. Kings did not always take much notice but the principle was established: That the people of England would be heard by their ruler.Over the ages, the people slowly became the boss. Until now.Sometimes you will hear the Commons derided as a talking-shop but that, correctly, is what it is. Talking can prevent violence.There is a reason modern heads of government are not, by and large, stabbed in their beds like poor King Duncan in Shakespeare’s Macbeth.That reason has been the parliamentary process and the comforting knowledge that when push came to shove, parliamentarians would be on our side.Our side, please note. Not on the side of rival countries.There developed a quiet understanding that on issues of conscience , MPs need not slavishly follow their constituents. They were not quite delegates.But as representatives, they would be expected to follow broadly the sympathies of their electors and the policies of their parties. Otherwise they could just lie at election time then do the opposite once they had won their seats in the Commons.In his address outside  Downing Street last night, Boris left people in no doubt of his intentions to see us out of the EU after October .But when MPsto the Commons this afternoon, you will hear Remainers complain that “Parliament has been bypassed” in the Brexit process. This is tommyrot.As can happen in modern politics, it is the very opposite of the truth. I’m afraid they’re lying. They are ignoring you — the electorate — and they think you are too busyto notice.The EU referendum in  was set up by the Commons.The Commons approved the Article  process under which we told Brussels we were off. All well and good.David Cameron would not have won the  election had he not promised a referendum.Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn would not have attracted millions of votes in the  election had they not promised to respect the Leave result.But now that our departure is imminent, Remainer extremists such as Hammond, Bercow, Gauke, Grieve, Soubryplan to try to stop it.They have already bent the rules doing so and will possibly do so again today.Please, guys: Spare us any bleating about “constitutional outrages” by Boris. Your behaviour has been far worse.These swivel-eyed Europhiles have decided that the Leave vote of  — the biggest exercise in British electoral history — must be neutralised.The plebs got it wrong. Computer does not recognise. Reboot time. All past data has been lost.Just look at that warped figure Tony Blair, who treated Parliament with open contempt when he was PM.Yesterday he was throwing up his soft hands in horror at the idea of a new General Election to break the Westminster deadlock. He opposes an election because he knows it could result in a big win for an on-fire Boris. All this from the same Tony Blair whose regime helped kill hundreds of thousands of Iraqis in the name of, er, democracy.Instead, Blair wants a second referendum, whose wording would be decidedby the current, pro-EU, electorate-defying Parliament.We used to laugh at communist assemblies in countries such as North Korea, which were stuffed full of identikit dummies.We mocked minnows such as Ireland, which were forced by Brussels to re-run referendums that produced “wrong” results.We thought our democracy was more authentic because Parliament was connected to its constituents and because our politicians accepted the electorate’s verdict.We won’t be able to make such boastsWestminster’s Remainers have their way.What is the point of a parliamentit ignores the electorate  None. Many of these Remainer MPs seem readier to take their cue from Twitter users than from their own voters.

They’re not all “champions”, or possibly even the best each respective part of the Cowell empire has to offer.That goose was cooked the moment SuBo, Diversity, Dennis Egeland almost everyone  with a signicant career or talent declined to appear.There was a certain curiosity value to BGT: The Champions, though, I’ll admit, as it featured several performers doing the one thing everyone in their country should arguably be forbidden from even attempting.Indian salsa, Ukrainian sand-painting, Australian stand-up comedy, Indonesian magic, British dog dancing.This last one was  winner Ashleigh Butlerwho began by revealing that, moments before Pudsey died: “He lted his head and had a little look at me.That was him saying ‘Goodbye’.” Or  him saying: “You’ll be going through the same motions, with some hyperactive little impostor, in two years’ time, mark my words.”I got the impression everyone  at the show thought it might just be “a bit too soon”, as well, which may not entirely explain The Champions’ in-built British bias.But the line-up was certainly front-loaded with other familiar faces, Paul Potts, Boogie Storm and Connie Talbot, who’s doubled in size since we last saw her, with Piers Morgan, in . So’s Piers Morgan, for that matter.The great unknown factors were the foreign acts, though, who proved to be a pretty forgettable bunch apart from America’s “comic daredevil” Bello Nock, whose wheel of death t***tery, with daughter Annaliese, was almost as terrying as his appearance,which was described perfectly, by David Walliams, as “Jedward’s dad”.It was certainly enough to hypnotise the Wembley arena audience into voting him the winner.If all this exotica and the set were designed to make us think we were watching something on the scale of Eurovision, though, it failed. The Champions is nothing like as good.Nor is it even as original as Going For Gold, with Henry Kelly, for the simple reason BGT has been welcoming foreign acts for years.All this adds up to is Britain’s Got Talent minus the best bit, the auditions. We also don’t get a chance to vote, either.That came down to a golden buzzer Amanda Holden went for the Ukrainian sandpainter and the arena vote for Bello Nock.Quite something, isn’t it, when we can’t even win such a heavily loaded show and, I have to tell you, Paul Potts took it pretty badly. Simon Cowell, though, had some words of comfort for Ashleigh.“Pusdey’s in dog heaven, looking down on you now, thinking . . . ” “I was the talent. I was the bloody talent.”DIVA Forever’s Gemma Collins landed in Los Angeles last Wednesday night on ITVBe with all the charm and subtlety of a jolt from the San Andreas Fault.Take comfort, though, from the fact our gain is very much Calornia’s loss.Because within five minutes of arriving she’d already decided, “I ain’t going back to England”, and was using her new catchphrase to describe everything.Hamburgers  “Next level.” Hollywood Hills mansions  “Next level.” The Beverly Wilshire hotel  It’s next friggin’ level. She seemed to have her priorities right, though.Before going anywhere near a green card applicationshe got pretend friend Jonathan Cheban to take her to cosmetic surgeon to the stars, Doctor Simon Ourian: “Because I want a facelt while I’m here.How long will I need ” How long have you got, Gemma  It’s next level.FINAL word on Celebs Go Dating belongs to ­brilliant narrator Rob Beckett.Lauren Goodger: “Everyone’s, like, ‘Did you find love, did you meet anyone ’And I’m, like, yeah I did. I found Lauren Goodger.”“S**test game of hide and seek ever.”BBC’s brilliant Untouchable: The Rise And Fall Of Harvey Weinstein documentary.Damon Herriman’s performance as Charles Manson in episode five, series two, of Netflix’s Mindhunter.ITV’s impressively handled A Confession. And theof greatest ever breakfast television duo Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid to GMB.Cos I don’t mind telling you, I’ve really missed the hoary old cricket anecdotes, that unfeasibly small yet hyperactive mouth and all three of those le-insurance-risk chins. And Piers as well. IF this fth series of Peaky Blinders achieves nothing , then Irish actor Brian “Jimmy McCavern” Gleeson’s attempt at a Scottish accent has certainly highlighted the problems of frictionless borders.Back and forth it pings between Dublin and Belfast.With the odd stop-off in downtown Hyderabad, before settling at something closer to Hercule Poirot Belgian rather than the leader of a depression-era Glaswegian razor gang thug he’s meant to be.It has a knock-on effect as well. Notice one thing that’s wrong with the show, you’ll probably notice everything  as well.Like the fact it’s all over the place historically, Paul “Arthur” Anderson is over-acting so badly the estate of Yosemite Sam should sue and Helen McCrory doesn’t look foxy dressed up as Janet Jackson. She just looks ridiculous.Underneath all that baggage and the obtrusive soundtrack, there is, I think, a serviceable enough plot involving Oswald Mosley, the IRA, the UVF, even though they weren’t formed until , and all sorts of carnage involving gypsies and Glasgow’s infamous Billy Boys gang, which our friend Brian Gleeson attempted to put into sharp focus at the end of Sunday night’s episode.“Zo, Tummy ­Shell-beee, it’s wuuuurgh yur wunt, it’s wurgh you zjall ’ave.” No, me neither.THIS week’s winner is BBC Breakfast presenter Dan Walker and Beaker from The Muppets.Compiled by Graham WrayJONATHAN Ross, in , to producer Andy Davies, on the subject of his -year-old neighbour: “I think you should, just for charity, give her one.”Jonathan Ross, in August , to Judge Rinder, on the subject of Brazilian President Bolsonaro’s disparaging remarks about Emmanuel Macron’s we: “I’m team Macron.It’s the most pathetic and most misogynistic thing they could say. It’s pretty awful, it’s pretty horrible really.”Jonathan, you’re a helluva guy.Sink Or Swim, Arg: “I’m going to be the plus-sized Michael Phelps.”And for all those wondering what the technical term for that is, it’s Michael Feltz.LIKE most of you, I watched a lively old bird called Judith serenade four sets of shrivelling male goolies with a chorus of The Lord Is My Shepherd before taking all of her clothes off on Wednesday night’s Naked Attraction.Then I switched over to Newsnight, where arch-Remainer Paul Mason was discussing Brexit and, I promise you, he sounded about a thousand times more unhinged. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A first leg of the new rail network, linking Londonaposs Old Oak Common to Birmingham, was due to open in . But this is to be put back until between  and , Transport Secretary Grant Shapps declared today. Birmingham Live revealed the delay yesterday but it is even worse than predicted. Mr Shapps said HS chairman Allan Cook does not believe the current schedule of  for initial services on Phase One is realistic. The second phase to Manchester and Leeds is now only expected to open between  and  - a delay of up to seven years from the previous date of . Mr Shapps also confirmed the expected cost of the whole scheme - including phase two, which extends it to Manchester and Leeds - has risen from £bn to between £bn and £bn in  prices. Mr Shapps, however, insisted: [Mr Cook] is of the view that the benefits of the current scheme are substantially undervalued. HS Ltd continues to refine its estimates of cost, benefits and schedule. All these will be considered within the scope of the Oakervee review.    Prime Minister Boris Johnson has ordered a review of HS, which will consider a series of options include scrapping the scheme entirely or finding a way to bring the benefits to the North of England more quickly. But the delay is not a result of the review. It comes after a report by HS chairman Allan Cook for the Department for Transport warned that it is not possible to complete the line within the expected timescale. It remains possible that the review will recommend cancelling HS, or making major changes to the project that could cause further delays. The Department for Transport confirmed last month that a review will consider “whether and how HS should proceed”. The review will be chaired by Douglas Oakervee, a former chairman of the -mile Crossrail line in London and the South East, and a former chairman of HS Ltd, the government-owned business building the high speed rail line. A DfT spokesperson said yesterday: The new Secretary of State has established an independent review into HS, led by Douglas Oakervee with Lord Berkeley as deputy. The new report will set out, before the end of the year, the latest position on cost and make recommendations on whether and how to proceed. “We have committed to providing Parliament with a full update on all the information he has received this week. West Midlands Mayor Andy Street, a firm supporter of the proposed rail network, will be a member of the review . He said he would make the case for going ahead with HS, and was confident he could win the argument.

We do believe we have the MPs here and ready to support that legislation because many are alarmed at the consequences for jobs, for our economy, of crashing out on October  without a deal, which is what the Prime Minister seems determined to try to do, riding roughshod over Parliament and democracy in the process.

Shadow Attorney General Shami Chakrabarti was sent on the airwaves to clary party policy after Labour MPs clashed over whether to back Boris Johnsonaposs plan for an October  poll. The PM is expected to demand a snap electionMPs vote tonight to take control of the Commons order paper - the first step to stopping no-deal Brexit. That, in turn, will force a vote in Parliament as soon as tomorrow night to trigger the general election in  daysapos time. But any election needs the backing of two-thirds of all MPs to be approved - and Labour MPs are split over whether to let Mr Johnson have his way. They are afraid the Prime Minister will cheat them out of being able to stop no-deal Brexit and use sneaky methods in an election to ram it through. The fears revolve around a Bill tabled by MPs to delay Brexit by three months to January  in order to stop no-deal.    Itaposs expected Parliament will be dissolved on Monday next week - just enough time to pass the Bill. But there are fears Boris Johnson will either stop the law being passed - or, worse, get MPs to pass an October  election only to sneakily change that date when he visits the Queen. No sources and ex-Chancellor Philip Hammond have both confirmed the power to set the final date rests with the Prime Minister alone. Downing Street today flatly denied Boris Johnson will sneakily change the date of an election. The PMaposs official spokesman insisted: “It is simply wrong to suggest that the polling day could or would be changed”.But the issue sparked a row in Labour, with dozens of MPs saying they did not want to vote in favour of an election in case they are betrayed by the lying Tory PM. Last night Jeremy Corbyn said he’d be “delighted” to bring the fight to Boris Johnson. But shadow Northern Ireland Secretary Tony Lloyd said: “We are not daft enough to see a tactic dictated by PM Johnson which is designed to land us with a no-deal Brexit and to fall for that.”    The Mirror understands senior allies to Jeremy Corbyn - including Emily Thornberry and John McDonnell - raised the fears of deception at yesterdayaposs shadow cabinet. One top shadow minister said: Boris Johnson could come to the Commons seeking a two-thirds majority for dissolution on the promise of a date. And then once heaposs got the authority and the Queen dissolves Parliament, the date could be changed. We will be looking very carefully at what mechanisms are available to us to ensure Boris Johnson canapost make a promise to Parliament then renege on it.  A string of backbench MPs also voiced concerns. Labour MP Diana Johnson said: I will not be supporting any attempt by the PM to force a General Election at this time of national crisis. We first need to avert a no deal crash out of the EU on st October. Ms Chakrabarti was then sent out onto the BBC this morning in a public bid to set the record straight. She said the “priority” is to “get this legislation locked down” to prevent a no-deal Brexit - and Labour will of course “live and breathe” for an election after that. She added “it’s about sequencing” before Labour can vote in favour of an election in the House of Commons.  Baroness Chakrabarti told the BBC: The priority this morning... is preventing this no-deal crash out. What we need to ensure is that we get this legislation locked down... weaposve got to get a locked-in guarantee that Britain would not crash out of the EU in an election campaign period. Weaposve also got to try as best as possible to ensure that it wouldnapost be possible for the sitting, squatting prime minister in this period to set a general election and then change the date. So the priority this morning is preventing this no-deal crash out. And then, of course,we get the sequencing right and we can get sufficient support across the house we live and breathe for a general election.

Since then she has married, started a family and owned a successful business. Anna estimates she has paid £, in tax and has raised her two children here. Always living in Bristol, Anna has attended school and university in Britain and considers the UK her home. But the British government doesnapost agree and her request for permanent residency has been rejected.    Devastated Anna was told she did not have enough evidence to document her status - despite sending an entire box of information that was so heavy it cost £ to post. She had spent three months compiling her paperwork, which included tax s, banks statements, qualications and her national insurance number. Anna said: You are in your country, it is a democracy, all of a sudden you are told after this time no one knows what is going to happen to you. Where do I go  It is really, really scary. Following her refusal for permanent residency, in writing, Anna made a series of frantic phone calls and sent almost a dozen emails, certain there had been a mistake.    In one a government official told her she had failed to prove herself as, “a qualied person either as a worker, a self-employed person, a student, a jobseeker, or a self-sufficient person”. Anna ran a pizza takeaway business for almost  years and has also worked as a personal assistant and a counsellor. She said: All of a sudden, they snatch it away from you. You become unstable. It gives you anxiety, stress, you know it affects every aspect of your le. It is so upsetting. The Home Office has stressed Anna did not apply for permanent residency under the EU Settlement Scheme and had instead made her application under EEA regulations. Under the EEA Regulations , a person who is eligible for immigration to the UK is known as a ‘qualied person’. The government added Anna has not reapplied for permanent residency under the EU Settlement Scheme but stressed she had been given advice on where to get help.    A spokesman said: The EU Settlement Scheme makes it easy for EU citizens and their families to get the status they need to remain in the UK and they have until at least December  to apply. “Nobody has been granted pre-settled status without first being offered, and declining, the opportunity to submit evidence that they qualy for settled status, and our latest statistics show that by the end of July, nobody had been refused.” “Over one million people have been granted status.” But Anna is not sure she wants to apply for the status for a second time and has said she will deal with the consequences. She could apply for citizenship through her British husband but says sheaposs offended by the idea of having to sit an English and history test and paying more than a thousand pounds to get citizenship after living in Britain for over half a century. Anna said: I resent the fact I have to apply for settlement in my own country. If I apply again, I am enabling the system. What is next  A badge, branding ” Amato says her Italian father, who had dementia in later le and died in March, would be upset at how EU migrants are being treated.    He moved his family to Britain to work in a factory making washing machines in , a time when Britain was looking abroad for workers. Anna said: He loved the UK because he thought it was a fair and decent nation. He was proud to be here. I feel betrayed. Her story is one of many being faced by EU nationals who have made the UK their home. For decades, Britain’s membership of the EU has guaranteed the bloc’s citizens the right to live and work in the country. But as Britain prepares to sever ties with Brussels after  years, EU citizens must apply for a new legal leline to remain, known as settled status.    Under the government’s plans, EU citizens who can prove they have lived continuously in Britain for five years will be granted settled status, giving them the same rights to work, study and benefits they currently hold. Many EU nationals are concerned they could lose the right to free healthcare or employment. Others are worried about how they will prove they have the right to they travel abroad.The fate of EU migrants has been thrown further into confusion by the government’s announcement this month that their automatic right to live and work in Britain will end abruptly - and sooner than expected - in the event of a no-deal Brexit .The government launched its EU Settlement Scheme for registering EU citizens in January this year.    The status of British and EU nationals living in each other’s territories has been one of the most important issues in Brexit talks, which have dragged on for the past three years. Both sides have promised to ensure settled citizens do not lose any rights.In his first statement to parliament after becoming Prime Minister in July, Boris Johnson said he wanted to thank EU citizens living in Britain for their contribution and promised to ensure they could remain after Brexit.There are now fears the issues facing EU nationals who have to prove their status could mirror the Windrush scandal. This led to British citizens of Caribbean origin denied rights despite living lawfully in the country for decades.    Some lost jobs, others were wrongly deported.Labour politician Virendra Sharma said: Anna’s story is a tragic one.How can somebody who has given so much of their le to the UK, who went to school here and got married here, have their existence in this country wiped  I think most people would say that can’t be right. Even Brexit supporters are calling for more to be done about the issue.    Daniel Hannan, a prominent Brexit supporter and Conservative lawmaker in the European Parliament, has called on the government to do more, saying he had been contacted by EU nationals in his constituency denied long-term residency. He said: This is a breach of the assurances I and other Leavers gave during the referendum. Please help sort this out. Until recently, the government had been advising the estimated . million EU citizens living in Britain that they had until December  to register to retain their rights. So far, only about  million people have applied. Richard Bertinet, a renowned French chef who has lived in Britain for the past  years, was denied settled status after applying earlier this month with the help of his British we, a former lawyer.    Bertinet, who has written two award-winning cookbooks, appeared on cookery TV shows and set up a bakery that supplies upmarket supermarket chain Waitrose, said he had only been granted pre-settled status. The government gave him the right to stay until , when he will need to reapply for settled status. He said: It is painful and embarrassingI have spent more time in my le in this country than in France.

This Tory Prime Fibber is a reckless and dangerous charlatan. He’s the head of a ragtag government threatening to defy the law and sidelining Parliament because he’s terried of its sovereignty. This hypocrite vows to dump MPs who vote against Brexit – as he did twice. Britain quitting Europe without a deal would be an economic calamity, destroying jobs, smashing living standards and imposing trade taxes. So the Kamikaze PM should stop pretending it’s a viable option.  The  referendum did not ask for a nuclear Brexit and our European allies know even Johnson realises it would be a disaster. MPs must this week vote for sanity and rule out a Halloween horror before Jeremy Corbyn and others decide on a General Election. Demonstrators shouting “stop the coup” over Johnson as he delivered a Conservative Party Political Broadcast in Downing Street underlined how ided the country is. He should be careful what he wishes for. Care fee plea    Private care home fees costing up to £, more than local authority places show why we need a lot more council provision for the elderly and vulnerable. The private sector’s average £, annual bill against £, for local authorities is typically £, a month added to the financial burden on families wanting relatives protected. Social care was a victim of callous Tory austerity, which was a political assault on vital services for ideological, not economic, reasons. We desperately need a fairly funded National Care Service to look after everybody, irrespective of their means, something which Labour planned and the Tories nastily blocked.

But a thereaposs a lot that can happen between now and October . It all kicks off with a Parliamentapossfrom the Summer break - but the coming weeks could see crucial votes, a delay to Brexit, showdowns, recriminations and sackings. AndBoris Johnson doesnapost get his way, itaposs more than likely going to include a full-blown snap election. So buckle up - itaposs going to be quite a ride. Hereaposs how the next few weeks are likely to pan out, day-by-day.  MPs will today try to seize control of the Commons agenda in an attempt to stop a no-deal Brexit.Boris Johnson has tried to head off the revolt by threatening to remove the whip from Tory rebels and ban them from standing at the next election. But at least a dozen say they are ready to defy Downing Street to prevent a no-deal. The PM says he will not accept any move that stops him taking us out of the EU, with or without a deal, on October .Although he said he did not want an election, his statement was about preparing the ground for onethe Commons blocks a no-deal Brexit this week.  If MPs succeed in taking control of the Commons timetable tonight, Downing Street has said it will trigger a general election on October . MPs would then be asked tomorrow to override the Fixed Term Parliament Act, that says polls should only take place every five years. But there is no guarantee rebel MPs will succeed in blocking a no-deal.This is a two-stage process that requires the Speaker granting an emergency debate so they can vote on taking control of the Commons agenda and then a second vote on the Bill preventing us crashing out without a deal. If the MPs fail, then Downing Street will withdraw the threat of an election.  To hold an election, the Commons has to vote by a two-thirds majority to revoke the Fixed Term Parliament Act. Shadow Attorney General Shami Chakrabarti issued a serious note of caution today, saying Labour will not back an election until the party is sure no-deal Brexit can be blocked. But it seems almost certain Labour will back a poll.  Jeremy Corbyn wants a poll despite Tony Blair warning him it is an “elephant trap”.The former PM said Labour could struggle to winMr Johnson “mixes up the Brexit question with the Corbyn question in a general election”. But allies of Mr Corbyn say similar warnings were made before the  poll, when the Labour leader exceeded expectations.    What will happen in the election  The polls suggest another hung parliament.Mr Johnson needs to stamp out the threat from Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party, while Labour needs to hold on to its seats in Leave areas. The Lib Dems are confident of taking Tory constituencies that voted Remain. The SNP are confident of making gains in Scotland at the expense of Labour and the Tories.  Parliament s after summer break. Opposition MPs try to take control of the Commons order paper - the first step to blocking no-deal. The vote is due at pm. If this is successful, MPs will table a table a bill that would force Boris Johnson to delay the Brexit deadline until January , a deal isnapost agreed by October . Meanwhile, the Government will publish the text of a draft motion to trigger an election to take place on October . And where, the legal bid to block the shutdown of Parliament brought by a cross-party group of MPs and politicians gets a full hearing in the Court of Session in Edinburgh.    Wednesday  September Chancellor Sajid Javid was set to announce Whitehall spending for   - including boosts for police and schools - in his first spending review. But assuming MPs have successfully taken control of the order paper, both the Brexit delay bill and the election bill will be formally moved. A government source did not rule out cancelling the spending review to make room for the election vote. If MPs vote to trigger an election, there would usually be a limited period of wash-up before Parliament is dissolved, to allow bills in progress to be completed or axed. Thursday  September  The Brexit delay law could go to the House of Lords in a race against time to be approved. Meanwhile, campaigner Gina Miller - teamed up with ex-PM John Major - will seek to legally challenge Johnsonaposs attempt to suspend Parliament.    Monday  September If an election is called for October , this is the date Parliament should be dissolved according to the statutory electoral timetable - which requires at least a  working day campaign. That means itaposs the last date MPs and peers can attempt to seal up a Bill blocking no-deal Brexit on October . Thursday  September This is the last possible date Parliament will sit after Boris Johnson previously vowed to suspend it in this week. But itaposs likely the Commons will end earlier. Sunday  September Labour Party conference begins in Brighton. It is almost unprecedented to have a general election campaign during party conference season. If the conference goes ahead - huge sums have already been spent organising it - expect rabble-rousing election talk from Jeremy Corbyn. Monday  SeptemberBoris Johnson speaks at UN General Assembly in this week and could visit the White House. Expect him to attempt to lob news grenades into the UK domestic agenda. Thursday  September At midnight is the likely deadline for Brits to register to vote for the election. If youaposre already registered at your current address you donapost need to again. If you are registering for a postal vote the most likely deadline is Friday  September . If you are registering for a non-emergency proxy vote the most likely deadline is Friday  OctoberSunday  SeptemberTory Party conference begins in Manchester. Expect an electioneering series of hard-right, pro-Brexit speeches gearing up for an election. Monday  October If there is an election, polls open at am and close at pm with the new Prime Minister known by Tuesday morning - unless thereaposs a hung parliament. If there isnapost an election, Parliament s on this day with a Queenaposs Speech - but is then snarled up in a week of debates which curtail debating time for Brexit.

Just hours after her death she was dubbed the Peopleaposs Princess and the whole country was united in grief. A sea of floral tributes started to build up outside the gates of Buckingham Palace and Britain was in mourning. But as the country collectively grieved one person was conspicuously absent - the Queen. Her Majesty was one of the first people to be told about her former daughter-in-lawaposs death.    The Queen was on holiday at Balmoral with her son, Prince Charles, and her grandsons, William and Harry, when the princess. Charles received the phonecall, and shocked, the first person he told was his mother. As thousands of people flocked to The Mall, anger began to grow towards the royal family. First, there was the refusal to fly the Union flag at half-mast on Buckingham Palace.And then  the Queen  aposs absence from London, where millions had gathered to lay flowers and pay tribute to the late princess, further incensed the public, angry she wasnapost publicly mourning Diana.   Many believed Her Majesty should have ed immediately from Balmoral. Eventually, the Queen did bow to public pressure and came back to Buckingham Palace a day earlier than planned. Dressed in black, she viewed the floral tributes left for her former daughter-in-law and addressed the nation, revealing she shared in their grief. But the monarch had an utterly heartbreaking reason for refusing toto London as soon as the death was announced - her grandsons. The Queen wanted to shelter the young princes, who had just lost their beloved mother, from the limelight and do all she could to support them.    Tina Brown, author of The Diana Chronicles, said: The Queen was adamant that her place was at Balmoral with her grieving grandsons. Everyone rallied around the young princes. This was the first time in a long reign that the Queen was thinking about her family before her people. We should admire her for that. Her thoughts were with her grandchildren and she wasnapost thinking about how this would be played out in the media. Royal commentator, Alastair Bruce, said: The royal family realised there were two young boys who had lost their mother.    I donapost think thereaposs a human being alive who doesnapost respond to that as an important thing. During the days in the immediate aftermath of Dianaaposs death in a tragic car accident in Paris the Queen and Prince Philip did all they could to help the young princes. Tina said: Prince Philip took them walking, horse riding and fishing every day - anything to take their minds off the tragedy. The Queen didto London a day earlier than planned and greeted the crowds. And the union flag WAS flown at half-mast above Buckingham Palace in the days after Dianaaposs death.    This was a total break from protocol as the only flag ever flown above the palace was the royal standard, which is unfurled to indicate the Queen is in residence.Then Prime Minister  Tony Blair , coined the phrase aposPeopleaposs Princessapos.He told a BBC documentary: She was most worried about the impact on the boys, obviously sad about Diana, and concerned about the monarchy itself because the Queen has a very strong instinct about public opinion and how it plays out, and, in that first conversation, we agreed to keep closely in touch with it. I got people from my office to work very closely with the royal court and how we managed the affair over the next week. The Queenaposs grandsons were devastated by their motheraposs death.   Prince Harry , who was just  at the time, has been open about his battle with depression following the tragedy.Desperate to do all he could for his beloved mother, even in death, Harry asked his father, Prince Charles,he could travel with him to Paris to collect Dianaaposs body. But determined to shield his children from some of the heartbreak they were going through, Charles refused Harryaposs request. Journalist and friend of Diana, Richard Kay: The Queen and Prince Charlesapos view was that the boys were their main priority. Instead, the Prince of Wales travelled alone to Paris to bring his ex-wiveaposs body back to Britain.    But even this was frought with dficulty. Journalist and friend of Diana, Richard Kay said: Charles took the decision that he was going to Paris to bring back Dianaaposs body. This was a surprising and brave move. He was an ex-husband, he had no right to be there other than as the father of her sons.

The British boy, who has remained anonymous, had such a diet he suffered from a condition normally only seen in malnourished third world children. His is believed to be the first case of its kind in the UK. The  year-old had only eaten chips, Pringles, sausages, processed ham and white bread since primary school, telling doctors he did not like the texture of fruit and vegetables. Dr Denize Atan, who works for the University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust and wrote about the boyaposs case, said: He had a daily portion of fries from the local fish and chip shop and snacked on Pringles, white bread, processed ham slices and sausage.    The shocking lack of vitamins damaged his optic nerve, which connects the eye to the brain. He was found to have a condition called nutritional optic neuropathy- usually only seen countries where access to food is restricted. Dr Atan said the youngsteraposs blindness was caused by junk food and that he was suffering from a rare eating illness known as avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder or AFRID for short. Sufferers become sensitive to the taste, texture, smell or appearance of certain types of food. Some can only eat them at a certain temperature. The unnamed patient, from the West Country, also developed hearing loss and bone weakness.    Eating too much sugar and carbohydrates in processed food can damage the ears. Dr Atan said: The conditions remained undiagnosed for several years. The boy was blind by the time he reached , leaving experts at Bristol Eye Hospital mystied. While NON can run in families, there were no hereditary signs found in the boy. However, he was deficient in vitamin B which is found in offal, milk, fish and eggs, prompting doctors to carry out further investigations into his diet. Once drinking, smoking and drug taking were ruled out as possible causes, and his height and BMI had been judged normal, the medics landed on diet as the likely reason for his illness.    Dr Atan said: However, the patient confessed that, since elementary school, he would not eat certain textures of food. He had first been taken to his GP three years earlier, when he was , complaining of tiredness. Aside from being labelled a fussy eater, he was otherwise well and took no medications. Blood tests showed he had low levels of B which caused fatigue, leading to treatment including vitamin injections and diet advice. The intervention had little effect on the teen, whose hearing and sight began to deteriorate when he was . Following two years of progressive loss his visual sharpness was just   and he was diagnosed with NON. Normal vision is  , which means you can read an eye chart at  feet.    To be considered legally blind, it needs to be   or worse. The boy lost nerve fibres in the retina which essentially ruined his central visual field. Dr Atan said: Junk foods are nutritionally poor but energy-dense and cheap. Hence, high-energy diets correlate with high BMI, low socioeconomic status and poor health. aposFussy eatingapos that is restricted to junk foods and causes multiple nutritional deficiencies is an eating disorder. Avoidant-restrictive food intake disorderis a relatively new diagnostic entity, but unlike anorexia nervosa, it is not driven by weight or shape concerns. Onset is in middle childhood, with lack of interest in food, heightened sensitivity to food textures, and fear of the consequences of eating.

First-time parents Shauna Copple and Josh Fell were stunned when they were first told they were having twins. Shauna, , and Josh, , were delighted when non-identical twins Amelia-Rose and Maison were born. But little did they know that  months later, there was another surprise awaiting them, the Manchester Evening News reports . In November last year, the couple, from Swinton in Greater Manchester, discovered Shauna was pregnant again.    They expected just the one baby this time around. So, it came as an even bigger surprise when doctors told the pair that they were having twins - for the second time. Last week, Shauna gave birth to two healthy non-identical girls - Isla and Darcie. All six members of the family are now back at home. The new arrivals have been introduced to their siblings in a somewhat busier household.    Shauna says the family has just enough room at her mumaposs three-bedroom house, but theyaposre most worried about finding a big enough car. Itaposs the car we are most worried about, I currently have a four-seater which is absolutely useless, and Josh has a five-seater, Shauna said. Weaposre going to have to save up and buy a seven-seater for us all to be able to travel together. The couple, who have been together for five years, say that neither of their respective families have ever had twins before. There are no twins in the family at all that we know of so it was a complete surprise when we found out the first time, Shauna added.  With the first two, everyone was saying it was going to be dficult, but it wasnapost as hard as we thought. I got pregnant again and at the first scan we were told we were having twins again - it was an even bigger shock.

Investigators who want to interview Frenchman Jean-Luc Brunel, , say he is a “ghost who has disappeared without trace”. It is understood enquires are being made in Brazil, the US and Europe. French prosecutors have opened their own inquiry into the crimes of American financier Epstein, . The convicted paedophile, a friend of Prince Andrew, committed suicide in jail on August  while awaiting trial on child sex trafficking charges. Brunel, who helped found the New York model agency MC and is credited with finding supermodels such as Christy Turlington, has strenuously denied any wrongdoing.    It was claimed Russian ex-model Svetlana Pozhidaeva, who was signed to MC, was pictured at Epstein’s New York mansion in . Ms Pozhidaeva, the daughter of a Lieutenant Colonel in the Red Army, has denied it is her in the photo. A day before it was taken, Prince Andrew was photographed standing in the doorway of Epstein’s home. One of Epstein’s victims, Virginia Roberts, has alleged she slept with the Duke of York three times, which he has strongly denied. He has also denied knowing anything about Epstein’s illegal activities.    Roberts also claimed to have slept with Brunel “many times” when she was aged  to . Many of the girls said to have been used by Epstein were allegedly “sourced” in Paris, where the American owned a £million apartment. Brunel, who also lived in the city, was known to be scouring Brazil for new talent until early this summer. French prosecutors this month opened a preliminary inquiry into whether Epstein sexually abused French minors. Authorities say it is “urgent” Brunel is interviewed. But one Paris legal source said: “He is a ghost who has disappeared without trace.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds addict sheds 10 stone","story":"NewsMcDonalds addict sheds  stone after ditching , McNuggets-a-year habitKathryn Mulkerns love of fast food was a full-on addiction as she feasted on her favourite McDonalds meals for breakfast and dinner every dayShareCommentsByLucy NotarantonioHelen Bennicke:,  SEP Updated:,  SEP Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news us-news video mcdonalds-addicts-weight-loss-after-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Footage from the area shows choppy water submerging cars as palm trees bend and snap in the wind.Thoughts and prayers for those whose homes and lives have been devastated by the category five hurricane have poured in from all over the world, but some have come under fire for the way theyaposve gone about doing this.   A number of people have chosen to take Hurricane Dorian as an opportunity to share throwback photos of themselves on holiday in the Bahamas.Users on Instagram have posted appreciation snaps of the Bahamas, showing themselves smiling and lounging in bikinis on white sands, or posing by a pool, alongside captions sharing their condolences.And while the photos have gained many likes, a large proportion of the Instagram community were unimpressed and voiced their disapproval in the comments. Some of the images were branded disgraceful and disgusting with one user instructing the posters to delete their photos immediately.    Dorian is now slowly moving west towards the US with Florida, Georgia, North and South Carolina declared as states of emergency. Bahamas Prime Minister Hubert Minnis has begged residents of Abaco and Grand Bahamas to head for the main island to escape the devastating, dangerous storm. I want you to remember: homes, houses, structures can be replaced. Lives cannot be replaced, he told a news conference on Saturday.

Yulia Gorina was travelling on train from Minsk, Belarus to Asipovichy in Russia with her father who had dozed off on the -mile journey. She was reportedly snatched by a man and woman who it is claimed were hiding from police and she ended up in an orphanage before her foster parents adopted her.    But it was not until she met her boyfriend, Ilya Kryukov, , who helped to search for her parents, that the family was finally brought back together. Heartwarming pictures show her mother and father breaking down in tears as they meet their long-lost daughter. A DNA test has now proved that she is the daughter of Viktor and Lyudmila Moiseenko - and her has father “begged her forgiveness” for losing her.    Her parents, now in their late s, searched frantically for their lost child at the time, as did local police, but they ended up under suspicion of killing the girl. As recently as  when police reopened the case, they underwent lie detector tests which they both passed. It remains unclear how Yulia got from Asipovichy to Ryazan, except she has a memory of a train journey. A couple - who possibly kidnapped the lost girl - were believed to have been involved. “I do believe it’s all true now,” said Yulia after finding and hugging her real parents. “It was proved by a DNA test, but it was clear even before, we are so much alike, as soon as we saw the photographs of each other. Nobody had any doubts – we are one family.    I found not only my mother and father in Belarus, but also brother Dmitry and elder sister Nadezhda . Yulia still lives in Ryazan where she was found on a railway siding in . It is  miles from Asipovichy where she was lost. Her biological mother Lyudmila said: “Twenty years is like a whole le, but we never lost hope, we believed – and so we found each other. The emotional reunion was held in a police station in Marjina Horka settlement. “We were all in tears,” said Yulia. “We could not even talk, we only cried and hugged each other.    “My parents have told me that they were searching for me for a long time, that they believed they would find me one day. “My mother could not stop hugging me, she made me sit on her lap asI was a little girl. “We were chatting till  am, and then Ilya and I had to go back to Russia – my daughter was waiting for me.” Yulia said the police sent her to an orphanage after a fruitless search in Russia for her family. She was given up for adoption to foster parents Irina and Oleg who have always wanted a daughter.

The hate for Thatcher was pure and the depth of feeling surged through concerts and rallies.He says with a chuckle: “Them were the days.“We thought it was bad then, but everything can get worse, as we see now. It’s a case of careful what you wish for.“I don’t get involved in politics now, like I say when didn’t anyone complain about politicians “Can you point me to a golden era where# everybody liked being ruled  F***ing never!“But there are some real creeps nowadays. But then again I expect the worst from any politician.”So what can fans in Dundee expect when John rolls into town for his show at the city’s Gardyne Theatre on Saturday October  Without missing a beat he fires back: “A right f****** good night!“And they can expect more of the same#and then some. There will be a few classics and there will maybe be a few extra poems.“Then I will add a bit of fun and I can guarantee – solid, copper-plated guarantee – that everybody is going to leave with a smile on their face.”John has fond memories of Dundee and spoke of savouring the atmosphere of a waterfront hotel and added: “I love coming to Scotland and Dundee. I’ve been many times and the reaction of the crowd is great.“I was here last year and saw the VA which is fabulous. I know of DC Thomson and the Sunday Post, the Beano and the Dandy plus Oor Wullie.“Maybe I will buy one of those sculptures.”Posh hotels and venues seem a world away from the clubs and student venues of the s with smoke-filled rooms and plastic tumblers full of warm beer.He used to travel to the shows on public transport and chuckles at the memory.John said: “Yeah, long time ago now, mate. Now I have a driver and I am too old for public transport.“But I still love doing live gigs. It’s smashing. Anywhere where there’s people is greatI’m doing my stuff.“I am working on my book of poems right now. It’s called ‘The Luckiest Man Alive’ and I’m also working on the memoirs. vw, px\"  “I am thinking of calling that ‘I Wanna Be Yours’ after the Arctic Monkeys. I just hope to live long enough to finish it.“But I am not finishing up any time soon. I have never even thought about that. I am not retiring, not yet and not in the foreseeable future.”John has the tour to contend with first and is also lining up some television work.And at the age of  there is definitely no holding him back.

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

It was fantastic to speak to so many of my constituents.It was also wonderful to see many local business stalls promoting Islay#s dynamic and booming economy.The show was well attended with lots of families, both local and visitors, having a fun day out and luckily the sun was shining most of the day.A huge thanks to all the organisers and everyone  who contributed to the event.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I have real concerns about the deteriorating condition of some Argyll cemeteries.Constituents from Islay recently joined Councillor Alastair Redman in highlighting the poor upkeep of cemeteries in the area he represents.Councillor Redman reported that there were also problems at other cemeteries in his ward, including the cemetery at Carradale in East Kintyre.I understand that Argyll and Bute Council confirmed that they now, at last, have plans in place to address the problems at Kilnaughton.It remains disappointing, however, that things are allowed to deteriorate to the extent that the maintenance of cemeteries has become a matter of public concern.Frankly, it is very surprising that a cemetery where interments are actually still taking place has been undermined in this way and there must surely be an obligation to ensure this doesn’t happen.My experience is that communities in the Highlands and Islands pay special regard to the final resting places of fellow members of their communities and will be perplexed to discover that they appear to be uncared-for.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures august 16 2019","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTayvallich reader Colin MacInnes captured this photo of these two fluffy cygnets at the Corran Burn in Lochgilphead back in July.A couple of adult swans were spotted floating nearby at the time on Loch Fyne and Loch Gilp around Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"radio stars face ayr sailing opposition","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLook out for the first major event by Mid Argyll Radio Sailing Club .A special competition is to be held at Loch a Bahrain, Cairnbaan, on Saturday August  between Ayr Bay Radio Yacht Club and MARS.

The deadline was broken on  minutes when Lee MacLean broke from midfield and managed to beat the offside trap, his cross from the left channel was met by the in-form Stuart MacLean whose shot beat Martin to give Star the lead.Tarbert looked to commit bodies forward in a bid to get back into the game which made for a more open contest, however the Star defence of Coll McCallum, Ricky Reid and Kyle Selfridge coped well throughout.Red Star should have made the closing stages a lot more comfortable for themselves with Gregor Peacock going close with a couple of opportunities and Aaron Moore having a shot well blocked but in the end Stuart MacLean’s goal was enough for a hard-fought but deserved win.On Saturday August  Star welcome Dunoon to the joint campus for their final game of the group stage, where a victory for the Lochgilphead side will see them progress to the quarter-finals.The kick-off time will be announced on the club’s social media pages during the week."},{"url":null,"title":"easy like summer busking","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe music club designed for everyone continues its summer of busking on Wednesday August .Get along to Lochgilphead Resource Centre for an evening of music from the much-missed Danny Kennedy with bagpipes, percussion and plenty of chances to sing along to the music.The event starts at pm and is free other than donations.

These songs were associated with the Tlell River on Hai Gwaii in Canada. These tracks, with a selection of later collaborations, make up River to Sea from Tlell to Tiree. The title documents Sheila#s journey from the coast of Canada to Tiree, where the track All You Really Need is the Sea was written.This artist is probably best described as a folk blues singer. She has the sharply observing, descriptive eye of the classic singer songwriter troubadour and while her voice is given gravitas and character by time, she swings and has the timing of the blues singer.Wild Biscuit#s musical accompaniment gives Sheila#s characterful voice depth and presence. The menacing guitar on I#ve Waited a Long Time and the atmospheric double bass and keyboards on Where the Pebbles Grind and Scrape complement Cameron#s lyrics and singing.Remembering Mr Toast is an atmospheric and evocative, less bombastic or overblown Scottish Jim Morrison, finding real beauty in a melancholic memory. The delicate hesitant guitar and reflective lyrics continue on Don#t Sigh and Go on Then, beautul, bitter sweet country love songs. All You Really Need is the Sea and Deep and Real are spiritual songs, again moving between an intimate relationship to consider the huge landscape and the restorative natural world.Is it blues, country, easy listening, folk or poetry set to delicate sympathetic music  It doesn#t matter. Close your eyes, listen to Sheila#s rich voice, with its cadence and rhythm. Enjoy the flow of words and the pictures they conjure on this warm and captivating set of recordings."},{"url":null,"title":"macalister wins tarbert golf championship","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe delayed fourth and final round of the Tarbert Golf Club championship took place at Glenralloch on Saturday August  in glorious conditions.The greens were freshly cut with captain Smyth choosing some interesting pin positions to test the players# skills.Iain Macalister held a one shot lead over Bruce MacNab and a five shot lead over John MacNab heading into the final round.If there were any nerves at the start of play this was not evident as Iain started with four fours then followed that with an excellent -foot birdie putt at the fth and a chip-in birdie at the sixth.

Iain#s second shot came up a bit short leaving him a dficult up and down, and the drama continued as Bruce almost holed his second shot to leave a tap in birdie. With nerves of steel, Iain chipped on to four feet and duly rolled in the putt for a well deserved victory of the Sam Andrews trophy.This was Iain#s first championship victory and in his acceptance speech he told the crowd of his delight at winning while complimenting the sterling work done on the course by Graham Prentice, John MacNab and Duncan Johnstone.Iain swept the boards, also winning the nett and senior championship at the same time.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day.

coincide with a full council meeting, and waved flags, shouted slogans and played lsquoMoney Money Moneyrsquo by ABBA on a PA system.Speaking at the demonstration, Willie Thomson, a regional industrial organiser for Unite, said that the dispute could risk the regionrsquos winter maintenance programme.He said: ldquoThe reason why the men are taking action is basically a refusal from Scottish Borders Council to respect the terms and conditions of their employment.ldquoThey have had changes imposed on them that will cost them poundrsquos, and they are not willing to have that done to them.ldquoThe reason they are striking is to send a strong message that the council needs to get back round the table and reach an agreement with the workers.ldquoThe people of the Scottish Borders need to be aware that the council is risking their winter maintenance service.ldquoDuring the winter maintenance service members do a lot of extra hours to keep up with the extra demand.ldquoWersquore now in a position where members will be withdrawing that programme.ldquoThat work is done a voluntary basis and the good will that is required to do that is in short supply.Currently, summer standby for Scottish Borders Councilrsquos road workers is voluntary, but council chiefs are trying to make this mandatory, in line with other sections of the council.Earlier this year, Scottish Borders Council notied the unions that not enforcing the same terms and conditions across the whole council could leave the local authority open to gender pay discrimination claims, as the mainly male roads section of the council is not required to be on standby over the summer, whereas the mainly female care home staff are.Summer standby payment for roads workers is currently pound., albeit it on a voluntary basis, and Scottish Borders Council is offering to up this to pound as long as it becomes mandatory.The two main unions which represent road workers at Scottish Borders Council, Unite and Unison, have been in discussion with the council ever since it informed employees that the terms and conditions would change.However, the talks with Unite broke down, and .% of the unionrsquos members who voted in an industrial ballot voted for strike action. The turn out was %.Scottish Borders Councilrsquos chief executive Tracey Logan,said: ldquoThe council has not changed terms and conditions for this staff group, nor have we failed to consult the trade unions or the staff affected.ldquoIn fact, we discovered some months ago that a small number of staff in this section had been claiming a higher rate of overtime than they were entitled to under the agreed terms and conditions.ldquoThey were also claiming for time to travel to work when working weekend overtime, which again is not in line with the agreement in place.ldquoGiven that Unite agreed to these terms and conditions, I am surprised and disappointed that they now want some of their members to be given more favourable pay rates than others, and for this small group be able to claim additional allowances that their other members cannot.ldquoIt is a principle of fairness and equality for staff across the whole workforce and one which I would expect Unite as representatives of staff to uphold and commit to."},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-bar-cream-crop-scottish-cuisine","story":"A BAR and restaurant is the toast of Selkirk after winning the Best Scottish Cuisine title at Food Awards Scotland .The celebration of the countrys best restaurants, takeaways, pubs, hotel restaurants, cafes and bistros was held last week in Glasgow.Within the restaurant category it was the The Fleece Bar  Kitchen which was announced as cream of the crop when it comes to presenting Scottish cuisine.Trevor and Tracey Ward, who have owned the historic Selkirk inn since , were delighted with the latest accolade.Tracey told us: \"Wersquore absolutely delighted to have been awarded this accolade which celebrates the very best Scotland has to offer in the hospitality industry.\"To win the category of Best Scottish Cuisine when wersquore a family run restaurant situated in a small Borders town, is testament to the commitment and focus of our staff and the support we have from our customers and the community.\"There were some great, long established restaurants in our category and for us to have come out on top was a welcome surprise!Over the past three years the Wards, along with trainee chef son Ryan, have been rewarded with a regular stream of five-star reviews from delighted customers.And the awards shelf is filling up as quickly as their restaurant diary.Another Borders establishment which was also honoured last week at the Food Awards Scotland was Stewarts Cafe Bistro in Jedburgh.The High Street business was named as the regional Cafe Bistro winner.Creative Oceanic has been organising and hosting the awards for the past six years.CEO Irfan Younis told us: ldquoCongratulations to all winners and finalists at the sixth Food Awards Scotland .\"We welcomed and rewarded some of the best in the Scottish food industry who serve us up some of the tastiest food, enhance our culture, deliver top quality customer service and provide us with some of the best banter around.

The overall revenue budget for the upkeep of parks across the Borders is contained within the budget for neighbourhood services and no savings are projected from this budget as a result of the play programme.ldquoThe removal of old play equipment from playparks, which following appraisal, deemedto be low value facilities, will allow for sufficient resources to be deployed to maintain thenew facilities being invested in by the council through the outdoor community spacescapital project on an ongoing basis.ldquoThe new facilities include more pieces of equipment, widening access and providinghigher play value than the previous, aged, low-amenity, play equipment. Thedecommissioning of the older low value facilities will ensure the revenue impact to the parks and environment service budget is cost neutral.ldquoI would further confirm that no play park will be decommissioned until such times as thenew play park investment in that locality is complete.ldquoMembers should also note that no town or village which currently has a play park will beleft without one following the upgrade process.Tweeddale West councillor Heather Anderson also queried the council leader, asking for an update on the proposed closure of eleven parks in her ward.Councillor Haslam told the chamber: ldquoThe council requested feedback to the programme for decommissioning of play parks with an end date of August .ldquoOfficers will now undertake a review of the feedback and, where appropriate, respond prior to implementing the council decision.ldquoIn announcing a signicant investment in outdoor community facilities the council recognised the need to address the historic over provision of low value playparks, indeed the council is in amongst the largest providers of play parks per  head of population when compared to similar authorities, however when it comes to quality it is amongst the lowest in play value terms.ldquoThe council decision to invest in destination playparks and decommission those play parks which are obsolete does not remove the spaces from fulfilling an important community need in terms of access to open spaces.ldquoThese spaces can be used for informal play and have the potential to help the council address other issues such as its obligation to identy places for community food growing.Scottish Borders Council recently spent pound, on a new playpark at Harestanes Countryside Visitor Centre, near Ancrum, which follows on from new parks built in Galashiels, Oxton, and Stow.The council also opened up a new playpark in Hawick in  as part of the regeneration of WIlton Lodge Park, and Coldstream is set to be next to receive a new playpark with a pound, facility set to open in Home Park at the end of the month."},{"url":null,"title":"driving-legend-jackie-opens-museum-39-great-friend-39","story":"SIR Jackie Stewart praised Jim Clark as a driver and as a friend when he officially opened the refurbished Jim Clark Museum on Thursday in Duns.Clark won two Formula  World Championships, in  and , claiming overall a total of  Grand Prix victories with  pole starts, and also the Indianapolis  in  before he died in a horric crash at Hockenheim in .Sir Jackie, who later was flying off to Spain for the weekendrsquos Grand Prix, recalled his friendship with Clark.And he revealed how he regularly visited the Borders to meet up with his lsquogreat friend.He said: ldquoWhen Jim Clark was racing he was my hero and was certainly the best racing driver I ever raced against.\"We had a great le together and he was an enormous help to me.

Work is expected to start at the end of the month and should be completed by the send of September.Councillor Frank T. Spears stated that the work would not involve any long-term closure of the main roadway.The #dry bridge#, owned by Lord Margadale, has been the subject of much discussion and minor rows for the past several months. Since Western Ferries Ltd. began their sea service, heavy articulated lorries carrying malt and grain to the island#s distilleries have been unable to go under the bridge. Matters came to a head three months ago when Argyll County Council re-imposed a weight limit on the Glen road # the ersion used by the transporters to avoid the bridge.The bridge owners came quickly to the rescue and allowed the heavy traffic to use their private road at Bridgend for a three-week period, but following local protests and legal consultations the transporters were again allowed to use the Glen road.Leboat saves three on rocksThe crew of a lobster fishing boat were marooned on a partially-submerged rock for more than two hours when their vessel foundered off the north-east coast of Islay on Thursday morning.The ft #May#, owned and skippered by -year-old Mr Lachlan Clark of Port Charlotte # the veteran of several sea-dramas # struck the rocks while they were lting lobster creels.The Islay leboat was called out to rescue the skipper and his crew # Alastair MacDonald, a -year-old fisherman, and Norman Gardiner, a -year-old Colonsay doctor#s son who was making his first trip and deputising for a sick crew member.Following the rescue, the crew # who were unhurt # were landed at Port Askaig.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGONational Health Insurance ActA number of contraventions of the National Health Insurance Act were the subject of prosecutions in Campbeltown Sherf Court on Thursday # Sherf MacMaster Campbell on the bench.The first case was that of a Clachan merchant who was charged with neglecting to stamp the card of a female servant.Mr M. Dick, solicitor, who appeared for accused, tendered a plea of guilty, and said the observations he was about to make would apply equally to all the cases subsequently to be heard. These were the first prosecutions of the kind in this court. The Act, as his Lordship knew, was a most voluminous and complicated measure.The sherf observed that some excellent and very lucid summaries had been circulated.Mr Dick, proceeding, asked his Lordship to examine the contribution card. He would find that the part which was the very kernel of the offence was embodied in the middle of Art.  in very inconspicuous type. The employer was there required to stamp the card #not later than the time at which wages are paid# but to read that one required to hold the card at about  degrees.The sherf askedhe was to understand that this was the first occasion on which a domestic servant had been employed by accused  If not, he must have been trained in the use of this wonderful document years ago.Mr Dick said his Lordship must consider this, that in cases of this kind there were two standards of clearness. What was clear to the judicial mind might be very far from clear to the lay mind.It was a matter of common knowledge that there was a very general belief in this part of the country thatinsurance cards were stamped at the time they were run out the Act would be complied with.The card, of course, bore that the stamps must be affixed #not later than the time wages are paid#. He asked his Lordship to consider the phraseology. These cards came into the hands of many rustic employers of labour. Why should it not be stated in bold characters on the card that the stamps must be affixed at the time wages are paid In the country wages were paid sometimes by the half-year, sometimes by the month, and sometimes at irregular periods suitable to the circumstances of the worker.The cards represented not the half-year of the feeing terms, but the calendar half-year. All these circumstances contributed to the confusion of the lay mind, and encouraged the widespread impression thatthe cards were stamped at the end of the period the duty of a citizen was thereby fulfilled."},{"url":null,"title":"leader august 23 2019","story":"The Courier is honoured to deliver news to the community # during the good times and the bad.This week we were delighted to share the news that Campbeltown now boasts the #whisky bar of the year#, according to judges at the Scottish Bar and Pub Awards , who bestowed the title to the Ardshiel Hotel.Since buying the hotel more than a decade ago, Flora Grant and Marion MacKinnon have more than tripled the number of whiskies on offer, turning the hotel into something of a tourist attraction in itself.However, we also revealed that nine jobs have been lost at Campbeltown Creamery.While it is still hoped that a take-over by local farmers is the future for the site, it is terrible for the iniduals who have lost their jobs, some after many, many years.We know there is a market for Campbeltown cheese, and while the number of farms supplying the creamery has fallen over the years, there are still almost .Here#s hoping the future is bright for both Campbeltown#s whiskies and cheeses."},{"url":null,"title":"fun in the sun at first mokfest","story":"India enjoyed herself at this year#s Up The Close event, which included children#s entertainer Funky Chicken and ious fair attractions, and was made all the better by the glorious sunshine.India was joined by her mum Lynsey Mcshannon, who was able to get into the spirit of things this year having been heavily pregnant last year, and her dad Gary Anderson.This year#s Up The Close was a particular hit, with the welcome , after nearly a decade, of indie rockers a new hope "},{"url":null,"title":"more music in store for the wee toon","story":"On Wednesday, September  at .pm, well-known folksinger, entertainer and broadcaster Alastair McDonald will be in concert in Campbeltown Free Church.This will not be Alastair’s first visit to the Wee Toon.

She pointed to the relaxation in the cutting of greenspaces and the use of plant species which attract a wide range of pollinators. She added: ldquoOur most recent residentsrsquo survey found high levels of satisfaction with our parks, gardens and open spaces.ldquoWe have a number of initiatives to increase sustainable management of our countryside sites and improve bioersity and pollination.ldquoThis is reflected in the work we have been doing with partners such as Buglersquos John Muir Pollinator Way project, the planting of , metres sqaure of wildflower meadow, low impact grassland management and targeted use of a weedkiller where appropriate.ldquoOur Green Network Strategy, part of our Local Development Plan, recognises the importance of vacant and derelict land for wildle, and seeks to identy suitable locations for tree planting given the important role that trees play in mitigating climate change. This links in with the draft Climate Change Strategy which considers in more detail how East Lothian can tackle climate change."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-cockenzie-pub-39-s-beer-garden-open-longer","story":"The Thorntree Inn in Cockenzie has to close its beer garden at pm as part of its planning conditions.However, agents for the pub owners Caledonian Heritable argue that the beer garden, which overlooks the Firth of Forth, has become a popular destination in itself and is unfairly disadvantaged by the fact it has to close at the early time.And they say the closure has put severe limits on the use of the popular spot in the village by its customers.The pub is thought to be one of the oldest in East Lothian, opening its doors as Barclays Hotel in .It opened the beer garden, which runs along the bottom of neighbouring gardens and overlooks the seafront, five years ago.Applying for a change in the conditions to allow it to stay open until pm in the evenings, the agents said: ldquoAs drinking habits have changed and drinking has become more sociable, it is not uncommon for beer gardens to be destinations in their own right.ldquoThis beer garden in question has excellent views across the Forth and affords a relaxed atmosphere for friends and families to enjoy time together.They said that the beer garden had run without complaints and listed a number of other beer gardens across East Lothian that are open until pm.They said: ldquoClosing the beer garden at pm is having a detrimental effect on the business and is resulting in disappointed customers.ldquoIt seems unreasonable given the lack of complaints and incidents regarding our clientsrsquo beer garden that it should close at pm when other beer gardens in East Lothian remain open."},{"url":null,"title":"major-review-east-lothian-schools-consider-closures","story":"Fiona Robertson, East Lothian Councilrsquos head of education has revealed proposals to consult parent councils, communities and families over ways to change the current schools estate.The pre-consultation, which was given the go-ahead by councillors at a meeting this morning , will consider a ldquofull range of options.In a report to a meeting of the council, Mrs Robertson confirmed that the consultation would consider catchment reviews, new school build requirements, school merger proposals on a new site involving the closure of existing schools, and other alternative proposals put forward during the consultation.East Lothian Councilrsquos Labour administration scrapped proposals to close rural schools operating at less than  per cent capacity ahead of last yearrsquos budget after it met strong opposition.If it had been adopted, the proposal would have seen two primary schools ndash Stenton and Humbie ndash close their doors.The new review will focus mainly on primary schools and will look at the range of uses of school buildings and other council buildings by local communities.Mrs Robertson told the meeting: ldquoIt is essential we carry out this review given the current challenges to the school estate.ldquoThe focus will be primarily on primary schools and the consultation process will be about six months.Councillor Norman Hampshire, deputy leader, told the council meeting that the review would have ldquohuge financial implications.And Councillor Stuart Currie, SNP Group leader, warned that the review would spark concern among parents.He said: ldquoThe risk of offending people is pretty high when people start talking about closures.ldquoThis is a signicant piece of work.Mr Currie and fellow SNP councillor Paul McLennan called for the results of the consultation and any ldquoemerging themes to be put before the councilrsquos education committee for discussion before coming back to the council for a decision.Speaking after the meeting, Mr Currie said there were concerns that the report would bypass the education committee, which includes members outwith the council including church officials and representatives from the teachers union.He said: ldquoIt is a decision about education and should be considered by the education committee.ldquoIt will have implications for many families and needs to be debated fully before any decisions are made.ConservativeCouncillor Craig Hoy, who has joined the education committee, said: ldquoWe agree with East Lothian Council undertaking a full review of the school learning estate to ensure it is fit for the future.\"The Scottish Conservative Group looks forward to the findings but will always stand up for our existing network of rural primary schools.

When the corn was eventually gathered in early September, it is said decaying corpses were discovered. They had lain in the fields since August , a day of barbaric infamy in Tranentrsquos history. The dead were victims of the Tranent Massacre, and one of the bodies may have been that of Jackie Crookston or Crookstone.I say lsquomayrsquo for there is ironically so little known about this well-known woman. A statue by David Annand of Jackie on Tranent High Street shows her beating her drum with a clenched fist, defiantly leading the protest against the Militia Act. The plaque by the statue calls her a ldquoresolute woman who joined the protest, and states she was one of those killed by the cavalry.Her heroic reputation is well established in local lore. The th-century historian John Martine called her ldquoa Tranent virago. This word describes a woman of brave, fearless qualities, but it has a sting in its tail. It can also be used to mean a woman who has overstepped her mark, broken cultural rules in relation to her role as defined by gender.And by leading the protest against the Militia Act she most certainly did this.Another th-century historian and collector of traditions, P. MrsquoNeill, was clear on her role: ldquoJackie indeed was the prime mover in the whole affair, he states.We have accounts of her beating her drum and leading the protest with chants of ldquonae militia. She is said to have threatened a captain of the cavalry and declared defiantly that ldquoshe didna care a pin though she were cut in halves, she wad hae nae militia. Another account has her telling a member of the yeomanry to leave or she would ldquothraw his neck, at which he duly rode off.If these accounts are true, she was indeed resolute on that day in defending her family, her neighbours and her community. Jackie was not the only woman on the streets that day, for women took a leading role in defending their families. But she was the most prominent, it seems.The Militia Act aimed to conscript young men into a militia by means of a ballot. It was resisted for a number of reasons, but for the poverty-stricken mining and farming communities of Tranent and the surrounding area, it was seen as an imposition which would take young men of working age away and potentially cripple their families economically.There is no space here to recount the details of the massacre, but much of what happened on that day remains hidden behind a mist of cover-up and official indference.And somewhere in the bloody carnage of August , , Jackie Crookston was killed, along with many others. Yet despite her leading role, her name was not included in the original list of people killed. Eleven deaths were recorded, but no mention of Jackie. ldquoHow her death escaped recording is dficult to explain, reflected P. MrsquoNeill in his book Tranent and its Surroundings.Perhaps an explanation can be found in an eyewitness account written immediately after the massacre. It was a letter from Archibald Roger to his we in Edinburgh.It begins: ldquoDear we, this comes to acquaint you that you need not weary for my ing home, for my sister is to be buried this afternoon at four orsquoclock, and I cannot come away till I see her decently interred. I am sorry to inform you of the cruelties that were committed here yesterday there were six persons shot dead on the spot, of which my sister was onehellip the number of wounded is not yet ascertained, but I am just now informed that  dead corpses were this morning found in the corn-fields and it is not known how many more may be found when the corn is cut.Was Jackie one of those lying undiscovered in a field  It seems so by some accounts. Is that why her death was not on the list  Sandy Mullay in his book The Tranent Massacre says she was shot in the streets, but there is also a tradition which states her body was found well away from Tranent much later in a field, with stab as well as gunshot wounds.Was she initially wounded and then a victim of later retribution  Was she hunted down in an unrecorded atrocity because of her role as ring leader, and a woman who didnrsquot know her place  She will have been easy to identy because of her prominence in the protest.Her death, just like her le, is unrecorded by history. Despite her leadership in the events, she was a woman and she was poor, and history lacks interest in such characters. A tax on the registration of births and deaths at this time meant many poor people lived and died unregistered even in parish records.So who was Jackie  We know she was born in Gladsmuir in June  and was a mother. Perhaps not all her children were registered because of the tax, but it seems she had at least four surviving at the time of the massacre. She was only  when she died, but how do we imagine her le  What was behind her passion in defending her community When I spoke of her to artist Mags Nisbet-Macfarlane, she was inspired to use art to search for the woman behind the historical glimpses.ldquoI felt connected to this woman I did not know, she told me, ldquoshe will have had a le that explains her defiance that day she had so little, but was protecting what was important to her. Magsrsquo image of Jackie tells a story without the need of words.The plaque by the statue in Tranent says there were  killed in the massacre, as Jackiersquos name has been added to the original . But in truth we will never know for sure how many were really killed and maimed that day.There was no prosecution of those responsible, no investigation and no interest by those in authority to allow the truth to be told."},{"url":null,"title":"new-dunbar-area-radio-station-hunt-volunteers","story":"Sescot Radio, previously known as Dunbar On Air, is looking to take to the airwaves and have the community at the heart of its programmes.Andrew Morris, who is behind the proposals, was keen to get people involved, whether that was on air or behind the scenes.He told the Courier: ldquoFirst of all, we are an internet radio station so our catchment area is all around the world.ldquoBut, from a common sense point of view, there is no physical radio covering from East Linton and Dunbar right down the coast to Burnmouth and along to Kelso wersquove got a triangle.ldquoIrsquom keen that these little places that have got two or three cottages are just as involved.ldquoWhat we are doing is covering Eyemouth, Dunbar and Kelso but we donrsquot want to preclude these folk either.ldquoWe want to involve everybody and preclude nobody.Already, the fledgling station has been out in the community and got involved with Dunbar Civic Week earlier this summer.Mr Morris was keen to see the radio station cater to as large an audience as possible.The -year-old was previously involved with both East Coast FM in Haddington and Tranent-based East Lothian FM, which is now Radio Saltire.He told the Courier that he had interviewed a number of East Lothian councillors on air but the focus was firmly away from politics and instead looked at a number of dferent topics.That was something he was keen to consider repeating, with other shows looking at ious genres of music, as well as cooking shows.As well as music, the station would promote local good causes and encourage involvement from schools, charities, clubs and other organisations.Now, Mr Morris, who lives on Dunbarrsquos John Muir Crescent, is calling on members of the public to come forward and offer a helping hand to get the station off the ground.A meeting takes place at Hallhill Sports Centre in Dunbar on Wednesday evening.Mr Morris said: ldquoWe are progressing but a lot slower than I hoped.ldquoWe have got ious applications out for grant money and have been awarded some but we need a lot more before we think about buying the gear that we need.ldquoWe are also anxious to find some suitable premises.In-house training will be provided at the station, which will be run entirely by volunteers.The station also intends to offer work experience opportunities for those looking to find their way into a career in the media.The meeting takes place at pm, when members of the public will be updated on the stationrsquos progress."},{"url":null,"title":"up-and-coming-band-go-first-scottish-tour","story":"Johnny Brown and the Devanties, made up of frontman Johnny Brown, , Erin Ritchie, , Andrew Dobie, , and Struan Blacklock, , will be heading to Aberdeen at the start of next month on the first gig of their headline tour.Johnny told the Courier: ldquoIrsquove been singing and writing music since I was about  years old.ldquoI knew the tour manager for The View so ended up playing a few gigs with them.ldquoIrsquove played the EH festival and once I had the chance to play with Republica.ldquoIn January I reconnected with a few people I went to school with through the music scene and we decided to form the band.ldquoWersquove released one single and our next one, Streetlights, will be released after the tour.Johnny of Edinburgh Road, Cockenzie, met his fellow bandmates while at Preston Lodge High School.He said: ldquoWe had to make sure that we were able to sell out shows before we knew we could tour.ldquoWe sold out about seven gigs in a row, so thatrsquos when we thought we should give it a go.The bandrsquos first single, Brooklyn, was released just after they were first formed in January and garnered good reviews, in particular from Discover Music, Scotlandrsquos Music Blog.As to the future, Johnny said: ldquoWersquore hoping our tour and our new single will do really well, hopefully itrsquoll help us break through.

The world is a much better place as a result but, unlike with family, the bonds and obligations of friendship are less clear-cut. Sometimes ties wither naturally, at others, rash or destructive relationships have actively to be severed. This is an unpleasant fact of le and one that Prince Andrew is discovering belatedly to his cost.For some time now, speculation has been mounting after the publication of a photo showing the Prince walking in a New York park with his friend, the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who was recently found dead in a prison cell, where he awaited trial on charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy to engage in sex-trafficking.The headlines must have made the Palace shudder, their insinuations all too clear. After details of a US lawsuit mentioning him were released, a terse statement was issued distancing the Prince from historic accusations made against Epstein, and claiming that ldquoAny suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.:Prince Andrew hosted Jeffrey Epstein at BalmoralClose observers of Buckingham Palace might have noticed a cloud of dust around the flagpole as the house was shaken to its foundations. When the Daily Mail published footage recently showing the Duke of York ushering a young woman out of Epsteinrsquos Manhattan apartment in , a further statement was issued. The Duke, it said, ldquodeplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent.Poor Prince Andrew. He is discovering what every child in the playground knows: that you are tarred and feathered with the same brush as those with whom you mix. If one of your gang throws a brick through a window, you are deemed guilty too, evenyou did nothing wrong.In the case of His Royal Highness, letrsquos put aside for a moment the suspicions his closeness to Epstein, following his release from prison, arouse. Bad enough that Andrewrsquos personal contacts are so dodgy they raise serious questions about his judgement, let alone his behaviour.If nothing , these images suggest one of two things: that the Prince was a loyal chum who stuck by Epstein, despite his ruined reputation and the risk it posed to his own. Or that, living as he did in a gilded cage, removed from real le and the consequences of any stupid decisions he made, he was utterly unconcerned about the effect their friendship might have on his prospects. When you are cocooned from birth in a cradle of privilege when you are feted, indulged, and pandered to by sycophants and liggers from the minute you can shake a rattle, it must be easy to believe you are above the normal rules and standards by which society works.Meeting in the park with Epstein was, at best, decidedly odd for someone in Prince Andrewrsquos position. Going to his apartment, however, where a stone satyr presides over the front door, was simply crazy. According to police who raided the property, they seized photos of underage girls. These and the fetishist decor would have led most ordinary visitors to make a swt exit.These images of the Duke of York date from the period when he was acting as British ldquoSpecial Representative for Trade and Investment. A bespoke role for an aimless aristocrat, it gave him licence to roam the globe, meeting fat cats in rich countries and opportunistic states in the hope that some of their wealth would find its way into Britainrsquos Treasury.:In Pictures: Commonwealth leaders gather for state dinnerDuring his deployment as an envoy, Prince Andrew made ious embarrassing ldquomissteps, among them some politically unwise associations. Nothing, however, could compare with being identied as one of Epsteinrsquos cronies, after which revelation he relinquished the post.As the grapevine quivers with anticipation over other high-profile names likely to be found in Epsteinrsquos fat address book, the Dukersquos predicament is increasingly grave. He can hide behind the Palace gates and hope the storm will pass, but this is a story that has been brewing for years. Until certain questions are satisfactorily answered, as far as hersquos concerned it is far from over.Doubtless, it will go against every royal instinct, but would he not be wiser to face the cameras, do an in-depth interview, and silence ndash perhaps even charm ndash his critics  In a situation like this, where unfettered gossip is fuelling supposition, Prince Andrew surely needs to explain his connection with Epstein and help suffocate the scandal. It would, of course, be a historic move. No member of the royal dynasty has ever voluntarily gone on record to put their side of a wildfire story, with the exception of Princess Diana. In her unforgettable, kohl-eyed interview with Martin Bashir, she was more focused on scoring points against Prince Charles than in illuminating her own often dubious actions.Sticklers for Palace protocol might feel sick at the thought of Prince Andrew going public. Even in the hands of the most measured journalist ndash Kirsty Wark, say, or Fiona Bruce ndash it would be viewed as stepping into the lionrsquos den, a suicidally reckless act. Added to which, the Windsors do not explain. They take a long view, recognising that the passage of time usually allows even the most unsavoury episodes to fade into oblivion.In this instance, however, that seems unlikely. So what is worse  Staying schtum, and waiting for more seedy revelations to be added to the blaze, or allowing the Duke to get ahead of the story, and give his version of events By remaining aloof, the Palacersquos response suggests it hopes to avoid further fallout. The implication of this is all too plain: royals might not be above the law, but its arm would have to be very long indeed to winkle one of them out of the front door and into a Black Maria. Inviting a Windsor to a police interview, let alone into a courtroom, would require Herculean effort, and a mountain of cast-iron evidence. By contrast,Andrew were willing to face, refute and defuse the rumours, it would be an act of bravery to restore family pride."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10345671.jpg?type=article-full","title":"celebrate-tastes-scotland-scottish-food-drink-fortnight","story":"AldomakAldomak are a Scottish confectionery business established in  in Glasgow, supplying the ice cream trade.They manufacture Scottish Tablet, Fudge and Macaroon for a wide array of independents, supermarkets and the tourist trade, and have also branched out into making Handmade Meringues on a large scale, supplying farm shops, delis, hotels and cafes across Scotland.Aldomak are proud of their handmade artisanal credentials and over the years have spent time reimaging traditional recipes and scaling these recipes into large batches, whereby the confectioners pour and cut these by hand, to retain rustic products their customers love.They have also brought two of their own brands to the market, Confectious and Bonnie Glen which was a huge investment for the business.With Aldomak recently being awarded two  stars in the prestigious Great Taste Awards for their Bonnie Glen Vanilla Fudge and Butter Tablet, this validates the quality of their confectionery.Aldomakrsquos MD Dario Riccomini is clearly delighted with how things are going, stating that  has been a good year for the company in raising the profile of the business.

No-one seriously believes the Scottish Conservativesrsquo recent revival could have been possible without the working-class, kick-boxing lesbian ldquofae the Kingdom of Fe.Davidson breathed le into the moribund Tory party by confounding expectations. She was an exercise in confusion marketing the antithesis of the reactionary, middle-class, middle-aged, strait-laced Scottish Tory image. She talked straight, and she sometimes talked dirty.Her LGBT liberalism finally rescued Unionism from the old Rangers-supporting, Union Flag-waving, sectarian taint that dated from the days when the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party really was the Orange party.This rebranding took the Tories from the margins of politics to the main opposition in Holyrood in only three years.She then won  Westminster seats at the  General Election, more than the Democratic Unionist Party, Theresa Mayrsquos coalition partners. The likely loss of those Scottish seats at the next General Election could be crucial to the fate of the United Kingdom. It may not survive her.For First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, the loss of her most dangerous foe caps her best-ever summer.Last month, the Labour shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, came north to the Edinburgh Festival and, in a remarkable reversal of policy, announced that Labour would not stand in the way of another Scottish independence referendum. Scottish Labourrsquos leader, Richard Leonard, doesnrsquot seem to have quite got the message.Boris Johnsonrsquos election as Conservative leader and Prime Ministerwas an even greater political windfall for Sturgeon. Of all the potential candidates for Number , the Bullingdon English nationalist was the best because he was the worst. The Tories havenrsquot had a leader so out of tune with Scottish sympathies since Margaret Thatcher. His very voice seems redolent of English public school elitism.Now, Johnsonrsquos reckless pursuit of a no-deal Brexit has served to remind Scots just why they voted overwhelmingly to Remain. In this weekrsquos Herald readersrsquo survey, support for Brexit is now down to %. Some % of Scots voted to leave the EU in the  referendum.His decision to prorogue Parliament allowed Sturgeon to announce that it was a ldquodark day for democracy and accuse him of exercising dictatorial powers. As Scotland is dragged kicking and screaming out of the Europe, power is being centralised in Westminster as never before. This has renewed the debate about the powers of the Scottish Parliament. If the PM is prepared to run roughshod over Westminster, how is he going to treat Holyrood in future Davidsonrsquos departure comes not a moment too soon for the First Minister. There has been grumbling among SNP activists on social media about the lack of progress to the next independence referendum. No-one believes that Johnson will agree to one, which makes Sturgeonrsquos promise of a referendum in the second half of  sound vacuous.Why wait, said the former SNP MP George Kerevan. She should withdraw MPs from Westminster, he tweeted, and ldquodeclare an independence referendum immediately REGARDLESS of Londonrsquos permission.He added that Gandhi and Mandela ldquodidnrsquot await permission to free themselves. Many thousands of independence supporters stand ready this weekend to join a campaign of civil disobedience in support of self-government. All Sturgeon needs to do is give the word, and they would be manning, and womanning, the barricades.But I donrsquot think the First Minister is going to go down an extra-parliamentary, unconstitutional route to independence. Recalling Holyrood is a possibility, though it would have to be for a specic purpose, not a unilateral declaration of independence. She certainly wonrsquot call an unlawful Catalan-style unauthorised referendum. Nor will she withdraw MPs from Westminster. She is not a risk-taking, insurgent leader.This doesnrsquot mean Nicola Sturgeon has given up on independence, or that the Union is saved. On the contrary, the events of the past week may have destroyed the last vestiges of support for the Union in Scotland, and made some form of constitutional orce inevitable. But Sturgeon is a cautious lawyer. She is unlikely even to request a referendum unless there is a signicant increase in support for independence in the opinion polls.Support for Yes is certainly edging up over % in some polls ndash but it is painfully slow. Most Scots tell pollsters that they expect Scotland to be independent some time in the future, but that doesnrsquot translate into a demand for a referendum today. The landscape of Brexit is just too confused. We canrsquot even be sure when or how, or even , the UK is leaving the European Union.The First Minister is a gradualist, and her sights will be set, first of all, on the next General Election. She wants those  seats that she lost in  ndash that really hurt. Then there is the possibility of a hung parliament and working in some form of confidence-and-supply arrangement with Labour. Now that there is agreement on indyref, a Corbyn coalition is eminently doable.If there is no General Election, orthe Tories win again, she will concentrate, I believe, on obliterating the Tories in Scotland in . She has really hated them being the main opposition party in Scotland and no doubt feels a personal sense of responsibility to see them back in their box. With Richard Leonard in dficulty, there is now no effective opposition to the SNP in Holyrood.She will put indyref high on the agenda for the  Scottish elections, and use that as a lever to get a Section  from Westminster for a legally binding referendum, perhaps in  ,  years after the first independence referendum. That may seem a long way off for her more ardent troops, but in the great scheme of things it is a blink of an aye.There is speculation that she might not lead that independence campaign. A number of nationalist insiders believe the First Minister could resign following revelations in the forthcoming Alex Salmond court case.

Of the six elections since the establishment of our Parliament, it is the second lowest majority. In terms of votes, Tavish Scott in  won  per cent of the vote, but last week Ms Wishart achieved less than half. Tom Wills increased the SNP vote by nearly  per cent, while Ms Wishartrsquos Liberal Democrat vote fell by almost  per cent of what it had been in . If Mr Forbes Grattan wants to assert that Ms Wishart ldquoromped home, then he must surely agree with me that she was limping, and quite badly at that.Gerald Edwards points out that the ldquopro-Union parties still achieved over  per cent of the vote. True enough, except last time Liberal Democrats, Conservatives and Labour achieved  per cent of the vote between them. If reducing the Union vote by one third is ldquostill a vote loser he must be using ldquoloser in a way I have never encountered before.However, perhaps there is enlightenment to be had from Martin Redfernrsquos assertion that ldquopro-UK voters [in Shetland last week] largely avoided any temptation to vote Labour or Tory. Given that between them, these parties secured less than five per cent of the vote, at one level he must be correct. But the more telling truth is that Shetland continued its tradition of voting Liberal  Liberal Democrat, rather than avoiding any temptation to vote for anyone .As well as Shetlandrsquos Holyrood seat being continuously represented by the Liberal Democrats since , we have to go back to the  General Election to find an instance when the Orkney and Shetland Westminster seat has been represented by anyone other than a Liberal  Liberal Democrat MP. Given this background, I think James Taylor confuses a ldquorevival of the Liberal Democrats by winning in Shetland, with ldquobusiness as usual, and indeed no less than could be expected.

Brexit is an English construct readily propagated by tax avoiders and is dragging Scotland out of the EU against our democratic will.The argument for Scottish independence is an argument for making government accountable to the people of Scotland who will have the final say on which international relationships we enter into.Fraser Grant, Edinburgh EH.Read more: Brown warns no-deal Brexit threatens UK food supply chain with catastrophe"},{"url":null,"title":"everything-need-know-commons-showdown-brexit","story":"Here a look atat what skirmishes are anticipated and how events may play out.ndash How can MPs legislate to prevent a no-deal exit The cross-party group will attempt to use a motion on Tuesday which would allow them to control the Commons business on Wednesday, guaranteeing time to debate a new law to block a no-deal Brexit.This could be achieved through an emergency debate being sought from Commons Speaker John Bercow under the rules of standing order number , commonly called SO.ndash Is time of the essence Certainly.

We went over my current benefits and discussed ious options. “I had been thinking about claiming Universal Credits but we worked out that I’d be five pounds worse off each weekI did. So it was reassuring to hear that I was doing the right thing. “We also ran through my loan repayments which were taking a third of my benefits each week.“Just by making a couple of calls I’ve managed to get an extra £ a week in my pocket which is more than enough to cover my monthly TV, broadband and mobile costs. “The team are friendly, helpful and the adviser properly listened. “I’ve now told both my sisters to call as I think it could really help them too.”Advice is available from the Money Talk Team on    and at local Citizens Advice Bureau.

The society now also delivers animal welfare educational programmes, reaching more than , children in .So it’s fair to say that it has come a long way in the last  years.But for all the successes, there are also new issues it has to face – not least thanks to the advent of the internet.Mike explained: “For years, we have looked after all of Scotland’s animals – wild, farm and domestic.“Farming has come on leaps and bounds in the last few decades and we now have very few problems in the industry.“When I was a kid growing up, you used to have pet shops selling cats, dogs, budgies and the like.“Now, thanks to the internet, people have far more exotic animals in their care which all of our inspectors need to know how to care for and handle – from bearded dragons to massive boa constrictors!“We also have to contend with puppy farmers plying their trade online and selling puppies from car boots.“Some of the puppies die within a few days of people buying them, having paid a lot of money for the animal and thousands on vet fees.“Sadly, we also still see things that I saw  years ago such as Dobermans with every rib on their body sticking out.“However, thanks to our education programme, we are reaching the children of today who will be the animal lovers of the future.“And the majority of people our inspectors visit are not harming animals for fun – it’s a case of ignorance and neglect. In those cases, we’re not just helping the animals, but humans too.“Only five to ten per cent of cases every year are intentional cruelty. So Scotland is still a nation which, in the main, loves and cares for its animals.”That care and concern shines through as the public helps fund the SSPCA’s £ million budget annually.That covers the cost of  employees, including  inspectors,  ambulance drivers and the -strong team based at its nine centres across Scotland and its widle sanctuary.The society receives no government funding and relies solely on the public to fund its work.Mike added: “We are really lucky that, from a population of five and a half million, only  people were prosecuted last year for animal cruelty.“We will never be out of a job but the vast majority of people in Scotland are law abiding and animal loving.“And we couldn’t do what we do without their support.”In December, the Society plans to launch celebrations to commemorate the th anniversary that will run throughout .Anyone with interesting anecdotes or memorabilia they’d like to share should get in touch via its website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.The SSPCA is the only animal charity in the UK able to report animal cruelty cases to the Crown, with reports sent to the Procurator Fiscal Service. The charity receives no government funding and relies on donations and grants to continue its work, which costs £ million each year.In , it found homes for  rescued animals, helped more than  wildle casualties and spoke to more than , children.For every pound it receives, p is spent on animal welfare, p on fundraising and promotion and p on administration.So you can rest assured that the bulk of any donation you make will make a huge dference to the animals in the SSPCA’s care.Last year, its animal helpline received almost a quarter of a million calls, the inspectorate attended more than , incidents and more than , animals were cared for across its nine rescue and rehoming centres and at the national wildle rescue centre.

enjoying the sunshine and boosting trade in local shops, business, pubs and restaurants.To get Inverurie into party “mode” for the Royal WeddingInverurie traders invited local retailers to decorate windows and dress-up in best wedding attire to celebrate the big day.A great effort was made, with union flags, and red, white and blue very much in evidence.Friday began as busy as normal, but by mid-morning the streets emptied as most people chose to watch the big event at home on TV.Keith Whyte of Mitchells told the Herald: “On Friday we had a quieter day as many people were obviously at home enjoying the Royal Wedding but we were very busy in the afternoon.“We put on a special wedding day menu including bridal slice and Royal game soup, which went down well.”Both Neil Ross, of Inverurie Tile Centre, and Scott Graham of McLeish, Inverurie also noticed that it was definitely quiet during the wedding.Neil said: “We were quite busy first thing on Friday morning, but mid-morning until lunchtime it was very quiet, in fact I looked down the High Street and not a soul was going about!“Then we had a normal afternoon, and the sales we had were very good”.Scott added: “We were busy as usual early on Friday morning, but from about am onwards it was really quiet through to lunchtime, then we had our normal afternoon.“I thought it was excellent that so many shops and businesses really entered into the spirit on Friday and joined in decorating windows and dressing up.”Gibbs of Inverurie, for who gent’s wedding attire is a major part of their business, had a special Royal Wedding theme for their window decoration, although Prince William chose his military unorm over traditional Highland dress for his big day!Robbie Gibb commented: “We ran a special wedding offer on

The devices were first introduced in Tayside in June this year and they were subsequently introduced in the North East in July.The mobiles will provide apps enabling officers carry out checks and file crime reports. Officers will also be able to type statements directly to the device through the use of its digital notebookPronto which will obtain an electronic signature from victims and witnesses.Chief Superintendent George Macdonald, Highland and Islands isional commander, said: #The introduction of mobile technology is a major milestone which will positively enhance the operational policing approach in the Highland and Islands.#Over the last two years, we have seen a signicant investment and upgrade in our IT systems to enable us to take advantage of technology.#Given the geography of the area, officers do incur signicant travel time between calls and their stations, the mobile device will allow officers to be more visible in the community, spend more time on patrol and hopefully be more accessible within the areas they serve.#Members of the public will see police officers operating their mobile device in public areas. It is important they understand they are not using their personal telephone and that they are working, but be reassured they will always be available to offer help, advice or assistanceneeded.#Cabinet Secretary for Justice, Humza Yousaf  is pleased that the Scottish Government has been able to help Police Scotland invest in new mobile technology, which he believes will enable officers to work in the heart of Scotland’s communities, providing reassurance and increasing their visibility.“This technology is enabling officers to become even more agile and responsive, ensuring the service is better-equipped to meet the modern-day demands upon it,# he said.#Being able to access information at their fingertips will improve the ability of officers in the Highlands and Islands to react promptly to a range of issues they encounter, enhancing the amount of time available to spend in the heart of their communities and keeping people safe.”Susan Deacon, Chair of the Scottish Police Authorityfeels that this is an important and much needed step forward.#The introduction of mobile working will bring real benefits to the police and the public and will make the police service more responsive, visible and efficient,# she explained.#Continued investment in technology is vital to ensure that policing in Scotland keeps pace with changing needs and demands. Communities across Scotland will be better protected as a result of these changes.#The £million Mobile Working Project which was part funded by the Scottish Government’s capital budget allocation will see approximately , of Police Scotland’s unormed officers issued with mobile devices by spring .The devices will be further enhanced over time with the addition of future policing applications, including national systems as they become available.Last year, Police Scotland produced a business case for a major investment in digital, data and ICT over  years to modernise the service. The proposed investment would also generate savings and public service improvements for the wider criminal justice system justice system.David Wallace, BT’s public sector director in Scotland and chair of the BT board in Scotland, said: “We’re pleased to be leading this project, bringing in our EE mobile network – the largest G network in the UK – and our unrivalled resources to help Police Scotland transform the way they work.“By helping our customers take advantage of BT’s investments in innovations and networking, including our launch of G in Scotland, we’ll see opportunities we couldn’t imagine ten years ago come into our lives.”Norman Dixon, Motorola Solutions# Account Director for Scotland added: “The Pronto mobile application replaces the paper notebook and modernises police workflows by giving them access to databases and tools on their mobile device on the beat.

Craig Clouston and Callan Jessiman were tasked with anchoring the midfield for Hotspurs, while Rovers lined up in a --, spearheaded by Steven Tulloch and Zack Singh.The opening stages were cagey, as the two teams felt each out. The big talking point of the opening half hour was an agricultural challenge by Scott Drever in the Rovers midfield. He went over the top of the ball on Jordan Low in the middle of the park, an offence referee Mike Cursiter saw fit to issue a caution to the midfielder, with Hotspurs looking for a red.Aiden Drever saw a free-kick go narrowly wide of Davy Leonard#s post after  minutes, while Tulloch might have done better with a half chance just before the half-time whistle. A driven ball from Graeme Horne on the left was nodded on by Singh, but the veteran Rovers striker couldn#t direct his header on target, with Hotspurs appealing for an offside flag.The match remained goalless at the break, with neither team having really got going.The match was soon to kick into le in the second half. After  minutes, Rovers ‘keeper Liam Valentine made a hash of a clearance, booting the ball against Spurs striker Jerry McBeth. With the goal gaping, the Hotspurs striker was just about to pull the trigger when he was tripped by Valentine.Cursiter awarded the free-kick, and after a long consultation with his linesman, deemed the challenge worthy of a yellow card only, despite the protestations of the away side. Joe Wilson#s effort from the set piece was tipped wide by the ‘keeper.Just before the hour mark, Rovers saw their best chance come and go. A long ball found Connan Rendall on the right, who controlled it wonderfully before shuffling inside to the edge of the box. His drilled effort looked every inch a goal until Leonard flung himself down to his left to tip it round the post.Moments later, the breakthrough was to come at the other end, as the match swung from end-to-end.Aiden Drever was penalised for a foul on Logan Peace wide on Hotspurs left. The free-kick was flighted in but cleared out to Joe Wilson. His cross back in found Hotspurs legend Wayne Monkman at the back post, whose header floated over the stranded Valentine for the opening goal. Could Monkman#s goal be the fairytale ending for the defender on his final Hotspurs appearance Rovers now needed to score twice in the last  minutes to win the title, but in truth they found a well-marshalled away defence dficult to break down. Hotspurs had the bit between their teeth, with a first ‘A’ League title since  now tantalisingly close.The hosts# task was made even more challenging when Aiden Drever was sent off for two bookings in quick succession with  minutes to go. From there, Hotspurs saw out the game relatively comfortably.In the th minute, Valentine got caught underneath a high ball into the box, dropping it at the feet of substitute Jack Paterson. As the sub tried to get a shot away, he was impeded by the Rovers goalie, who saw his second yellow card of the evening to ensure his side would finish with nine men.Seventeen-year-old midfielder Jessiman stepped up to coolly slot away the resultant penalty, ensuring Hotspurs would win the  ‘A’ League, and sparking scenes of delight amongst their support on the sidelines.OAFA president Colin MacLeod paid tribute to both sides for a hard-fought league campaign after the match, and invited up Hotspurs skipper Keith Harcus to receive the Brough Cup for his side.Harcus — standing in for the injured Owen Rendall — paid tribute to his centre-back partner Monkman who is set to bow out of domestic football as an ‘A’ League champion and urged his teammates not to go another  years before landing the biggest prize in domestic football.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

During a question-and-answer session at the end of the launch of Travalyst, which features leading online travel firms, Harry was asked how he travelled to Amsterdam for the event andhe was changing his travel behaviour.He replied: ldquoI came here by commercial, I spend % of my le travelling the world by commercial, occasionally there needs to be an opportunity based on a unique circumstance to ensure that my family are safe ndash itrsquos generally as simple as that.One of the trips taken by Harry, Meghan and baby son Archie was in a private jet loaned by Sir Elton John, who said he wanted to ldquomaintain a high level of much-needed protection for the Sussexes.In a speech to outline the Travalyst project, the duke spoke about his impact on the environment, saying ldquono-one is perfect but what is important is ldquowhat we do to balance out negative effects. -- --He added: ldquoIrsquove always offset my CO, I think part of the group discussion we had earlier was lsquoWhat is offsetting CO rsquoldquoThere are so many people out there that hear about it, donrsquot know about it. In my mind itrsquos the right thing to do and we need to make it cool, but it canrsquot just be a ticking-the-box exercise.ldquoSomehow we have to connect people to where that little bit of extra money is actually going and, the moment you have that connection, you feel you have a bigger purpose in le, and you can actually see the dference yoursquore making, and I think thatrsquos acceptable.Harry has spent three years working on the Travalyst initiative which he hopes will improve conservation, environmental protection and help increase the economic benefits of tourism for local communities.The duke and the co-founders of the project ndash Booking, Ctrip, Skyscanner, TripAdvisor and Visa ndash want to spark a movement of like-minded companies and organisations to make the future of travel more sustainable.Harry said in a speech to launch the initiative at Amsterdamrsquos Arsquodam Tower: ldquoSometimes the scale of the conservation crisis feels overwhelming and that inidual actions canrsquot make a dference.ldquoIrsquove certainly felt that ndash but Irsquove learned that we cannot dismiss the idea of trying to do something, just because we canrsquot do everything. We can all do better. ldquoAnd, while no-one is perfect, we are all responsible for our own inidual impact the question is what we do to balance it out. -- vw,vw,px, px\"The Duke of Sussex and online travel chiefs at the launch of the new Travalyst sustainable tourism partnership--It is unlikely that the duke or other members of the royal family will stop taking private jets as security, time constraints and safety are normally put forward as reasons for travel decisions.But a Buckingham Palace spokesman said all aspects of the trip to the Netherlands ndash from Harryrsquos commercial flights, and those of all who attended, to the heating used in the venue building ndash would be off-set, paid for by the Travalyst partners. Sunshine Sachs, a US public relations firm, has been assisting the palace press office with the project, liaising with US media and the American-based firms who are part of the project. Keleigh Thomas Morgan, who represented Meghan when she was an actress in the TV drama Suits, is a partner of the company.In his speech, the duke outlined the ldquonegative impacts of mass tourism from Maya Bay in Thailand, made famous by the film The Beach, where its reefs have died, to Africa, where safari vehicle ldquotraffic jams are beginning to outnumber the wildle. But he stressed that there are positives from tourism, which accounts for one in  jobs worldwide.ldquoTourism can strengthen the local economy. Tourism drives improvements in the quality of le for so many. In some cases, itrsquos all they have, he said.Outlining the future for his new initiative, Harry said: ldquoOver the next few years, the members of Travalyst will work together to create incentives for organisations and destinations to do right by the places, spaces, and animals we all need to protect.ldquoAt the same time, theyrsquoll be making consumers aware of more lsquooff-the-beaten-trackrsquo places to share the impact as well as the benefits with local communities. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Kanika Soni, of TripAdvisor--The duke hosted a question-and-answer session with his travel company co-founders ndash Gillian Tans, chairwoman of Booking Jane Sun, chief executive of Ctrip Skyscanner chief executive Bryan Dove Kanika Soni, president of TripAdvisorrsquos hotels department and Suzan Kereere, global head of merchant sales and acquiring with Visa.Ms Soni told the discussion: ldquoSustainability and conservation are growing things in the travel industry. We certainly keep hearing that from our travellers and businesses who are looking to do good in the community.ldquoOften what gets in the way is they just donrsquot know how to put it into practice thatrsquos the reason why wersquore really excited about this initiative. Earlier, Harry joked about having the ldquobest nightrsquos sleep Irsquove had in the last four months staying over in Amsterdam.

This court and these petitioners were being actively misled.He argued the real reason to suspend Parliament was to allow a no-deal Brexit to take place by removing proper scrutiny. Mr OrsquoNeill also said Mr Johnson was trying to govern as an ldquoautocracy using ldquoone-man rule by these attempts.He added: ldquoWhy were these specic dates chosen  Itrsquos because they think theyrsquore gaming the system.It was argued decisions in two separate Brexit-related court cases, brought by activist Gina Miller and Andy Wightman MSP, show Parliament should decide whether or not the UK leaves without a deal.Mr OrsquoNeill said it was not lawful to create circumstances where that happens without such approval.David Johnston QC, representing the Government, said the arguments were ldquoacademic as it was not for the courts to decideParliament can be prorogued.copy -.

It is supposed to have climate change at its core, writes Dr Richard Dixon.When Nicola Sturgeon stands up this afternoon, she will outline a programme of bills and new policies that her Government will introduce between now and the Scottish election in . This period includes the two weeks at the end of next year when the eyes of the world may be on Scotlandit is chosen to host the annual United Nations’ climate conference in Glasgow.There is quite a high bar for this ‘climate emergency’ Programme for Government. We rated the one in  the ‘greenest ever’ because it committed to low-emission zones for air pollution, the deposit- scheme for cans and bottles, the Scottish National Investment Bank, the Just Transition Commission and the phase-out of new petrol and diesel vans and cars by .: Experts call on Scottish Government to follow -point environment planFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereThere are some existing things that are bound to get a mention: the new review of the current air pollution strategy is likely to lead to a commitment to a new strategy the recommendations of an expert group for a ‘latte levy’ will probably get the go-ahead and the long-promised Circular Economy Bill should finally see the light of day. There will no doubt also be mention of Scotland’s world-leadingclimate targets.There could well also be things the Government thinks are climate measures which we will think are a step backwards, top among these being any support for carbon-capture-and-storage or hydrogen fuels, both of which inevitably lead to emissions from fossil fuels going on much longer into the future. So, there will be some things we already know something about, possibly some things we would rather not have, but what about the new and radical policies that Scotland needswe really are going to respond to the climate emergency Ideas we have been pushing include ending official support for getting every last drop of oil out of the North Sea, and instead planning for a managed phase-out of extraction and a just transition to green jobs for the affected workers and communities. Crucial to this is a commitment to do much better at keeping decommissioning and renewable energy jobs in Scotland.We have also suggested free bus travel for all, a move which would reduce air pollution, congestion and climate emissions, help people access work and reduce car dependence in rural areas. Luxembourg will have free public transport next year and cities around the world have free buses. Even betterthose buses were in public ownership rather than run by big companies who have already demonstrated that they have no interest in improving our cities’ environments.A related idea, which got publicity last week, was banning fossil-fuelled vehicles from our cities by . This is a logical next phase for the Low Emission Zones which are being created in Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow, and complements the Scottish Government’s plans to phase out fossil-fuelled vehicles everywhere in the long term. There is plenty to do to reduce climate emissions from our buildings but a good start would be to commit to match the UK Government’s plan to end the fitting of gas boilers in new homes by  and to go further and end the replacement of existing gas boilers by anything not powered by renewables by the same date.

And these are just some of the issues affecting the sector that the Scottish Government must address, writes David Lonsdale of the Scottish Retail Consortium.As MSPs reconvene at Holyrood following summer recess, their attention is quickly turning to the unveiling of the Scottish Government’s legislative programme for the coming year.So what do retailers want to see from our Government and MSPs in the months ahead In these challenging times, our industry seeks measures which support consumers and retail workers, improve competitiveness, and incentivise retail investment.The industry has faced a year which could best be described as underwhelming, at least as far as any growth in the value of Scottish retail sales is concerned. Indeed, sales growth has been pretty much flat over the past  months, at a time when public policy continues to push up the cost of employing people and the cost of operating stores.That’s why we want to see a far greater emphasis on keeping down the cost of doing business in the First Minister’s new Programme for Government. Tangible headway is being made on recasting the business rates system for the future, especially on more regular property revaluations as envisaged in the Non-Domestic Rates Bill. : Insolvencies climb % on back of retail strugglesFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereHowever, the rates burden remains onerous and continues to escalate, with the tax rate now at a -year high. Scots retailers faced an extra £. million uplt in their rates bills in April.Returning to a substantially lower poundage rate is unlikely to happen overnight. As a first step, the Budget Bill should restore the level playing field with England on the large firms’ supplement. This Scotland-only surcharge costs firms’ £ million extra each year, of which retail accounts for £. million. It raises the hurdle for commercial investment in physical premises and increases the attractiveness of investment in digital routes to market instead. The surcharge ought to be eradicated by next April, as advocated by the Barclay Review.Scotland’s rates system has been bedevilled by ad hoc supplements over recent years, including the large retailer levy, the doubling of the large business supplement, and the recently rejected proposal for a levy on out-of-town premises.A moratorium on new or additional rates levies or supplements would increase certainty, as would scrapping plans in the Transport Bill which will see firms taxed twice for any parking spaces provided for staff.Workplace-parking levies will simply add extra cost and complexity, and would come on top of the business rates already paid on those spaces. If Parliament is determined to legislate and give councils the ability to bring in such levies, then safeguards ought to be introduced. There should be a cap on the amount that can be charged, a sunset provision on the duration of any levy, consistency amongst councils over how it is implemented, and a focus on assisting compliance rather than enforcement. The resulting receipts should be transparently used for additional transport services.Household finances continue to be under strain, following an inflation-busting rise in council tax and an increase in the statutory minimum employees must contribute to their pensions. Other rises in the cost of living are in the pipeline, with consumers facing the introduction of up-front charges on drinks bottles and disposable drinks cups, as well as higher statutory charges for single-use carrier bags. MSPs should be wary about heaping further pressure onto family finances over and above those already planned. Indeed, the emphasis now should be on bolstering household incomes and consumer confidence, with the Budget Bill ruling out increases in income tax rates.It’s not just businesses that can benefit from Government action. In particular, we think there is a role for legislation to protect retail workers, and for Scotland to take a lead on this. Too often we read about violent or abusive behaviour towards shop staff. This is utterly unacceptable, and retail workers should be able to work free from fear of violence, intimidation or abuse. It’s a growing problem, despite retailers investing considerable resources in protecting colleagues. Many of these crimes are thought to be linked to purchases of government-licenced and age-restricted products.Recent years have seen more of these duties placed on shop workers. Our parliamentarians should get behind Daniel Johnson MSP’s proposals to change the law, so that the sentences available to the courts are stf enough and offer a sufficient deterrent.There is also an opportunity to do more to improve the nation’s diet. Retailers have led the way on providing healthy options, reformulating products, and improving the food and calorie information available to consumers. The Government has a chance to take that good practice, along with restricting multi-buy promotions of crisps and chocolate, and bring forward legislation which ensures the whole food industryplays its part in creating a healthier food environment.While the coming political year will be dominated by Brexit and perhaps a possible UK General Election, our MSPs should channel their collective energies into ensuring that the retail industry, Scotland’s largest private sector employer, is even better placed to be able to invest, expand and create jobs.David Lonsdale is director of the Scottish Retail Consortium©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"boy 5 with butterfly skin left with third degree burns from simple bumps","story":"A five-year-old boy is left with third-degree burns every time he bumps himself due to a rare condition which means his skin is as fragile as a butterflys wing.Jamie Cockeram was diagnosed with recessive epidermolysis dystrophic bullosaat birth - a rare inherited skin disorder that means his skin is so delicate a bump or graze rips three layers off immediately.Before school every day, Jamies parents Jenny and Simon pierce any blisters with a sterile needle and wrap him in bandages.His parents have spent years fundraising for medical research in the hope that one day their sons pain will stop.Simon, , an IT security expert, said: \"He fell over on the grass while playing the other day, which is normal for children.\"But this caused Jamie a big blister on his knee.\"We had to give him morphine and take him home to clean it up.

Such oppor­tunities don’t come often. They were also seen to catch a seal in the bay at Lund, and photographed by several folk during their progress north, and so hopefully can be identied by the team that are still up here researching the distribution and abundance of killer whales around Scotland.From photographs, it has been established that an orca seen off Cullivoe, north Yell, on the evening of the th July, is a big male known as  or “Bigga”.Next day, the same inidual was identied at hrs heading north through Yell Sound.Some of our showiest plants are in flower just now. “I know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows …” wrote William Shakespeare in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”. And indeed I do. There’s a fantastic bank near me where the pale mauve flowers of thyme are pushing through between the bell heather, itself with some plants paler than others.Common heather is not so bold in its colouration, but works in mass production, and will soon be colouring the hills with subtle shades. The third in the trio of obvious heathers is cross-leaved heath, whose compact flowerheads drooping from a single stem are pinker in colour.Changing colour, two striking plants are now in full bloom – angelica and meadowsweet. Although names for meadowsweet in dferent coun­tries all translate as “queen of the meadow”, it seems that its name actually comes from its use in flavouring the drink mead. Also in the days when hygiene was not quite so good as now, the plant with its rather nauseating scent was spread out on the floors of houses to counteract unpleasant odours. A Shetland name is “blackenin-girse”, from its use for dyeing wool.From the showy to the opposite – demure and unnoticed is a little plant with a big name that is very common about gardens, steps and roadsides: procumbent pearlwort. This low, hairless, tufted perennial has its base as a non-flowering rosette. However, the name pearlwort is said to come from the tiny, pearl-like white, long-stalked flowers whose sepals are actually longer than the usually four petals. In folklore it is said to have special powers of protection. So next time you go to pull out this so-called weed, just give it a closer look first.

Records show that the first Worshipful Master was John Featherstone from Moat Road, in Harryville.The current WM is Sir Knght Desmond Armstrong, a Harryville native himself.From the beginning, the Preceptory has had strong but  links with Cullybackey.It was an ‘unwritten rule’ that the WM was a town resident one year and a Cullybackey man in the following year.This is the Preceptory’s fourth banner and replicates the first with imagery illustrating the Biblical ‘Arise and eat for the journey is far’ on one side and Britannia on the other.The original name of the preceptory was also incorporatedGuest speaker at the unfurling, which was held at St. Patrick’s Church of Ireland, Ballymena, was Sovereign Grand Master Rev William Anderson JP.Rev JJ Andrews of Ballee Presbyterian Church dedicated the banner.

Matt Aumlkerfeldt worked as Nikolaj Coster-Waldau’sstand in and body double from  to the show’s grand end this year. Caution - Contains spoilersyou haven’t watched the final season yet!Matt applied to be an extra on the show when it first came to Northern Ireland then ended up landing a full on role.“I did a few days of extra work and then got noticed by the casting staff as I bore a resemblance to Nikolaj, who played Jamie Lannister.“Most of my measurements were the same as him, down to even my hand size which was vital from season three as Jamie has his hand cut off. “I worked about  days a year on the show and then during season eight I was there pretty much every day!”In ‘real le’, Matt, who is , loves working in the Fairhill branch of Cafe Nero’s.  Born in Sweden, Matt moved to Northern Ireland when he was a child with his mum. He has adopted the Ballymena area as his home and says Game of Thrones helped keep him here. He explained: “I would get in before all the other cast and crew and have a rough idea of what scenes were going to be shot that day. I’d then go over them with the director and the camera guys plus the director of photography.“I’d be given some direction and then take part in crew rehearsals. After this would be the full rehearsal with all the extras, so by the time the main cast come on set I’ve probably gone through the scene about  times!“Nikolaj would then come on and get some short notes from the director before I’d also give him notes as I’ve already ran the scene. My face is never actually recorded on camera but I’ve been in every one of his scenes. “Working then as a body double was dferent. When doing this I dressed up in the character of Jamie and picked up the shots.“This even applied to the nude scenes, which I was comfortable with as I’m not really a shy person and don’t get nervous easily!”Although it would be practically impossible to tell the dference between Matt and Nikolaj on screen, Matt said: “I know all the scenes I did and,anything, it’s a bit illusion breaking as I also know what’s behind the scene!”So what was Matt’s favourite moment from the whole Game of Thrones season  His answer was the iconic trial of Jamie Lannister in Season .“All the main cast were together,” Matt explained.“On that day Nikolaj got wrapped early so when he’s not on screen all the actors are actually looking at me and I was delivering his lines to them. “I had this amazing line up of actors looking at me. It was a big moment in the whole series and I suppose I was relatively nervous!“When action is called, it’s like your le stops, you’re no longer in this world you feel you’re actually in Westeros. Then when cut is called everyone is back to normal. It’s amazingnot a little weird!”Being a body double meant that Matt wore the original costumes.“I wore Nikolaj’s costume alot, including the armour which is real.“I had to keep my body a certain shape so as to fit it plus I did have to keep pretty fit to carry it.“When we started working with the gold hand, my own arm was strapped behind my back, which was pretty uncomfortable, but the fake arm was amazing. It looked very real, down to the pours and hair on the skin.”It’s no secret that the last season of Game of Thrones was surrounded in secrecy! So how did Matt handle keeping the secret that almost  million people wanted to know He revealed: “I certainly didn’t tell too many people!“For nine years I kept all the secrets of the show and, especially in the last season it really was such a burden as there were so many consperies. It became hard to not talk about it and I really just wanted to tell someone about it.”Many of the ludicrous rumours about how the show would end were indeed , however Matt did confirm that scripts were destroyed after each scene was filmed.He said: “There were hundreds of people in the crew during the last season so it got to the point that sets were closed.“There was also misinformation circulated. One part of the crew would be told a certain detail about a scene or filming while another would be told something , all just to throw people off the scent of what was really going on.  “On one occasion Nikolaj went to Seville just so as people would think he was filming there when infact he wasn’t.”Final EpisodeThe final episode and season was met with much acclaim but it wasn’t without some negative reviews. Many people thought the ending wasn’t as dramatic as should have been, and some were left disappointed.To a certain extent, Matt agrees.“I think there was alot of character progression over the years that was forgotten about or pushed aside during the final season, and perhaps some characters could have had a more gloried end. “Perhaps the writers were concentrating on dferent projects. “My view was that this was the last season, we should have gone all out!”On Jamie’s last scene, where he died under a pile of rubble in the arms of his sister, Matt has his own philosophy.“In my head I’d like to think that Jamie was actually going to kill Cersei so as he could have a proper future with Brienne of Tarth.”Matt talks fondly of all the cast members, especially Nikolaj.He said: “I love Nikolaj. I obviously spent alot of time with him and I went to the wrap party which was great too.Gwendoline Christie, who played Brienne of Tarth was a lovely lady and I was friends with Jacob Anderson who played Greyworm. I got to know everyone well and generally everyone was really nice.” Le after Game of ThronesThe future is certainly bright for Matt as he aspires to get more recognised as an actor.“Currently I’m working at the Game of Thrones exhibition in Belfast and doing some photography work.“I’ve started a series of YouTube videos going round the Thrones locations in Northern Ireland and explaining them.“I recently did a video from Cushendun caves, which is special to me as it’s actually where Nikolaj and I had our last scene together.“From that I was noticed by a writer, currently writing a movie and was sent the script. So I potentially have the opportunity to be part of the main cast for that upcoming movie. “I don’t have an agent as I need a showreel of me infront of the camera, sothis movie works out I’ll get the showreel then hopefully an agent and we’ll see where it goes from there.“I also really want to keep my job in Nero’s as I love it there!”Looking back, Matt had such a great experience working on Thrones.“It was a great nine years! But when it all aired and all the secrets were out I felt really free. It was like a car had been lted off my shoulders as there was so much information I had to keep to myself!”Matt still hasn’t watched the final season on TV.“I still miss it as it was better than anything I’ve worked on before but I’ll watch it at some point, I know what happens at the end of the day!” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2228521.jpg--.jpg?1567156924000\n","title":"j p corry site re opens","story":"Local builders’ merchants, JP Corry, officially reopened its’ Ballymenabranch on Monday th August following a devastating fire that closed the site just  weeks ago.

Councillor Carol Black said that she that she was in favour of allowing the sale of alcohol toat Buskfest, which was held last weekend, to be reinstated.“I would like the council to do a rethink.If a beer festival can get approval, I don’t see why a beer tent at a music festival should not be allowed,” explained Councillor Black.“I totally reject the notion that adults cannot, en masse, drink responsibly.”Referring to the council make-up in , which voted for a ban and was DUP-dominated, the UUP councillor added, “I am fed-up with the DUP dictating a ‘dry house’.Let people make their own decisions.”SDLP Councillor Seamus Doyle said it was time for the council to adopt a more “forward-thinking” approach to Buskfest, and other future major outdoor events Banbridge may stage.“As long as it’s well controlled I see no problem with that.Most festivals have controlled areas where drink can be purchased and consumed.Now that Oktoberfest has been approved that could set a precedent for the future,” explained Councillor Doyle.One councillor who has voiced strong opposition to the sell of alcohol at any outdoor event was Jim McElroy who stated at Monday’s meeting that the council was “breaking its own by-laws” by allowing Oktoberfest to sell alcohol. \"  \"  N.I. man Jonathon Conaghanconvicted of sexual communication with a child and grooming Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"car goes up in flames after teenagers come to driver s aid","story":"Two teenagers from Co Down have been praised for their brave actions in helping a man escape from his car before it went up in flames.Sean Kelly, , and Joshua Allen, , spotted smoke coming from the grille of the man’s car in the village of Dromore shortly after pm yesterday and raised the alarm.Sean Kelly and Joshua Allen, the Dromore teenagers who rescued a man from a car which caught fireJoshua said: “We were on our way back from the shop.

However, he says that he hopes his run will raise awareness of mental health issues and suicide.“I’ve done several charitable runs in the past, but my main inspiration has been kids who have a certain condition and affliction and their parents seem quite helpless,” he explains.“I felt I couldn’t really help them in any way, so the only thing I could think of was to run to raise money for the charities that help them. I hate running, but it’s the only way I could help – I can’t do anything like a doctor would do or a counsellor would do.“Unfortunately depression, anxiety, suicide and mental health issues are getting worse in Northern Ireland, especially around West Belfast and North Belfast, which is really, really sad. For many people they don’t feel like they can talk to anyone or that they can speak up, because there’s still a lot of stigma attached to it, which is wrong. “We all go through issues, we all have problems – others might be better able to deal with them men in particular struggle to open up, but we all need to offload. If you have a toothache you’ll go to the dentist before it falls out,you have a sore leg you’ll go to the doctor before it breaks, but people ignore every sign from their minds that they need help. “It will help you in the long run and there is help available. There are charities that do it for free and they offer an amazing service. I myself have availed of it. I went to see a counsellor when I was having a tough time of it, and somebody took me aside and said ‘you need help’ and I’m glad I did, otherwise I might have been more unfortunate. “Depression is indiscriminate, whether you’re rich or poor, young or old, it can affect everyone. It’s important to be sympathetic to someone in that situation, because it could be you, your best friend or family member that needs that help. Hopefully, this run will be able to raise more awareness about these issues.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"city hall in the pink for organ donation week","story":"BELFAST City Hall was illuminated pink on Monday night as part of Organ Donation week.

Donald previously worked at Altnagelvin Hospital in Londonderry, where he met fellow doctor Emma before moving to Antrim four years ago. He says he is hugely moved by the response to Barrys social media post: \"It was quite overwhelming to read comments from parents of babies I delivered seven years ago and still remembered me.\"My we and I got quite emotional about it.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson last night insisted \"I dont want an election, you dont want an election\" but he said he would not seek an extension to the Brexit deadline - which is what a cross-party alliance is demandingthere is not a deal. DUP leader Arlene Foster denied Mr Johnson was playing a dangerous game of brinkmanship and said MPs should give him more time to negotiate a deal with the EU.\"Others are absolutely playing games because they are trying to stop the Prime Minister from getting a deal that works for the whole of the United Kingdom,\" she told ITV News.\"Everybody knows that the issue is in and around the backstop and it has to be dealt with, and the Prime Minister is making progress. \"He said today he is making progress in relation to the negotiations and talking to his colleagues in the EU.\"So therefore he should be given the space and time to do that.\"Mrs Foster said her party would stand on its record of delivery of £bn of benefits to Northern Ireland it extracted from its confidence and supply deal with the Tories.\"Political parties in Northern Ireland cannot be afraid of elections, and were not afraid of elections,\" she added.\"But we dont believe its the right time, because what we should be concentrating on it getting a deal.\"A senior Government source said Mr Johnson would request a general election on October MPs back the cross-party move to seize control of Commons business today. A motion for the early election will be tabled by the Government which would require the support of two-thirds of MPs under the provisions of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act . The Government source said MPs will face a \"simple choice\". The source said the vote would be treated as though it is a vote of no confidence, and that any Conservative MP voting against the Government would have the whip removed from them. The source said: \"If they vote to wreck the negotiation process, to go against giving Britain the ability to negotiate a deal, then theyll also have to reflect on what comes next.\" October  was the date scheduled for the Queens Speech under Mr Johnsons controversial plan to suspend Parliament for up to five weeks. The Government source said the motion on an early election would be published before MPs vote today so they would know the consequences of their actions. The source said thatMPs were to vote to take control of the order paper, and \"so destroy the Governments negotiating position, to make it impossible for the UK to negotiate a deal with Brussels, then the vote would then move to an FTPA vote, which I would expect to bring about a general election\".\"I thinkyou were to have any chance of securing a deal, which the PM has been very clear that he wants the deal, you would want to have that election on October  so that you can go to European Council and secure a deal.\" The European Council summit meeting of EU leaders on October  is seen as the last chance to achieve an agreement before the October  deadline. Confirmation that Mr Johnson would seek an election rather than risk another delay to Brexit came after he used a statement in Downing Street to plead with would-be rebels not to join Labours Jeremy Corbyn in backing a \"pointless\" extension to the process. The Prime Minister claimed the chances of a Brexit deal are rising and he was \"encouraged by the progress we are making\" with Brussels. ButMPs voted against the Government and backed the cross-party Bill they would \"chop the legs out from under the UK position\". \"I say, to show our friends in Brussels that we are united in our purpose, MPs should vote with the Government against Corbyns pointless delay,\" Mr Johnson said. \"I want everybody to know there are no circumstances in which I will ask Brussels to delay. We are leaving on October , no s or buts.\" Former chancellor Philip Hammond and ex-justice secretary David Gauke are among the senior Tories who have put their name to cross-party legislation which the group hopes to push through the Commons this week. If MPs agree today to allow the cross-party group to seize control of Commons business, the legislation will be considered tomorrow. Under the terms of the proposed law, the Government must seek a delay to the UKs withdrawal from the EU until January , there is no agreement with Brussels in place by October  and Parliament has not approved a no-deal Brexit. Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said it could be Parliaments \"last chance\" to stop a \"reckless and damaging\" no-deal Brexit. The Prime Ministers statement came as Tory MPs enjoyed a reception in the gardens of Downing Street - after being ordered to hand in their phones. The BBC said the DUP were also in attendance.Earlier, Mr Johnson was accused of \"goading\" some Tory MPs to rebel so he can force a snap general election having ejected opponents of a no-deal Brexit from the party. \"I think they seem to be quite prepared for there to be a rebellion, then to purge those who support the rebellion from the party,\" Mr Gauke told BBC Radio s Today. Labour leader Mr Corbyn, who called a meeting of his shadow cabinet in Salford to discuss tactics.He also said no-deal meant \"damage and danger\" to the peace process in Northern Ireland.He will be joined by other opposition leaders in Westminster - including the SNPs Ian Blackford and Liberal Democrat Jo Swinson - for further talks about their approach tomorrow.Belfast-born Labour MP Kate Hoey last night indicated she would defy her party leader.\"Any MP who votes for this Bill will be showing more loyalty to the European Union than to the United Kingdom,\" she tweeted.The Alliance Party saida general election is called \"we will fight it on a campaign to stop Brexit\". \"Given the recent speculation on an election, preparations are under way and Alliance believes that we are well placed to be competitive in a number of constituencies,\" a spokesman said.Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard said the Conservatives \"have literally allowed the chaos to infiltrate every single part of the Parliament\". Meanwhile, the SDLP has accused the DUP of blocking its proposal in Belfast City Hall to take legal action to prevent the suspension of Parliament.Councillor Seamus De Faoite said: \"Instead of taking the fight to Boris Johnson, Sinn Fein and the Alliance Partys silence meant the DUP blocked our proposal to fight this attempt to undermine the Good Friday Agreement and force a no-deal Brexit on a city that didnt vote for it.\""},{"url":null,"title":"american coastguard boat washes up on irelands west coast","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But here the PA news agency takes a look at how the mooted election for October  could pan out and the factors that may trouble political leaders:– Where would a Tory majority come from The PM will be banking on overturning the losses made by his predecessor, Theresa May, to give him the parliamentary power to drive through his Brexit plans.He would hope to do this by sniping off Labour Leave seats by accusing Jeremy Corbyn of causing a “pointless delay” to Brexit, as Mr Johnson did in his Downing Street speech on Monday.Mr Johnson would also need to hold on to Brexit-backing seats in the South West where the Liberal Democrats pose a threat. His first major challenge as PM was the by-election in the mid-Wales constituency of Brecon and Radnorshire, which voted % to Leave in the referendum. The Lib Dems overturned the Tory majority to win the seat with a swing of nearly % last month.– Can the PM charm lelong Labour voters in its northern heartlands Mr Johnson is an Old Etonian whose path to premiership was paved with study at Oxford University and the editorship at the Spectator magazine. He is not the typical candidate to win the support of traditional Labour voters.But they may see him as being closely aligned with their views on Brexit, with many Labour seats in the north having supported Leave.Mr Corbyn, on the other hand, backs blocking no-deal and wants a second referendum on any agreement hammered out with the EU.And there are two major precedents for Mr Johnson’s reputation as a “Heineken” Conservative who can reach parts of the electorate other Tories cannot. He was twice successful in becoming mayor in Labour-leaning London, in  and .However, much has changed since those elections.– A clear-cut Brexit threat\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Nigel Farage could pose the greatest threat to the PM Some pundits believe the main battleground may not fall on traditional turf, and may in fact be between the Tories and Nigel Farage’s insurgent Brexit Party.While Mr Johnson has always said he would enact no-deala fresh agreement is not won, the former Ukip boss presents a more clear-cut argument.Mr Farage argues no-deal is the only legitimate Brexit.Mr Johnson has faced questions as to whether he would form some sort of pact with the Brexit Party in order to ward of its threat and win a poll.But, so far, Mr Farage appears to not want to form an alliance while Mr Johnson remains publicly in favour of a deal with the EU.– A slump in Scottish support Ruth Davidson was seen as a modern Tory capable of winning support from across party lines until she announced her resignation as Scottish Conservative leader, citing her “conflict” over Brexit.The SNP already holds a large majority of seats north of the border, but her departure has raised fears that the Tories could shed votes in the  constituencies it currently commands.– What does the polling say It is crucial to point out the polling does not attempt to tell us what will happen on any election day, but rather should be treated as a snapshot of opinion at a very specic period.But they can be useful to give us an insight into what voters are currently thinking.Right now, Mr Corbyn should be deeply troubled, while the PM is offered little reassurance. An average of polls puts Labour on %, a figure that has been relatively steady in recent months, while the Lib Dems are close behind on %.The Tories have increased their share to % in the wake of Mr Johnson’s selection as Conservative leader, a change that mirrored a fall in support for the Brexit Party.It is dficult to estimate seats won from share of the national vote, but Mrs May failed to secure a Commons majority despite winning % of the vote.And there are fears a Remain alliance could lock out the Tories.– The Lib Dems and a pact against Brexit\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Brecon victor Jane Dodds and Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson If the Lib Dems could conquer the Leave-backing Brecon seat, then its hopes must be boosted in EU-favouring areas.The party has perhaps been most vocal and clear in its Remain support, having quickly come out in favour of a second referendum.And they are in favour of forging a Remain alliance to combat Brexit along with Plaid Cymru, the Greens and some independents.The non-aggression pact would see candidates tactically stand aside so they can maximise the benefits from pro-EU support.Labour is not in favour of joining the allegiance, but all the same it could pose a threat to some Tory seats.The Lib Dem victory in Brecon was interpreted as the first alliance success after Plaid Cymru and the Greens both stood aside.– What’s the view from an elections expert Sir John Curtice, a professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde, thinks the Tories will have a battle just to maintain the minority they have, but gives them a shot of winning a majority.He said they could lose out to the SNP, that defeats to the Lib Dems are “inevitable” and that “in order to stand still” they must make gains from Labour.“The truth is with an eight-point lead they probably would make enough gains but whether they get an overall majority: a   shot,” he told BBC Radio ’s Today programme.The real battle, he believes, is the showdown between the PM and Mr Farage over who can win the hearts of Brexit voters.“Boris Johnson will be going into an early election saying, ‘I don’t want my hands tied by a no-deal being taken off the table, but I want a deal,” Sir John said.“Nigel Farage, on the other hand, will be saying hang on now we should just be leaving without a deal.“That could be the crucial debate upon which any early election might well turn.”"},{"url":null,"title":"baby monkey born at london zoo named after astronaut buzz aldrin","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Amongst the pupils at the house which was called Tanus, was a young Samuel Beckett who attended there between the age of five and nine.The school was located on the Leopardstown Road between Foxrock and Stillorgan and in his later years literally giant still recalled that the place had a big lawn where, between classes, he and his brother Frank would play with the other children.Also, whilst they were attending the school, the Beckett’s father acted as a surveyor for a new building that the Elsner’s had constructed at the end of their garden to act as a gymnasium.Having obviously inherited her father’s undoubted musical talent, Alex attended the Royal College of Music in London where she honed her contralto voice and on herto Ireland in  and took part in concerts with many of Dublin’s musical societies and remained an extremely popular choice for private recitals in the fashionable houses of the capital.Later in the s Alexandrina Elsner was travelling north to sing in Belfast and the North West as well. Amongst her first memorable appearances in Derry was a performance as a soloist at a St Columb’s Choral Union concert in February  and at another concert in October  at the city’s new Opera House on Carlisle Road.The stature of the appearance of Miss Elsner at Derry’s Opera House, which had opened in , should not be underestimated since there were very few venues of this stature in Ireland at the time that attracted only the top acts of the time. In fact, the Derry newspapers - the Standard, Derry Journal and Londonderry Sentinel lauded her as one of the most favoured performers of the local audiences.Renowned Italian opera companies regularly visited Derry to perform and such was the popularity of the city’s Opera House that late night train services for audiences were often laid on from Inishowen and in the city late evening tram services allowed audiences to travel more easily to the shows.When she married Abraham Stewart on June ,  Alex Elsner moved to Derry where she wasted no time in throwing herself into the cultural le of a city esteemed for not only for its love of music but its wealth of talent as well.Just two years after her arrival in her new home, Alexandrina had established the Londonderry Philharmonic Society and Londonderry Feis. The Feis, beginning as a single day event on April ,  eventually bloomed into a week-long festival of music and singing by the s and she herself took lead roles in the bi-annual performances of the Philharmonic Society.The budding impresario wisely took counsel from the organisers of the Feis Ceoilin her native city of Dublin and invited a representative to Derry to advise on how to establish a local version. As a result, Derry became the second place in Ireland to establish such a festival, beating Sligoand Belfastto the punch.Initially, there were just a few competitions – for church choirs, factory choirs, school choirs, drum and flute bands, brass bands and for solo singers as well as special medals for songs sung in Gaelic awarded by the Derry branch of the Gaelic League. The interest of budding competitors was immediately taken as the workers of the famed city shirt factories quickly scrambled to form choirs specically for the Feis.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshIn advance of the first year of competition, by February of  three of the factories established four choirs. Welch Margetson  Co and Hogg  Mitchell both entered a choir each, whilst the much larger workforce at Tillie  Henderson entered two choral groups.With the passing decades the Feis gained more and more competitors and its repertoire of competitions expanded as a result not just from all over Ireland but from Scotland and England as well. As its prestige also increased, many of Derry’s businesses were glad to be associated with its success and donated beautul gold and silver cups and medals. Bursary schemes for those intent in pursuing a professional le in music and singing also began.In , just a year after partition, another woman Mrs Edward HenryO’Doherty founded Feis Doire Colmcille along with Fr Joseph McGettigan. The Derry Feis centred more upon Irish music, dancing and singing but despite the obvious cultural dferences, competitors from the Catholic and Protestant communities competed in both feiseanna without exception.Alexandrina Stewarts devotion to the Londonderry Philharmonic Society was equal to her commitment to the feis. Apart from featuring her own distinguished performances, the concerts also featured many distinguished musical names from both London and Dublin.In an era long before manufactured television vehicles, the twice-yearly Derry concerts also attracted talent scouts from far and near seeking bookings for their concert halls and opera houses.And, a major talent was spotted as the result of the Philharmonic Society’s concert in Derry on March , . James Johnston, a native of Belfast was well-known as an amateur singer in his younger days but was practically untrained at the highest level. Instead he concentrated as a career in butchery in his father’s shop and supplemented his income as a semi-professional singer at venues around Ireland.It was after his performance in Derry that he was snapped up by the Dublin Grand Opera Society and so began a huge career as an opera singer. It was after highly memorable performances in Rigoletto in Ireland’s capital in , the globally renowned theatrical director Tyrone Guthrie offered him a contract at Sadler’s Wells where he became principal tenor for well in excess of a decade.During his career Johnston played a wide range of roles which included his Covent Garden debut in La Traviata in  and also appeared with Maria Callas and Joan Sutherland. Johnston retired at the height of his fame in  and simply ed to working in the family butcher’s business in Belfast’s Sandy Row where he lived out the remainder of his le until he died aged  in .Johnston’s success however was entirely based on being spotted in Derry and to the efforts of Alex Stewart’s in establishing the city’s Philharmonic Society. It too sprang from relatively humble beginnings, with having just over  in the chorus and nineteen strong orchestra in . By the s the society accounted for  voices and a  strong orchestra that drew its membership from all classes across Derry.The pinnacle of Alex’s own musical career had perhaps come in March  when she was soloist for the celebrated Halle Orchestra at St Columb’s Hall. The orchestra had been founded in  in Manchester by Sir Charles Halle to perform at the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition in January . The orchestra exists to this day and has been in residence at the Bridgewater Hall in Manchester since .Abraham Stewart died suddenly in  and as a result, Alexandrina ed home to her family in Dublin, but ed to Derry every year without fail during feis week. The Feis Committee awarded her the honorary title of administrator and offered to pay the fare for herjourney for le.On May ,  Alex McCausland Elsner Stewart died at a nursing home in Dublin and her remains were brought to Derry and buried beside those of her husband in the city cemetery. The couple had two sons and a daughter. Her daughter, also called Alexandrina, had been killed just a few weeks previously whilst on active service in Burma during World War II.Abraham and Alexandrina had lived at the prestigious Crawford Square in Derry and it was there on April ,  that the Ulster History Circle unveiled a blue plaque marking her le and contribution to the cultural le of her adopted city.Commenting on the unveiling of the blue plaque, Chris Spurr from the Ulster History Circle said: “When Alexandrina Stewart embraced Ireland’s city of music, the result was a harmonious partnership founding the first Londonderry Philharmonic Society and the Derry Feis Ceoil.”CAPTION: The Londonderry Philharmonic Society on stage at the Guildhall."},{"url":null,"title":"derry needs gallery art lovers devastated loss ebrington gallery","story":"Art lovers in Derry have expressed their “disappointment” at the loss of an Ebrington gallery space which hosted the most prestigious modern art competition in the UK a matter of years ago.The Derry News exclusively revealed that Nerve Visual is set to close its doors at the end of this week.Artists based in the city say we should “demand” that this space is used to showcase the local arts scene and,properly promoted, it will prove to be a “massive draw” for both tourists and the local community.Since the announcement, people who are passionate about arts and culture have aired their views.National Museum NI curator, Kim Mawhinney, said: “I am devastated to hear this. We worked with Nerve Visual to bring two of our most impactful exhibitions from the Ulster Museum to Derry.”The exhibitions referred to are Silent Testimony and Art of the Troubles. “Derry needs this gallery!” she added.The Nerve Centre reopened the former Turner Prize gallery space as Nerve Visual in June  when it was lauded as a “major new venue for visual arts in the Northern Ireland”.A spokesperson for the Nerve Centre said it has received no core funding and was programmed and funded on a project by project basis.In just over three years it has hosted  successful exhibitions.However, writer and art critic Dominic Kearney said he couldn’t understand why it was so poorly attended, particularly as the Turner Prize was such a success at the same location.Nerve Visual only took over a section of the Creative Hub Building   in  but during the City of Culture year in  the same gallery space hosted the prestigious Turner Prize - one of the best-known visual arts prizes in the world.Mr Kearney believes the location is “terric” and “exactly” what Ebrington needs. “The space is perfect for a gallery and the exhibitions that they had there were very impressive.“The Troubles Art exhibition, Future Artist Makers and the Colin Davidson one was stunning, I’d hesitate to say beautul given the nature of its subject, but it was incredibly powerful.“It’s the only gallery that’s open to the public in Derry that deals with mainstream, accessible, representational art. For this to close is really going to detract from the local art scene, from Ebrington, the Waterside and Derry as a whole. Like a pebble dropped in a pond, the ripple effect will spread out from that building to the outer ring of the entire city.”He added: “It’s such a shame, in six years it’s gone from hosting the most prestigious modern art competition in UK to a couple of empty rooms.“People can only have so many cups of coffee, tourists need something to do when visiting the city. If there was a gallery dedicated to Irish art with links to galleries in Dublin, the Ulster Museum, and maybe Britain. Tourists would definitely want to go there as galleries are the type of thing people look for.”‘Massive draw’Local artists were regularly showcased at the Nerve Visual gallery.Stephen Lewis has lived in Derry for over  years, he’s an artist based at Bishop Street Studios who also works with the arts charities Creative Village Arts and ArtLink at Fort Dunree. He expressed his “disappointment” at the gallery’s closure.“There have been recent initiatives by the Nerve Visual, Tower Museum and An Culturalann to give folk here a chance to see art that is held in their own national collections - but it simply goes back to the inability to keep a space that is equipped to do this open.“People in the North West should not have to travel to Belfast to see their own art - The Ulster Museum often has  or  art exhibitions on at any one time - we built a world class gallery in  and we really should demand that this becomes our space to see our own art collections - properly advertised it could be a massive draw for locals and tourists alike.\"It’s understood there will be plenty of people interested in taking over occupancy of the building but at this stage it is unclear what will be based there.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures 39 wall wall sunshine 39","story":"Berriew Show President and grandfather, Mark Bright, presents cup winner in the ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtover s fancy dress ltspan classtruncate-full-screengtto Olivia Jonesfrom Berriew.

Work to widen Fountain Street to provide on-street parking and traffic calming measures has already been completed, while a pound, project at Collinsrsquo Corner is currently underway.Roads officials have previously suggested the introduction of a one-way system but little or nor progress appears to have been made on this particular scheme.While pleased with the work in Fountain Street and Collinsrsquo Corner, Cllr Curran believes they will not have a positive impact on town centre congestion, prompting his call to meet with senior roads engineers. He is also concerned that no progress is being made to tackle a congestion and road safety issue at Edward Street in the town.His call for talks to discuss solutions to town centre congestion came ahead of a special meeting between councillors and roads officials last night when the Department of Infrastructure presented its annual report which details work that has already been completed on ious schemes and what projects are in the pipeline.Cllr Curran said the annual report contained no ldquoconcrete proposals for addressing town centre congestion, prompting his call to meet with engineers.ldquoA proposed road between Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue has been shelved due to the cost involved and the minimal impact it would have on tackling congestion, he said. ldquoThat is why we need to get round the table and look at all options moving forward.ldquoCan lessons be learned from other towns which experienced similar problems or what about changing the sequencing of traffic lights  he asked.ldquoIt has been said many times that there is no quick fix solution to Downpatrickrsquos congestion problem and while the layout of the town may pose problems for engineers, surely it is time for some innovative thinking ldquoAll the key players need to get together as years of inaction has exacerbated the congestion nightmare faced by residents, businesses and visitors.Cllr Curran says the time has come to ldquograsp the congestion nettle with the onus on roads officials to finally deliver by taking a critical look at the problems.ldquoWe need to take a critical look at the problem and come up with ideas on the way forward. I suspect that the congestion issue that we have in Downpatrick would not be allowed to go unaddressed in any other major town in the country. We have had numerous reports on the way forward but what people, in particular those in the business community what to see, is action, he continued.ldquoDownpatrick councillors need to join forces and sit down with roads engineers to look at what can be done. Apart from the development of the Saul Way link road, there has been no major traffic development in Downpatrick town centre for decades.ldquoThe congestion problem is getting worse andthe ambitious plans to redevelop the former Irish Street police station base and adjoining buildings are to be a success and attract new commercial and private development, we need to solve the traffic problem.Cllr Curran added: ldquoThe congestion is driving shoppers out of the town and we need to arrest this decline. To achieve this, I believe that we need a brainstorming sessions to come up with a new blueprint on the way forward.

Housing Executive workmen carried out repairs, but seven months ago the fireplace again broke up. Since then repeated calls to the Executive met with little or no response.ldquoWith winter fast coming we needed this fireplace fixed, said Mr Terry McGrory. ldquoDuring the summer months we managed to make do, but therersquos no way we could face cold nights without a fire in our living room.ldquoSince February wersquove had to do without a fire and it was beginning to look like it wouldnrsquot be fixed at all.

I hope that by implementing this action plan we can make a real dference to the residents of our district.Last year, there was across-the-board political support for a motion calling for a major housing conference to take place to address the social housing crisis.At the time, it was revealed that Newcastle was a social housing need hot spot with  people on the waiting list for new homes classed in the urgent need category.Politicians were told that a lack of available land to build new homes was exacerbating the crisis in a resort where rented properties were at a premium, with houses that do come on the market snapped up by people for use as holiday homes.Councillors say they are keen for all ious stakeholders collaborating to provide short, medium and long term solutions to tackle the crisis.In addition, they are keen to see a focus on building appropriate housing for the changing needs of the district, including the increasing demand for single occupancy dwellings and housing that meets the needs of vulnerable people.Politicians say more affordable housing is also required as house price growth is higher in Newry, Mourne and Down than the average growth experienced across Northern Ireland.They say there is a need to plan for long term needs, tackle homelessness and the poverty gap, social housing development and accessible homes provision.Politicians say they hope that by working with partners across the statutory, community, voluntary and private sectors, they can come up with solutions..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/28th August 2019 Special.jpg","title":"Special film of Canon’s Excursion brings back memories  ","story":"THE screening

ahead of the annual excursion so everyone was looking their best, with families gathering at the St Dillonrsquos Avenue sports pitches before marching to the townrsquos bus station via Edward Street, John Street, Irish Street and Market Street.A fun-filled day was spent in Newcastle, when the summers always felt warmer than they are today, with families ing home by bus, exhausted after a frantic

being spearheaded by the Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association.It helped put together the short film which captures some of the the sights and sounds of the Canonrsquos Excursion which was one of

Model Farm and Flying Horse areas.A number of cars were again pelted with stones as they drove along the Killough Road, while several fires were also started on Saturday evening.On Sunday, part of the Brannish Road was reported to be barricaded with branches and supermarket trolleys with young people targeting passing cars with stones.The most disturbing incident occurred on Monday evening when a woman driving alone was left frightened after her car was stoned on the Brannish Road as she made her way to work.Police have confirmed that they are aware of the recent trouble and warned those responsible for the unruly behaviour that their involvement could lead to a criminal record and harm their future university and employment prospects.Officers have also appealed to anyone who can assist them with their enquiries to contact them as they work to apprehend those responsible for the trouble.The Flying Horse Ward Community Forum mdash which earlier this year organised a public protest to call for an end to trouble at this part of the town mdash has condemned the weekend incidents.The grouprsquos chairwoman, Lisa Perry, said the continuing trouble was ldquosimply not acceptable and must end. She also appealed to parents to know where their children are and what they are doing.Ms Perry said children need to be taught to respect the community where they live, the people of the Model Farm and Flying Horse areas and those who commute along the Killough Road.ldquoResidents and those who use the Killough Road should not have to put up with such behaviour and anyone who knows who is responsible should contact the police, she said.Ms Perry said the message must go out that stoning cars is not acceptable and that those responsible will not be be allowed to get away with what they are doing.ldquoIt does not bear thinking about what would happena driver whose car is stoned loses control of the vehicle and crashes into pedestrians or someonersquos home. Those who throw missiles at cars need to realise the potential consequences of what they are doing. For drivers, this is a terribly frightening experience.Angry residents have also taken to social media to voice their concern about the trouble which has been prevalent at this part of Downpatrick for many years.Parents have also been urged to warn their children not to get involved in behaviour which could lead to serious consequences, with residents branding those responsible for the trouble as ldquodisgraceful. They said their parents should be doing more to stop the unruly behaviour, expressing concern that the trouble has been allowed to continue for too long and must be stopped.ldquoThe trouble is too frequent, said one woman, while a man revealed his van was stoned on two occasions at the Killough Road last month. Worryingly, he reported that children as young as  were responsible.Another resident expressed concern that a driver could lose control of their car after being stoned which could result in a crash and someone being seriously injured.South Down MLA Colin McGrath said local police must respond swtly to the anti-social behaviour, especially after Monday nightrsquos incident when a woman was attacked.ldquoThere has been an escalation of the anti-social behaviour in the Flying Horse and Model Farm area from a number of youths. Cars have been stoned, fires started and people assaulted. This behaviour is unacceptable, he declared.ldquoThe perceived inactivity of the authorities cannot be allowed to send a message that such behaviour is acceptable. The perpetrators must be dealt with.Mr McGrath said police and other statutory agencies require information to challenge the anti-social behaviour and apprehend those responsible.He added: ldquoInformation can be provided confidentially and is needed to help break this cycle of behaviour at this part of Downpatrick.Police have asked anyone who believes they can assist them with their enquiries to make contact using the non-emergency  number or the confidential Crimestoppers number,  ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/10309754.jpg","title":"bomb explodes newtownbutler amid major security alert","story":"Police at the scene of an ongoing security operation in Newtownbutler have confirmed that some form of explosive device has detonated in the area.Deputy Chief Constable Stephen Martin said: ldquoAt around .am this morning Police officers at the scene have reported an explosion in the area of the Cavan Road at its junction with the Wattlebridge Road.

We got his stuff out of the car and popped the hood. “I phoned the fire brigade and Sean and I redirected traffic to keep them away from the car until they came.“The fire started to escalate, within I’d say about  seconds of popping the hood the engine was fully on fire.“Thankfully the fire brigade got there before the petrol tank went up.”Joshua guessed the man, whom they helped back to his house in the village with the items they helped rescue from the car, was in his fties or sixties. A video has been circulated on social media of part of the incident and praise has been heaped on Sean and Joshua for their brave actions.Joshua commented: “It happened so quickly, natural instincts took over. You couldn’t stand by and watch that. He needed help. He didn’t have a clue that his engine was on fire. If we hadn’t done anything he could have died.”Both Joshua and Sean play rugby at Banbridge RFC and are former students at Newbridge Integrated College. The boys will start Banbridge Tech next month.Sean’s mother Lisa commented: “They were very brave and I’m very proud of them, but it could’ve went terribly wrong just as quickly.The Mid Sussex streets

Picture by Jonathan Porter Press EyeHosts Morgan and Reid clashed with former DUP health minister Mr Wells, who said that Strictly is “family viewing”, adding: “You’ve had a busy week, you sit down with the family and you watch pure entertainment.“The last thing you want is to be challenged or to be asked deep intellectual questions.”.ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog

.desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Mr Wells, who makes his opposition to same-sex marriage widely known, said that he believes same-sex couples should only be shown on Strictlyit were after the watershed of pm.He cited Blind Date, saying that the programme “went down the plughole” and that viewers switched off after the “radical” move to include homosexual and lesbian couples.Morgan and Reid asked what time he thinks gay couples should be allowed on TV, to which he replied: “Exactly the same time as the BBC thought two years ago, pm.”Morgan asked him: “What are you like at parties  Do you ever dance ”Mr Wells said he rarely dances in public, to which Morgan said: “When you danced and men came on the dancefloor, how did you feel  At what point did you feel like a man entering your orbit became a problem for you ”Reid also challenged Mr Wells’ views, asking: “Have you ever seen children dancing  They dance together, girls dance together, boys dance together, there’s nothing challenging about it.“Your concern is only about seeing gay couples - it’s not about children.”Morgan told him: “I think you’re just an old bigoted dinosaur, and you feel challenged because you don’t like the idea of scary gay people around you.”Referring to former Strictly professional Robin Windsor, who appeared on the programme and was sat next to him, the presenter added: “There’s one right next to you Jim, the whole time you’ve been talking you’ve been in close proximity to a gay man.”Only surviving signatory of

Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Windsor said that he thought Mr Wells’ belief that same-sex couples should only be seen dancing after the watershed was “an absolute disgrace”.During the debate, Mr Wells also said his views are not a “repressed” thing after Morgan told him: “Most people who have this weirdly anti-gay sentiment at some stage in their le have had a ‘feeling’.”After the politician claimed he was being insulted by Morgan, the broadcaster replied: “I’m not insulting you, I’m insulting your bigotry, which is irrational, inconsistent, makes no sense whatsoever, your favourite shows have loads of gay presenters on, there’s a gay judge on Strictly, you think that’s fine but you won’t have two people - who may not even be gay - dancing together.”Mr Wells, who lost the DUP whip after criticising the leadership last year, askedMorgan is meant to be impartial for the interview, to which Reid said: “How can you be impartial about homosexuality ”The politician claimed he has received a lot of support for speaking out about his views, but that people are “scared to stand by traditional values” in fear of the backlash.The BBC last week said that Strictly is an “inclusive show” and that they are “proud to have featured same-sex dancing amongst the professional dancers in group numbers in previous series”.A spokesman said: “We are completely open to the prospect of including same-sex pairings between our celebrities and professional dancers in the future, should the opportunity arise.”try catch  TrendingTransfer

The executors were Joe Cahill, one of the Provisional IRA’s most senior figures, and Dessie Mackin, who was convicted of IRA membership during the Troubles. At the time when the will was made, both men were Sinn Féin’s treasurers.Yesterday the only surviving signatory of the will, legal secretary Carmel Brady, told the News Letter that she remembered Mr Hampton arriving alone at the solicitor’s office where she worked, with the Englishman saying that “he was only visiting the area”..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default

.fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Last night the Electoral Commission restated that it had no concerns about the money and had no intention of launching an investigation.But yesterday the TUV leader Jim Allister wrote to the National Crime Agency, drawing to its attention to the “inextricable” link between the IRA and Sinn Féin at the time.The size of the donation to Sinn Fein is much larger than originally reported, the probate document for William E Hampton’s will has reveals.Last week the Electoral Commission reported that the party had received a total of £. million in two instalments since Mr Hampton’s death in a Welsh nursing home in January .However, the probate document states that his total assets were almost £. million.Once the expenses of the process and the small payments to other iniduals are made, that is likely to leave about £. million for Sinn Féin.The Press Association has reported that there was litigation around some of the assets, although it did not specy the nature or location of the legal battle.Last week Sinn Féin objected to questions about the source of Mr Hampton’s wealth, saying that he was from “a wealthy family”.The bequest is more than five times the size of the previous record known donation — the £, given to the DUP to promote Brexit in .Johnson faces showdown in Parliament as MPs seek to block no-deal Brexit Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Last week the News Letter asked Sinn Féin whether it knew how a retired mechanic came to have such a large sum of money and, given the extraordinary scale of the donation, what it had done to satisfy itself that the money was legitimate.In a brief statement the party responded: “Mr Hampton was from a wealthy family, so for you to question the legitimacy of his wealth without any foundation whatsoever falls well short of the objective standard we would expect from a professional journalist.“As with all donations required due diligence was carried out by Sinn Féin and in full compliance with the rules of the Electoral Commission.”Mr Hampton’s will – which was signed by him, a solicitor and a legal secretary – referred to him being “of no fixed abode as I am living in my mobile home in Ireland” but gave previous addresses at Fenstanton in Cambridgeshire and a solicitor’s address in Aberystwyth in Wales and an address in Durrus, Co Cork.The two-page typed document referred to “my assets in Ireland, England, Singapore and New Zealand” as well as “other assets I may have anywhere  in the world”.Listing Mr Cahill and Mr Mackin as the executors of his will, he gave  Parnell Square, Dublin as their addresses – the location of Sinn Féin’s southern headquarters.As well as providing for his debts, funeral and testamentary expenses to be paid, the will only provided for a few thousand pounds of his fortune to go to anyone other than Sinn Féin.He left £, to Rosalind Morton of Lowestoft, £, to Jim White of Hornchurch, £, to Labour MP Denis Skinner and £, to the former Private Eye journalist Paul Halloron.Mr Hampton then said that the rest of his estate should go to Sinn Féin, and set out detailed instructions as to what should happenSinn Féin was to split.He said that the money was to go to Sinn Fein “to cover election expenses, to fund Sinn Fein offices and advice centres and to aid republican prisoners and their families in both Ireland and Britain”.He went on: “For the purposes of clarication the organisation which I intend to benefit is commonly known as Provisional Sinn Féin to distinguish it from Republican Sinn Fein.“In the event that the organisation which is now known as Sinn Féin should cease to be in existence or should have split or taken on a dferent name at the date of death then I direct that my executors and trustees are to apply my money to the political party to which Mr Gerry Adams, MP then belongs.”He said thatMr Adams had died by that point that the money should go to the republican or nationalist partywith the largest number of elected councillors in “the six counties” – with the exception of the SDLP.At the weekend, The Sunday Independent reported that “sources paint a picture of a man who could only be described as a loner. He always lived alone and set up home in a number of countries, including a brief time spent in Co Cavan. It is also believed he lived abroad for a time including a period in France.”It added: “He has been described as a mechanic but, according to those who knew him, he liked to ‘tinker’ with cars.”Yesterday the Electoral Commission said it had “no plans” to investigate the circumstances of the gt to Sinn Fein.The commission said: “We are not investigating the donation received by Sinn Fein from Mr Hampton. The donation reported by the party was permissible as the donor was on a UK electoral roll within the five-year period prior to his death.”It added: “Political parties must report all donations and loans over £,accepted by the central party and over £,accepted by an accounting unit.“Political parties must only accept donations from permissible donors. It is the responsibility of political parties to check the permissibility of the donations they receive and to ensure they have systems in place to maintain their compliance with the law.”Mairia Cahill, the grand niece of Joe Cahill and now an SDLP member, said thather great uncle “had responsibility for finance for a number of dferent outfits,I can put it like that” and she was very close to him but that he had never mentioned Mr Hampton to her.try catch  TrendingTransfer Deadline Day RECAP: Rangers confirm pound.m Ryan Kent signing from Liverpool, Celtic sign three, four exit Ibrox, Hibs

Of those,  have been empty for more than two years.Landlords will be given incentives to bring long term empty properties into use as the council says they attract crime and anti-social behaviour, drive down values and become ldquodetrimental to the lives of residents.Measures are set out in a draft strategy which the councilrsquos cabinet, on July , agreed to publish for public consultation.While the council wants landlords to accept help to get homes in use, the strategy says theauthority will take actionnecessary.Vale council deputy leader Cllr Lis Burnett told the meeting she was ldquostunned more than  homes in the Vale have been empty for more than two years.ldquoItrsquos absolutely staggering, she said. ldquoA strategy on a way we can tackle it is very welcome.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The boys said they heard a tazer sound earlier in the evening but it went away.“But a couple of hours later, when we were all in bed, I heard the boys screaming that there was a fire,” she said.“My two nephews were in the house as well but all  of us got out safely,”Fire destroyed family home in Mourneview at the weekendAll the family were left with were their pyjamas.However after an appeal by Tanya’s friend Angie the entire Lurgan community and beyond rallied round to donate clothes and supplies to help the now homeless family.“I am just glad we all got out OK, everything  can be replaced,” said Tanya who admitted to being completely overwhelmed by the generosity and kindness of everyone.Already almost £k has been donated on a fundraising page as well as clothes, toiletries and essentials.The fire happened just before the children were to start back to school and through the generosity of the public, all of them were able to go with their correct school unorm.A plea went out on Sunday morning from Angie Thornbury asking for help, particularly for school unorms for the two eldestwho attend Brownlow Integrated College and the youngest Two boys aged  and six and three girls aged eight and five who attend Dickson Primary School.

I can’t believe all the stuff, all the clothes, even underwear and tooth brushes body wash.“Got to hand it to this town, when something tragic happens, everyone pulls together,” she said.Tanya said everyone has been traumatised by the fire and she has been grateful to her mum and her mum’s partner for letting them stay at both their houses since the fire.“It has split up the family so we need to get a new home,” said Tanya.Although she has been to the NI Housing Executive, they have no available housing in this area. “I would even take a two or three bedroom house, just to get a roof over the children’s heads,” she said.The -year-old mum said they are now looking at private rental - just for four to six weeks until the NIHE fix the house.“They said the upstairs is badly damaged and it could take around six weeks to fix it.”Now her hopes are pinned on getting a private rental in the Lurgan area for the next  weeks.“It has been very traumatic, especially for the children,” she said.Tanya has been so overwhelmed with the support and thefundraising page which has raised almost £k for the family. “I am so grateful but I think half of the money should go to charity, like a burns support charity. There are other people worse off than us.”DUP MLA Carla Lockhart, who has been helping the family, said: “My thoughts are with this family. I have been speaking with them and they are so thankful that they and their children are still alive.

Now in its st year, the region’s longest established listing of company performance provides insight on the accomplishments of Northern Ireland based companies, either Northern Ireland registered or where a signicant proportion of their business is transacted in the province. The  edition of the Top  incorporates analysis of figures filed at each companies year end and posted at Companies House and primarily relate to financial periods ending in late ,  and . SUMMARY Sales have grown to £.bn from £.bnwhich is a growth of .%. While extremely encouraging this result needs to be tempered with the fact that profits for the top companies decreased by nearly % to £.m. Shareholder value for the Top  companies increased by .%. Revenue sales Sales revenue is the income received by a company from its sales of goods or the provision of services. The performance of the Top  showing a .% sales growth to £.bn is exceptional in what is a dficult trading environment and period of uncertainty for the provinces businesses. The Brexit question came to the fore on June ,  so all the financial figures shown in the listing have come post the referendum and in essence since the suspension of the Assembly in January . Moy Park continues to hold sway with the highest turnover, currently £.bn, up from £.bn previously – snapping close at their heels is WR Barnett Ltd . Next in the listing are a number of high fliers, LCC Group Ltd and John Graham Holdings Ltd. John Graham Holdings Ltd, which trades as Graham, is another privately owned company based in Hillsborough and specialising in building and civil engineering projects – Graham posted annual sales of £.m in its latest financial accounts up from £.m – an increase of some .% year on year. One of the perennial high performers of the Top  showed a signicant decrease in sales dropping it from a position last year of  to a position this year of . Fane Valley Co-Operative‘s sales decreased from £m to £.m – this is a result of their change in ownership of Linden Foods. Linden Foods is now a joint venture and has entered the list at number  with sales of £.m. Another indicator of strong performance within the listing is that turnover figure required to gain access to the Ulster Business Top  is at its highest ever, with Heron Bros Ltd posting year end sales results for    of £.m. Last year’s number  was Cranswick Country Foodswith sales of £.m. This represents a rise in sales required of .%, to make the Top . Cranswick Country Foodshas risen to  in the listing posting impressive sales growth of %. Profitability Since the Ulster Business Top ’s inception in , we have identied the top companies by measuring turnover, while also accepting that both profitability and tangible shareholder value are also key measures of performance. This year has seen a drop in profit margin for the Top  companies from a margin of .% to .% with total profits now sitting at £.m compared to £.bn for the corresponding companies in their prior year. Northern Ireland Water Ltd has retained its position as the most profitable business within the listing, posting pre tax profits of £.m on a turnover of £.m a margin of .%. Northern Ireland Electricity Networks Ltd is second most profitable with pre tax figures of £m against a turnover of £.m . While the reduction in profitability of the Top  is disappointing this can be tempered by the fact that a number of the companies made signicant losses during the last filed figures recorded for the compilation of the listing. Short Bros PLC after currency adjustments filed losses of £.m, CaterpillarLtd posted losses of £.m, Northern Ireland Transport Holding Companyfiled losses of £.m, EP Kilroot Power losses of £m and Dunnes Stores Bangor Ltd losses of £m. The level of losses across the Top  listing is unprecedented with the  companies that posted losses amounting to £.m. Tangible net worth Tangible net worth is most commonly a calculation of the net worth of a company that excludes any value derived from intangible assets such as s, patents, goodwill and intellectual property. Tangible net worth is a simple calculation of a company’s total tangible assets minus the company’s total liabilities. A business’s tangible net worth provides a snapshot of your financial situation at this point in time. The current tangible net worth of the Ulster Business Top  currently sits at £.bn – as the Top  listing is fluid with companies entering and leaving the list any comparison with previous listing can be distorted, however compared to the  listing tangible net worth has increased by £m. Six of the companies within the Top  have liabilities that outweigh their assets. Increasing the tangible net worth shareholder value is of prime importance for the management of a company. So the management must have the interests of shareholders in mind while making decisions. The higher the shareholder value, the better it is for the company and management. The shareholdersfor the Ulster Business Top  equates to profit tangible net worth and as a percentage sits at % The sales to equity ratio defined as turnover tangible net worth provides an indicator of how much money are generated by the business with each pound invested, for the current Top  this amounts to .. Employees A total of , people are employed by Northern Ireland’s Top  Companies, a decrease from , employed by the companies in the  listing. Moy Park Ltd , Almac Group , Short Brothers PLC , Queen’s University , and Northern Ireland Transport Holding Companymake up the top five employers within the listing. Each employee within the Top  accounted for £, turnover – sales employee and accounted for £, profit – profit employee. Location Since the inception of the Top  we have periodically looked at the geographic location of the companies within Northern Ireland – historically the east of the province has held sway over the west – however, we are beginning to see a sht with currently  businesses based in Belfast, Co Antrim and Co Down, with Co Tyrone being a major recipient of Top  activity. Breaking down the sectors As would be expected when looking at the line of business activity of the Top , both the wholesale retail and manufacturing sectors dominate, accounting for some  of the companies.

Short Brothers files in dollars, while KN Networks Ltd and Lakeland Dairies Ltd files in euros. To allow for fair comparison their financial results have been amended to reflect the currency value at their financial year-end. .

We speak to founder Daniel Crawford and his team about the journey so far A spark in the mind of Daniel Crawford as he studied for his masters degree in Glasgow just a few years ago has grown into a business at the sharp end of technology. axialD is tasked with turning the complicated and laborious process of converting D medical scans into D models – and producing them for use by surgeons and medical professionals. It’s an ever-growing business, spun out of Ulster University, which is expanding its reach across the UK, Ireland and now into the US where it’s targeting a burgeoning fresh marketplace. The company has been involved with Catalyst since , been directly involved with a host of its programmes, and is participating in the EU INTERREG funded North West Centre for Advanced Manufacturing , managed by the Special European Union Programmes Body . Catalyst is Northern Ireland’s leading technology hub, home to  companies and around , staff. Daniel has a strong team around him – growing to  staff based in Belfast city centre, including Niall Haslam, chief technology officer, Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships and Cathy Coomber as operations manager. While studying medical visualisation and human anatomy in Glasgow, Daniel was exposed to the raft of imaging available – including CT, MRI and ultrasound, and began examining how the crucial data could be better used. The biomedical physics undergraduate grew the idea into his thesis – looking at converting D data sets and converting them into fully D printable files. “That allows us to turn images into D models to allow surgeons or registrars, to understand digital pathologies, before going in to theatre,” he said. “But we discovered it wasn’t just good for that and surgeons also wanted to get their hands on the D models.” That gave Daniel greater scope for developing the concept. In one early case, a surgeon was able to use one of the D prints to identy small fractures in a patient who had suffered a motorcycle crash, that weren’t initially apparent using more traditional methods. The company was thrust into Catalyst’s Springboard programme in  – a  week scheme which allowed a would-be entrepreneur, fresh out of university, access to business training and development, which included working with PathXL’s Stuart Harvey. From there, it was into the Halo programme – bringing axialD together with angel investors in order to get the start-up off the ground. It landed £, through Techstart and private investors, which allowed the company to get the ball rolling. Through Catalyst, Daniel also got the opportunity to visit MIT and the entrepreneurial development programme, Way to Scale, bringing axialD to Massachusetts and the Boston area – the global heart of the health technology sector. Niall Haslam is axialD’s chief technical officer. He said a Belfast and Boston partnership has helped strengthen the links between the cities, bringing firms from Northern Ireland to the US for both networking and scoping out the potential for setting up shop across the Atlantic. “The Way to Scale program brings entrepreneurs together. It’s a great networking opportunity,” Niall says. axialD is now a partner in the EU INTERREG-funded NW CAM, which brings together a network of research institutes, universities and enterprises to carry out research in advanced manufacturing. It is working with Ulster University on a number of projects, including looking at developing custom designed jigs for hospitals to produce D models. Cathy Coomber has been with axialD for three years. “What we have done in that time is looking at standardising the processes,” she says. “Biomedical engineers from Ulster University and those across the UK are producing data, manually segmenting thousands of medical images in order to help them develop an algorithm. “That allows us to massively improve our standardised process and reduce the time involved in producing those files.” That could mean reducing the time down from up to five hours, to as little as an hour. “When the company started, Daniel was able to get those early users excited in Glasgow, and then setting up in Belfast there were key surgeons which helped set the pace,” Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships said. The company has since been involved with NHS frameworks as a means to help remove as many bottlenecks as possible. This involves developing and marketing the products to the NHS and HSC in the Republic – helping them to learn about the product, the process and what area of specialism it can be used in. “In the last  months with the development of the algorithms, we are moving in to the US,” Katie said. “We’re seeing a lot of growth in the US.” And the axialD team is also growing fast. “We have  staff at the moment but are looking to expand in  months,” Daniel said. “That includes new staff in the US to help grow and manage that market as we further expand our software team back home.” The success of axialD mirrors the overall success of Catalyst, since its inception  years ago. It’s an independent not-for-profit organisation across its four sites – including its largest base at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, alongside its Londonderry hub, Ballymena, along with the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub at Danske Bank in Belfast city centre.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
