Worse, Moth had been diagnosed with corticobasal degeneration, a brain disease for which there was neither cure nor treatment. And yet, as Winn recalls in the opening of this, her second book, as they walked the clifftop paths from Minehead to Polruan, “he’d grown stronger. The fog in his brain had cleared, his movements had become surer, easier to control. Why, why, why had that happened?”Written as a gift for Moth, a record of their endurance, The Salt Path was shortlisted for the Costa book award and translated into 14 languages. And it caught the eye of Sam, a City trader with a farm beside a creek in Cornwall that is said to have partly inspired The Wind in the Willows. Sam offered Winn and Moth a free tenancy in return for reviving the wildlife on the farm. Their relocation here, once again in search of natural healing but also a sense of home, is the premise of The Wild Silence.As the book opens, Moth has begun a degree, but in the confines of a converted chapel they are renting near Fowey, and without a physical connection to the land, he is deteriorating. Winn already feels that “a dark sense of enclosure had borne down on me and I had to get out” when she learns that her mother has had a stroke.Leaving Cornwall for her mother’s bedside, Winn agonises over how she might best allow her to die. Forced to confront mortality wherever she turns, her prose is extraordinary: wise, unflinching, exquisite. As her mother passes away, Winn sees “A mist… Lifting from her body in a gentle, rising haze… It was just there, in the outline of her quiet stillness: a slow movement of molecules through time and air”.Slipping out of the hospital, she retreats to the nearby woods of her childhood, and to her memories of camping trips, to connect with “the land, the earth, the deep humming background to my very being”. Curiously, it’s here, in her element, where she overreaches: everything Winn sees in nature carries an immutable wonder, wisdom, or elemental power, until occasionally her breathlessness clouds the window: “Moments of blinding lightning lit sheets of water as they were lifted from the ground by the wind and thrown upward to meet the deluge from above in rolling balls of water that reflected the terrifying black monster of a mountain a thousand times, until we became the mountain.”Their need for spiritual flight is understandable – backwards, through a life of shared memories then on to Iceland, to find solace in an environment more primal than Wind in the Willows – but the narrative often lacks a compass. Still, there is a luminous conviction to the prose, and their odyssey through Iceland is profound. As Moth’s condition worsens – he holds up a Mars bar one day to find it embedded with shards of his teeth – Winn appears to surrender something to “a land in transition… a place where the Earth is born and life begins”. Ultimately, she draws hope, and shares it – allowing us to see how the planet’s “fixed impermanence” can make bearable our own.And the Sun Shines Now: How Hillsborough and the Premier League Changed Britain by Adrian Tempany was shortlisted for the Orwell prize• The Wild Silence by Raynor Winn is published by Michael Joseph (£14.99).

Brexit, which Scots rejected by a thumping majority, and Covid-19 have changed the political dynamics since 2014. Put simply, Scotland would rather be inside the European Union with Nicola Sturgeon in charge than outside it with Boris Johnson calling the shots.That was the cue for the usual barney about whether Scotland was actually being subsidised by taxpayers in England or whether the Scots were only getting back some of what they were owed after decades in which the UK government has snaffled North Sea oil revenues that should have been going to those living north of the border.Even so, the Gers data suggest that those campaigning for independence will eventually have to come clean on what sort of macroeconomic policy regime they intend to run. Saying there are plenty of small, successful independent countries is true but beside the point because there are plenty of small unsuccessful ones as well.Scotland has four options, three of which have been touted in the past and a fourth, the most radical of the lot, which has not.Option one is for an independent Scotland to continue using the pound and to have its interest rates set by the Bank of England. This is perfectly feasible: there are plenty of countries that use the dollar as their currency and put up with whatever monetary policy the Federal Reserve deems right for the world’s biggest economy even if it doesn’t suit their own situation.David Cameron’s government said it would not go along with this sort of arrangement back in 2014 and there is no doubt Johnson would say the same in the event of another referendum. Even if Westminster did agree, the downsides are obvious: if the Bank of England decided to raise interest rates, Scotland would simply have to suck it up. Sticking with the pound does, though, seems to be the SNP’s preference.The next possibility is for Scotland to create its own central bank, issue its own currency and set its own interest rates. For those who think (as Theresa May might put it) that independence means independence this is the only meaningful option. But it would not be cost free, at least in the early years.That’s because – traditionally at least – it takes time for newly formed states to establish their credibility with the financial markets and they do so by keeping interest rates higher than they otherwise would be and squeezing public spending in order to reduce the budget deficit. Were Sturgeon to appoint a big international figure – Mark Carney, let’s say – to run an independent Scottish central bank this would be the sort of policy he would undoubtedly suggest. The alternative would be capital flight, a run on the currency, a ratcheting up of interest rates and an even more severe dose of austerity.The only conceivable way for an independent Scotland to avoid pain would be if it adopted modern monetary theory which proved to be the magic bullet its supporters claim. Boiled down to basics, MMT says that countries operating below full employment and with their own central bank should not be deterred from spending money to create jobs because the central bank can be relied upon to print the readies necessary to cover the cost. Only when inflation rises to an unacceptable level should policy be tightened, and then by raising taxes or reining in spending.Opponents of MMT say this is the road to hyperinflation, and cite Weimar Germany and Robert Mugabe’s Zimbabwe every time the idea is floated. This infuriates MMT supporters, who insist the idea would work but really need a small, newly formed country to give it a try. Scotland would tick a lot of boxes. It has plenty of spare capacity and unfulfilled needs. It runs a sizeable structural budget deficit that is being made worse by low oil prices. Sturgeon is respected and Scots might trust her to know when rising inflation required remedial action.It is a fantasy, of course. MMT is too radical and risky for the SNP, which is pretty conservative when it comes to the big picture economic stuff. There’s no chance of Sturgeon embracing MMT, which means that she will have to choose one of the other three options."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0868233cda075dab514173cc98292bcead14e464/0_44_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94867546601d65e2c9ea2b587b6523fa","title":"rishis dinners wont stop businesses feeling empty by autumn","story":"Eat out to help out saw busy restaurants and extra spending generally, but looming job losses could mean the whole nation tightening its beltBritain loves a bargain – even, as it turns out, during a global health emergency. Dismissed as a gimmick at first, the government’s eat out to help out scheme has proved hugely popular, dishing up more than 64 million discounted meals so far – equivalent to almost one for every person in the UK – since its launch a month ago.When the scheme finishes on Monday, chancellor Rishi Sunak, will be able to say that his policy successfully encouraged people back into restaurants, pubs and cafes between Mondays and Wednesdays in August, serving up a much-needed boost to the economy, and to the embattled hospitality sector in particular.“It has been surprisingly effective,” said Mark Gregory, chief economist at accountancy firm EY. “People haven’t gone on holiday and, in a way, this hit the sweet spot. Fair play to the chancellor – it really did help give a short-term boost.”While the early signs are that, thanks to the scheme, businesses are bringing back staff and making money once more, it is still however true that a discounted Nando’s does not a comprehensive economic strategy make.The concern is that the scheme was just a snack, devoured in August on days when it was available, when what the hospitality sector really needs is the whole meal – sustained demand well into the autumn. As the nights draw in, job losses mount, and the furlough scheme closes, the meal deals of August could become a distant memory.Encouragingly, however, Saturday 22 August was the first weekend day since the outbreak of the pandemic when there were more people eating out than on the corresponding day a year ago – which indicates that eat out to help out could have encouraged a wider return to restaurants, regardless of whether there’s a discount on offer.Many restaurants and cafes are choosing to extend discount schemes after eat out to help out ends tomorrow because of their popularity with diners, but these places will have to foot the bill themselves. In a boon for hard-pressed consumers, chains that plan to continue cut-price offers into September include Harvester, Toby Carvery, Tesco Café, Bill’s, Pizza Hut and Prezzo.However, groups including the Federation of Small Businesses have called for the government scheme to be extended, given the less-than appetising outlook for the economy over the coming weeks. Unemployment is expected to rise sharply as more companies cut jobs, some sectors of the economy remain starved of demand, and the progress made in August risks being derailed by rising coronavirus infections.On Wednesday, MPs will have an opportunity to quiz Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, about just how sustainable the economic outlook might be.The chancellor’s next job will be to figure out how to consolidate the summer rebound. Concerned about the strength of the recovery, business groups and trade unions are lobbying hard for Sunak to provide further financial support to workers and firms in his autumn budget.“We need to see what the plan is for protecting economic capacity over the coming period,” said Gregory. “After the summer, he will probably have done the easy stuff, and now it gets to the hard bit.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e6d482bca3fc535cbf4ce96c4ef6d6b9684ec31/0_68_953_572/master/953.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0be043bb6e75a07094a11b994598a2f9","title":"pebble pods and bubble domes six amazing places to wake up in northern ireland","story":"From quirky glampsites to boutique hotels with amazing views, discover the most enticing places to stay in Northern IrelandPebble Pods, Strangford, County DownA relatively new entry to the Northern Ireland glamping scene, but one of the most remarkable, this private location on the shores of Strangford Lough takes pod camping to a new level – and with only three two-person pods, you’ll never find it overcrowded.The glass-and-timber Pebble Pods resemble Hobbit holes, and have a host of amenities, but let’s focus on the most important: a private hot tub, thermal sauna, firepit and barbecue area, providing for year-round luxuriating by the cool waters of one of NI’s most gorgeous loughs.If you’re an active person, there are free bikes and even kayaks to help you explore the area. If you’re feeling more laid back, you can just hit the tub and let the world scurry on by.Lough Erne Resort, County FermanaghIf you’re after absolute luxury, why not go the whole hog? The sprawling, castellated Lough Erne Resort, housed on its own 243-hectare (600-acre) peninsula between the reedy shores of Lower Lough Erne and Castle Hume Lough, just outside Enniskillen, really is the last word in refinement.Starting your day with a choice between the resort’s two world-class golf courses sounds like our kind of dilemma: the Faldo course has been represented globally by local son Rory McIlroy, who holds the course record.For those who don’t have the golf bug, take heart: with an incredible Thai spa, world-class restaurants and access to the 40-mile-long splendour of Lough Erne, you’ll be fine.If it’s good enough to host the not-unpicky G8 summit (as it did in 2013), Lough Erne Resort is sure to satisfy your own exacting standards …And those who are after quality local food won’t need to look further than the resort’s Catalina restaurant, where guests can dine in luxury after a long day of exploring.Larchfield Estate, Lisburn, County AntrimIt’s fair to say Myrtle has been around for a while, seen a few tight squeezes, and is always ready with a warm welcome for her guests. Don’t worry, she’s not an over-friendly local – Myrtle is a lovingly-restored 1952 Saurer Swiss Army truck that now serves as one of Northern Ireland’s most inspiring glamping options at the gorgeous Larchfield Estate.The accommodation is suitably cosy and stylish, equipped with a log-burning stove, sun deck and a sauna housed in its own wooden pod with bucolic views of the surrounding greenery. Rise and shine after a night with Myrtle and set off to explore the 243-hectare (600-acre) estate. Mission accomplished.Killeavy Castle Estate, County ArmaghA gothic flight of fantasy built in 1836, Killeavy Castle is both grand and cosy: it features imposing medieval-style doors and turrets, yet the restored pile makes room for just four luxurious bedrooms within its castellated walls. Wake to the view from any of its 52 windows and you’ll feel like landed gentry.Elsewhere on the estate, the original mill, gatehouse and coach house have all been converted into stylish accommodation. There’s also a high-end spa, all on 142 hectares (350 acres) in the shadow of Slieve Gullion, the tallest mountain in County Armagh.Famed for its locally sourced food, Killeavy Castle Estate provides everything from sublime seven-course tasting menus to a famously good fry-up for breakfast.That’s your morning plans sorted.Palace Street Apartments, Derry-LondonderryPass through the famed city walls at the ornate Bishop’s Gate, then hang a sneaky left, and you’ll find yourself in a barely car-width street lined on one side by the kind of Victorian red brick you’d expect to see in an adaptation of Dickens.It’s also the very fitting home of the Palace Street Apartments, a lovingly restored, three-unit, self-catering gem. Step outside in the morning and you’ll find all of Derry-Londonderry at your feet. Within the confines of the old walled city, you’re only a stroll away from the historic Guildhall (as well-known for its political history as for its appearance in Derry Girls), St Columba’s Cathedral, where the original keys of the city are held, and the Diamond war memorial.That said, dark wood, oiled leather, antique furniture and deep beds come as standard in each apartment, making going outside an optional extra.Finn Lough, County FermanaghA lot has been written about the bubble domes at the eco-conscious Finn Lough resort in Fermanagh, but nothing can prepare you for the experience of waking snug and cosy in a luxury bed, and opening your eyes to see the dawn sky straight above you.These transparent domes offer uninterrupted views of the surrounding nature alongside high-end creature comforts: four-poster beds, ensuite bathrooms, and coffee machines to ease you into the morning the right way.Once you’ve recovered from the majesty of the morning there are woodland trails to explore, on foot or cycle, and a lake to linger by. There’s also a top-tier spa for those who aim simply to “sleep well, be pampered” – and who can blame them, when your bed is this spectacular?Come on over to Northern IrelandPlan your visit to Northern Ireland with everything you need to know about things to do, where to stay and more at irelandnorthern-irelandGet advice about travelling to Northern Ireland, including the latest information on Covid-19 restrictions at nidirect.gov.ukcoronavirus"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/345c28211f4ca1ea57842a60109e9d76c3d87992/0_116_6242_3745/master/6242.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b59877834e5319eb717de6309ac0365b","title":"surf cycle or hike go wild on northern irelands adventure coast","story":"Where can you hike along a world-heritage coastline, ride an Atlantic wave, then cycle around a puffin colony, all within a few miles of each other? The answer is along Northern Ireland’s Causeway CoastWhether you like to explore on foot, by bike or by water, Northern Ireland’s Causeway Coast could be the most scenic part of the UK you’ve never visited. Yet its natural attractions and ersity of landscapes make it perfect for anyone with an adventurous heart.Here we pick a few of Northern Ireland’s outdoor highlights, though the full range of opportunities extend far beyond what’s mentioned here. The best advice? Book a week and discover the possibilities for yourself.Explore by footAt the tip of Northern Ireland lies its most famous attraction – the Unesco world heritage site of the Giant’s Causeway. And there’s no better way to reach it than on foot, by following an eight-mile section of the Causeway Coast Way. Begin at picturesque Ballintoy Harbour, which Game of Thrones fans will recognise as a setting for the Iron Islands. Then head west along the signed coast path, passing sandy beaches, rock arches and a ruined clifftop castle before finishing at the Giant’s Causeway. The 40,000 interlocking basalt columns provide a fitting finale to one of the best walks in Northern Ireland.For something completely different, head to nearby Glenariff Forest Park. Set within the celebrated Glens of Antrim, the scenery here transports you to another world. Expect numerous waterfalls, wooden walkways deep within river gorges, and long-distance views along chiselled glacial escarpments. Signed hiking circuits of different lengths mean there’s a route for walkers of all abilities.Explore by bikeIf two wheels are your thing, Rathlin Island offers an outing that will remain etched in your memory for years to come. Lying six miles off the coast, the trip begins with a ferry ride from Ballycastle marina. You’ll need to bring your own bike due to Covid-19 restrictions, but the island can be explored in a few hours. The highlight is the eight-mile return trip to its western tip. Here the land ends in sheer cliffs that are home to both a lighthouse and Northern Ireland’s largest breeding seabird colony. There’s no better way to break your ride than descending to the RSPB viewing platform and, if you’re here at the right time of year – between April and August – watching the antics of hundreds of thousands of nesting birds. Regardless of when you visit, the views remain breathtaking all year round, and the sensual assault of sound and smell makes the trip back to the harbour feel positively peaceful.For a longer journey, back on the mainland try the signed cycle route between the Giant’s Causeway and Benone. This 22-mile trip can be completed in either direction, and follows a mixture of public roads and traffic-free paths. The ride takes you through the coastal towns of Portrush, Portstewart and Castlerock, with numerous opportunities to explore sandy beaches or stop for refreshments along the way.Explore by waterAnother great option is to leave the land altogether, and explore the unique coastline from the sea. This is a shore littered with caves, arches, tunnels and cliffs, and the only way to appreciate them fully is from the water.Sea kayaking is a great option, with several local companies providing all the equipment and guidance you need to begin weaving silently between the headlands. Choose from a half-day or full-day excursion, with incredible coastal scenery interspersed by a snack or lunch in some tucked-away cove along the way.If you’d prefer to embrace the waves then there’s the chance to try surfing instead – the neighbouring towns of Portrush and Portstewart are the twin meccas for local surfers. Hire a wetsuit and surfboard from the back of the beach, book into a lesson, then hit the waves. Whether you’re a beginner or a pro, you’re guaranteed a great time, with watery thrills and spills all part of the fun.Novices and experts are also welcomed by the local sailing centres. Take a lesson or join a skippered yacht for a longer adventure, spending anything from an hour to a whole weekend on the water. With the emphasis on guests doing as much of the sailing as possible, it won’t be long before you know your jib from your gybe.Something differentOf course the activities mentioned here just scrape the surface of what’s available, and with a little imagination almost anything is possible. How about a catch-and-sea boat trip, where you start by going sea fishing, then return to watch a professional chef prepare your bounty, garnished by other local delicacies?Or a horse ride, featuring a gentle hack through the glens or an adrenaline-filled canter across the beach? Organised scuba ing, coasteering it’s all here, with countless options to suit all ages and abilities.So what’s keeping you away? The Causeway Coast is a goldmine of activities and opportunities, its charms are just waiting to be discovered.Due to Covid-19 restrictions, the mini-bus tour, bird sanctuary and bike hire are not currently available, for more information visit: rathlincommunity.orghomeCome on over to Northern IrelandPlan your visit to Northern Ireland with everything you need to know about things to do, where to stay and more at irelandnorthern-irelandGet advice about travelling to Northern Ireland, including the latest information on Covid-19 restrictions at nidirect.gov.ukcoronavirus"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b97b31f87a6d52db724fa46f4474ab8690e8bf9f/266_0_3013_1808/master/3013.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee653bc6ffba4ffb1376c79d0806d729","title":"how fitting for the tories to hire a worthless former australian pm tony abbott","story":"Tony Abbott is the product of rightwing thinktanks that do so much to tarnish our politicsWhat is Tony Abbott to Britain or we to him? A failed Australian politician who will be remembered, if at all, for believing climate change was “probably doing good” as his country burned, and being eviscerated for his sexist comments by Julia Gillard. Abbott is a has-been from the other side of the world of whom we know little and care less. Nevertheless, Boris Johnson is thinking of making him our trade envoy. No one has voted for Abbott in Britain and he negotiated no major trade deals in his error-strewn period as Australia’s prime minister, which ended in 2015, when, incidentally, his own party judged him to be worthless and brought him down.His record does not matter to Johnson because Abbott is a product of the global network of rightwing thinktanks that has learned how easy and cheap it is to manipulate British politics. I want to emphasise the cheapness. Britain is the Poundshop of European politics, where money goes further. Pecunia non olet – “money does not stink” – said the emperor Vespasian as he defended his tax on the sale of urine from Rome’s sewers to tanners who used it to soften animal skins.It might be the motto for the Anglo-Saxon right, which will use money from any source to soften public opinion. The best text to reach for if you want to understand how Abbott, a blunder from down under, became a figure of consequence in London is Peter Geoghegan’s Democracy for Sale, which should be the most discussed political book of the year. It is by turns balanced, authoritative, revelatory and scandalous. As the web and unsourced money twist elections, the subject could not be more urgent. Too many politicians and journalists are too compromised to think about buying influence, however, and the book has not been mentioned outside the liberal press.I’ll come to the reasons for the silence later. For the moment, let’s endure a few more minutes of Abbott’s company. His case illustrates our troubles in microcosm. Abbott could be influencing our government because he earned the essential qualification for promotion when he became a travelling player on the rightwing thinktank circuit. He defended Donald Trump at the Heritage Foundation in Washington and Brexit on behalf of the Policy Exchange and the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) in London. He was so far gone, he was willing to join Daniel Hannan, Andrew Roberts and a clown parade of other fruit loops in asserting that Britain could free itself from geography, leave Europe and become a part of “Canzuk” , an Anglo-Saxon Narnia formed by the merger of the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.A little money goes a long way in political London. After a mere £12,000 donation to the Tory party, the billionaire developer and former pornographer Richard Desmond saw Robert Jenrick unlawfully approve his property development in the East End of London two weeks later, which you might say is prompt service. For 50 grand, pretty much anyone can get a seat with a minister or prime minister at a Conservative Leader’s Group. And again the first question is, really, is that all? The cheapness of influence-peddling fits a time when unregulated campaign groups can use small sums to target marginal seats on social media and disappear as soon as the election is over. There is a clear need for reform. The Electoral Commission should be expanded and given police powers. Political parties should have the same duty as banks and be held accountable for checking the sources of money they take. Thinktanks and all lobbyists should be required under pain of criminal punishment to declare who is funding them. As indeed should social media companies running political adverts.Much of the media won’t help us clean up politics. Sky and the BBC are too compromised. They want extreme opinions, no matter how tainted or stupid, which will hold their fickle audiences’ attention. In return, they too often betray the duty of journalists to ask the IEA and Spiked on the right and Novara Media on the left hard questions about who they are representing and who is picking up the bill.I cannot see politicians reforming the system. Inidual MPs speak well on the folly of thinking democracy will look after itself in an era of dark money, dubiously acquired data and digital campaigning. But come now. Do you expect a government led by Dominic Cummings and Boris Johnson to open up a system that gave them power? Pecunia non olet and they want to keep the stink from voters’ noses in case the country realises they are taking the piss."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1cce9c92a5adedc5fbdfe55eb2342252e9ffa0e8/0_355_8203_4922/master/8203.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=0d910a3873354df4e2d4171bc6a0a8c8","title":"former royal yacht britannia voted top attraction for uk visitors","story":"Fountains Abbey in North Yorkshire and the Tower of London win plaudits from Which? voters, but Southend Pier sinks to bottomThe Royal Yacht Britannia has been rated Britain’s favourite historical attraction. A survey by the consumer magazine Which? of its members has placed the Queen’s former yacht, now permanently moored at Ocean Terminal, Leith, in Edinburgh, as the best of the UK’s top-50 most visited attractions.The yacht, which sailed to 144 countries during 44 years of royal service, topped the survey and was given a five-star rating for food and drink, information and value for money.Runner-up was Fountains Abbey and Studley Royal Water Garden, North Yorkshire, the country’s largest monastic ruins. The abbey was praised for its spectacular setting and for the lack of crowds and queues.Third place in the Which? survey was given to Stourhead house and gardens, in Wiltshire, followed by the Tower of London, the most expensive of the 50 attractions in the survey. Entry costs £25 a head for adults. Nevertheless, the tower was still rated as providing good value for money.By contrast, Durham Cathedral – in seventh place – was the highest-scoring free attraction in the survey. Visitors also gave it five stars for lack of crowds.Others making it into the survey’s top 10 were the Houses of Parliament Culzean Castle in Ayrshire Dover Castle Titanic Belfast, the city’s maritime museum and Tyntesfield house, outside Bristol.Southend Pier, the world’s longest pleasure pier, came bottom and was criticised for giving poor value for entertainment and for its food and drink. Visitors complained that the pier was “run down” and “not the most exciting place in the world” although they did like the option of taking a train from one end to the other to enjoy the views."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9badd696cf7250b942409a58df622affc1797640/0_289_4335_2601/master/4335.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=602a2b8c1e724b8e0c625a814c0ebe58","title":"teachers and parents across the uk share your thoughts on the reopening of schools","story":"We’d like to hear from people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland about returning to schools, and those in Scotland about how it has beenWith just weeks to go until children return to school in England and Wales, and less than a week until the first cohort of students in Northern Ireland return for the start of the new academic year, protective measures in schools remain fiercely contested.Many teachers have criticised the government’s ‘bubble’ group scheme and social distancing measures, while some unions have called for teachers to be able to choose to use face coverings, against government advice.We’d like to hear from teachers and parents about how they are preparing for the reopening of schools, and how they are feeling about it.If you are in Scotland, where schools are already open full-time, we’d also like to hear how it has been so far.We are particularly interested in hearing from parents about whether they will be sending their children back to school, and how they feel about possible fines for not doing so.You can get in touch by filling in the form below, anonymously if you wish.

However, it is believed he pushed for the move to north London, having recently changed representation to the super-agent Jorge Mendes, and has become José Mourinho’s third signing of the summer following the arrivals of Pierre-Emile Højbjerg and Joe Hart. “I’m so excited to get going. It’s one of the most exciting days of my career so far,” Doherty told the Spurs website. “My time at Wolves was fantastic. I haven’t got a bad word to say about the club. But coming here, it just feels like it’s going to take my game and my career to the next level.Spurs have already sold the right-back Kyle Walker-Peters and told Serge Aurier he can leave the club. The 27-year-old is wanted by Milan.Crystal Palace have strengthened their attack by signing Eberechi Eze from Queens Park Rangers in a deal that could rise to £19.5m. Eze, who scored 14 goals in the Championship last season, has joined Roy Hodgson’s side on a five-year deal after Palace fended off interest from Aston Villa, Fulham, Leeds, West Brom and West Ham.Palace have tracked the 22-year-old forward’s progress heavily over the past 12 months and have long been favourites to sign him. They were not put off after having a £12m bid rejected this month. Palace were determined not to walk away and have met QPR’s demands for an initial £16m plus add-ons.However it is understood West Brom and West Ham never made a serious approach to QPR. West Ham do not have a big budget this summer and the priority for Moyes is improving his back four.That left Palace as favourites. Eze is their most expensive signing since Hodgson’s appointment in 2017 and a sign of their determination to rejuvenate their squad. Palace have already brought in the exciting 19-year-old right-back Nathan Ferguson after his departure from West Brom.However Wilfried Zaha remains determined to leave Palace. The 27-year-old winger, who has attracted interest from Arsenal, Borussia Dortmund, Everton and Monaco in the past, wants to play at a higher level.West Brom are considering trying to sign Watford’s Troy Deeney on loan. The striker could be available following Watford’s relegation. Deeney scored 10 goals last season and would provide West Brom with Premier League experience. However it remains to be seen whether Bilic, whose focus is on younger players, will push ahead with a move for the 32-year-old Watford captain.West Ham have confirmed Roberto has joined Real Valladolid on a free.

First he brought down Georginio Wijnaldum of Liverpool with a flailing attempt at a rugby tackle and saw Virgil van Dijk’s neat finish to an Andy Robertson free-kick correctly ruled out for offside. A couple of minutes later he needlessly passed the ball out of play to set up the position for Neco Williams to cross from the right, James Milner heading too high in the middle when he should probably have hit the target.Even though there were barely 10 minutes on the clock at that stage it appeared the pattern of the game had been set. Liverpool had their famous front three on the pitch and Arsenal had Rob Holding, thought to be heading for Newcastle some time soon, in the back line as well as the unpredictable David Luiz.With Mikel Arteta stressing beforehand that four or five days of training was far from ideal before meeting the champions at Wembley, it was easy to suspect Arsenal would be in for a long afternoon.Jürgen Klopp was not particularly impressed with the timing of this game either, describing it as coming “halfway through pre-season”, though Liverpool had been back in training for a week longer than their opponents.Those first impressions were altered, however, as soon as the 18-year-old Bukayo Saka got hold of the ball. Many thought the teenager unlucky not to make Gareth Southgate’s England squad last week, and here he showed why people are tipping him to break into the national squad before long.After 12 minutes in which Arsenal struggled to get out of their own half, Saka picked up the ball on the right and sent over a superb cross-field ball to pick out Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang on the left. The Arsenal captain’s finish was sublime, nudging the ball away from an exposed Williams to give himself space for a right-foot curler that flew past Alisson from the edge of the area, though it was the accuracy of the pass from Saka that gave the striker the time to utilise the space around him. That and a run from Kieran Tierney that might have distracted Liverpool’s reserve right-back.That was Aubameyang’s fifth goal at Wembley this summer, and with his new contract still unsigned on the table and subject of much discussion in north London, the striker Klopp used to manage at Borussia Dortmund looked to have upstaged the inconspicuous Mo Salah, Sadio Mané and Robert Firmino as the story of the day.Saka, though, had other ideas. A wonderfully unselfish pass midway through the first half allowed Eddie Nketiah to shoot almost without breaking stride. It was a good effort too, right where Nketiah would have wanted it to go, but Alisson showed his class in getting down low to push it away. Saka set up Nketiah with another shooting chance before the half was over, then turned up on the left to play a ball across the six-yard line that none of his teammates anticipated. To say Liverpool were not at their best would be to understate the case. They could easily have been a couple of goals down by the interval.Perhaps the normal service from the flanks was missing with Trent Alexander-Arnold out injured, though Robertson did his best to compensate with a succession of inviting crosses from the left, yet when Arsenal went forward they seemed to do so with a little more purpose and imagination than the slightly sluggish champions.Saka faded a little in the second half, it must be said, though he might have managed to get himself on the scoresheet had Aubameyang been able to summon a little more accuracy with his crossing.Arsenal were trying to withdraw him when Takumi Minamino scored his equaliser, and by the time Saka departed some seven minutes later he was not the only white-shirted player looking dead on his feet. Just for a while, with Holding, David Luiz and Ainsley Maitland-Niles looking calm and composed in defence and even stroking the ball around to each other in the six-yard area, it had appeared Arsenal would keep Liverpool at bay, until Klopp’s substitutions successfully introduced a little more urgency.Liverpool would most likely have won in normal time but for Emiliano Martínez twice leaving his line quickly to deny Mané, though with both sides enjoying a bright half each, a level scoreline was a fair reflection of the game overall.Both teams will play a lot better when the real season starts, but Arteta and his players must be quite pleased with their showing after so little preparation. As long as Aubameyang sticks around Arteta definitely has something on which to build."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d15d4b8d7b2213b55d72563c6ba11831d68b6134/0_1121_8272_4963/master/8272.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=59a8f824d84798e7fa729b429a0e7f5a","title":"only noisy wild animals can lull our boy to sleep","story":"Bedtime disrupted, I’m discovering all over again the depths of my parenting ignoranceReturning from our Irish trip was made easier by our smugness about the heatwave we missed while we were gone. It’s still warmer than we’d like, of course, but more manageable than it looked on Instagram during our break, where naive, deluded London friends pretended they enjoyed things like sweating, peeling and – God forbid – eating outdoors. This shared horror of the sun is one aspect of London life that has strengthened our marriage. It might even be the thing we most like about each other.Unfortunately, the boy has had a tougher transition. This surprised us as he’s usually pretty adaptable. He settled into his first nursery in a week and then his second in three days. In between, he adjusted to my less-than-perfect lockdown crèche without so much as a churlish Ofsted rating. Most impressive of all, when we returned to iPlayer and found that Raa Raa The Noisy Lion had added a new character, Pia the Parrot, he embraced her into the fold without a second thought. Her addition enraged only us, his Raa Raa-addicted parents, who consider Pia a sad, squawking obscenity who has ruined the central chemistry of the show’s oddly scaled jungle critters.No, his problem has been sleep. Whatever routine we’d gotten him into in Dublin seems to have broken his rhythm and he now refuses to go down for naps or night time.His sleep habits had been stable for a while, once again proving one of parenting’s cruellest quirks anytime you’ve got a handle on one problem, another you’d already solved comes back into your life, like an unwelcome, charisma-bereft jungle bird that’s somehow the same height as the lions and elephants it hangs around with.You’d have to be pretty stupid, and extremely arrogant, to think the trials of parenting stop at two years old. But I am precisely that thick and twice as vain. I presume that each of my son’s developmental advances is not merely permanent, but probably owed to some knack for parenting that’s somehow escaped detection in 100+ columns I’ve written, almost exclusively, about the fact I’ve no idea what I’m doing. My ignorance re-asserted, I once again scramble for new solutions to old problems.We’ve tried tough love and soft love. We read books and sing songs until he’s limp in our arms, but still he starts roaring whenever we try to exit. We’ve switched up his mealtimes and swore off TV before bed, but no dice. Our one successful approach has been to lie on the small couch beside his cot, quietly watching Raa Raa on a tablet ourselves, so he can hear its faint strains as he drifts to sleep.So, this is where you’ll find me, on a tiny sofa watching loud claymation animals. Praying for sleep, I will make no sound, wishing death upon the stupid, sad parrot I choose to blame for everything.

In fact, Shron had only viewed the basement of his current family home when he told his estate agent he’d purchase the property: provided Sidura liked the upstairs, he was ready to go. Shron needed the perfect basement because, for nearly 30 years, he had dreamed of building a life-size replica of a 1970s Canadian VIA Rail railway carriage inside his house, the exact train that took him from Toronto to Montreal to visit his grandmother when he was a little boy.Step inside Shron’s basement today and you will be greeted by a 200lb blue-and-yellow train door. As you pass through it, an MP3 player will hiss the sounds of air circulation accompanied by the squeaking of gangway connections. Inside the carriage there are rows of vintage reclinable red-and-orange-striped seats, luggage racks, a real VIA garbage can removed from a scrapped train and a metal sign instructing passengers that smoking is indeed permitted. What Shron couldn’t find on the scrap heap, he made. He printed out orange litter bags, custom-printed napkins and engraved wine glasses.“The great thing was it ended up looking exactly as I’d envisioned it,” the 45-year-old says of his basement train, which took him four-and-a-half years to build and cost $10,000 (the scrapped carriage alone cost $5,000). “I fell in love with VIA trains from the age of two – I became madly obsessed, it’s all I would talk about, all I wanted.” Shron recreated the train that he took to visit family to tap into “that very warm, comfortable, positive energy” he felt as a child. “I get a little bit of that every time I go down to the train.”Shron’s basement is an unusual thing, but it is perhaps a little more common than you’d expect. A number of people have created their own “worlds” underneath their homes. In late May, the listing for a Maryland mansion went viral after a Twitter user discovered a fake town inside the basement. The basement features cobbled streets, 15 shopfronts, fake flowers and real vintage cars. But even this isn’t unusual. More than a decade ago, a YouTube video documented the basement of John Scapes, an Illinois man who had built an 1890s street under his home.Across the Atlantic, Shron’s train and the Maryland town aren’t anomalies either. In December 2019, an American man made headlines for transforming his basement into a replica Blockbuster video store, with row after row of rental vids and a snack stand. Seven months earlier, a woman in Canada transformed the space under her stairs into Narnia. Just before that, a Harry Potter fan magazine documented a woman who had created wizarding streets complete with shop windows in her basement. American and Canadian basements are now home to life-size bakeries and wine shops, casinos and arcades. What possesses someone to create their own private world in their basement? What compels them to spend so much money and time bringing their vision to life? And is an underground fantasy-land actually beneficial, particularly when public spaces are shutting down because of the pandemic?Angela Burns has a village inside her home. In 2012, the 66-year-old builder and designer completed her New Jersey mansion, which she designed with 10ft ceilings in the basement. You enter the space and arrive at a village square, which ides into two cobblestone streets lined with real, functional shops. There’s a coffee shop, a hotdog stand, a wine shop, a bakery, an ice-cream parlour, a pretzel stand, a pizza stall and a newsstand. There’s also an arcade, a bar, a poker room and a 20-seat cinema featuring a concessions kiosk and ticket booth. There’s fake brickwork, fake wooden store signs, fake awnings and fake shop windows. The ceilings are painted blue to mimic the feeling of being outside. The entire basement cost Burns $250,000 (around £190,000, which is just £40,000 under the average price of a UK home).“It was like building a movie set,” Burns says of creating her miniature world. The hardest part was securing fake cobblestones. Originally, she wanted to use real paving stones, but they were too thick and she feared they might cause people to trip. Instead, she opted for a driveway covering that a tiler could lay.Why did she create the space to be so unfailingly realistic? “I wanted it to be something that people find interesting and fun and unique.”Throughout her career designing homes, Burns began to notice that many people would only use one part of a basement and ignore the rest of the space, and she wanted to change things around. She built a spaceship in the basement of her previous home, inspired by episodes of Star Trek the ceiling lit up like the night sky. “It was a really popular thing,” she says. “I had several bids on the house and the people who bought it kept it all.”Burns’s basement is designed to be shown off – she rarely visits the space alone and instead uses it to host parties throughout the year. Other people, however, create their basement worlds to be private retreats from everyday life. “We’re so connected with our phones and with social media, that it’s very hard to escape from all the negativity,” Shron says. “To build this space shows a tremendous amount of drive and passion – and then you can escape to that and say, ‘I deal with the real world for 10, 12 hours a day, now I’m going to go for half an hour with a Scotch. I’m going to sit in this world that I’ve created.”Sam Gosling is a social psychologist at the University of Texas and author of Snoop: What Your Stuff Says About You. Gosling’s book theorises that we leave “traces of ourselves” in the spaces we create, and these traces are insights into our personality. Gosling says there are three mechanisms connecting us to our spaces. The first, “identity claims”, are the deliberate things we do to communicate our selfhood: posters of our favourite movie on the wall, record players with select records left in prominent positions, bumper stickers on our cars. The second mechanism is also deliberate but less communicative – our homes feature sentimental items designed to remind ourselves of certain memories that may be obscure to others (I, for example, have a personalised rock on my desk from a friend’s wedding). The third mechanism is “residue” – the accidental stuff that communicates who we are, like a messy desk scattered with old coffee cups and crumpled paper.Gosling says basement worlds are simply a more extreme version of the spaces we all create. “A lot of people have a sewing room, a studio, a garden shed or a workshop,” he says. “The justification and rationale for this is: ‘Oh, I’m going out to fix the lawnmower.’ But actually it’s about having your space that’s under your control.” Gosling says these spaces help us to foster our identity, thoughts and feelings. But when asked why some people might be happy to project their identity on to their environment with a simple framed picture of a train, while others build an entire train in their basement, he confesses, “I don’t know.”Travis Larson is a 46-year-old construction estimator from Utah who has an unofficial Disneyland in his basement. His replica is strikingly accurate – he spent years photographing walls, lights, mouldings and columns in the theme park in order to recreate every detail. He has a simple answer to the question that stumped Gosling. “Well, it’s kind of my personality,” he says, when asked why he went to such extreme lengths.Larson says he has always been “detail orientated” and has “always liked things that are a little on the different side”. Surprisingly, he’s not a Disney obsessive – he first went to the park aged five, and he takes his three daughters every couple of years. “Having Disney in my basement I guess kind of satisfies that desire a little bit. So you can go a little bit longer without having to go there.”The reason Larson chose to recreate Disneyland is because he wanted to do something unique – he considered a pirate theme or a vintage town, but landed on Disney for his daughters. He started making the basement in 2004 and finished it 12 years later. By repurposing materials frugally, he estimates he spent no more than $5,000 on the whole thing. The space features paving stones, railings, park benches and the exteriors of iconic Disney rides such as Snow White’s Scary Adventures. Doors, lamps and windows are extremely detailed and intricate – Larson’s replica of a Disney restaurant even features the same curtain rods used in the park. Like Shron, he also added sound effects – the same music that plays in the parks can be heard in the basement, and he occasionally lights a scented candle to replicate the smell of sweet treats. “I had a mould of bricks and I made probably hundreds of them,” Larson says of his handiwork. “It was extremely time-consuming.”What, exactly, is the purpose of a private basement universe? Shron uses his train as a home office and also meditates in the space every morning (he has to turn off the horn sounds). Two of Larson’s daughters have bedrooms in his Disneyland, and he has a workshop down there. Both men say the spaces were an unexpected relief during lockdown.Like Shron, Larson sees his space as an “escape”, and both men admit – as Gosling theorised – that they enjoy having a space under their personal control. “Watching a movie or reading a book, that’s one thing,” Larson says. “But it’s different to have a physical location that you can escape to – especially someplace that you know is private or that you kind of control so that way you can make it as magical as you want.” Larson argues that while films and books are mentally immersive, his space is “a physical escape as well as a mental escape”.A creative personality, expendable income and a lot of determination are common denominators in those who create basement worlds – Shron describes himself as “very much a hardcore nerd”. Yet you may have also noticed that these spaces are extremely nostalgic – vintage villages, 1970s trains and the original Disney park all embody pleasant memories of times gone by. Krystine Batcho is a psychology professor at Le Moyne College who invented the Nostalgia Inventory, a survey that measures personal nostalgia. “There is a purity about childhood that we can never truly experience again in adulthood,” she says. “The phenomenon of actualising a fantasy land within our mundane reality reflects the indulgence of a nostalgic desire for imagination and fantasy.” She adds that in a social climate of uncertainty and conflict, nostalgia can comfort us and connect us to a more secure past.But why basements? Gosling argues that because those who build these worlds have families with a variety of needs, they can only use redundant, extra space for these projects. There is also a fun element of secrecy and surprise. “In the town that I live in, the exteriors of the houses are all very traditional,” says Burns, owner of the village basement. “You can still have a regular house that doesn’t look weird, and then once you go down those stairs and go to the basement level, it’s a whole new world.

We’re still very much aiming for June,” she wrote.“We’ve moved our ticket resale back from October to April, because so few people have asked for a refund (next year’s festival remains sold out), meaning we don’t have enough tickets to resell.“Plus, we’ve extended the free cancellation deadline until the end of January.”Paul McCartney, Taylor Swift and Kendrick Lamar were set to headline the Pyramid Stage this year to celebrate the festival’s landmark anniversary.Michael Eavis previously told ITV News West Country they were “moving heaven and earth” to make sure the festival happened in 2021.“But that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s going to happen. That’s just wishful thinking,” he said. “The only certainty I think is the year after, 2022, to be perfectly candid, so we might have to wait for two years maybe.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6516bfe622d82e705d960497e3489636de289763/0_0_4241_6361/master/4241.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=72b53bb8c85c14b1f75e3cbca8c06119 1440w","title":"how labour climbed 26 points to match the tories in opinion polls","story":"A combination of Boris Johnson’s policy confusion and a change of opposition leader has had a dramatic impact on the publicLabour is now level-pegging with the Conservatives, according to the latest Opinium poll for the Observer, which shows the Tories have lost a massive 26-point lead in the five months since March.At the same time it will be a boost for Labour, as MPs prepare to return to Westminster on Tuesday.

To begin with, it felt like a sleek performance from a well-honed relay team. On 11 January, only 10 days after reporting a new respiratory disease, the Chinese published the genome sequence of the virus that causes it. Researchers around the world set to work building vaccines against Covid-19, as the disease became known, and the first candidate entered human trials on 16 March it was joined, as the months passed, by dozens of others.Scientists were jubilant, and they had every right to be. They’d broken all vaccinology records to get to that point. But then tensions began to surface among the team members, and lately even the most distracted spectator will have noticed that they appear to be trying to nobble each other openly on the track. With accusations that the Russians and Chinese hacked research groups in other countries, biotech executives criticised for cashing in on their own, as yet unapproved vaccines, and Russia approving a vaccine that is still in clinical trials, the quest for a vaccine seems to have turned sour.Political pressure has been mounting for scientists to deliver an economy-saving result, and reports of corner-cutting emerge daily. Two days before his Republican party’s national convention began last week, president Donald Trump accused the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of dragging its feet, delaying approval of any experimental vaccine until after November’s presidential elections. When the FDA then gave “emergency use” authorisation for blood plasma treatments for Covid-19 patients before such treatments had shown any clear benefit in clinical trials, fears grew that it would do the same for a vaccine candidate before that candidate had been put fully through its paces – just to suit the presidential agenda. And Americans are laggards when it comes to cutting corners. Before Russia approved its vaccine, China also approved a locally made, but not thoroughly tested, vaccine for use in military personnel – and last week it announced that it had been administering an unapproved vaccine to key workers since July.Nor is it just politicians who are in a hurry. On 2 August, Steven Salzberg, a computational biologist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, suggested in Forbes magazine that a promising vaccine be rolled out to a wider pool of volunteers before clinical trials had been completed, triggering an outcry (and some sympathy) that prompted him to recant the next day. Meanwhile, a research group with links to Harvard University continues to defend its publication in July of a recipe for a DIY Covid-19 vaccine – one that only the group’s 20-odd members had previously tested. “Out there in the real world, millions of people are getting sick and very large numbers of people are dying every day,” says group member Preston Estep, a genome scientist. “We don’t believe that our vaccine is nearly that much of a risk to people.”The accumulation of such incidents has left many scientists feeling deeply uneasy. “I’m more and more concerned that things are getting done in a rush,” says Beate Kampmann, who directs the Vaccine Centre at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (and whose work email account was subject to a failed hack in July). On 13 August, the editor-in-chief of the journal Science issued a call to order. “Short cuts in testing for vaccine safety and efficacy endanger millions of lives in the short term and will damage public confidence in vaccines and in science for a long time to come,” wrote H Holden Thorp.He went on to point out that the stakes are higher than with unproven therapies such as hydroxychloroquine, because a vaccine is given to healthy people. “Approval of a vaccine that is harmful or isn’t effective could be leveraged by political forces that already propagate vaccine fears,” he warned.Even if most vaccine research groups aren’t rushing, says Paul Offit, head of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, the language used to describe the search for a vaccine – the US government’s naming of its vaccine funding programme Operation “Warp Speed”, Russia’s evocation of the cold war space race with its “Sputnik V” vaccine, even the expression “vaccine race” – might imply otherwise. “It makes it sound like timelines are being suppressed, or safety issues are being ignored,” he says.Doing things by the book, where testing a vaccine – or any medical intervention – is concerned, involves putting it through a human or clinical trial. This conventionally comprises three phases. In the first, a small group of healthy people receives the vaccine to see if it is safe – that is, that it causes no serious side effects. Phase 2 continues to test safety but mainly tests the vaccine’s ability to elicit an immune response. It does this in a few hundred people, some of whom act as controls because they receive a placebo or different vaccine. In the third phase, which also includes controls, the vaccine is typically administered to tens of thousands of people who are followed over many months, usually in a place where the risk of infection is high. This tests whether the vaccine works in the real world – that it prevents disease – and attempts to root out side effects that might not have been apparent in smaller, less erse groups.If an experimental vaccine is judged both safe and effective at the end of this process, it becomes eligible for approval. But it is universally acknowledged that clinical trials can’t catch all possible side effects – because some may only emerge in certain sub-populations, or after a very long time – so surveillance continues post-approval (this is sometimes referred to as a trial’s phase 4). A vaccine against rotavirus, a common cause of diarrhoea in infants, was taken off the market in 1999 after it was found to cause bowel obstruction in a small proportion of babies – something that, because of its rarity, trials had missed.When Russia announced earlier this month that it had approved Sputnik V, the vaccine had been tested in no more than 100 people. At the time, the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology in Moscow – which is running the ongoing vaccine trial – had registered phases 1 and 2 in public databases, but published no results from them, and given no evidence that it had even started phase 3. And this in a country that, at least until five years ago, had by its own health ministry’s admission, standards of drug safety surveillance that were lower than those recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). (Under-reporting of side effects was still a major problem in Russia in 2017.)Philosopher and bioethicist Angus Dawson, who works at the University of Sydney, says he understands the pressure to accelerate Covid-19 vaccine testing, given the numbers of people globally who are susceptible to severe or lethal forms of the disease. But he thinks it has blinkered some scientists to the dangers of rushing trials. “They’re focusing on potential benefits without reasonably and fairly thinking about the downsides,” he says.Covid-19 is not flu. It is caused by a virus, Sars-CoV-2, about which relatively little is known, and some of the experimental vaccines currently going through clinical trials also make use of novel technology. That is a lot of unknowns. “We don’t have a vaccine for any coronavirus, so why do people assume this is going to be straightforward?” Dawson asks.One potential risk with some kinds of vaccine, for example, is that they can cause the recipient to experience a worse bout of the disease if that person becomes infected naturally later on. This phenomenon, known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), has been a problem with experimental vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) – which is caused by a virus related to Sars-CoV-2 – and it will need to be ruled out by rigorous testing of vaccines against Covid-19.If ADE were to turn out to be a problem with a vaccine after it had been approved, in a country with poor safety reporting, years might pass before the full human cost came to light. This is a dilemma currently exercising the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, which is working with Covid-19 vaccine developers to set up phase 3 trials in Africa. Covid-19 outbreaks are now growing in parts of that continent, meaning it is potentially a good place to test the ability of a putative vaccine to protect people against infection, but safety surveillance can be patchy there. “Often where you have most cases of an infectious disease, the infrastructure for surveillance isn’t as good,” says Kampmann.When Salzberg rescinded his suggestion to roll out a vaccine before trials had been completed, ADE was one of the reasons. “I have concluded that (1) the risks are greater than I presented them, and (2) the benefits are not as great as I had thought,” he wrote.But unknowns are just that, meaning that experts disagree about how much speed is justified in the current situation. Dawson argues that the existing, sequential system of trial phases should be maintained, partly on moral grounds: safety should be fully established before efficacy, for example, and if it hasn’t then a volunteer giving “informed” consent to take part is less informed than she should be. But the WHO and the Oslo-based nonprofit organisation the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (Cepi) – which is helping to coordinate Covid-19 vaccine development – have both endorsed a “pandemic paradigm” in which some phases are run in parallel and trial duration is shortened overall. The front-running Oxford UniversityAstraZeneca vaccine (see graphic, below) is one of a number of projects running phase 2 and 3 trials simultaneously.The justification for doing so is that all of the usual checks and balances will still be performed before a vaccine is used widely they just might not be performed in the same order. The cost of compressing the process is a greater financial risk for vaccine-makers, since it requires them to move forward through ever more expensive trial phases before all the information is in from previous ones – with no guarantee of approval at the end. It’s for this reason that Cepi, Warp Speed and others are investing public money in Covid-19 vaccine research – to help spread that risk.Andrew Lo, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, applauds this development. He points out that companies have been fleeing the vaccine field in recent decades, because the profit margin on most vaccines is so thin. “The fact that we now have more companies getting into the vaccine business because of Covid-19 is a tremendously positive aspect of this pandemic,” he says.But the changing economics of vaccine development have thrown up new ethical dilemmas. Nobody is suggesting that executives at Moderna and Inovio – US biotech firms working on experimental Covid-19 vaccines using technology that has never been approved – broke any rules when they sold off stock in their own companies. This is normal practice, once companies go public, partly because it allows executives to recoup their initial investment. But Lo says legal scholars are currently debating whether those rules remain fit for purpose. And while the scholars debate, the spectacle of execs cashing in on unproven technology that taxpayers helped fund – in the middle of a pandemic, to boot – does nothing for public trust in scientists. “It creates a cynicism that’s understandable,” says Offit.For Dawson, the bad behaviour now on display is evidence that commercial incentives are too dominant in the search for a vaccine. He points out that other kinds of incentives were possible. The WHO could have offered a prize for the vaccine most likely to reduce the global burden of Covid-19, for example. That might have given it some ownership of the final product, and power to ensure its equitable distribution. Unfortunately, the chronically underfunded WHO doesn’t have the authority many people think it has. “People assume it’s this global power,” Dawson says, “but my university has a bigger budget than the WHO.”The bad behaviour has repercussions. Now that seven candidates are in phase 3 trials, ensuring the equitable distribution of any that are approved has become a pressing issue. A few weeks ago Cepi published the results of a survey suggesting that the world had the manufacturing capacity to produce the 2bn doses considered necessary to protect the most vulnerable by the end of 2021 – without borrowing capacity from other lifesaving vaccines – but not to produce enough doses to protect everyone by the same deadline. “People are waking up to the fact that vaccines will not be there for all,” Kampmann says.To date, 172 countries have expressed an interest in Covax. They include the UK, but not China, Russia, the US or the European Union. The deadline to commit is the end of August. Gavi CEO Seth Berkley says he hopes common sense will prevail, and specifically the realisation that nobody is safe until everybody is safe. “To go ahead and cut the final deals, though, we need to know how many countries are going to be in and to have them put in the money up front,” he says.History doesn’t give much reason to be hopeful. “In keeping with the longstanding pattern of political behaviour during pandemics,” wrote global health expert David P Fidler of the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington DC, in Science on 14 August, “vaccines will eventually reach most populations, but only after powerful countries have protected themselves.”If a vaccine is shown to be safe and effective, through rigorous application of the scientific method, Offit is optimistic that most people will take it. Kampmann, meanwhile, feels it’s important not to let the recent shenanigans in the vaccine community overshadow its huge achievements. If current forecasts are correct, a Covid-19 vaccine will be available in 2021 – smashing all records for vaccine development – and there will be many more reasons to trust it than not to. Still, those with their eye on that glittering prize should remember what is at stake. “We have to be careful,” she says, “because what we do with Covid-19 could have repercussions for trust in all vaccine programmes.”• Laura Spinney is the author of Pale Rider: The Spanish Flu of 1918 and How It Changed the World (Vintage, £10.99).

The feat, verified by the Racing Post’s historian John Randall, was achieved at Windsor where the 23-year-old jockey scored on five of her seven mounts at cumulative odds of 899-1.“I thought it’d go one way or the other,” said a delighted Doyle, whose 116 winners in 2019 smashed the previous record for a woman in a calendar year. “I thought, this could be a good day or a really bad day.“I’m just really blessed at the moment to be getting a leg-up on these good horses. The last few years have been awesome.”The highlight of Doyle’s day came aboard Extra Elusive, on whom she won the Winter Hill Stakes. Now five, this horse had become a frustrating underachiever but is unbeaten in two runs since Doyle was given the ride.“I really like him and I trust him,” she explained. “I understand how to ride him and keep him happy. We seem to get on all right. He’s got bags of ability and physically he’s beautiful. Jammy, aren’t I?”It so happens the Sky TV cameras are due at Doyle’s home on Monday, but not for her her boyfriend and fellow jockey Tom Marquand is to give an interview. Told of this, Doyle smiled wryly and said: “I’d better get the cleaning done, then...”Someone else should be making the headlines on Sunday, as Doyle is going to Yarmouth, the one track where ITV3’s cameras will not be present. Instead, the spotlight may fall on Andrea Atzeni, who has a fine chance in Goodwood’s Supreme Stakes aboard Cloak Of Spirits (3.35).This filly is sailing under the radar for most punters, judging by odds of 7-1, but she was beaten only by Love in the 1,000 Guineas and was flying high again when fifth in the Coronation Stakes. Dropped to this level, she has continued to run well and was a fine third in what looked a good-quality race at Deauville last time. The step back to seven furlongs is a smart move and Richard Hannon’s runner should make a bold bid.1.50 Goodwood The obvious choice is Ice Sprite, seeking a three-timer and helped by the weight concession from her older rivals. From the William Haggas yard, she proved her ability to cope with this kind of surface at Windsor last time.2.05 Perth The switch to handicaps was very much indicated for Scardura after he made a fine chasing debut at Stratford. Headed on the run-in, he finished between two higher-rated rivals, both of which have won since. He is not the only unexposed runner but should prove way ahead of his rating.2.25 Goodwood Course and distance form points to Chairmanoftheboard, who ran a stormer to be fifth in the Stewards’ Cup. His only previous visit was for his debut, when he beat Sir Busker by eight lengths on soft ground.2.40 Perth There is no getting away from Imperial Elysian, who has won three handicaps on the bounce and still looked under-rated when coming home clear at Southwell for the in-form Fergal O’Brien yard.3.00 Goodwood This is a first attempt on a testing surface for Native Tribe but, as a son of Farhh, he ought to like it a lot better than the fast ground on which he looked a difficult ride at Sandown. The blinkers are fitted in response but he may not need them, as an unexposed youngster who can take another step forward in a winnable contest.3.15 Perth This is a hotter race than the one Fortunes Hiding won here six weeks ago but there was a lot to like about the way the seven-year-old travelled and jumped that day on his return from a spell in point to points. He started brightly for his former trainer and perhaps a change of scenery has helped him get back on track."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55078a912f66eba2b73e0de75dc1ec9b438d0c95/0_166_5321_3193/master/5321.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e637b94f99bc14b7dbb53db618792fe4","title":"naomi osaka forfeits western southern open final injury tennis","story":"Naomi Osaka was forced to withdraw from the Western \u0026amp Southern Open final in New York with a pulled hamstring, handing the title to Victoria Azarenka. Osaka faces a rush to recover in time for the US Open, starting on Monday.“I’m sorry to have to withdraw today with an injury,” Osaka said in a statement. “I pulled my left hamstring yesterday in the second set tie-break and it has not recovered overnight as I had hoped. This has been an emotional week and I want to thank everyone for the outpouring of support.”It marked the final twist to a dramatic week for Osaka, who on Wednesday followed the lead of the NBA in the wake of the police shooting of Jacob Blake by refusing to compete in her semi-final against Elise Mertens. The tournament later responded by cancelling all play on Thursday and offering a “pause” in line with other US sports leagues.Osaka is scheduled to face her compatriot Misaki Doi in the night session tomorrow, which she admitted is a daunting prospect. “I’m a bit stressed, but at the same time I feel like I have to keep forcing into my brain that I made the choice to come here, so I shouldn’t be stressed about it and I should just be happy to be playing in the first place.”For Azarenka, her first title in four years was the culmination of an unexpected return to form in New York. A two-time Australian Open champion and former world No 1, Azarenka is currently ranked 59th and has struggled badly to rediscover form since returning to the tour after the birth of her son.Off the court, she has been embroiled in a custody battle with her son’s father, which even forced her to miss the Australian Open this year.She admitted this week that she had considered retirement before deciding to “try, last time, and see what happens”.There was little reason to suggest that her fortunes would change after her 6-3, 6-2 first round loss to Venus Williams earlier this month.“There is no magic,” said Azarenka. “There is just … when you do a lot of little things and they finally come together, sometimes you’re waiting for them, you work hard and it doesn’t go. But if you stick to it and believe that what you’re doing is right, you have trust in that, I think the things come together.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f5286aba8c23a633a9129f53d1b5dfa669ef5b5/785_415_4265_2561/master/4265.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d4dc640d7cf5e70499b39a7da1abd65","title":"this isnt the 1990s apple under pressure from app developers","story":"Facebook, Amazon and Google all have their problems, but Apple is losing friends fasterFacebook may be the home of international conspiracy theories, Amazon the bane of high streets everywhere and Google slowly tightening its grip on the entire web but it is Apple that is rapidly becoming the most friendless of the big tech companies.Even its attempts to make new allies are starting to come back to bite.The company’s rigid control of the iPhone App Store, long a source of friction for developers large and small, became a battleground over the summer, as Apple began to tighten policies requiring developers to pay the company a cut of commerce on the store.“We thought we knew all the written and unwritten rules,” David Heinemeier Hansson, the co-founder of Hey’s developer, Basecamp, told the . “But then we, with all this knowledge … can be a victim of their capricious policies. If they kick you out of the App Store, it’s like you don’t exist.”Just as that standoff thawed, with Hey agreeing to build features for users without a subscription, another, noisier conflict started, with Epic Games, the developer of Fortnite. That fight, still ongoing, resulted in Epic introducing its own payment processing into Fortnite, breaking Apple’s rules in the process. Apple removed Fortnite from the App Store Epic sued, alleging abuse of monopoly.But even when Apple tries to make friends, the company has found itself ing into new conflicts. In April, Amazon made a surprising announcement: Amazon Prime customers would be able to buy streaming movies and TV shows on iOS using the credit card they have saved on file.At first glance, the move appeared to be exactly the same switch that would later lead to Epic being unceremoniously expelled from the store but, Apple revealed, it was actually a sweetheart deal: “premium” video apps were allowed to use their own payment systems, in exchange for supporting the company’s troubled Apple TV hardware.Now others want the same deal. Digital Content Next, a trade organisation representing some of the largest US news organisations including the New York Times and the Washington Post, has written to Apple asking the company to offer the same freedom to its own members.“Nearly all of DCN’s members offer apps in the Apple App Store and … many offer subscription-based access to a wide variety of content,” wrote Jason Kint, the organisation’s chief executive. “The terms of Apple’s unique marketplace greatly impact the ability to continue to invest in high-quality, trusted news and entertainment particularly in competition with other larger firms.“I ask that you clearly define the conditions that Amazon satisfied for its arrangement so that DCN’s member companies meeting those conditions can be offered the same agreement,” Kint’s letter concluded.The push to offer special deals to inidual developers may allow the largest companies to thrive on the App Store but risks undercutting Apple’s favourite defence of its model: that it underpins the broad-based success of the “app economy”.In June, citing a study commissioned by the company and carried out by Analysis Group, Apple claimed “the App Store ecosystem supported $519bn in billings and sales globally in 2019 alone”.“If that is the outcome of this summer of App Store turmoil, it will be a win for everyone: developers, Apple and the users that want both security and innovation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/094a764bb3cd67ebb628eb52f967b98f9e23beb2/184_0_5225_3136/master/5225.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=8c4d5537385a06a2ca51ba75aee10b69","title":"brazil island fernando de noronha reopens tourists covid 19","story":"Visitors will have to show test results to enter Fernando de Noronha, which has so far suffered no coronavirus deathsOne of Brazil’s most celebrated tourist destinations, the paradisiacal archipelago of Fernando de Noronha, has announced it is reopening to outsiders – as long as they have had Covid-19.Tourists have been banned from the Unesco World Heritage site, which Charles Darwin visited in 1832, since late March when the pandemic forced many parts of Brazil into partial shutdown.Since then more than 120,000 Brazilians have died, the world’s second highest death toll, and President Jair Bolsonaro faces accusations of catastrophically mismanaging the crisis by undermining containment measures.But from Tuesday visitors will be allowed into Fernando de Noronha, 211 miles off Brazil’s north-eastern coast, if they can prove they have been infected and recovered.The results of two types of test – PCR virus tests and IgG antibody tests – will be accepted if conducted at least 20 days before arrival.Last week a man in Hong Kong was diagnosed with Covid-19 having recovered from it in March – the first lab-confirmed case of reinfection – suggesting immunity can be short-lived.But some scientists caution against reading too much into that case and Rocha claimed the decision to reopen was grounded in science.“What we’ve seen is that these cases of reinfection are very rare and very debatable. There are doubts,” he said.“The current understanding is that someone who has already had this disease is immune. So this is the protocol we are following.”Fernando de Noronha – a spectacular chain of 21 islands, islets and volcanic outcrops in the Atlantic Ocean – is perhaps Brazil’s most hyped destination, famed for its emerald waters, idyllic beaches and well-heeled guests.Rocha said it was visited by about 100,000 tourists each year, who must pay a daily tax to support conservation efforts.But the archipelago, whose only inhabited island has about 3,500 permanent residents, was closed to outsiders on 21 March, as coronavirus swept Brazil. In April, islanders who had left for the mainland were also barred. Locals were allowed back in late June after cases of community transmission were stamped out.“So far we have had zero deaths – precisely because of the controls introduced by the government,” Rocha said.Rocha conceded next week’s reopening was not entirely risk-free. “But we are aiming for the smallest possible risk. And what is the smallest risk possible right now? What is the safest way? It’s reopening tourism on the island only for people who have already had Covid.”He urged tourists to return to what he called an “exuberant” paradise in Brazil’s Pernambuco state.“People fall in love with Noronha because of its unmatched natural beauty, which you can’t find anywhere else on Earth,” he said. “Fernando de Noronha is unique.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd039201147e75cd37f11e4d0607ac2dce4fd265/0_180_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=541adaf59fae02b53ed68fcb80cde037","title":"new zealand coronavirus two new cases as auckland lockdown due to lift","story":"Masks will be compulsory on public transport and strongly encouraged elsewhere, says prime minister, as restrictions wind back on MondayNew Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has thanked Aucklanders who come out of lockdown after Sunday night for their commitment to suppressing the latest coronavirus flare-up.Two new cases of Covid-19 have been reported on Sunday, both in the community and linked to the latest Auckland cluster. Ardern thanked the residents of New Zealand’s largest city for their adherence to the stringent lockdown requirements.“Our system is only as good as our people,” she said. “And our people are amazing.”But Ardern urged Aucklanders to “keep going”. Though lockdown lifts on Monday, masks will be mandated on public transport and strongly encouraged elsewhere.“Basically when you step out of your home, we’re asking you to please wear a mask.”Ardern said it was “highly unlikely” there was Covid outside Auckland and “we want to keep it that way”.She warned that if further outbreaks occurred, New Zealand could be forced to move back up the alert levels.The programme of curbs has worked well, Ardern said, telling a televised briefing: “It is designed to keep us on track with our elimination strategy.”On social media, the prime minister gave a demonstration of DIY facemask making:By Sunday there were 136 active cases of Covid-19 in New Zealand, with 10 people in hospital, two of them in intensive care.New Zealand has recorded 1,378 cases of Covid-19 since the pandemic began.

Photograph:  EPASTRMore than 25 million cases of coronavirus have been recorded worldwide with more than 842,700 deaths, according to the latest data from Johns Hopkins University. The global pace of new infections has steadied a little. It has taken about three weeks for the caseload to jump by 5 million cases to 25 million. That compared with the 19, 24 and 39 days it took, respectively, to add 5 million cases to the 20 million, 15 million and 10 million marks. The rate of new daily cases has slowed to around 1.2 per cent over August so far. That compared with 1.7 per cent in July, 1.8 per cent in June, 2.1 per cent in May, 4.6 per cent in April and 7.7 per cent in March. Health experts stress that official data almost certainly underreports both infections and deaths, particularly in countries with limited testing capacity. While Covid-19’s trajectory still falls far short of the 1918 Spanish flu, which infected an estimated 500 million people, killing at least 10 per cent of patients, experts worry the available data is underplaying the true impact of the pandemic.The following is a summary of the latest developments on the virus around the world:India India set a single-day record of 78,761 cases, according to data from the health ministry. The US had set the previous highest number of 77,638 on July 17th, according to Agence-France Presse.The total number of cases in India went past the 3.5 million mark and the death toll exceeded 63,000, according to government data.India is third in the world behind the US and Brazil in terms of infections and fourth for fatalities, according to Johns Hopkins data.Despite the surging case numbers, prime minister Narendra Modi has been pushing for a return to normalcy to lessen the economic pain of the pandemic, having imposed a strict early lockdown of the country’s 1.3 billion people in March. The government announced on Saturday that it will reopen underground train networks - a lifeline for millions in the capital city of New Delhi - and allow sports and religious events in a limited manner from next month. rail services have been permitted to resume in a graded manner from September 7th. Social, political and cultural and religious gathering with a limit of 100 people permitted from September 21st as per the new guidelines. States won’t be allowed to impose local lockdown within state or city limits other than in containment zones. Schools, colleges and coaching institutions will remain closed until September 30th.US The US added 47,860 virus cases Friday, a 0.8 per cent rise compared with the average 0.7 per cent daily increase of the previous seven days, according to data from Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg. The total is 5,913,913.Another 975 deaths were reported, after three days of increases over 1,000, the data show. Total fatalities are 181,789.The number of new coronavirus cases in Texas climbed by 4,732, or 0.8 per cent, to 606,530, the department of state health services said on its website, less than the 0.9 per cent average over the previous week. Deaths increased by 154 to 12,420. New infections have retreated from records of more than 10,000 a day at the peak of Texas’s outbreak in mid-July.California reported 4,981 new virus cases, the lowest daily count since August 4th and below the 14-day average of 5,725. There have been 693,839 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the state, according to the health department’s website. Deaths climbed by 144 to 12,834.Illinois governor JB Pritzker proclaimed a “solemn day” as Illinois surpassed 8,000 virus deaths, a day after the state increased the number of counties considered to be at a “warning level” to 30 from 20.Florida cases increased to 619,003 on Saturday, a rise of 0.5 per cent in line with the average daily increase of the previous week. Deaths among Florida residents reached 10,957, an increase of 148 and higher than the 89 reported the previous day, according to the state health department report, which includes data through Friday.New York hospitalisations dropped to a record 458, the smallest number since March 16th, governor Andrew Cuomo announced. The state now has 22 straight days with a positive-test rate under 1 per cent, he said in a statement.Brazil Brazil, the country with the world’s second-highest number of infections, reported there were 758 deaths in the past 24 hours. The country also had 41,350 new cases. More than 3.8 million cases have been confirmed in the country while the number fatalities exceeded 120,000.Mexico Mexico reported 5,974 new confirmed Covid-19 cases, bringing the total to 591,712, according to data released by the health ministry on Saturday night.

Daily cases in Germany are hovering near a four-month high, with 1,555 new infections reported on SaturdayUK The UK reported 1,108 new coronavirus cases bringing the total number of infections to 332,752. Cases have increasing by more than 1,000 a day for much of the past two weeks, raising concerns about the growing spread of the virus as the country prepares to reopen schools in the coming days.The surge in cases has not been accompanied by a jump in fatalities, with only 12 new deaths reported Saturday, bringing the total to 41,498, the world’s fifth highest tally.British health scretary Matt Hancock warned on Saturday that the country could face “very extensive” local lockdowns in the event of a second wave of coronavirus this winter. Mr Hancock told the Times he’s working under the “central scenario” that a vaccine will likely be available “some time next year.” Until then, he said the government will have to rely on three “lines of defense” to stop the spread of the coronavirus: social distancing, testing and tracing and local lockdowns.Italy Italy’s new virus cases declined to 1,444 on Saturday, the day after the nation reported its largest increase since May. Anti-migrant politicians have used the late-summer surge to try to drum up support for tighter border controls. The government of prime minister Giuseppe Conte was forced to clarify that migration policy is controlled from Rome after Sicily’s governor ordered migrant centers closed citing virus risk. An outbreak on the country’s other main island, Sardinia, has led authorities to draw up a contingency plan for tourists who’ve tested positive to return to the mainland on separate vessels, newspapers reported Saturday.Russia In Russia, the number of new cases held steady at 4,941. The daily figure has been below 5,000 for the last two weeks. The country recorded 111 deaths.Hong Kong Hong Kong has embarked on the world’s biggest experiment in voluntary testing. Local media Radio Television Hong Kong said that as of 8am local time on Sunday, 310,000 people had already signed up for the free virus test. The two-week effort aims to reach a high percentage of its 7 million residents. Government ministers on Sunday stepped up their campaign, urging people to sign up as soon as possible, RTHK reported. Officials said more than 40 testing sites had already been fully booked on the launch day of the tests - and authorities will decide whether or not to extend the programme depending on the public’s response.Hong Kong’s government has distributed 160,000 test kits to front-line workers, including security guards and cleaners at property-management companies, it said in a statement. About 97,000 of the voluntary tests have been returned and five were positive for Covid-19.In total, the city reported 18 new cases, two of which were imported, according to the city’s Center for Health Protection. Fatalities at public hospitals rose to 86.Australia New coronavirus cases in Australia’s state of Victoria returned to the triple digits on Sunday. Southeastern Victoria reported 114 new cases, a day after the daily tally fell to 94, its lowest in nearly two months. Its capital, Melbourne, is four weeks into a six-week hard lockdown that authorities have said may ease only gradually.The nation of 25 million has suffered about 25,600 infections and just over 600 deaths since the start of the year.New Zealand Australia’s closest neighbour, New Zealand, reported two new virus cases on Sunday, taking its tally of infections to 1,378, while the death toll stands at 22. Prime minister Jacinda Ardern said curbs in Auckland would be eased from Monday, but would be tightened again if needed. Limits will stay on public gatherings and movement in Auckland, however, with masks made mandatory nationwide from Monday. The programme of curbs has worked well, Ardern said, telling a televised briefing, “It is designed to keep us on track with our elimination strategy.” Both New Zealand and Australia have proved far better able to rein in the spread of the virus than many other nations, moving swiftly to clamp down with social distancing measures. However, the high cost of the measures for both nations has been reflected in the largest loss in gross domestic product in decades.South Korea South Korea added 299 more coronavirus cases in 24 hours vs 323 a day earlier, raising the total tally to 19,699, according to data from Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Yesterday’s numbers included 283 locally infected cases, bulk of that in Seoul. There were two more deaths, taking the total death tally to 323.Iran Iran reported 1,905 new cases on Saturday, its lowest daily total in three months and the first time since late May that the number was under 2,000. Fatalities fell for a sixth day to 110, the lowest since late June, according to the latest Health Ministry data.Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia reported 987 new coronavirus cases and 27 deaths on Saturday, dipping below 1,000 new cases daily for the first time since mid-April.The country has gradually managed to bring down daily new cases from a peak of nearly 5,000 in June, with masks mandated in public and international flights suspended since March. However its death rate has steadily crept up over the same time period, reaching 1.2 per cent on Saturday -- still among the lowest in the world.–Agencies Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Houses were built on private Palestinian lands in unauthorised West Bank outpostMike Pompeo\u0026rsquos tour of the Middle East failed to gain support for normalising ties with IsraelOne-time revolutionary Shia movement now a status quo party opposing popular protestsMore than 2,200 cases reported in 24 hours as number of infections surges to 365,606Netanyahu says now is not the time to drag the country into an unwanted fourth electionSaudi minister says \u0026lsquopeace must be achieved\u0026rsquo on the basis of international agreementsOne found guilty, three acquitted in UN-backed tribunal into killing of former Lebanese PMCourt rules there is no proof Syria was involved in Hariri\u0026rsquos assassinationFour low-ranking members of the Shia Muslim Hezbollah political party are accused of killing the former prime minister and 21 others in a massive bombing in 2005Two countries taking steps towards normal relations with telephone links and flightsPutin suggestion came after Trump said he would trigger a \u0026lsquosnapback\u0026rsquo of sanctionsAs inquiry into Beirut blast gets under way, rescue of country not ruling class urgedThursday\u0026rsquos announcement underlines split in Arab world on Palestinian questionIsraeli right wing furious over decision to drop plans for annexation of parts of the occupied West BankDire condition of Libyan migrant detention centres condemned by human rights groupsCountries to open diplomatic relations for first time and Palestine accuses UAE of selling outAgreement between the two countries described as \u0026lsquoa complete sellout\u0026rsquo of PalestiniansMove seen as victory for Israeli PM Binyamin Netanyahu and will infuriate PalestiniansCountry needs administration that can fight graft, says German ministerWith 200 dead, 6,000 injured and 300,000 destitute, the mood in Beirut is unbendingStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4342147.1598772515!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"how did labour climb 26 points to match tories in opinion polls","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s prime minister Boris Johnson has seen the Tory party lose a 26 point opinion poll lead over Labour in six months. Photograph: Getty Labour is now level-pegging with the Conservatives, according to the latest Opinium poll for the Observer, which shows the Tories have lost a massive 26-point lead in the five months since March.The survey - which puts the two main parties on 40 per cent of the vote (the Conservatives are down two points and Labour up one point on a fortnight ago) - will cause further alarm in Tory ranks as internal unrest over the performance of Boris Johnson’s government grows.At the same time it will be a boost for Labour, as MPs prepare to return to Westminster on Tuesday.It is the first time since Mr Johnson became Tory leader that Labour has been level, and caps a remarkable surge since Keir Starmer took control of the main opposition party in April.At the end of March, in the final days of Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership and when the country was rallying behind Johnson after he imposed the full lockdown on March 23rd, the Tories were 26 points ahead of Labour.An Opinium poll at the end of the month put them on 54 per cent of the vote, and Labour on 28 per cent.In the same poll at the end of March a large majority of people (65 per cent) approved of the way the government had handled the Coronavirus crisis, while 23 per cent disapproved.Five months on, after the UK became one of the worst performing nations and ministers executed a string of policy U-turns, the proportion approving has more than halved to 31 per cent, and that disapproving has more than doubled to 47 per cent.As schools prepare to reopen in England from Tuesday, a clear majority of people believe it will, however, be safe for young people to go back to the classrooms. Of those questioned, 63 per cent think it will be safe for primary schools to reopen while 30 per cent think it will not be.For secondary schools, 60 per cent think it will be safe while 33 per cent have doubts.More people (40 per cent) blame Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, for the recent exams fiasco than lay blame at the door of the regulator Ofqual (29 per cent) or teachers (10 per cent).Commenting on Labour’s recovery, Adam Drummond of Opinium said: “This is the first time Labour have drawn level since July 2019 when both main parties were in freefall and losing votes to the Brexit Party and the Liberal Democrats.“Since Boris Johnson became prime minister the Tories typically had a double-digit lead, peaking in MarchApril this year when they were seen to be handling the pandemic and lockdown fairly well while Labour changed leader. In the five months since that peak, the lead has gradually declined from 26 per cent to 0 per cent now.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4332116.1597668041!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"inside joe biden s race of a lifetime to be us president","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDemocratic presidential candidate Joe Biden: Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. Photograph: Olivier DoulieryAFP via Getty ImagesIt was late afternoon on February 2nd, the eve of the Iowa caucuses. We were jammed into a high-school gymnasium in Des Moines, the state capital, for Joe Biden’s closing rally.No one thought he would win the primary season’s talismanic opening contest the following day. Nor was he expected to come close to beating Bernie Sanders, the socialist Vermonter, in New Hampshire the next week. Though he was still ahead in the national polls, the 77-year-old former vice-president was treated as yesterday’s news.A crowd of several hundred was waiting unexpectantly. Biden entered roughly half an hour late, accompanied by a phalanx of retired politicians: John Kerry (76), the former secretary of state Chris Dodd (75), the retired senator from Connecticut Tom Vilsack (69), former governor of Iowa and Harold Schaitberger (73), president of the International Association of Firefighters.The oxygen seemed to drain from the room. As Biden’s surrogates spoke one after the other, the air got progressively thinner. By the time the candidate got up to speak, it was positively embalmed. “This is like a wake,” joked one veteran television anchor. Biden’s low-key soliloquy did little to lift the energy.Such are the limits of conventional wisdom. Twenty-seven days later, Biden grabbed the Democratic mantle after sweeping the South Carolina primary. With the notable exception of Sanders, who fought on for another five weeks, most of the rest of the field dropped out and endorsed him. It was a breathtaking twist.With hindsight, Biden officials say they always knew he would be the Democratic nominee. They were playing the long game. “We made a decision from the start not to listen to the loudest voices on Twitter,” says Stef Feldman, Biden’s policy director. That was not how many sounded at the time. When I asked a Biden staffer in Des Moines about the campaign’s mood, he used the TV anchor’s same funereal analogy.Who could blame them? Biden’s long history of running for the White House offered no cause for hope. Over a  of more than 32 years, he had not won a single primary. In 1987, he crashed out months before the voting began, having been accused of plagiarising a speech by Neil Kinnock, leader of the British Labour party.In 2008, he quit after having won just 0.9 per cent of the Iowa caucus vote. “At that point, most people thought his presidential career was over,” says Shailagh Murray, then a journalist with the Washington Post, who went on to become Biden’s deputy chief of staff. He had at least another 12 years to go. Nobody that night imagined that Barack Obama, winner of the Iowa caucus, would go on to pick Biden as his ­running mate.Ceremonial presidentThe vicissitudes of Biden’s 50 years in politics ought to make anyone sceptical of forecasts for this November. In the absence of time machines, we can only go by the numbers. Both the betting markets (about two to one in Biden’s favour) and the polls (an average eight-percentage-point lead over Donald Trump) suggest Biden will be America’s 46th president.What manner of president would he make? Half of Washington claims to know the man well. At a year above the median US male’s life expectancy, many expect him to be a ceremonial president. Even Biden’s close friends admit his energy and power of recall are not what they were.His would be a restorationist presidency – an erasure of what he is fond of describing as the Trumpian “aberration”. Others, notably Trump, depict him as a geriatric prisoner of the Democratic Party’s left. Most agree that whatever his agenda, and whatever the time of day, he would probably still talk too much.The word “logorrhea” (a tendency to extreme loquacity) has recently come into fashion. Biden’s campaign is keen to emphasise he would not, like Trump, be the “Twitterer-in-chief”.Those who know him the best – many of whom spoke to me for this profile – are in little doubt about the character he would bring to the presidency. Their Biden may stray too readily into schmaltz. But his empathy for people is real. In this pandemic-blighted election year, that quality could count for a lot.“Biden is the same guy I first met in 1969 – he was full of piss and vinegar,” says Louis Susman, a Chicago-based investor and former ambassador to the UK. “He doesn’t suffer from inner demons, he doesn’t bear grudges and he loves being around people.”Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. No other serious figure has tried this long to make it over the finishing line in recent history.A majority of Americans were not born when Biden first entered national politics. At 30, he was the fifth youngest senator in the country’s history after he won office in 1972. Biden’s 48-year political career is older than John F Kennedy, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama when they were elected.Yet he sounds remarkably similar today to the ambitious, blue-collar Irish-American that he was then. Staffers tried and failed to get him to avoid using words such as “record player” during the 2020 primaries. Calling someone a “horse’s ass” is no longer thought to be cutting. In an interview with Kitty Kelley in 1974, Biden worried about being seen as a “gay young bachelor” around Washington – by which he meant “happy”, not “LGBTQ”.So popular are Biden’s anachronisms that there is even a “Biden insult bot” – a Twitter algorithm – to which fans can turn. “You got something stuck in your craw, you milk-swillin’ circus peanut,” reads one tweet. “Shut your piehole, you hood-winked britch soiler,” reads another.‘Amtrak Joe’Most American voters already know of the ­tragedy that struck Biden in his early career. A few weeks after he was elected to the Senate, he lost his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter, Naomi, in a car crash while they were Christmas shopping in Delaware, his home state.His sons, Beau, aged three, and Hunter, aged two, survived but were hospitalised with severe injuries. Most people would have disintegrated. Biden considered not taking his Senate seat. In the end, he was persuaded to be sworn in at the hospital beside one of his sons. He said he could only continue in politics if he saw his kids every morning and night.Thus was born “Amtrak Joe” – the senator who took the 90-minute journey each evening from Washington to Wilmington to say goodnight to his sons. He commuted until 2008, long after the boys had grown up. Subtracting a tenth of nights for other travel, and nearly half the year for recess and weekends, I calculate that Biden spent at least 21,000 hours – or three years of his life – on that train.“He knew the names of every conductor and they all loved him,” says Paul Laudicina, Biden’s legislative director between 1977 and 1982. “Often, he would still be talking when he boarded, and I would go to Wilmington with him and then cross the platform and come straight back.”In the 1974 Kelley interview, the famously acerbic journalist said Biden “reeks of decency”. He nevertheless managed to sound almost Trumpian about his deceased wife. “Let me show you my favourite picture of her,” he says, holding up a snapshot of Neilia in a bikini. “She had the best body of any woman I ever saw. She looks better than a Playboy bunny, doesn’t she?” Kelley described his office as a shrine to Neilia.Biden recently conceded that he has been too invasive of women’s personal space – “handsiness” has also entered the DC lexicon. Unlike some of his contemporaries, however, he has not been dogged by rumours of infidelity. A former Senate staffer, Tara Reade, accused him earlier this year of sexually assaulting her in a corridor in 1993. Biden denies it and her story has been criticised as inconsistent.In 1977 Biden married Jill Tracy Jacobs, a teacher based in Wilmington. On their first date he dressed in a jacket. When he dropped her back home he shook her hand. According to What it Takes, the ­celebrated 1988 campaign book by the late ­Richard Ben Cramer, Jill said she could not believe such men still existed. “Jill is Biden’s least appreciated strength,” says Susman, who often hosted the Bidens for Thanksgiving in his Nantucket home.Much of Biden’s sense of gravity comes from her. Even when her husband was vice-president, Jill Biden continued to teach every day at a community college in Northern Virginia. When he left office in 2017, the Bidens’ net worth was less than $500,000. They still hadn’t paid off the mortgage on their Wilmington home.Irish-Catholic and handsomeUntil he was rescued from near-certain genteel decline by Obama, Biden was defined by his disastrous 1988 presidential bid. Most of the people who helped him on that jinxed quest, including Ted Kaufman, his long-running chief of staff, Michael Donilon, his chief strategist today, and Donilon’s brother Tom, Biden’s foreign-policy adviser, are still around him.They are mostly Irish-American and very tight-knit. Cathy Russell, Tom Donilon’s wife, was Jill Biden’s chief of staff when she was “second lady”. Her husband is tipped as a possible secretary of state. Kaufman is running Biden’s presidential transition – that long and rickety bridge between victory and inauguration.In the 1988 campaign, Biden tried to present himself as the new John F Kennedy – young, Irish-Catholic and handsome. It never quite took hold. Then he saw a video of Kinnock’s soaring oratory – “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university?” That was the middle-class poetry Biden had been lacking – the story of how the sons and daughters of coal miners had been lifted up by the welfare state, Britain’s version of the New Deal.“He grabbed that tape and took it home he inhaled the thing,” wrote Cramer. “It was like when Barbra Streisand came on the radio – Kinnock was singing Joe’s song.” For the most part, Biden credited Kinnock’s words. But the rival Michael Dukakis campaign found one tape where Biden had not. They leaked it.Suddenly, Biden was inundated with calls asking whether his grandfather had been a coal miner (none of his forebears had been). “It looked like Joe didn’t just steal the words, it looked like he ripped off Kinnock’s life,” Cramer wrote. A few months after dropping out, Biden had a near-fatal ­aneurysm. Then another. He was given a 50-50 chance of ­surviving the first nine-hour operation.“Joe wouldn’t be alive today if he had still been running for president,” says Kaufman. “He wouldn’t have had the time to get his headaches checked out.” Or, as Biden said when he emerged from the anaesthetic: “Now I know why the campaign ended like it did.” For what it’s worth, Kinnock’s Labour Party lost the election too.Emotional antennaeBiden’s 2008 loss left less of a mark on him, partly because he became vice-president less than a year later. “How could you begrudge losing to Barack Obama?” says Murray. “Obama was like The Beatles.”The campaign Biden still regrets was the one that he didn’t fight in 2016. His reluctance stemmed from another tragedy, the death in 2015 of his son Beau from brain cancer. But he had little encouragement from Obama, who had already committed to backing Hillary Clinton. Biden’s internal polls show that he would have beaten Trump. But he had little chance of wresting the crown from Clinton, whose machine he could not hope to match.In his memoir Promise Me, Dad, named after Beau’s request that his father stay in politics, Biden recounts his anger following a Politico story that he was exploiting his son’s death for electoral purposes. “It exceeded even my worst expectations of what the opposition was going to be like,” he wrote. In truth, he could not discuss running without breaking down. “He would literally start to cry every time we raised the subject,” says a Biden ­confidante.In another cycle, Biden’s lachrymosity might have been an albatross. During coronavirus, his emotional antennae look like a virtue. More than 165,000 Americans have now died in the pandemic. That toll is likely to be approaching a quarter of a million by early November.Trump’s inability to express condolences for America’s grieving families could not be further apart from Biden’s. In 2016, anger was the dominant political emotion. In 2020, it feels more like sadness. “If Trump were matter, then Biden is anti-matter – their characters are opposites,” says Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor who has been advising Biden on constitutional matters since the mid-1980s.When Biden was vice-president, Norm Ornstein, a veteran Congressional watcher, lost his son in a tragic accident. “The moment he heard, Biden telephoned and spent an hour on the phone with me and my wife, talking us through it,” says ­Ornstein. “The next day I received a handwritten letter of condolence from him. There is nothing fake about his sympathy. He feels it deeply.”Andrew Yang, the maverick hit of the Democratic primaries, says: “When most people hadn’t figured out who I was, Joe took me aside and was very gracious and friendly. This was just as true when things were going badly for him – he’s always steady and good-natured, in public and in private.”‘Shoot. Me. Now’Some in Biden’s world admit they have one or two concerns about the election and beyond. Chief of these is his tendency to make gaffes. In that sense, the lockdown has a silver lining: there is no campaign trail to avoid. Zoom is easier to manage.When Obama was elected to the US Senate in 2004, Biden invited him to join the foreign relations committee, of which he was chairman. Having listened to a trademark Biden disquisition, Obama scribbled a note and handed it to a staffer. It read: “Shoot. Me. Now.”When the two men were discussing how they would handle their White House relationship, Obama said: “I want your advice Joe, I just want it in 10-minute, not 60-minute, increments.” For the most part, Biden complied.Sometimes, he could not help himself. The term “Bidenism” – self-inflicted public humiliation – has long been in currency. “Stand up Chuck, let ’em see ya,” Biden once said to a Missouri state senator in a wheelchair. “Folks, I can tell you, I’ve known eight presidents, three of them intimately,” he said in praise of Obama, adding: “I promise you, the president has a big stick, I promise you,” in a mangled rendition of Theodore Roosevelt’s dictum about speaking softly and carrying a big stick.Fear of such miscues saw the Obama camp “quarantine” Biden for most of the 2012 re-election campaign. This year’s actual quarantine could thus be helpful.Many in Biden world are betting that his choice of Kamala Harris as running mate will immunise him against a record of racial gaffes. Earlier this year, Biden apologised after saying that “you ain’t black” if you would consider voting against him. As a mixed-race American of Indian and Jamaican heritage, the Harris pick will buy Biden more protection.Given Biden’s age, she is far likelier than most running mates to become president. As Biden discovered in the primaries, she also knows how to throw a punch.It is hard to find anyone in Biden’s circle who is losing sleep over three debates with Trump later this year. As Biden showed in 2008 with Sarah Palin and in 2012 with Paul Ryan – the Republican running mates of John McCain and Mitt Romney – he is a surprisingly taut debater.Trump, meanwhile, seems to be afflicted with his own severe dose of logorrhea. His recent boast in a Fox News interview that he recalled five words in order in a cognitive test was greeted with mockery. “I have two words for you,” says a senior adviser, when I ask about Biden’s age and prolixity: “Donald Trump. ”Biden’s peopleNor is the campaign worried about Twitter. When I asked two Biden officials whether he composed his own tweets, or would know how to send one, I got an unexpectedly constipated response: “No one has ever asked us that.” It turns out that Biden does not physically send his own tweets but is involved with their substance.Their second concern is ageing. At 74, Trump is only a smidgen younger than Biden. The difference with Trump is the people with whom Biden would surround himself. Chief among these is Ron Klain, a long-standing Biden aide who is likely to be White House chief of staff. Tony Blinken would probably be his national security adviser.Other top-job contenders would include Tom Donilon and Susan Rice (successive national security advisers to Obama), Kurt Campbell (who ran Asia policy for Obama), Jake Sullivan (who leads Biden’s campaign policy), Nick Burns, a former under secretary of state, and Bill Burns (no relation), a former deputy secretary of state. Michèle Flournoy, a former under secretary of defence, is tipped as a likely Pentagon chief.One adviser predicted that Biden would choose Romney, the Republican senator from Utah, as his secretary of state. That would annoy Vladimir Putin’s Russia, whom Romney described as America’s “number one geopolitical foe”. It would also upset most Democrats for very different reasons.Either way, the contrast between Biden’s friends and the parade of often bizarre cameos that have staffed the Trump administration is glaring. The current president is now on his fourth chief of staff and sixth national security adviser. By contrast, most of Biden’s coterie have known him for decades.“What leaps out about Biden’s people is their competence,” says John Podesta, a senior official in both the Clinton and Obama White Houses. “Neither he nor his team need training wheels.”There are also lingering worries about Hunter Biden, who has long been a source of concern for his father. “Joe has a total blind spot about Hunter,” says a close family friend.Hunter was discharged from the US Navy because he tested positive for cocaine. He launched various business ventures while his father was vice-president. He was accused of monetising the Biden name and subsequently got a seat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.Trump’s attempts to extort Ukraine to supply Biden opposition research resulted in his impeachment last year (though he was acquitted by the Senate). “The campaign just has to keep Hunter out of the picture,” says the friend.Radical platformWhat would Biden actually do in office? Tackling the pandemic would be the first, second and third priority of any incoming president. Little can happen while the US economy is under semi-­permanent lockdown.Beyond that his economic platform is radical by the standards of any recent Democratic president, including Obama. “We would have the largest mobilisation of investments since world war two,” says Feldman. “We would start by putting pandemic logistics and supply on a war footing.”Some people compare the gargantuan challenges of today to 1932, when Franklin D Roosevelt won the election in the middle of the Great Depression. In spite of running a fairly bland campaign, FDR then embarked on a streak of “bold, persistent experimentation” that would remake America.But the differences are more interesting. For all its ravages, coronavirus is not as intractable as the Great Depression. By next January, the world should be closer to having a vaccine. Biden would also be fulfilling the first rule of any job – always follow an under-performer.He could achieve a lot in his first 100 days simply by covering the basics, such as launching a national coronavirus plan, shunning Twitter and not insulting foreign leaders. “If you have an American president at foreign summits eating with his mouth closed and not throwing cutlery around, the world will give him a standing ovation,” says one adviser and friend.Low-hanging foreign-policy fruit that Biden would pluck in his opening days include rejoining the World Health Organisation, the Paris agreement on climate change and the Iran nuclear deal, says Jake Sullivan. He would also convene a global summit to tackle Covid-19.Domestic steps would include stopping work on the US-Mexico border wall (such as it is), setting up a daily coronavirus briefing led by Dr Anthony Fauci or Ron Klain (who led Obama’s Ebola team) and picking an attorney general who would embrace planks of Black Lives Matter’s criminal-justice reform agenda.In his dealings both with Republicans and foreign leaders, Biden would place great stock in personal chemistry. Enjoying the company of people is one area where Biden is as different to Obama as he is to Trump. “The thing that Biden most likes is what Obama liked the least – the ­personal stuff,” says Podesta. Nick Burns says Biden revels in the “constant gardening” of diplomacy – talking frequently to his counterparts.Wishful thinkingSceptics point out that today’s Republican Party is unrecognisable to the one with which Biden grew up. Should he emerge intact from transition with a paranoid Trump, the chances of the defeated party working with him will be slim. Woke nativism will prove a more durable pathogen than Covid-19.Moreover, Biden’s global honeymoon would be unlikely to last long. Most people view his musings about restoring the status quo ante – going back to the world before Trump – as wishful thinking, not that geopolitical trends were particularly stable during the Obama years.China looms far larger today than it did in 2016. Biden’s favourite European, Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, is due to retire by next year. And Biden will neither be inclined – nor likely in a position – to offer Britain’s Boris Johnson the US-UK trade deal he craves.Tony Blinken, Biden’s senior foreign policy adviser, says Biden’s scepticism about Obama’s ineffectual Afghanistan surge looks better and better in hindsight. “I respect Gates tremendously but he just wanted approval for his Afghanistan plan and Biden disagreed,” he says. Biden was in favour of US intervention in Bosnia in 1995, he adds, to convey that Biden is not some ­inveterate peacenik.But Biden’s biggest migraine would probably be at home. In the coming weeks, Trump is likely to make a lot of Biden’s “socialist” agenda – the hundreds of billions he has pledged to spend on everything from college education to rural broadband.Should Biden follow Obama’s example and pick Wall Street-friendly economic advisers, the left’s distrust would soon resurface. Last week, Lawrence Summers, Obama’s chief economic adviser and Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary, ruled out joining a Biden administration. “My time in government is behind me,” he told the Aspen Security Forum.Happy passengerTo many people’s surprise, the left has largely fallen into line. Bernie Sanders dropped nearly all his most-cherished demands to agree a joint platform with Biden. This is in stark contrast to Sanders’s stand-offish – and simmeringly uneasy – ceasefire with Hillary Clinton in 2016.An estimated one-fifth of Sanders’s supporters in 2016 either sat on their hands or voted for Trump. Biden has not adopted a universal basic income, Medicare for all or a wealth tax – Sanders’s top three priorities.Yet the Vermont senator seems to be a happy passenger on Amtrak Joe’s train. Their policies may differ but their values are not miles apart. “Biden believes that his ultimate calling is to make life better for the middle class,” says Jared Bernstein, an economic adviser. “His watchword is ‘dignity.’” Ted Kaufman adds: “Biden and Bernie may disagree ideologically but they respect each other’s integrity.”Might such charms work on Republicans? I spoke to many people in Biden’s world and none thought the Republican leopard was likely to change its spots. One said: “Joe is still a romantic about the Senate. He will have to learn the hard way.”The omens for old-fashioned Biden-style bipartisanship are not cheerful. Yet there is an improbability to Biden’s odyssey that should give anyone pause. The lyrics may be corny. The music is not. It is an odd mix of Shakespearean tragedy and Shakespearean comedy.I have heard people describe Biden as the embodiment of America’s can-do spirit. Shailagh Murray called him a “spiritual optimist”. A campaign official talked of his “strategic empathy”. I have also heard people call Biden a “clown”, including a former Obama official.Biden loves to talk of when “the man meets the moment”. The joke is that he has said this about himself every time he has run for office. There has never been a moment where Biden does not think he should be residing in the White House.But like a stopped clock, perhaps this time he is right. “Life is about choices, right?” says a former senior CIA official who has interacted with Biden over more than three decades. “Biden or Trump?” He admitted that he occasionally saw Biden as a “mediocre” politician. But he added that Biden always struck him as fundamentally decent, which sounds like a subversive quality in today’s Washington.“Even if you thought that Biden was mediocre,” he continued, “you would take mediocre over catastrophic every time.”– Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"exclusive british librarys chief librarian claims racism creation","story":"The British Library’s chief librarian has claimed “racism is a creation of white people” and backed calls for major cultural change at the institution, the  can reveal.Liz Jolly manages the vast collection of literary treasures held by the institution, and is supporting changes to displays and collections in the wake of Black Lives Matter protests. Reforms are being proposed by a “Decolonising Working Group”, which claims the British Library’s London building is an imperialism symbol because it resembles a battleship.Staff being supported to decolonise the UK’s national library have also suggested that traditional puppet Mr Punch reflects “colonial violence”The  has exclusively obtained documents revealing these claims, and a letter endorsed hundreds of employees which declared a racial “state of emergency” at the institution.In response to this emergency, an internal report called for the removal of statues of the library’s founding fathers, replacing “Eurocentric” maps, and reviewing collections of western classical music which staff branded part of the “outdated notion” of Western Civilization.The institution recently faced calls for defunding from MPs after the  revealed employees had urged colleagues to donate to Black Lives Matter and back the work of Labour MP Dianne Abbott.The  can now reveal that Chief Librarian Ms Jolly has urged white staff to support the institution\u0027s plans to purge the library of perceived racism.In a video clip obtained by the  she tells colleagues: “I think, as I have said before, that we need to make sure some white colleagues are involved, because racism is a creation of white people.”Ms Jolly receives between £120,000 and £125,000 per year for her work as Chief Librarian, a role she has held since 2018.She has given her support to a broad “Anti-Racism Project” proposed in the wake of Black Lives Matter protests, telling colleagues “particularly pressing” work was ongoing to review “artworks in the St Pancras building”.Ms Jolly assured staff that the project is “about developing and delivering major cultural change”, and part of this would be ensuring the repository of literary treasures will “reflect the ersity of Britain today”.This followed on from a letter declaring a “state of emergency” at the library, signed by 200 employees, demanding BAME staff should review any job cuts which might affect employees with “protected characteristics” to ensure continued ersity at the library, better treatment of these workers, and ensuring the BAME Network has a say in who is employed as Head of Collections.To tackle the legacy of “colonial violence” at the library, the letter also demands a statue of founder Sir Hans Sloane be removed.This recommended removal is echoed in a report by the Decolonising Working Group, which claims that the “physical space” of the British Library contains “manifestations of the institution’s racism” by glorifying the British Empire.Staff claim in the report that: “This glorification is hard to miss in the structure of the building itself, designed as it is in the form of a battleship, by far the greatest symbol of British imperialism.”The building was designed by architect and former naval officer Sir Colin Wilson, who added maritime references such as portholes to the building.In the report aimed at reforming the British Library “as a space”, visual aspects including a portrait of Mr Punch which hangs in the institution is critiqued.The character, popular at seaside shows is: “A theatrical figure from the heyday of Victorian imperialism who ‘entertained’ through an abuse of women and children that mirrored colonial Violence.”Staff have also claimed Library links to the “ongoing settler-colonisation of Palestine”, and have proclaimed that “every vacant wall” of the institution’s property should be used to advertise the cause of anti-racism.Other recommended actions include reducing the number of European maps on display, being “tools of power”, and reviewing the presence of busts of Beethoven and Mendelssohn, whose revered status is part and parcel of “western civilizational supremacy”. The music collections should also be ersified, the report suggests.The Decolonising Working Group is part of the BAME Network at the library, which advised colleagues to read Marxist authors and support Black Lives Matter, deeming “colour-blindness” a form of “covert white supremacy”.In their compiled report circulated among staff they demand the bust of another library founder, botanist Sir Joseph Banks, be removed and the statue of King George III be reviewed.Their work has been acknowledged by the ongoing Anti-Racism Project at the institution, which is being backed Chief Executive Roly Keating and Chief Librarian Ms Jolly, who has enjoined white staff to advance the project to address the “creation by white people”“This says to me that there is something fundamentally wrong with the leadership of the British Library,” said MP Ben Bradley.“If the Chief Librarian is so unhappy with British history perhaps they should not be in that job.“The very suggestion that racism only applies in one direction , by white people towards BAME people, is categorically false, inflammatory and isive.”The British Library houses almost 200 million objects, many of which have major importance to British history, culture, and literature. These include two copies of the Magna Carta.A spokesman for the British Library said: When our galleries reopen on Tuesday, visitors will see that the busts of Sir Hans Sloane and other historically significant collectors remain in place in the Library\u0027s front hall, with fresh interpretation from our curators that provides information about the contentious aspects of some of their legacy, as well as their achievements.Ms Jolly has been contacted for comment. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"liz truss set ambition gold standard trade deal australia","story":"A Whitehall source On Saturday night said both sides were optimistic a deal can be struck before the end of the year, with the UK also hoping to conclude a deal with Japan in the same time frame.The trade bloc, comprising 11 nations including Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, accounts for 13 per cent of global commerce, with 95 per cent of goods traded between members tariff-free.  The UK is said to be particularly drawn to the bloc due to huge growth potential as well its high standards in areas such as digital and data. “We are intensifying talks over the next few weeks, and fighting hard for British interests in areas like financial services, telecoms, tech, and food and drink.The UK intends to secure zero-tariffs on UK exports including whisky, gin, sausages and cars, currently set at five per cent, as well as simplifying customs processes, and making it easier for professional and financial services companies to operate in Australia. While Downing Street has not yet confirmed the appointment, which is expected to be as an advisor, Mr Abbott is due to be in London this week to address the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee and speak at a think tank event. In a foreword to a paper published in 2017 by the Tory backbench Free Enterprise Group, Mr Abbott added: Of course, no two countries are more like-minded than Britain and Australia.

It would be surprising if he did not touch on the issue of impartiality, given it is such a live issue.” On the review into social media, they added: “There is an acute understanding among some people, senior in the organisation, that this is an issue that needs to be addressed.”It comes as Sir Robbie Gibb, the former head of BBC Westminster and director of communications to Theresa May, warns that last week’s row over the Last Night of the Proms has made “painfully clear” the challenges faced by Mr Davie. He adds that the BBC has been “culturally captured by the woke dominated group think” among staff, adding that its journalists are “increasingly letting their politics preferences show.”Urging Mr Davie to tackle the problem, Sir Robbie calls for a new steering group to be established to enforce impartiality and ensure “that content genuinely reflects the outlook of the country.”He also argues that the BBC Board, working with the department for editorial policy and standards, should commission “Ofsted-style reports” into inidual programmes and how the broadcaster is covering major stories.On Saturday night it also emerged that Sir Robbie is also spearheading a drive to raise funds for a rival news channel to the BBC, called GB News. Separately, a group of 14 Conservative MPs have written to Mr Davie this weekend, claiming that the BBC is “fundamentally failing” to reflect the “erse perspectives and interests” of the public in its output.They cite the row over the Proms as the latest example and urge Mr Davie to reinstate the lyrics of the songs, as well as addressing what they describe as a “distinct lack of impartiality in BBC reporting and commentary.”Mr Davie’s intervention is likely to be welcomed by Boris Johnson, with senior ministers lauding Mr Davie as someone prepared to shake up the organisation at a time of major change in broadcasting. The issue of impartiality is said to be at the top of Downing Street’s agenda, following a series of clashes in recent months over its election coverage and comments made by high-profile presenters. Concerns have been reignited in recent weeks after Newsnight’s policy editor Lewis Goodall was accused by Sir Robbie of “off the scale” bias for writing for a Left-wing magazine attacking the Government’s handling of the exam crisis. Goodall pointed out that his article looked at the handling of exams by all political parties that govern the UK.While the BBC said the article had met its impartiality guidelines, it comes just months after presenter Emily Maitlis was reprimanded over a monologue attacking the Government’s handling of Dominic Cummings’ lockdown trip to Durham.Separately, Gary Lineker, the host of Match of the Day, has previously clashed with BBC colleagues over his comments on Twitter about Brexit and Dominic Cummings, the Prime Minister’s chief adviser. However, as a non-news presenter, Lineker has more freedom to voice his views, with the BBC previously stating that his role as a sports host means his “personal political views does not affect the BBC\u0027s impartiality.Previously, Downing Street temporarily ordered ministers to boycott BBC Radio 4’s Today programme over anger at the broadcaster’s general election coverage. The BBC has also come under intense criticism from supporters of former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bbc has real chance reform losing sight purpose","story":"If the BBC\u0027s new director-general was in any doubt about the scale of the challenge he faces in reforming the corporation, events this week will have made it painfully clear.Tim Davie, who takes up his post next week, has already been forced to intervene to bring some much needed common sense to the BBC\u0027s consideration of removing the patriotic anthem Rule, Britannia from the Last Night of the Proms.It seems BBC bosses were so fearful of causing offence to woke activists who claimed the song was racist, they ended up outraging the vast majority of the public who are proud of their country, its heritage and its traditions.What the Rule, Britannia debacle shows is that BBC decision makers have lost sight of who they are working for and are basing decisions on their own sensibilities, rather than the values and views of the audience they are supposed to serve.The BBC has been culturally captured by the woke-dominated group think of some of its own staff. There is a default Left-leaning attitude from a metropolitan workforce mostly drawn from a similar social and economic background.When the BBC moved some of its output out of London, it simply replaced metropolitan London with metropolitan Manchester, Leeds or Glasgow.The BBC has strict editorial guidelines and processes to ensure the sensibilities and sensitivities of its audience are paramount. But all too often, as one insider put it to me, BBC staff are making programmes for other BBC staff - not for licence fee payers.Once the gold standard of impartial, fair and accurate news, BBC journalists are increasingly letting their political preferences show. This can range from subtle bias, such as liking certain tweets, to flagrant breaches of the BBC\u0027s impartiality rules - such as Lewis Goodall, Newsnight\u0027s policy editor, grabbing the cover story of Left-wing magazine New Statesman, with his attack on the handling of exam grading.Over time, BBC\u0027s news teams have focused on other priorities than impartiality - such as making an impact for a particular programme or raising the profile of inidual journalists.Social media has eaten away at BBC impartiality, encouraging staff to see online success in terms of the number of followers or the number of times a post is liked or retweeted. That leads to news programmes seeking controversy and the car-crash interview while journalists blur the line between reporting and political commentary.There is an obvious long-term recruitment challenge for Mr Davie to grapple with but the BBC also requires more urgent reform.The erosion of BBC staff\u0027s online impartiality is subject to an internal review, the results of which will be revealed by Mr Davie in a keynote speech on the corporation\u0027s reform next week. But top-down decrees for a change of direction, no matter how correct, will fall foul of the pervading BBC culture unless enforced with radical action.The BBC\u0027s editorial decisions are devolved to departmental heads, programme editors, item producers, reporters and presenters. That means, unless calls for reform come with a new system that rewards programme impartiality and is accompanied by rigorous enforcement, nothing will change.The BBC\u0027s referendum coverage shows it is more than capable of enforcing impartiality. At the start of the EU referendum campaign, senior BBC executives and news editors met to discuss how to cover what promised to be one of the most potentially isive political events in modern history. There was widespread concern that, regardless of outcome, the losing side in the debate would seek to blame BBC bias in part for the result. It led to the imposition of an impartiality first culture throughout the campaign.Programme commissions were regularly checked to ensure they represented a wide spectrum of views. It was used most notably to prevent soap operas, dramas and specials - from Countryfile to EastEnders - from injecting anti-Brexit political script lines just because it was deemed topical. On news output, everything from running orders and language to guest bookings were subjected to the impartiality test.Yet almost as soon as Britain\u0027s verdict was delivered, the rigorous rules were relaxed and anti-Brexit bias and metropolitan group think crept back into the corporation\u0027s coverage.What was achieved on a temporary basis can become the norm.In order to avoid political bias in news and entertainment, a cross-BBC steering group should be established. Its aim would be to ensure impartiality across all BBC output and that content genuinely reflects the outlook of the country. Impartiality should not be just part of the mix but the number one priority and starting point for every item and running order.In order to provide evidence and benchmarks on which impartiality can be judged, the BBC Board, working with the BBC Editorial Policy and Standards department, should commission regular Ofsted-style reports into inidual programmes and how the BBC is handling a particular running story.The BBC can only be justified as a publicly funded broadcaster if it provides something its commercial rivals and newspapers do not - truly impartial news coverage.Over the past decade, the BBC has drifted away from its purpose and the people it serves. The arrival of Mr Davie offers a real chance to change course - BBC staff must not squander it.Sir Robbie Gibb is the former head of BBC Westminster and former director of communications at No 10 Downing StreetMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bbc does not represent britain","story":"It is clear from its news, its commentary, its dramas and its dismal, lazy comedy that it despises the voting majority which — to the out-of-touch corporation’s disbelief — repeatedly backed both Brexit and the Tories.Its decision now to censor Rule, ­Britannia! and Land of Hope and Glory ought to be the last straw.Boris Johnson has rightly joined many others in condemning it.

I cannot remember any government being so devoid of direction, leadership, policy, conviction and — frankly — intelligence.And I had to endure Ted Heath AND John Major’s attempts to run the country. Oh, and the shaft of glorious sunshine that was Gordon Brown. Those guys have nothing on Boris. He is the clear leader in the field. If you ever wanted to know what a country would look likeit was led by Frank Spencer, here you go. Yes, I know — I’m showing my age. To be honest, under this administration I’m feeling my age.For those who don’t remember, Frank was a bumbling, dithering, halfwit from the s sitcom Some Mothers Do ’Ave ’Em. The only dference with Bojo is that Frank was thinner. And, mercully, a fictional creation. Boris is all too real. Many kids will be going back to school wearing face masks. For ages, this government insisted that they would not have to do so. Now they’ve changed their minds. Face masks and grouped in “bubbles”. Probably getting only about half of their usual education,that. Any kid who coughs will be pounced upon, exiled to the Outer Hebrides and the entire school shuts down. Never mind that there has been no recorded case of a schoolkid passing on the virus to a teacher.Never mind that our economy needs the schools fully open with a proper, normal, timetable, so people can get back to work.After six months of no lessons , the kids now have to endure insufferable conditions at school.This is because Boris and the rest have proved utterly incapable of standing up to the teaching unions .Other U-turns have involved the wearing of masks in shops, the usefulness of masks in general, whether there’s any point in closing our borders, the schools due to re-open in June, the scrapping of an expensive track and trace system, the re-grading of GCSEs and A levels . . . oh lordy, the list goes on and on.Sometimes the U-turn appears only a day after the original decision.Sometimes we have to wait a week or so. But come they surely do, a long parade of staggering ineptitude. In fact, I think even Frank Spencer would have been more decisive. Maybe the right comparison is with Benny from Crossroads. Yes, it’s my age again. For those who don’t know, Benny was a cast-iron moron.We know that dealing with this horrible pandemic can’t have been easy. We know Boris has had a dficult year.But the utter lack of planning and resolve has been astonishing. Slow to take the virus seriously, bizarrely refusing to close our airports at the peak of the outbreak, hopelessly lost over track and trace and what do with our poor kids.This has been mismanagement on an almost heroic level. My guess is that Boris will not survive as Prime Minister: His party will get shot of him when the opportunity arises. Because here’s the crucial, damaging question.Could Jeremy Corbyn have handled this crisis any worse I DON’T think those smug monkeys at the BBC realised the fury they would unleash when they banned singing our favourite anthems at The Last Night Of The Proms.A petition reached , names in just  hours.And Dame Vera Lynn is suddenly at No in the iTunes chart with Land Of Hope And Glory.The BBC apparently agreed with the Finnish conductor, Dalia Stasevska, that the “jingoistic” words of Land Of Hope And Glory and Rule Britannia would not be heard this year.I wonder what convinced Ms Stasevska to agree to conduct an evening of patriotic songs when she hates patriotic songs Money, you would guess. Meanwhile another BBC bureaucrat, Cat Lewis, likened singing the songs to Nazis singing about gas chambers.Silly woman. The BBC – its entire staff – has no understanding of the British people. It despises them. Support for the corporation is at an all-time low. And yet the BBC is still up to its tricks. Pulling off the unusual feat of being already in a coffin, but reaching out somehow to hammer more nails into its own lid.A TEAM of British scientists has been studying dreams and what they mean.And they’ve discovered they mean sod all.

As a result, very few people watch it — but it’s the toast of Beeb journos and left-wing social media, giving it undeserved influence over our daily news agenda.Despite her dressing-down over that outrageous Dominic Cummings monologue, Emily Maitlis is considered untouchable by executives. No one dares warn her that constant unbalanced questioning of Tory politicians and right-wing commentators is putting the very future of the Beeb under threat.And then there’s Lewis Goodall, the left-wing operative turned Newsnight policy editor who last week was allowed to author a feature for the New Statesman magazine headlined: “Failed.

And during lockdown we have seen that people are eating more and more while at home.“If people stay working from home this could well continue. Eating too much could precipitate Type  ­diabetes, which is a chronic condition which will impact you for le once the damage is done.“For many people, the fridge and kitchen cupboards are just a few steps from their desks and it’s all too easy to snack and pick at high-sugar, high-fat foods, piling on the calories.”Professor Tam Fry, of campaign group the National Obesity Forum, said: “Working from home means missing out on that walk to and from the station and structured breaks. Instead, you may have minimal exercise and constant access to snacks.“Weight gain is associated with many diseases including diabetes, heart disease and even cancer.”Despite the Government’s plea for ato workplaces, major ­corporations such as Twitter, Barclays and Google are now telling their thousands of staff they can work from home permanently, as remote working measures put in place during lockdown have proved so successful.On average we save £. a week by not going to work.But mental health experts say staying home will inevitably cause long-term damage.Psychologist Emma Kenny said: “What makes us human is physical contact and ­intimacy, eventhat means ­office interactions like chatting at the water cooler.“It’s obvious that the more isolated you are, the more your ­mental health issues grow. Online connection is not real ­connection, and while flexible working can be a brilliant option, we can’t underestimate the long-term impact of social isolation on mental wellness.“Since people have been working from home more this year, we have already seen a staggering increase in depression, anxiety and loneliness.“Cases of domestic violence, neglect and abuse are through the roof and we can expect that to continuepeople are incubated with their ­families.”Domestic killings more than doubled during lockdown and there has been a staggering increase of  per cent in domestic abuse cases. Visits to the charity Refuge’s ­website have surged by more than , per cent and this week the NSPCC reported a  per cent increase in reports of child abuse.As for the toll on physical health, GP Dr Marios Anastasiades said: “Spending hours hunched over a ­laptop on the dining table in an uncomfortable chair that has not been ergonomically designed puts a strain on your spine and your whole musculoskeletal system.“Even lighting is not designed for long working days in most homes, so it’s no surprise there has been an explosion in the number of people seeing chiropractors and physios or their doctor. The effect on mental health of working in isolation should not be underestimated. Chats by the watercooler are actually good for you.“Staying permanently at home, working long hours and juggling family le can put people under a tremendous strain. Or for those who live alone, feelings of isolation can be overwhelming.”However, he added: “If you can’t get back to work, don’t worry — take plenty of exercise, try to get the best chair you can, take plenty of breaks andyou feel low, please seek advice from your doctor.” And Sun GP Dr Carol Cooper said: “Despite the drawbacks and challenges of working from home it’s proved a positive experience for a lot of people. It’s cut a long commute for many, saving money and time. And for those with mobility issues it’s been a bonus.“But those working from home must take steps to protect their health. Eat only at meal times, don’t graze all day. Take frequent breaks and build exercise into your working day.“Get the best seat you can ­afford — it is an investment in your health. Make sure you meet others, andyou feel anxious or alone, talk to someone about your feelings.”Counsellor Charlotte Sharp, of Charlotte Sharp Counselling, said she and her colleagues have seen a steep increase in people seeking help for anxiety, burnout and depression across the UK.She said: “Working from home constantly is not good for mental health. We are social beings.“Losing social interactions means a greater risk of burnout.“The loss of routine, such as many people not even getting dressed for work, means they can quickly fall into a downward spiral and depression.” And  London financial adviser Peter Lane, of the firm Fortis Financial, said: “The hidden costs of setting up a home office are a couple of grand at least.“You need to get the best broadband and proper office furniture, while utility bills, when your heating’s on all day, will at least double.“We will all be using more water and electricity, and our food bills will go up too, since we are having all our meals and snacks at home now.“Some may even find they need to move to a bigger home to accommodate a home office.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Today I can reveal we are forming a crack team of sport, health and tech experts called the Sport Tech Innovation Group, who will work with sports bodies including the Premier League and ECB and the ground safety regulator to explore high-tech solutions that can get fans back into venues in greater numbers.That kind of tech could include tracking devices to measure social distancing between fans, and fluorescent disinfectants to reveal how often surfaces are touched.

They then saw the tooth imprints matched their samples.He told The Times: If you look at the upper carnassial teeth there are three projections from the tooth and the distance between two of them is far wider in cats, probably double that found in a similar imprint from a dog.In the past six years we have analysed more than  skeletal remains and from that we have  good carnassial samples. Five of those we are relatively confident come from a medium to large-sized felid. The others are more suggestive of small carnivores but five certainly do fit the bill as far as puma or melanistic black leopard.Dr Hemmings said that five of his colleagues at the university had reported seeing a big cat, with one having seen a mountain lion, also known as a puma, vaulting a dry stone wall.Big cats are believed to have been released into the wild during the Second World War when meat for their food was scarce.Earlier this month, a big cat was spotted stalking through a park in Cambridge.Dan Underwood, who was there at the time, said: I was out and about enjoying the sun and spotted a very large cat walking across Coldhams Common.It was around pm and I was sat on Coldhams Common where the Parkrun would normally take place. I just saw it in the corner of my eye and just straight away took a video.It was the size of a medium dog, lean and very agile looking. It was a light sand colour with dark spots, and big pointed ears.Much bigger than a regular cat.It had no collar and didnt seem to be in any panic. It just simply walked on by.The markings on the cat, which Dan filmed, were distinctive and look similar to those of a Savannah Cat.In May, concerns were raised after a large cat went missing from a billionaire owner in Hampstead, North London.Armed cops were called to the scene after the hybrid Savannah cat was spotted in a garden.Officers were joined by an animal expert as they surrounded the feline but were unable to catch it.The politan Police said the cat was not deemed to be a danger to the public and no attacks had been reported.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Boris Johnson said kids wouldn’t have to wear face masks, because “you can’t learn with face coverings”. This is true,the covering you’re wearing is made of concrete and you place it over your head, then it plays a selection of tracks by Iron Maiden. Andyou can’t learn while wearing a face mask, I wonder how anyone learns to be a surgeon. When a medical student performs their first operation, they must think “oh no, I can’t remember a thing we learned at medical school as I was wearing a mask. Which of these things is the heart and which one is the liver ” The World Health Organisation insists masks should be worn, but what does it know about health  For advice on how to avoid coronavirus, it’s much more sensible to consult someone who told you they were proudly going to shake hands with a long line of people who had coronavirus as there’s no way you could catch it like that, and then caught it like that. Then Boris Johnson’s advice changed, and he said it was the head teacher’s decision whether to instruct students to wear a face mask. That’s the sort of leadership we need. Nothing could be clearer and more decisive than to say: “Do what you want, I haven’t got a clue. If they don’t wear masks and all their grandparents start conking out, they’d better start putting them on I suppose.”  Then he changed his mind again to “everyone has to wear a face mask in corridors”. Next week it will almost certainly change again, and he’ll announce: “All students must dress as Elvis Presley in his later years. Parents will be responsible for providing white jackets, and any child without a quf will be sent home.” To make the restart guidelines even clearer, the Government announced at pm on Friday they wanted schools to introduce a rota system in lockdown areas, so kids would be taught at dferent times, meaning every lesson has to be rearranged. Tomorrow they’ll say: “Every child must spend half the lesson upside-down. Every class must include a pelican, which must be scrubbed with beak-sanitiser every seven minutes. And English must be taught in Welsh.” At four in the morning of the restart, they’ll announce schools have to use Tokyo time, which is nine hours ahead, which means they’re already late starting so they’ve all failed their OFSTED.

The South Korean report, based on  children, found that the virus could be found in their noses for up to three weeks, eventhey have no or few symptoms. Authors of the report suggest that children could pass Covid- on to others, and it could explain how it spreads silently. Among the  children that were included in the study,  of them did not show any obvious symptoms and remained asymptomatic throughout the study. Another  children were presymptomatic, meaning they didnapost look or feel sick at the time but eventually got symptoms later. But  of them in total did show symptoms, including fever, cough, diarrhea, abdominal pain and loss of smell or taste. The researchers, from the Seoul National University College of Medicine, said: In this case series study, inapparent infections in children may have been associated with silent COVID- transmission in the community.They highlighted the importance of contact tracing to isolate children as soon as possible so they donapost spread coronavirus in the community. The children, who were tested from  hospital across South Korea, were monitored for  days, with the virus detected for around two-and-a-half weeks. But at least half of those symptomatic were still showing traces of the virus for three weeks. In asymptomatic cases, the average amount of time tests detected coronavirus was . days. For symptomatic cases, the average was . days. Dr. Roberta DeBiasi and Dr. Meghan Delaney, both of Childrenaposs National Hospital in Washington, DC, wrote an editorial about the study. The pair wrote: This highlights the concept that infected children may be more likely to go unnoticed either with or without symptoms and continue on with their usual activities, which may contribute to viral circulation within their community.  This suggests that even mild and moderately affected children remain symptomatic for long periods of time.It comes as a separate study revealed that not a single healthy child has died from the disease in the UK.Research shows the six deaths that have occurred were those suffering from serious illness or underlying health disorders. In the largest study in the world examining children hospitalised with Covid-, researchers examined the characteristics of youngsters admitted to hospital and those who have severe disease. Of patients admitted to  hospitals in Britain found that less than  per cent were children. They stressed the risk to minors being admitted to hospital is tiny and the risk of needing critical care is even tinier. While the overall numbers were small, the team were able to identy which children were more likely to need critical care support in hospital - including newborns under the age of one month, children aged  to , black children and children who are obese. They were able to identy a cluster of symptoms linked to the hyper-inflammatory response to Covid- seen in a small number of children - which are slightly dferent to those currently known in the medical community.

The newlywed was booked in for gastric bypass surgery to help her realise her dream of ­starting a family. But as the weight fell away after her successful op, so did Jenna’s love for her husband. After meeting fellow slimmer Rob online, sparks flew – and now the pair are madly in love. Jenna, , said: “It’s like a ­fairytale. Rob’s the perfect guy, we have so much in common. “Losing the weight has been amazing but finding Rob and having him cheering me on has been even better. “Between us, we’ve lost st, countless dress sizes and two spouses but what we’ve found is worth so much more – true love. “Ditching all that dead weight was the best decision we ever made. Losing everything led us to so much more.” Lead support worker Jenna had struggled with her weight all her le and at the start of , was st and wore size  clothes. That March she had a gastric bypass on the NHS at the Spire Manchester Hospital. The August before, Jenna had wed her long-term boyfriend and was keen to start a family.  But she said: “I knew that at my size, there was no way I could conceive so that’s when I ­decided to have the bypass.” After the op, Jenna shed the pounds but her marriage hit the rocks. She said: “I thought my weight loss would make us ­stronger but my husband became jealous of my shrinking body. We quickly fell out of love. “It was a shock. I’d had the operation for our future family but instead, it just highlighted all the problems in our marriage.” Devastated Jenna turned to Rob, , who she had met a month earlier in an online support group for gastric surgery patients, The Friendliest Gastric Sleeve Bypass Group UK.  And Rob, who also lived in Manchester, was in a failing ­marriage, too. Jenna said: “I wanted to knowthe weight loss had affected anyone ’s relationship in the same way.“Rob and I were always chatting and liking each other’s pictures so I felt like I could turn to him. But when I sent him the message on Instagram, I worried I’d overstepped the mark.“When he replied to say his surgery had ­affected his marriage too, I was relieved. It felt good to know I wasn’t alone. “We were both loyal to our partners but there was definitely a spark there.”  Jenna ­realised her heart was no longer in her ­marriage and  months after her gastric bypass, in February , she ended the relationship. She said: “I’d never pursue someone while I’m in a relationship. But my marriage had hit rock-bottom. I was slimmer than ever and I loved my new body, but I just didn’t feel like I could be myself with my husband. “Leaving was a hard decision but we didn’t love each ­other and I knew it was for the best.” Afterwards, Jenna told Rob her marriage was over. She said: “It felt like fate. I ­messaged Rob as a friend but when he told me he’d split from his we and was newly-single, it felt like a sign.” The pair confessed they had feelings for each other and agreed to meet for the first time two weeks later – on Valentine’s Day. Jenna said: “I was so nervous but as our eyes met, everything  disappeared. We had an ­instant connection. “We’re perfect for each other, and from the moment we met, we hit it off.” Since finding Rob, Jenna has lost st and shrunk to a healthy size . She said: “I couldn’t be happier and I love my new figure. Doctors told me I wouldn’t lose as much weight as I have but with Rob cheering me on, I’ve lost more than they expected. “At st I’m healthier than ever and I get to enjoy my new lease of le with the man I love.” Rob, a Royal Mail driver, had a gastric sleeve op and has shed st, slimming down from a  to a -inch waist. He said: “From the age of six, I put on a stone every year of my le. By , I was st.”  The surgery changed his le. He said: “I’m one of those people who will give it  per cent, so I did. I now weigh st and feel amazing. “I really love wearing suits now and flaunting my slimmer frame. But thanks to the ­surgery, I found Jen.” Nothing happened between the pair before their marriages ended, but Rob felt a connection with Jenna online. He said: “We connected over losing weight but we never spoke out of turn to each other – we were both still in relationships. Before the surgery I always said to my we, ‘I’m never going to change’, but I wasn’t prepared for how much you do change. “One day, Jen messaged me and askedI was having trouble in my marriage. That’s when we started ­talking and realised we had all these crazy weird connections.” Rob now describes his weight loss as a rebirth.

The situation has been further complicated by the Government introducing a ban on evictions during the pandemic.

She said: “We can’t get back into our house, but because the tenant isn’t paying rent, we can’t afford a mortgage and to rent another property. “When we came from Qatar a dietitian kindly gave him enough food and medication which will keep him going until the end of September, and by that time we expected everything to be resolved and be back in the UK and we could re-register him with doctors and Alder Hey.

Carl and Kerry Osborne’s battle began on July  when Jaxon was born with a growth on his arm which was openly bleeding. Doctors at the Arrow Park Hospital in Merseyside transferred the newborn to Alder Hey Childrenaposs Hospital after they managed to stabilise him. Jaxon defied fears that he wouldnapost make it to the hospital, and underwent lesaving surgery, where staff managed to remove the growth and stop the bleeding.Carl, from Ellesmere Port, told the Liverpool Echo : We thought he had a growth on his arm, they can sew him up and he’ll be fine.“Then you get struck with the news that they can’t stop the bleeding and the only way to stop the bleeding is to amputate his arm. “It’s a sinking feeling, I can’t even describe it.” After the surgery however, Jaxon suffered organ failure due to blood loss and stress in his body, and he was taken to intensive care. Despite being given little chance of survival, he started making incredible improvements that gave his parents and doctors a sense of confidence he could make it. However, a devastating scan result revealed perforations to his bowel which would require two major le-saving operations in under  hours. The second operation in particular took its toll, and it looked like Jaxon would not make it due to internal bleeding. But the team at Alder Hey managed, against all the odds, to stop the bleeding yet again giving him a fighting chance. Carl added: “I think they honestly thought that they were going to open him up and say that’s so bad, that’s it, and it was just going to confirm for them that was the end, but they actually managed to put a stoma in and tidy up a bit of his bowel. “That was beyond our expectations, before that we felt lost really. “So you kind of start [hoping] again, but it was that morning we could tell there was something not right with him. “We were home for about two hours and then we got a call saying they couldn’t stop a source of bleeding around his belly and that was pretty much for him. “So before we left again for the hospital we told our six-year-old son, Kaelin, that Jaxon’s going to heaven.” As the couple exited the tunnel driving to Alder Hey, they received another call from the hospital telling them surgeons had finally managed to stop the bleeding giving them hope once more. Jaxon once again continued on a course of incredible recovery which even had the consultants scratching their heads. Carl, overwhelmed at his son’s roller-coaster battle, broke down as he described a particular memory. He said: “It was the day before my other son’s birthday, Thursday th July, it was my Kaelinaposs birthday on Friday, st. “Obviously you don’t want anything to happen but I was just praying don’t go on Kaelinaposs birthday, please, you know  “By the time we left on that Thursday, he was fighting again. You could see the look on the staff’s faces, they were just dumbfounded. “Thankfully Friday was uneventful and he was improving again.” After days of Jaxon continuing to fight, by a cruel twist of fate, he developed an infection in his already weakened body. Carl said: “After everything he went through, it was a little infection that did it. “He just couldn’t take it.” “He was a little thing, a precious thing.” On August ,  days after he came into the world under the cruelest of circumstances, Jaxon died in the arms of his parents in Alder Hey’s bereavement suite.

She said: I particularly felt really strongly that I wanted to try and create a portrait of the nation that sort of captures the fears and the hopes and the feelings of the nation and this really extraordinary time, as a record I suppose for years to come.  I’ve been so overwhelmed by the public’s response. The quality of the images has been extraordinary really and the poignancy and the stories behind the images I think have been equally moving as well. So I just wanted to say a huge thank you to everyone who has entered and taken part. To celebrate the announcement on Sunday the Duchess chose three striking images from the final , as an example of how the country coped under lockdown.The finalists’ pictures will feature in a gallery without walls – a one of a kind digital exhibition – which will launch on Monday, September .  A physical exhibition staged in towns and cities across the UK will also feature later this year.  The first of Kate’s chosen images was submitted by Hassan Akkad, who signed up to work as a cleaner in a Covid- ward at his local hospital in north London.  Capturing his colleague and ward host Gimba, he wrote: Within days, Gimba, our ward host, called me ‘my son’. “On the day the photograph was taken, Gimba had received the terrible news from Nigeria that her mother had fallen ill and had been rushed to hospital.Gimba cried all day and was heartbroken that she couldn’t fly home to see her mother and look after her because of travel restrictions during the pandemic.She declined to take any time off, saying: aposI have to feed my patients’.I took this photo while Gimba was having lunch in the staff room, after having prepared meals for all eighteen COVID- patients in our ward. She was having chicken and rice.” A second striking image titled ‘Prayers for our community’ shows the Rev Tim Hayward at his church in Bunbury, with photographs or parishioners adorning the pews due to lockdown restrictions.  He said: “When it was announced church buildings were to be closed to the public to reduce the transmission of the virus, I wanted to assure our community that although we couldn’t gather physically, their photos in church were a symbol that they and their loved ones were still very much in our thoughts and prayers.”  A final image selected by Kate, sent in by Robert Coyle of his partner and their son is titled ‘Weaposre really lucky to have a garden’.  He said: “The weekend is here, lockdown continues and Bernadette and Francis enjoy the garden. “One Friday, as I finished emailing at the kitchen table, my we had taken a chair and a drink outside to enjoy the evening sun.  “We were doing our best, like the rest of the country, with work, childcare and news of daily death tolls.  “Our son had taken to relieving himself on the plants, much to our initial amusement and then slight frustration.” Praising the quality of the images throughout the competition, Director of the National Portrait Gallery, Nicholas Cullinan, said: “, submissions is just extraordinary.  “And then just beyond the numbers of submissions I think just the extraordinary nature of the images, both uplting and some very sad, I think it’s been a really dficult thing to select them because there are so many extraordinary images, so I think we’ve all been through that process.” Fellow judge BAFTA nominated award-winning writer, international poet, Lemn Sissay MBE, said: I didnapost expect the judging process to be so emotional.  “As I studied the portraits in this most public crisis I was drawn into the most private moments.   “A nation through portraiture. Intimacy and inspiration, bravery and hope, determination and love and loss and laughter... “We have been in this together and in these portraits of private struggles and victories, the quiet moments, the tears and laughter are caught on camera forever in Hold Still.   “It made me proud to be British. It made me proud of my fellow citizen. “It made me remember who we are and what we have been through. I didnapost really know until now.

German investigators believe Brueckner, , killed Madeleine, then three, after abducting her from a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in May . Detectives believe the convicted sex offender was behind a number of holiday apartment raids in the resort prior to Maddieaposs disappearance.The unsolved break-ins, which happened in , saw British victims targeted, including a model and her producer husband, The Sun reports. The newspaper claims a female accomplice helped Brueckner by telling him which properties to target, which may have led him to where Madeleine was sleeping. Last week, Brueckner’s pal – now identied as Manfred S – spoke about his relationship with the convicted paedophile, and confirmed he has a history of breaking into hotel rooms and holiday flats on the Algarve. He said: “He told me he does his break-ins in hotels and really goes right inside the rooms.” Brueckner, , lived  minutes from the complex where Madeleine vanished in  in Praia da Luz, aged three. He and Manfred carried out a string of small-time raids in Portugal. But after Brueckner was jailed for diesel theft, Manfred stole a video camera from his home, on which he saw footage of a US pensioner being raped in the resort. He alerted police and Brueckner was convicted.  It has also been revealed that he stored  child abuse pictures and  sick videos on a second device, a Casio Exilim digital camera. It was the camera he used to take images of himself abusing an ex’s five-year-old daughter. Police also found a Reck PE blank pistol with ammunition in the pervert’s flat. Brueckneraposs lawyer, Friedrich Fülscher, has previously insisted that his client “is innocent.” Speaking in Germany, Fülscher said Brueckner had nothing to do with Maddie’s abduction and claimed he was the victim of a miscarriage of justice.  He claims that Brueckner was wrongly convicted of raping an American pensioner in Praia da Luz, Portugal. But there was DNA and video evidence in the rape case and mobile phone records place him in the village on the night Maddie went missing in May .

The teenager who was written off by medics at birth is blazing a trail as the first person with Down’s Syndrome to pose for fashion giant Gucci. At  she can count singer Nicole Sherzinger, , among her fans. She has featured in ad campaigns for Superdrug, Nike and Vodafone. The world of TV and movies is already on Ellie’s radar.And a magazine photoshoot for Vogue Italia has become the luxury brand’s most “liked” Instagram post of all time.All this from a girl whose joyful disposition is characterised by a childhood picture of her dressed as Snow White. Proof that fairytales can, as Ellie explains, be a reality. She says: “I’ve never defined myself by my Down’s Syndrome. “I’m Ellie first and I’m glad people are seeing me. It gives me a chance to show people with disabilities that dreams can come true.”  Ellie, from Ilford, Essex, signed with Zebedee Management, an agency that only represents people with disabilities, three years ago. But it is her photoshoot for Mascara L’Obscur from Gucci’s beauty range that has sent her career soaring.Former X Factor judge Nicole posted images of Ellie to her .million fans.The teenager says working with Vogue was incredible – and brought her some luxury freebies. Ellie says: “The photo shoot for Gucci was amazing. “It was in London and took about six hours and it was the best experience ever – having my make-up and hair done and wearing all these expensive beautul dresses and sparkly jewellery. “I loved seeing my pictures in Vogue Italia and on Instagram. Gucci let me go into their store and pick out anything I wanted. I got a beautul floaty dress, shoes, silk headscarf, sparkly headband and a £ hair clip with crystals that says Gucci.  “It’s a dream come true. I’ve been told I’m very professional and I take direction well, which is lovely to hear. I never get nervous. I think it’s important to be happy every day and to just be myself. I hope people who see my pictures in magazines and on Instagram are inspired to follow their dreams and that having a disability should never get in the way.” Other stars in the “body positive” Gucci shoot included super-lean Jahmal Baptiste and plus-size Enam Asiama. Ellie’s mum Yvonne, , recalls her girl as super-confident from a young age.  She says: “I should have known Ellie was destined for the finer things in le when she scrambled out of her buggy in a jewellery shop and disappeared. “Seconds later, we found her chatting to the sales assistant in the ring department. That’s Ellie, she chats to everyone.” The bubbly teen has a cheeky giggle, big personality – and she loves chocolate and Jaffa Cakes. Now she is a worldwide role model for people with special needs and disabilities. But, like many, her start in le wasn’t easy. Yvonne tells how she was left stunned by the reaction of some medics when Ellie was born.  Yvonne says: “She was whisked away for four hours, with no explanation. Eventually the consultant marched in dangling her in his hands and said ‘She has Down’s Syndrome. “She’ll never walk or talk or have a normal le – or go to university. There are leaflets outside’. “Then he left. He’d already written her off before we’d even held her. We were stunned and shocked by his cold and uncaring attitude. It was the first time we knew anything about it. My scans had always been fine. Then a nurse came in, took one look at Ellie, and said ‘The last woman who had one of those, left it here.’ We couldn’t believe what we were hearing.” Next day, Ellie was moved to London’s Great Ormond Street Children’s Hospital.  Yvonne, a support worker for young adults with special needs, goes on: “We were told she had holes in her heart and needed surgery before she turned five months old. I nearly passed out trying to take it all in. Ellie had nine-hour open heart surgery and was in intensive care for  days. It was a terrible time for us all.” But with a loving family around her, the resilient tot grew stronger each year. Soon she was chatting, walking and laughing. At , her reading age was . And today Ellie is one year into a performing arts qualication at college. While the financial rewards at this stage are modest, Ellie adores modelling. She says: “I’d love to work with more brands, be on the covers of magazines, on telly or in a rom com movie. I love all things girlie – skirts, tops and dresses in pink, purple, green and lilac, make-up and playing with hairstyles. My bedroom is sparkles and sequins and I’ve pictures on the wall from shoots and adverts. I’d love to go on the Ellen [DeGeneres] Show, stay at the wonderful spa at Penny Hill Park in Surrey, and go shopping for expensive stuff at Selfridges. Oh and one day, I want a kind and good-looking husband with a great personality.” "},{"url":null,"title":"prince harry says only coronavirus","story":"NewsPrince Harry says only coronavirus has stopped him ing to UK as he vows to visitThe Duke of Sussex says he is planning toto the UK for the Rugby League world cup, after he and we Meghan Markle moved first to Canada and then to Los AngelesShareCommentsByJeremy CulleyAssistant Editor:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG NewsHarry pledged toto the UK later this year \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

And according to bombshell biography Finding Freedom, Meghan and the Duchess of Cambridge stood next to each other but aposbarely exchanged a wordapos at the event in . While the doting mothers were photographed next to each other with their children, the two appeared to barely exchange a word, an extract from the book reads.Due to Government guidelines as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, there will be strict social distancing rules in place when the polo match is held in September.According to the Daily Mail, there will be enough space at this yearaposs secret venue to allow up to  spectators to attend, which is way down on the  celebrities who usually attend the event. On Saturday, in a Zoom call to mark Rugby Leagueaposs th birthday, Harry said that only coronavirus has stopped him from ing to the UK.

I would have been back already had it not been for Covid. Harry said the sport had thrived since its birth in  and added: Watching Rugby League is exhausting. Listen I spent  years in the army, I know what endurance is all about. But itaposs madness.  Full respect to anyone that plays the game, I think itaposs amazing, and a lot of people would be jealous not to be part of that community. Harry continued: It can bring so many families together, bring so many people together. It doesnapost matter whether youaposre in the stands, whether youaposre the groundsman, whether youaposre a player, whether youaposre a fan, or whether youaposre a first time watcher, every single person is bound by this family feeling. Just days after announcing his royal departure with Meghan, The Duke of Sussex hosted the World Cup draw at Buckingham Palace. The Rugby World Cup is set to take place in England between October  and November  next year.  The possible visit to the UK by Harry comes after he and Prince William commissioned a statue of their late mother Diana to be built in the grounds of Kensington Palace.Harry and Meghan are expected to travel to the UK next summer for the unveiling to commemorate what would have been their motheraposs th birthday.Royal author Omid Scobie - who co-authored the biography Finding Freedom - claimed thy have have many reasons to be based in the UK next summer.

The woman called Jo left the review after visiting The Cowshed at Hucknall, Nottinghamshire, for her sister-in-lawaposs th birthday. She claimed that her party spent approximately £ between them on drinks and pizza before they were asked to leave by staff with awful attitude for being too drunk. In the review Jo wrote, she said: [They] didn’t mind taking the £ though, I have never been spoken to in such a way. Maybe they should open reviews [on their website].She then added: And, yes, our family member was sick, and yes, we cleaned it up so no members of staff were affected by this. Maybe a course for your staff in customer service wouldn’t go amiss – rude staff, huffing and puffing because they had a large round to bring out. But the restaurant, which has a five star rating on TripAdvisor, shared their version of events from the night on Facebook by saying: Hi Jo, thanks for reaching out! We love feedback, whether it be positive or negative, we especially love feedback like this so others can see the type of people we have to deal with sometimes.  Firstly, it said that Jo hadnapost spent the amount of money she claimed she did. To spend that amount of money they would have had to have ordered  of their most expensive pizzas and  of their most expensive drinks... The Cowshed continued: You ordered nowhere near this, Jo... not even close. What you and your party spent, Jo, was a far more realistic and believable £ . Then it got a little brutal.  It added: You all acted like belligerent, entitled little toddlers from the moment you walked through our gates. At :pm you showed up with the tables you wanted already taken, but not to worry, we shuffled other customers about at your request in order to accommodate you.  Then you proceeded to pull our light fittings loose off our boundary fence in order to hang your birthday decor. We cleaned up all the smashed pint glasses you broke and birthday cake you dropped and smeared all over our tables and benches, and tolerated the many loud family rows you were having with each other. The group also supposedly treated The Cowshedaposs staff  like personal servants. It wrote: Clicking your fingers, shouting, swearing and barking your orders at [staff], to the point one was almost in tears and refused to deal with you any more. But it didnapost stop there. He also claimed the group refused to abide by social distancing rules following the coronavirus pandemic. Then, for your partyaposs grand finale, the gentleman in the blue shirt headed into our bar from outside and decided to vomit everywhere but the toilet. Our staff stepped into to help, but you demanded to aposdeal with the situationapos and rather than clean up the mess, proceeded to smear it over an even wider area with our mop, whilst... once again, being loud, rude, sticking your hand in our staffaposs faces and shouting over anybody who was trying to communicate with you or help. Donapost worry, the staff member that you nearly had in tears earlier on cleaned it up for you. "},{"url":null,"title":"schools coronavirus covid opening rules","story":"AdvertorialAll the things which are changing as schools and colleges open doors againEducational institutions are ready to welcome pupils back safely – and the benefits to their wellbeing and mental health are hugeShareByDave Masters:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG AdvertorialIt’s the start of a new term and it’s time for children across the country to get back to school, nursery and college. Many parents, pupils and teachers are excited to get back into the routine and although it’s understandable to have a few worries the benefits of going back into education are clear. Not only will pupils be learning again, but they’ll benefit from the sense of routine, the chance to see their friends and a boost to their wellbeing. With new safety measures in place things will look a bit dferent, but pupils will be guaranteed plenty of support from their teachers.  Dr Paul Phillips CBE, , the Principal and Chief Executive of the Weston College Group in Somerset is one of many leaders who’s worked hard to make the learning environment safe and welcoming for ing students. He said: If you came into my campuses you’d see the one-way system, you’d see all the sanitisers, you’d see the counselling service, you’d see the ability for us to check temperatures, but behind that are the inidual learning plans for each student. That’s where the crucial planning really takes place. We’ve increased the number of mental health advisors and support workers who are here, we’ve put a massive investment into all levels of additional learning support at tutorial level, mentoring and one-to-one teaching. I’ve doubled the amount of cleaners in the college – I just need to be assured that everything we do is protecting everyone.  Home schooling hasn’t been easy and many parents are worried that their children have fallen behind, but parenting expert and author Dr Kalanit Ben-Ari believes they’ll catch up quickly and that getting back into the classroom will boost their mental health. I’m not worried about the academic gap, because I think kids will pick up very quickly. But it’s starting to affect their mental health more and more, so it’s good that they will be back in school from September, says Dr Ben-Ari. Children are not designed to sit down all day. They need to be out in the fresh air and moving their bodies. It’s so important for children of all ages to interact with their friends face to face for communication, and non-verbal communication.  Kids at home have spent a long time on screens while parents are working and they don’t have the resources to entertain and teach their children at home. Spending more time on screens will have affected their mental health: it increases anxiety, especially with children who are a little bit more vulnerable to it. For Chloe Williams, a beauty therapy student at Weston College, thecan’t come soon enough. I feel ready to go for a long-awaited  and seeing the new socially distanced facilities has been great, she says. My tutors are very approachableI have any worries and we are all helping each other. The PHE’s Chief Nurse, Viv Bennett, says: Parents can be reassured that to maximise safety in schools, an extremely stringent system of controls has been advised by PHE and is published in DfE guidance. Evidence so far indicates that schools do not appear to be a primary driver of coronavirus infections in the community. Globally, children and young people have been found to experience coronavirus asymptomatically or as a minor illness.  The Government’s new Wellbeing for Education Return package has training and resources for teachers and young people to protect their wellbeing and mental health. Now the NHS Test and Trace system is up and running and there’s more understanding about what needs to be done to stay safer. Children should stay at homethey have any symptoms such as a fever, continuous cough or loss of taste and smell. If there is an outbreak at a school or college, local health protection teams will work with staff to agree what action is needed. Schools shouldn’t need to close fully, butthey do there’ll be a contingency plan in place to make sure children’s education continues. It’s vital that young peopleto school and college for their educational progress, mental wellbeing and wider development, so attendance is mandatory from the beginning of the new school year. For post-, attendance is important becausea student doesn’t turn up their college may believe they’ve left the course. Schools and colleges have put in a raft of measures to keep pupils and staff safe, including staggered start and finish times and lunch breaks, one-way systems, extra cleaning and encouraging regular handwashing. Where it’s dficult to maintain social distancing, with younger children, contact between groups or “bubbles” will be limited. This means things will look a little dferent, soparents or young people are anxious or worried about ing, they should have a chat with teachers. Parents with younger children are encouraged to take up a nursery place because it provides a routine and helps them develop their social skills. The Government offers a wide range of financial support for families with children aged up to , including Tax-Free Childcare worth up to £, per child per year and you can also apply for a  hours free childcare place before  August.

The latest claim that the North Korean leader is in a coma has been dismissed, and state media has pictured him chairing a ruling party summit and surveying typhoon damage in recent days. North Korea has never publicly stated who would follow Kim in the event that he is unable to rule, but Pyongyang watchers have once again tipped his sister, Kim Yo-jong, as his likely successor, although perhaps only temporarily. There is one long shot, however - the siblingsapos elusive and only surviving brother, Kim Jong-chul, who plays a support role for his brother, and is probably best known for his love of Eric Clapton and his  visit to London to see the Brit in concert. Observers say Kim Jong-chul, who is  or , is not a viable option to take over the country which has been ruled by the Kim dynasty since it was founded after World War II. Experts recently told the BBC that he has never appeared interested in politics or power, and at most he could be a symbolic link to the Kim family, and possibly be appointed to lead a foundation or read the odd speech. His father, Kim Jong-il, overlooked him as a potential successor in , and his older half-brother Kim Jong-nam fell out of favour when he was caught travelling on a fake passport Kim Jong-ilaposs former personal sushi chef, who used the pseudonym Kenji Fujimoto, wrote a book in , claiming the ruler saw his son Kim Jong-chul as no good because he is like a little girl, while he considered Kim Jong-un to be a boy of inner strength, the BBC reported. The chef wrote that Kim Jong-chul had the warm heart of a girl, the Washington Post once reported. Younger brother Kim Jong-un, said to be  now, was chosen and groomed to become the reclusive regimeaposs next supreme leader, taking over in December  after his fatheraposs death. Kim Jong-chul - the third of Kim Jong-ilaposs five children - is said to be more interested in music than politics, which has been suggested based on his travels abroad, but it is also claimed he has his brotheraposs respect. It is said he was educated at an international school in Switzerland, like the current ruler, before ing to Pyongyang, where he studied at a military university and worked in the propaganda department. His Japanese-Korean mother, Ko Yong-hui, who was born in Osaka, was reported to have been Kim Jong-ilaposs favourite consort. He is said to be a talented musician and he has flown around the world to watch Eric Clapton in concert - in Germany in , Singapore in February  and at Londonaposs Royal Albert Hall in May . In , South Koreaaposs spies claimed he had been shut out of power and was living under surveillance, the Nikkei Asian Review reported.  Thae Yong-ho, the former deputy ambassador of North Korea to London, was Kim Jong-chulaposs minder during the May  trip to London. After defecting to South Korea in , he told Reuters he escorted the Kim brother around London and took him to two gigs for Claptonaposs th birthday celebration tour. Thae said Kim was a polite young man who didnapost reveal much about his le in Pyongyang or his older brother. The defector, who disappeared from the embassy quarters in Gunnersbury, west London, with his family before resurfacing in Seoul weeks later, added: “He’s very free. But he’s only interested in guitars and music. Video of Kim Jong-chul at the gig showed him wearing a leather jacket and wearing aviator sunglasses with an unknown woman by his side, believed at the time to have been his girlfriend. Thae said she was not a girlfriend, but a rhythm guitarist from a North Korean pop group called the Moranbong Band, which was formed by Kim Jong-un after he took power. Journalist Simeon Paterson, who attended one of the concerts, told the BBC at the time: He was just like any other fan, but there were officials all around him. They were obviously not Clapton fans, and looked really out of place. But he was having a great time, singing along to all the words.  Thae said Kim Jong-chul is an accomplished guitarist, and days before the concert jammed at guitar shops in Denmark Street in Londonaposs west end. He bought gear to take home to Pyongyang, but the shop owners had no idea who he was. Thae said: [One] let him play for  minutes. The shopkeepers of those guitar shops were amazed by his talent. The shopkeepers tried to pry him excitedly with questions like What is your name  and Which band are you in .  Thae said: “He didn’t say anything. He just smiled”. Little is known about Kim Jong-chulaposs current role in Pyongyang. It is said that he plays a support role for his younger brother and has his ear. Before Kim Jong-unaposs historic first summit with US President Donald Trump, he reportedly consulted with Kim Jong-chul and sister Kim Yo-Jong, South Koreaaposs JoongAng Ilbo newspaper reported. Sources told the newspaper that Kim Jong-chul didnapost play a signicant role in policymaking, but the fact that Kim Jong-un holds discussions with him can be interpreted as him showing respect for his elder brother. North Korea expert Leonid Petrov told News.au in  that Kim Jong-chul was known for having a “soft personality. The North Korea Leadership Watch blog described him as having a pleasant, outgoing personality. Mr Petrov added: There are rumours hehas feminine traits to his character and took hormones to help him behave more masculine. “But Chul is also not interested in ruling, he’s apolitical and instead prefers pop music and concerts, and travelling overseas accompanied by North Korean minders.” From the coronavirus to Brexit, this is an era of great change and uncertainty.

for people project","story":"A Stonehaven cafe boss has argued that without the Spaces for People project, her venue would not have been able to reopen after lockdown.Megan Langdon, who manages Molly’s Cafe Bar at the town’s beach, was moved to speak-out after concerns were raised the social distancing measures are causing trouble for the seaside town’s economy.Last week, Aberdeenshire Council’s infrastructure committee was told by Stonehaven and Lower Deeside councillor Wendy Agnew the controversial changes to the town’s infrastructure have left certain businesses feeling “worried”.She said some have noted a “massive drop in turnover” which they believe is due to loss of parking spaces.But Ms Langdon says the changes # which include widened pavements and pedestrianisation # have been of huge benefit to her business.Without the Spaces for People initiative, she said she would not have been able to open up additional outdoor seating, leaving her with only six tables inside.Thanks to the project, she can now offer  tables.Ms Langdon says she believes dferent parts of the town are having dferent experiences # and cannot be treated as one.She said: “If we hadn’t had the space down the beach pedestrianised and space made for people to socially distance, I honestly don’t think we could have reopened the business.“With the changes made, people can feel safe and it’s a very family-friendly environment.“The situation at the beach has got lumped-in with the issues in the town centre, when it’s very much a separate entity from that.“I think some of the concerns are valid and I understand that a lot of the retail units are struggling.“I also understand that there’s a loss of parking and there’s dficulties in the town centre, but down here it is a positive.She added: “We feel the council have bent over backwards and are doing everything they can.“What seems to get lost is the council is trying to keep everyone safe. That needs to be done.”Ewan Wallace, head of transportation with Aberdeenshire Council, explained the region wanted to make it clear it was open for business, in the wake of a council meeting last week on Spaces for People proposals.He said: “We have sought to create space in town centres to try and give people some more confidence when visiting them.“The approach we have taken has been fully supported by Public Health colleagues who have been right behind us in terms of our response to the current emergency.We’ve kept all of the measures under review on a weekly basis, with regular monitoring by officers and potential changes considered each week.“Clearly the emergence from lockdown has taken longer than we expected but we have maintained our professional rigour and consistency to consider the changes we can put in place at dferent locations.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

The hairpin, is in the shape of a butterfly which symbolises joy and is decorated with pearls and precious stones. vw, px\"  The Chinese ivory hair ornament, far right, is decorated with a carving of a girl carrying a lotus flower. The lotus flower is associated with Buddhism and is a symbol of feminine beauty and purity.

Only Francis Munro , Mark McGhee , Adam Rooneyand Sam Cosgrovehad previously achieved that feat.Capped three times by Wales, Hedges hopes national Ryan Giggs will be monitoring the action at Easter Road tomorrow.Alongside Hedges fellow Welsh call-up hopefuls Marley Watkins, on loan at Aberdeen from Bristol City, and Hibs striker Christian Doidge are set to feature.He said: “You hope they will come up. We just need to keep producing andwe are doing well then hopefully I can get back in the Welsh squad.”Only four games into the new campaign Hedges has already equalled his four goal tally from last season.He began last season strongly only to fall out of the starting-line up at the end of the year.Following the January winter break he made just one start before football was shut down in March due to the pandemic.He said: “I need consistency.“I am looking to keep my place in the team by performing well every week and by bringing goals and assists.“It is up to me to do that.”Hedges completed his hat-trick from the penalty spot after midfielder Lewis Ferguson was brought down late on.Ferguson had converted a spot-kick in the - defeat of Livingston in the absence of regular penalty taker Sam Cosgrove due to a long term knee injury.Scotland U international Ferguson stepped aside to let Hedges secure his hat-trick.“I just wanted to take it for the opportunity to get my hat-trick.“I wouldn’t say he gladly stepped aside but Lewis did and fair play to him for doing that.“Butwe get one on Sunday I would think he would be on them again.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

Talking nonsense in the public or lounge bar can be very therapeutic#People are also being encouraged to switch to a tourist#s mindset and visit local attractions to help put a bit of flesh on their bones and see them through the winter.Buying local has knock-on environmental benefits too, often involving shorter journeys and sustainably produced local products.Shopping local has always been important, but never more than now.If we don#t use local services, we will lose them.

I share many of his concerns, and commend the series of articles.It would be good to hear from a range of Argyll and Bute residents with their ideas for how we get from #here# towards a better #there#. My personal pet project would be an Argyll and Bute Citizens’ Assembly, that would bring people together to generate real strategies to bring about just and #green# change for our area.A good start would be better transport links, via enhanced road and ferry services.A permanent solution to the Rest and be Thankful would be welcome, of course, but it was really heartening to see how Western Ferries rose to the challenge on Friday Auust .  They magicked away that endless queue at Gourock with great patience and goodwill and double service, showing what can be done.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,Following the latest landslide and road closure at the Rest and be Thankful, once again the road closure signs were placed at the wrong place on the Arrochar side.Having spoken to several of the local businesses owners, the main issue around the signs are they are too far away from the incident.

They came back positive and cheerful they followed all the new guidance and protocols with no problem and are just getting on with it in the way that Lochgilphead children do.Scottish Government guidance does not require social distancing in academic classes but Miss Devine emphasised the measures taken by the school.#We have stringent protocols in place for movement around the campus, using single file. We have staggered times for classes starting and finishing and are keeping pupils in their year groups outwith class, like a big social bubble.#We are also using outdoor spaces. The good weather has helped, and during lunchtimes for example the pupils are encouraged to go outside.#There#s been a lot of open windows and doors for ventilation around the school, to try to keep it as safe as possible.##In many ways it simplies some of the mechanisms around the school,# she added, #and it#s actually been nice to see them outside so much socialising with each other in a calm but controlled way.#She paid tribute to the support the school has received from the parent council and wider parent group.#The parent council has been magnicent, as have all the parents. They have kept in touch and supported the school throughout lockdown and over the arrangements. Obviously they are glad to see the children getting back to some sort of normality in schooling, but they have trusted us with the arrangements to safeguard the children and I feel very lucky to have that support.#Faced with a constantly changing picture, both locally and nationally, Miss Devine commented: #It is challenging to respond to that and keep lines of communication open with parents. Argyll and Bute Council has been good at giving guidelines to schools and that has helped a lot.#The council has also supplied hand sanitiser, face masks, gloves and visors and, said Miss Devine, the school is prepared to deal with anyone displaying symptoms.#We have thermometers in the school and we would testwe had concerns about a child becoming ill. There are straightforward guidelines that when a child displays symptoms they should be isolated and taken home immediately.#She added: #As yet we haven#t haven#t had to put those measures into practice.#In the event of a pupil being unable to attend school, Miss Devine confirmed that the online teaching s have been retained #as a safety net#.Miss Devine concluded: #Everybody is having to get used to the new health and safety protocols, but thus far people feel well supported.

This is now brought into line with the public transport guidance.What about primary school children With the exception of school buses as outlined above, the new guidance in schools only applies to secondary school pupils.Do they need to be worn in class While staff and students can continue to wear face coveringsthey wish to, they will not generally be necessary in the classroom.This is because there is greater scope for physical distancing and face coverings can have an impact on teaching.However it remains the case that where adults cannot keep m distance and are interacting face-to-face

wish to wear a face covering.Can someone help my child with their covering Education Secretary John Swinney said:ldquoSchools will be asked to ensure children and young people have clear instructions on how to put on, remove, and store face coverings.\"Any staff member or pupil will still be able to wear a face covering when they wish to do so.\"John Swinney confirmed the new guidanceWhy is this being done Mr Swinney added:ldquoThere is increasing evidence that face coverings can provide some protection for the wearer as well as those around them.\"We also know that some pupils have found it very dficult to physically distance when moving around school, which could increase the risk of transmission of the virus.\"And on school transport, as on public transport, there can be mixing between dferent age groups.\"What  was said Mr Swinney said:ldquoWe want to continue to protect what we have achieved in suppressing the virus and re-opening schools, and to do the best for children in schools.\"Alongside this change to the wearing of face coverings, we need to reinforce the importance of maintaining high standards of cleaning, personal hand and respiratory hygiene and physical distancing, where possible.\"In situations where there is a local cluster, use of face coverings throughout the day may be required.ldquoThe position will be kept under review to ensure that our

Masks can trigger ious types of skin irritationsand redness .How can you combat maskne There isnrsquot a prevention for maskne, as we need to continue wearing our masks, but there are ways that you can help combat the issues.Skin Care routineIf you want to combat the impact of maskne then having a good skincare routine is essential.It is just as important to cleanse your skin before wearing a mask as it is to cleanse after wearing a mask.To help your skin heal, Ashley would recommend using a squalane or balm cleanser so help remove make-up, dirt and debris.However,you are experiencing chapped, irritated skin or suffer from sensitivity then a gel based cleanseradvised.Dermalogicarsquos UltraCalming Cleanser helps to calm and cool sensitised irritated skin.ExfoliatingExfoliating is key to clear clogged pores and remove dead skin cells which will help reduce the impact of maskne.There are thousands of dferent types of exfoliators available from chemical, physical and masks but it is always important to follow the recommended application and how often you should use the product.Over-exfoliating your skin can compromise your skins barrier , damage the skins capillaries and dehydrate the skin.Ingredients such as glycolic acid, lactic acid and salicylic acid are great exfoliating athelping fight breakouts.Spot treatmentsUsing targeted spot treatments with ingredients such as salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide will help remove dead skin cells and decongest pores.Hyaluronic AcidsHyaluronic acid can hold , times its weight in water -

There are few jobs for young people in the south west. Investment in local infrastructure seems to melt and crumble every year. In the face of accelerating development, local communities frequently lodge notes of concern and protest, but these are routinely overturned or ignored by government ministers in Edinburgh. Our commercial outputs have gone through the roof, but it often feels like wersquore being left behind disempowered and ignored.The campaign to designate Galloway as a National Park was recently met with a resounding ldquono from Holyrood. In , a massive hoard of Viking treasure was unearthed by a metal detectorist in Galloway. It was whisked away to Edinburgh so quickly that it made our heads spin. All this might read like gripe or grievance, but the south west has been on the back foot for decades.Even as a child growing up in Galloway, it was always very clear that I lived in a fine, mighty place. I never wanted to leave, but young people find it incredibly hard to get started here. I was lucky to have been brought up in a farming family, and it seemed obvious that I should work with cattle. Cows have been our currency here since before history began, and Belted Galloways are an internationally recognisable trademark for southern Scotland. Working a number of jobs and saving up a few pounds here and there, I finally invested in a small number of hairy Galloway cows in . Almost immediately, I was swallowed up into a culture and sense of continuity which was dazzling in its clarity and intensity. I never really left south west Scotland, but agriculture gave me a compelling connection to the place where I belonged.Hill farming is slow work. Starting with four heers, it has taken five years to build a herd of . Each beast has its own character and attitude, and together they work as part of a system which created these old moorland places many thousands of years ago. Check on cattle at dawn or dusk and walk between their heavy bodies itrsquos a transportation to a dferent epoch. But le in this landscape is changing day by day. Commercial and industrial pressures are forcing our ancient places into fresh, untested new shapes. Galloway is famous for its granite foundations, but this place has begun to move so quickly that nothing is certain anymore.I have always been fascinated by birds. More than any other species, curlews seemed to represent the rough, endless Galloway landscapes that I had known as a child. However, many of these places have simply vanished over the past  years. Come down into Galloway through Carsphairn nowadays and yoursquoll pass through  square miles of commercial forest plantation, electricity pylons and wind turbines. That used to be curlew country a place where the birds were so numerous that naturalists could hardly be bothered to count them. But curlews have declined by almost three quarters since , and it seems likely that they could soon be gone altogether.Curlews depend upon wide, moorland habitats which are created and maintained by old-fashioned agriculture. As I worked with traditional cattle over several years, I steadily sank into a way of le that is now facing extinction. Galloway cows produce excellent beef, but their carcases are small and slow-growing. Supermarkets prefer to work with faster breeds of cattle, and the financial case for farming in the hills gets slimmer every year. No matter how carefully I herded my cows and drove them out to the moors, money remained tight and fewer curlews ed to breed each year.As farming and forestry have intensied, curlews have been pressed out of existence - Itrsquos fair to reckon that they have now declined too far to recover here. Huge new forest creation targets mean that thousands of acres of their habitat continue to be be ploughed and planted every year a forester friend confessed that the industry now has a simple goal to plant up the places they missed in the s.Itrsquos not clear where this leaves Galloway. For all that I mourn the loss of curlews, their decline is simply part of a much bigger sht in culture, heritage and communities in the south west. I find meaning and value in the old farming ways, but I canrsquot deny that I am fretting over the remains of something that is already dead. Irsquom tortured by the realisation that we have lost so much, but as I sank deeper into keeping and breeding Galloway cattle, I was ever more tantalised by the realisation that powerful fragments of the old ways remain.There is something very human in the culture of this place which nothing can erase. Most people find Galloway strangely enigmatic. Wersquore just part of ldquoDumfries and Galloway, and itrsquos not always clear to outsiders where the line lies between these two component parts. Many people say it doesnrsquot matter, but try saying ldquoGalloway doesnrsquot exist to a pub full of folk in Castle Douglas or Newton Stewart. Itrsquos not always a pretty place or an easy existence le in these hills can be desperately isolated and lonely, but the hardships are often more formative and interesting than days when the moors tremble with smiles and sunshine.It turns out that my style of farming calls for a dficult balance between loss and preservation. The way things have gone in Galloway, we have not been able to choose what we are allowed to keep and what has been taken from us. My grandfather would have said that it was unimaginable to think of Galloway without curlews the birds seemed to serve as an icon for the place. But as curlews begin to slip out of sight, therersquos still hope in the discovery that some things can never be lost.Native: Le in a Vanishing Landscape by Patrick Laurie is published by Birlinnand is shortlisted for the Wainwright Prize for Nature Writing.

Andthe early shots of the cast donrsquot do it ndash what a line-up: John Hurt, Gary Oldman, Benedict Cumberbatch, Toby Jones, Mark Strong, Simon McBurney, Stephen Graham, Kathy Burke, Ciaraacuten Hinds and Colin Firth ndash then the awesome set design and the fact that itrsquos a full  minutes before Oldmanrsquos George Smiley even utters a word will do the trick.From stylish start to stylish finish Alfredson handles the material beautully, helped by a sympathetic andfaithful script from Bridget OrsquoConnor and Peter Straughan. Oldman and Co. do the rest, though itrsquos up to the viewer to decideAlfredson is filming the book or making a lushcinema version of the iconic  television series which starred Alec Guinness as Smiley. There are certainly some cute nods in its direction. At one point we see Smiley go for an eye test and emerge from the opticians wearing a new pair of glasses, but out are the s-style ones he wears in the filmrsquos opening scenes and in are the exact pair Alec Guinness wears. At the same time there are other touches which seem entirely Alfredsonrsquos. After recruiting ex-Special Branch officer-turned-amateur beekeeper Mendel , Smiley and Guillam drive back to London with one of Mendelrsquos bees trapped in the car with them. Alfredson shoots the scene through the rear windscreen, a neat metaphor for the real le spy-swatting game the trio are about to embark on and which will have a sting in the tail for Smiley.As for the plot, itrsquos only marginally less labyrinthine than in the novel and the TV series.

But he never forgot that childhood experience in church. Gaelic psalm singing remained a fascination. ldquoI would say the psalm singing was the first indigenous Scottish music that really grabbed me, he says.And then in  he was introduced to fellow composer Calum Martin. Martin is also a precentor ndash the person leading the singing ndash in the Back Free Church in Stornoway. He is one of the people who performs Gaelic psalm singing. Out of that meeting came a chance to do something new with this traditional form.The result is The Edge of the Sea, a new album that features two pieces which combine the keening notes of Gaelic singers from Lewis and Harris, who would normally sing unaccompanied, with a soundbed composed by Armstrong as played by the Scottish Ensemble. The pieces were initially performed live, but this  recording is now being released on Christian Kellersmannrsquos new German label Modern Recordings.Itrsquos a thing of startling beauty. Equal parts mournful and soaring, it is an album that sounds ancient and modern at the same time. Both Armstrong and Martin are understandably thrilled with the result.What it is not, they are both keen to stress, is a stunt. When they were first introduced to each other by Donald Shaw, the director of Celtic Connections, Martin admits he was rather wary of the whole idea.ldquoAt that particular time, Irsquod been getting loads of people from New York, hip hop artists, wanting to do this, that and the other and Irsquod said no. Irsquom not interested in doing anything with anyoneitrsquos just a gimmick and thatrsquos what they were.ldquoSo, my first thing to Craig was, lsquoIrsquom not interestedyou want to do a gimmick.rsquoldquoI had never heard of Craig, Martin admits. ldquoAnd, of course, when I came home and I put lsquoCraig Armstrongrsquo into Google I thought, lsquoOh goodness me, this guy is quite well known. Hersquos probably the top film composer in the UK.rsquoRead More:From the Archive -Craig Armstrong on partying with Madonna in Read More: Composer Paul-Leonard Morgan on working with Philip GlassToday, Martin is at home in Stornoway when I call. Itrsquos dficult to believe Gaelic psalm singing could have a more enthusiastic and engaging advocate. ldquoIrsquom steeped in tradition. Itrsquos always been with me. Itrsquos like a language. My grandfather took me to church when I was four years of age and you just absorb it. You absorb the style because itrsquos part of your tradition.What is that tradition, you might ask  ldquoThis is nothing to do with choirs, Martin points out. ldquoIn Gaelic psalm singing you donrsquot have a choir. You have a congregation. A choir is something that is conducted. Gaelic psalm singing is completely dferent. Every single time you sing itrsquos going to sound dferent.ldquoAll of Gaelic psalm singing is taken from existing melodies going way back to the s and s. They are old tunes which are actually set in the Scottish Psalter.ldquoYoursquore also singing just one meter. Common meter is eight-six, eight-six. All Gaelic psalms are in just that one meter. So, every tune will fit every psalm.ldquoItrsquos a very simple system, but in application it becomes complicated because when you start singing it you slow it completely down. Now, the more you slow it down the more the natural inclination of the inidual is to add their unique grace notes.Those grace notes are what makes Gaelic psalm singing unique. And that uniqueness means you mess with it at your peril.ldquoItrsquos music from the islands and itrsquos essentially their music they create when theyrsquore at church, Armstrong points out. ldquoSo, it isnrsquot a terribly obvious thing to do a collaboration with. And also, theyrsquove never ever put music to the psalms before. Theyrsquove never had any accompaniment before. So, it was a bit of a responsibility.Then again, he says, why shouldnrsquot he be allowed to try  ldquoI felt, lsquoWell, I am Scottish. Itrsquos part of my culture and I did hear it early on.rsquo Plus, he had an elderly relative who, like Martin, was a precentor.That said, it was a challenge, he admits. ldquoI really wanted to study it first. I didnrsquot want to just jump in and do something on the surface. I wanted to get into the bones of it and study it and analyse it.To do so he went up to Lewis, recorded the congregation in Back Free Church, and immersed himself in the music. ldquoYou canrsquot help thinking that the sound of psalm singing is very linked to nature, Armstrong suggests. ldquoThe way theyrsquore all singing the same thing but in dferent tempo and theyrsquore all doing their own grace notes. Itrsquos almost like a murmuration of starlings. Slightly going out of focus and then into focus.The first fruit of the collaboration between Armstrong and Martin was The Martyrdom Variations, which was commissioned by Diageo to be performed at Edinburgh Castle in . Another piece, Ballantyne, was originally commissioned for the Lewis arts centre, An Lanntair, as part of a Creative Places Awards concert in August . Ballantyne was dedicated to Armstrongrsquos father John who had died the previous year.ldquoWhen Craigrsquos father died, Martin explains, ldquoI said, lsquoDo you know what would be nice Craig  I would like to write a psalm tune in memory of your father.rsquoldquoAt first I wasnrsquot sure, Armstrong admits. ldquoMy dad was a very private guy. But he was also a very religious guy. I think Calum connected with that, so we went ahead and did the second piece called Ballantyne which was my dadrsquos motherrsquos maiden name.Armstrongrsquos father, John, was a steelworker. ldquoMy dad worked at Ravenscraig all his le, his son points out. ldquoBut later on ndash I think he was  - he went to study to be a lay preacher in the church of Scotland. I thought that was quite brave of him.The album itself was recorded in the Caird Hall in Dundee in . As well as the Scottish Ensemble, fiddler Duncan Chisholm played on Ballantyne. ldquoThe singers are from dferent churches, Martin adds. ldquoTheyrsquore from Lewis and Harris basically. Most of them would be Church of Scotland and Free Church of Scotland. They are all island people steeped in the tradition.As for the soloists, Calum Iain Macleod was the former minister in Back Church that Martin belongs to. ldquoCalum Iain, I felt, was the best guy to do it. He had that strong, almost operatic voice. But itrsquos also steeped in tradition.The other soloist is Isobel Ann Martin, who just happens to be Martinrsquos daughter. ldquoShersquos such a fantastic singer, Armstrong enthuses.ldquoAt the end of the day it is breaking a bit of new ground, Armstrong says. ldquoFor me, the record it stands or falls on, does it work as a piece of music  Itrsquos not an exercise. We were trying to create something beautul.Back at the start of , Armstrong was telling The Herald about hanging out with Madonna and getting hugs from Bjork and raving about drum  bass producer Photek. Itrsquos fair to say his situation has changed in the two decades since.ldquoWhen I had three young kids, I had to find a way to make money and to do that I became an arranger for a lot of people and Irsquom quite happy to have done that. My arrangements became quite well known, so that famous people like Tina Turner, Madonna and Massive Attack all wanted me which was great at the time.ldquoIt got my hands on big orchestras. I remember doing the Goldeneye theme for James Bond. Things like that are quite funny when you are sitting beside Tina Turner.ldquoI think what happened  years ago was I didnrsquot have to take work all the time. I was able to finally choose what I wanted to do. I am not saying Irsquom not proud of some of the work I did before, but it was a period as a working musician.He is happier being his own master, he says. It also allows him to work with people like Martin on projects like The Edge of the Sea, which feel important.ldquoCalum is incredibly enthusiastic which is exactly what psalm singing needs at the moment. It needs someone to say, lsquoLook, this is a hugely important tradition and we are in danger of losing it.rsquo Hersquos got that about him.And that fear of a tradition disappearing is why Martin was keen to seeit would be possible to take psalm singing out of the church in the first place.ldquoThe bottom line at the end of the day is our tradition as we knew it and as we were brought up is on the way out, he says. ldquoThere are very, very few Gaelic services now. I think the way things are looking I can see it dying out in the churches.ldquoThis is going to disappear, and I was wanting to do whatever I could to try and have people showing an interest in it.ldquoWe are acting to try to keep it alive.The Edge of the Sea is out now"},{"url":null,"title":"letter-america-really-going-us-uk-trade-talks---leave-scotland","story":"Negotiations have moved through three rounds, the last round closing on August . The negotiating and working staff teams are deep on talent, many being career civil servants and non-partisan trade diplomats. There are  US and UK support staff from ious agencies with nearly  negotiating groups. In the third round alone, there were  sessions and  dferent workstreams. The fourth round is expected to convene in early September. Even with this accelerated pace, reaching the finish line and breaking the tape for an agreement by the end of the year is, in the words of Ambassador Lighthizer, ldquonearly impossible. The UK also is stretched on other negotiating fronts including the higher priority of the EU. Evena deal is reached, the US Congress will need to approve it, and the days in session before the end of year during a hotly contested election are limited.The distinctive voice of Scotland in these negotiations is vital. Dr Liz Cameron, CEO of Scottish Chambers that forms  Chambers of Commerce across Scotlandrsquos towns, regions and cities, is an effective promoter for Scottish business for the negotiations because she sits on the UK Strategic Trade Advisory Group. Truss has also been proactive in assembling  trade advisory groups across the UK to, in her words, ldquokeep businesses closer to the negotiating table.Keith Anderson, CEO of Scottish Power, sits on one of the advisory groups. However, that Scottish voice needs to not only be internal to the UK. It is critical for the United States and other countries to understand the unique values and economic sectors that comprise the Scottish economy and society, and, for that matter Wales, Northern Ireland, and England. To look at the UK through too wide an aperture will prevent businesses, investors, and government policy-makers from gaining a deeper understanding of how to strategically engage and successfully partner with business and entities across sectors and regions.Scotland is a trading nation, confidently operating on the global stage. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Trade Minister Ivan McKee have consistently emphasised this point, and the Scottish Government is investing in building export capacity through the ldquoExport Challenge. The number one international export country for Scotland is the United States. The latest trade data shows this figure was approximately pound. billion per year. Further, US and international businesses are increasingly attracted to Scotland for engagement and direct investment. Scottish Chambers of Commerce have as many as  trade missions to US cities each year.When the US government understands how deep and valued the trading and cultural relationship is they will not move to impose  percent tarfs as they did on a range of Scottish products, including single malt whisky, cashmere, sweet biscuits, cheese, and wool items. Those tarfs are neither good economic policy nor constructive diplomatic practice for allies. As Minister McKee has said, ldquoScottish businesses are being hit hard by these tarfs and jobs and livelihoods are now at risk. These tarfs have also negatively impacted on American consumers and importers. They should have never happened. With advocacy from Truss and Scottish government and industry leaders, the US has committed to lt some of the tarfs, but, unfortunately, some still remain.The US and UK trade negotiations offer a backdrop and an opportunity for Scottish enterprise to be heard. This is happening, but it needs to go much deeper. US decision-makers and Members of Congress would be wise to encourage this direct channel of dialogue, and Scottish industry and enterprise networks prudent to proactively nurture it. Eventhere is no trade agreement by the end of the year, the results of substantive briefings by Scottish enterprise leaders will reinforce an historically close relationship, spark a realisation of the many growth sectors that exist and can be forged, and heighten recognition of what makes Scotland a unique market. That approach would be beneficial to us all now and going forward.Ian Houston has spent a long career in Washington, DC, as an international non-profit leader, and a policy advocate for diplomatic engagement and global poverty alleviation.

At local, Scottish, level we are governed by one-issue-obsessed nationalists. Forget the \"civicrsquorsquo appellation beloved of the SNP. Nationalism is like a cancer, there are dferent kinds, but the basic illness is exactly the same. It is in effect tribalism and an appeal to the worst instincts in humans.None of this is helped by the rampant narcissism and rabble-rousing displayed by the SNPrsquos leaders, past and present.At UK level, we have Boris Johnson, and in the US, Donald Trump, both at times approach the buffoon level. Both are lacking the intellect and political skill to govern wisely.I fear for my children and grandchildren in this \"brave new worldrsquo.rsquoAlexander McKay, Edinburgh EH.IT IS WRONG THAT SALMOND IS STILL ON TRIALIAIN Macwhirter suggests that while Alex Salmond has been found not guilty by a jury of his peers, he remains on trial . Of course he is. The story of a colleague suggesting that Nye Bevan was ldquohis own worst enemy, being met with the comment by Ernest Bevin, ldquonot while Irsquom around he ainrsquot is instructive in thatwe substitute Salmond for Bevan and much of the Scottish media for Bevin, the situation is much the same.Mr Salmond enjoys a fantastic degree of loyalty from his supporters, much to the astonishment of his opponents, some within the SNP. But the not guilty verdict has been greeted in some circles with ldquohe got away with it. This is most ably demonstrated by the last words in Kirsty Warkrsquos recent ldquodocumentary on the trial going to one of the women whose case did not convince the jury of Mr Salmondrsquos guilt.Moreover, bear in mind the Moorov doctrine, which says ldquo that the evidence of one witness can corroborate the evidence of another in certain situationsthe Crown can prove that the accuseds offending was part of a course of conduct, systematically pursued. This can address dficulties of proving rape or other sexual offences, where there is no corroborating evidence, by showing a pattern of behaviour over a period of time. However, while there were  charges for the jury to consider, with certain features in common ndash the involvement of alcohol, being alone with Mr Salmond ndash the jury chose not to convict. Therefore, is the conclusion not that the jury were unconvinced by the womenrsquos versions of events not just inidually but collectively as well Mr Macwhirter concludes ldquothat you are guilty even when you are found innocent. Early in her ldquodocumentary Ms Wark speaks of the ldquowomenrsquos stories, but without convincing evidence that is what they remain ndash stories. The Carl Beech case, though I am not associating any of Mr Salmondrsquos accusers with him, is a prescient warning of where justice being based on ldquostories without convincing evidence can lead. We cannot have a legal system that accepts something is true just because the accuser says it is.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.SONGS THAT SHOULD BE CHERISHEDWHAT a pointless brouhaha created by the BBC so unnecessarily over those two rousing tunes which bring such a resounding climax to the Proms.If ever we needed the feelgood factor in our lives, it is today, in the midst of a pandemic and the gloomy prospect of economic woe.What better way to raise the spirits of any community than with powerful community singing which comes across even from our TV screens as energising, defiant and uplting Those tunes provide a marvellous send-off to the traditional finale of the last night of the revered Proms.Yes, Britain did have an empire, which like any endeavour contained elements both good and the bad.Maybe we should recall those words of a well-known holy man, \"let he who is without sin cast the first stone\".Again while the lyrics of the songs were written in a dferent era with a dferent outlook ,they take on a fresh new meaning, outside of nostalgiafor every new generation.No one can quarrel surely with the sentiment that Britons shall never be slaves when that applies to all our compatriots regardless of their origins, colour or creed.Let the BBC reinstate the choral singing of those tunes which it has downgraded out of a weird and faux concern over political correctness.There are some traditions we should always cherish and this is one of them.Denis Bruce, Bishopbriggs.DEPORTATION IS THE ANSWERDOUGLAS Robinsonchooses to reduce the important topic of illegal immigration to that of a pub discussion.He is obviously a Europhile. Mr Robinson misses the whole point about UK sanctions on France, since the Yellow Vests would riot on the streets demanding Emmanuel Macron stopped the migrant flow to the UK. Britain can get food from where delivered to our door.More than , asylum seekers, paying large sums of money, have illegally entered the UK this year. Following the death of -year-old Sudanese migrant Abdulfatah Hamdallah on a beach in France, the usual suspects have been rushing to blame Britain. After leaving Sudan he and his friend Gamr Alsha were in Italy and France, so under EU \"safe haven\" rules they should have claimed asylum there and Abdulfatah would not have died. The , who travelled through numerous \"safe havens\" in Europe should quickly be deported and this would deter others from risking their lives.Clark Cross, Linlithgow.MASKING THE DANGERSTHERE is much talk in the media currently on whether people should wear masks in ious situations.Inevitably most people wear cheap masks, and the fact that my glasses steam up, and that when I seal a cheap medical mask around my mouth I almost cant breathe, suggest that my breaths are taking the path of least resistance and going round the edges of the mask unfiltered.There are several research papers on the effectiveness of mask wearing, and perhaps the most interesting one is from  which claims to be the only study on cloth masks to that date.

When I first started in customer insights, my knowledge was superficial and developed through on-the-job learning. I was self-taught when it came to data-driven insights, using in-house processes and workplace training, but I hadnrsquot developed the skills needed to be able to think about the wider picture.Completing an MSc in Data Science at Edinburgh Napier University, through The Data Lab, has allowed me to progress signicantly in my field.Thatrsquos just my experience, granted. But the numbers speak for themselves. In a  government study,  per cent of employers agreed that they witnessed better business performance due to investing in vocational qualications, and % noticed improved staff retention.In a  Education and Skills Survey report by CBI and Pearson, nearly halfof employers cited an employee demand for further learning. Yet, the Employers and Lelong Learningreport from CBI found that employer investment in training was lower than before the  financial crisis. With the UK Commission for Employment and Skills predicting that roughly % of jobsare likely to need a postgraduate degree by , itrsquos more important than ever that training and education does not fall to the side.As we begin to slowly emerge from the wrath of the coronavirus pandemic, businesses are reeling with cost-cutting and redundancies looming for many. Itrsquos an uncertain time, butemployers want to help save as many jobs as possible, retraining and reskilling should be a core focus.Look at how engineers and manufacturers were quickly able to turn their hand to making ventilators or distilleries to producing batches of hand sanitiser instead of whisky when the pandemic reared its head. Adaptability is key to business survival, but a strong workforce is the cornerstone to success.Employers should foster an atmosphere that encourages their employees to seek and enter higher education part-time. Myriad benefits outweigh the potential costs involved.In fact, there may be access to funding and grants to support training at a post-graduate or Masters level - The Data Lab, Scotlandrsquos innovation centre for data and AI, runs several data-related courses in partnership with  universities in Scotland, and can help with funding too.Investing in your workforce greatly reduces staff turnover, saving a huge amount of money, given that the cost of replacing an employee is thought to exceed pound,.As we enter a new period of economic uncertainty, it feels more important than ever to foster further learning in the workplace.If not right now, investment in training, upskilling, and reskilling should be considered in the months and years to come, allowing staff to manage more than one discipline, and future proofing your business against a similar impact.From developing staff to become more confident in their roles, to retraining or reskilling existing staff to take on new roles, or bringing in innovative new solutions that you might otherwise have never come across, the benefits certainly outweigh any reservations.Raymond Martin is a graduate of The Data Labrsquos MSc Programme at Edinburgh Napier University"},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-prue-leith-ken-buchanan-combo","story":"EWE couldnrsquot make it up.

It was the Highland midge which sent him home to think again, about ever holidaying in Scotland.The beastie has form. In the summer of  Queen Victoria paid a visit to the Duke of Sutherland at his pile, Dunrobin Castle on the Dornoch Firth. It was a balmy day, a day that seemed ideal for a picnic. Vickyrsquos diary records what happened. \"We stopped to take our tea and coffee but were half devoured by midges.\" They fled for the damp pleasures of the castle.The wee critter is at least democratic and undiscriminating, it bites not just royalty and high head yins but the hoi polloi, indeed any warm blooded beast it can get its teeth into, but the assault is only carried out by the female, the placid male is happy to suck petals.And once the female strikes, in a sort of midge social media frenzy, thousands of others swarm to the site to get in on the feast. The first bug emits pheromones and all the others pick up on it and pile in. Kill one midge and all her sisters come to the funeral.The females are born with enough fat reserves to produce one batch of eggs, but after that they need blood to produce more pests. Apparently only one-in- is successful in finding a source, so just think how much worse it could be.There are more than  species of midge, most of which feed on other insects, more than  biters in Scotland but only one, the dreaded culicoides impunctatus, the Highland midge, does so habitually and with venom. A swarm can inflict  bites in an hour, in that same time , can land on an unprotected arm, should you be foolish enough to go for a dander in a short-sleeved shirt or blouse.Some brave,utterly doolally, people have taken the one-minute midge challengeincluding the naked, full-body version but should you be tempted, make sure therersquos lochan nearby to plunge into afterwards. Better still, have yourself sectioned.There a story, no doubt apocryphal, that a gravedigger on Rum in times past did something to offend the locals, perhaps burying a body upright , and in punishment he was stripped naked, tied to a post and left at the mercy of the midges. It took him some time to die, and goodness knows what his corpse looked like.Another tale, which carries a shred of authenticity, is that the Highland Clearances were responsible for the massive increase in their numbers. The imported Cheviot sheep chomped all the bushes and hedges, where birds, their natural predators nested, and bingo, mair midges, fewer sparrows.Perhaps the same thing happened in Australia when livestock was introduced and flies and mosquitoes prospered, hence the Aussie preventative solution, the wide-brimmed hat with the dangling corks.This would have little effect on our little pest. It may only be about mm long and slightly less across with its wings extended but its jaws are razor sharp. Ms Midge finds a human target and feasts on the blood like a microscopic vampire, also injecting chemicals into the wound to stop the blood clotting. She can feed there for up to four minutes, while sending out the alert to the others.In response to a bite, the human immune system kicks in, pumping histamine and white blood cells into the wound, causing swelling of the skin and that infernal itch wersquove all experienced. The normal way to treat a bite is to ignore it, buttherersquos an anti-histamine cream around it may help. Home remedies include crushed ice, aloe vera, honey and porridge. Or you could combine the last two to double the effect, and spoon up any residue.Oil of citronella is supposed to deter them, also dill, fennel and thyme, although covering yourself in dried, mixed supermarket herbs wonrsquot, and there are ious sprays said to do the job, but more of that later.Therersquos a wonderful chap at the Glasgow Science Centre called Derek who, asauditioning for Blue Peter which you can watch online, came up with his patented midge eater, which involves plastic bottles, scissors, sugar, water and yeast. Oh, an extremely smelly sock. You leave the contraption out and the midges will apparently swarm to it on a death mission. Aye, right Derek.Itrsquos estimated that midges, or the threat of them, costs the Scottish tourism industry about poundmillion a year, so this article should add a nought or two. One-in-five working days in forestry are, apparently, lost because of them, although as the industry employs less than , people, and the bulk are in processing, Irsquom not sure the loss is so grievous.They first emerge in May and June, after mild and wet winters, although extremely cold ones they tolerate too, theyrsquore most plentul and pernicious in low light, at dawn and dusk, they like mildly acidic habitats, peaty soil, rushes and bracken, where of course you can also double up on Lyme disease.A rough rule is that they thrive where there is at least mmof rain a year, which just about applies to the whole map, and they are rare above  metres.

He said that Scotland was \"the Belarus of the west ndash a small, sparsely populated appendage of England\". Given what has been happening in Belarus in recent weeks and the fact that polls, since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, have been showing a majority in favour of independence for Scotland, one wonders whether or not Mr Ferguson has seen cause to revise his earlier statement.Ian W Thomson, Lenzie.IN , a Russian died by mercury poisoning in a London hospital.

Asked to rate his performance, % said he was doing well, % badly and a whopping % were ldquodonrsquot know.To survive for so long without achievements, profile or prospects is, in its own small way, remarkable.But being Holyroodrsquos answer to moss wasnrsquot the objective.Mr Leonard is meant to be within striking distance of Bute House.After more than , days, itrsquos clear he never will be. He has had his chance and it hasnrsquot worked out. He is not a late bloomer but a dead bulb.Thatrsquos not to say hersquos a bad chap. He is manestly decent and sincere.At his best, he is one of the most commanding speakers at Holyrood.If he raises an injustice at FMQs, his solemn, unadorned phrases have an ability to silence MSPs and make ministers squirm in discomfort.However it is a patchy talent thatrsquos undone by the times he misfires horribly, as he did this week with a stale script and weak comebacks, and was shredded by Nicola Sturgeon.But his biggest problem is his failure to connect with the public. Too cosy talking shop within his own tribe - never get him started on trade union history - he hasnrsquot reached out widely enough to voters, hasnrsquot fought hard enough for their attention.Whatever the message, it needs the right messenger to be heard.As one party source told me more in sorrow than anger: ldquoHersquos making no impact whatsoever. Hersquos got no traction. Hersquos a lovely, intelligent and sharp guy, but I despair at times.Yet he carries on regardless, recently promising that he would lead Scottish Labour into the  election despite the third strike all around him know is inevitable. It will not be a campaign, but a resignation tour.While Ms Sturgeon will be askedshe intends to serve out a full term, few expect Mr Leonard to last the weekend after the votes are counted.:Anneliese Dodds warns Westminster Labour party wont decide Richard Leonards futureDetermination and a thick hide are necessary qualities in a leader, but they are not sufficient ones.Mr Leonardrsquos desire to carry on for the sake of the unions and the Left that elected him is understandable.But without Corbyn, he is a sidekick without a hero, a holdout for a ghost of a project rejected by the electorate. Ultimately it is selfish and lets down those counting on Labour in power, for without a Scottish revival Sir Keir Starmer will struggle to overcome Boris Johnsonrsquos  seat majority.Leaders heading for the exit cannot expect to interest voters, inspire activists or attract talent in the same way as leaders with a future.Jackson Carlaw had the same problem. He was not expected to stick around long after , and many of his key staff were already leaving when Tory HQ brought forward his departure date. Douglas Ross has a better chance of building a fresh team around him than Mr Carlaw ever did.I ask you, who is going to sign up for the last days of Richard Leonard So it falls to Sir Keir to spruce up Scottish Labour in the spring, offering a dferent anti-Tory vote to the SNP.It may not make much dference, but this early in his leadership he can afford to throw himself into the fray and take a few lumps, and therersquos no credit in ducking the fight.Thatrsquos the Prime Ministerrsquos modus operandi north of the border.All is not lost for Scottish Labour however. While Mr Leonard runs down the calendar, party HQ should work up a swt process to replace him, and interested MSPs can use the election to audition for the vacancy.Anas Sarwar is the battle-scarred favourite. He was wholly unprepared for the focus on his personal wealth that helped him lose to Mr Leonard. But he is tougher and cannier now. Monica Lennon may also apply.Although a coffin lid for Mr Leonard, the election could yet prove a shop window for his successor.Let the contest begin."},{"url":null,"title":"digital-learning-cash-boost-sees-unis-given-little-1-40-per-student","story":"Earlier this year the Scottish Government announced it would provide the funds to colleges and higher education institutions to help students who needed financial support to enable them to study remotely.However analysis of the figures shows some universities have been given as little as pound. per student, with the highest amount just pound. per head.According to the Scottish Funding Council , responsible for allocating the cash to higher education institutions, the grants are not supposed to be a blanket payment to all students but to only help those in financial hardship.They say universities are being asked to use their ldquodiscretion to ensure a ldquofair and equitable approach to iding up the money.However some students say their courses require expensive software and IT equipmentthey are to study off campus, and many would be unable to afford the costs by themselves.Some institutions have agreed to pay out of their own pocket to meet the expenses.John Craig, student president at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotlandhas now written to the Scottish Government about the issue, raising concerns that the grant funding provided will not be enough to cover studentsrsquo expenses.In a letter to Higher Education minister Richard Lochhead, he said: ldquoIm emailing today to askyou could provide any help or support in advocating for the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland to receive additional support from the Scottish Funding Council in light of their recent announcement regarding an additional pound million in support for Colleges and HE institutions.ldquoUnfortunately, in the pound million announcement, RCS was awarded pound.

While the software costs pound a year to license, it cannot be used on older computers so students may have to upgrade their machines.He told The Herald: ldquoThe RCS have acknowledged that pound itself is too low to be able to provide a laptop and microphone combination that would actually be up to spec to run these programs, and have agreed to match the funding internally to cover the additional costs for the students who receive the government funding.ldquoThis still means that only around - students will benefit.

People have gone to remarkable s, or rather depths, to come up with original shots, to sitting in a chair at the bottom of a pool reading, attempting to drink beer, or watching TV. It is latter-day surrealism that Magritte or Dali would have loved.Possibly the pioneer of this art was the former Eagles singer and guitarist Joe Walsh, with the album cover of But Seriously, Folks, which features him in a suit and sunglasses sitting at a set table under a parasol in the deep end.Irsquove searched for a similar site featuring supermarket trolleys, so far with no results, but Irsquom sure itrsquos coming.Just singing a songIt wasnrsquot the first time Neil Young had played in Glasgow. In , he had a calamitous evening at the Apollowhere the support band were the Eagles, although Walsh hadnrsquot joined then. But, on April , , he was back with his band Crazy Horse and gave a legendary performance, with three encores.I was reminded of it when I stumbled across a filmic gem of Young busking outside of Central Station on the afternoon of the gig. Irsquom sure that Youngophiles are well acquainted with it but it was new and immersive for me.It opens with Young in coat, scarf and deerstalker asking a passer-by, ldquoCan you tell me where the Bank of Scotland is  before sitting down with banjo and harmonica just outside the station ndash the banjo case open looking for coinsndash and a brief glimpse of a billboard behind which seemed to be about Celtic.

This was the last concert date in a -gig Japan and Europe tour.It was filmed by David Peat and directed by Murray Grigor. The singer had told them he wanted ldquosome funky s**t footage and thatrsquos what they provided.Young is no archetypal rock star. He suffered polio as a child in Canada, his two sons have cerebral palsy, his daughter epilepsy. He and his we founded a school for kids with communication dficulties. Hersquos director of a company called Liontech and is named as co-inventor of seven US patents. Back in  he was, for a few minutes, just a Glasgow busker.A fine MessiI KNOW Scots invented everything but until last week Alexander Bain was just a name to me. But thanks to Lionel Messi, his genius ndash Messirsquos is a given ndash was brought home to me. The Barcelona player, clearly an analogue man in a digital age, signed his first contract on a restaurant napkin and handed in his notice to the club by fax . It was Bain who invented the fax, some  years before another Jock, Alexander Graham Bell, lodged the US patent for the telephone. Would that we were as clever now at football.Bainrsquos career as an inventor was marked by being stitched up by others. In , when he was almost starving and desperate for money, he showed his invention of an electric clock to Sir Charles Wheatstone, the man who invented the concertina but most lastingly became a major figure in the development of telegraphy. Wheatstone was dismissive. ldquoOh, I shouldnrsquot bother to develop these things any further! Therersquos no future in them, he said.Three months later Wheatstone demonstrated an electric clock to the Royal Society, claiming it was his invention. Unfortunately for him, Bain had applied for a patent and although Wheatstone tried to block it he was forced, by Parliament, to pay Bain pound, through his company and give him a job. Wheatstone then resigned. In , Bain patented the first crude facsimile machine. It worked by a pendulum swinging over a copper line drawing and every time the pendulum hit a piece of copper it sent an electric impulse to another pendulum which copied the image. In , he attempted to patent an improved version but had been beaten to it by another inventor two years before.When Bain was living in Edinburgh, still before the arrival of the phone, he invented a chemical telegraph which was around seven times faster than the one by Henry Morse which was in universal use. Morse obtained an injunction against the Bain telegraph, claiming that it breached his patent and that was that. The fax machine may have all but disappeared but itrsquos still in use by the legal profession for sending documents back and forth, as the courts had banned emailing although, with the pandemic, that has been relaxed. And by Messi. Possibly.Taken down in RioYou donrsquot get a better intro than this: ldquoBrazilian gospel singer turned politician has been accused of organising the murder of her husband, a pastor, with the help of some of their  children.It gets better when you learn the pastor was  and his we .

This is only the beginning though.“The plan will evolve and respond to reflect the feedback and the needs of the sector. We are therefore calling for industry to review and contribute to the plan.” The recovery plan is available to view on the CLF website.Feedback can be submitted via the website on enquiries@constructionforum.scot by September .CLF will take all feedback on board to help develop the plan further, with regular updates published on the CLF site.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The infrastructure proposals have been designed to enable Orkney to manage a transition away from fossil fuels, while continuing to generate social and economic benefit from ongoing oil and gas activity.The proposals will have #transformational# impact on Orkney#s economy and society. As well as creating as many  new jobs, there will also be a substantial number of job opportunities during the construction phase.OIC leader James Stockan said: “Our vision is to build a truly sustainable business that is a core economic asset for Orkney, but also a first phase in enabling a scale of investment and logistical capability for the UK, which will be of international signicance.“Prime Minister Boris Johnson clearly welcomed our ambition and Orkney’s potential during his recent visit to our islands, describing as a ‘fantastic idea’ our vision for Orkney as a low-carbon, zero-emissions hub of innovation, with Scapa Flow at its heart.“We believe the time is right to maximise the incredible natural assets and geography of Scapa Flow and Orkney, to ensure a long-term sustainable future for our communities. We are open for business now, and ready to work with potential investors and operators to develop the signicant strategic and international opportunities Scapa Flow offers.“The Scapa Deep Water Quay proposal has been included in the Islands Deal list of projects that has received funding commitment from the Scottish and UK governments, and we are continuing to ensure that the funding earmarked for this will be secured.”Central to the project is the unique geographical advantage of Scapa Flow, described by the council as the largest natural deep-water harbour in the northern hemisphere, as the potential setting for internationally signicant marine logistics to serve the new and emerging sectors, including low-carbon fuel transition and offshore wind developments.Scapa Deep Water Quay is seen as the optimal location for construction and operations and maintenance activities, associated with offshore wind, as well as for a liquefied natural gasstorage and distribution hub. At the same time, this infrastructure has the capability to accommodate semi-submersible s of all types, giving Orkney a unique UK competitive edge within the existing oil and gas market.The project team believes it could be delivered by . Other proposals, such as Hatston and Kirkwall, could take three or four years to deliver.Phase two will ultimately develop the islands’ smaller harbours and piers across the islands.Harbour users and key stakeholders were consulted from the outset, to help gain an understanding of the issues, constraints and opportunities associated with harbour infrastructure around Orkney, through workshops and interviews. The range of stakeholders includes local communities, harbour users, potential funders and environmental bodies such as Scottish Natural Heritage.Harbourmaster James Buck added: “Tackling decarbonisation is the strand that binds these proposals together, providing infrastructure and knowledge for renewable energy developments around our waters will allow us to reach climate change targets. “We will also look at the potential for net environmental gain through habitat reinstatement and enhancement.”According to the OIC, Orkney Harbours is one of the most erse and successful council-run port authorities in the UK, with an annual turnover of £ million and nearly , annual vessel movements.The council added that the exact timing of construction for each of the phase one masterplan proposals is not yet known.This will be determined over the next six to  months, and will depend on a range of factors including market requirements, funding and environmental considerations.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The work by local folk to develop an initial idea from way back in  to today shows the enthusiasm to bring renewable energy to Yell.”“Throughout this process the project has received strong support from local folk, but we’ve also worked very hard as a team to, where possible, address matters raised by consultees and the wider public so that our final submission reflects a project we hope the communities of the North Isles can be truly proud of.”Project Manager for Statkraft Charlotte Healey said: “The Energy Isles windfarm is a very important renewable energy project for Statkraft and I am very proud to see the final plans and supplementary environmental information submitted to the Scottish government.”“Working with the initial consortium who conceived and developed this project has been nothing short of inspirational.

But what of other aspects What of community resilience, something I suspect will barely register as a priority for most us when deciding on our weekly shop It may be the case that more people will try and grow more of their own food and local produce will, hopefully, be in greater demand.All very welcome. But what’s really needed is a completely fresh approach to our behaviour as consumers.As the pound in our pocket becomes ever more stretched we need to value it in terms of what benefit it can bring to the wider collective # who can it support, what should it support and how can that can bring about greater resilience within our own communities.It’s not radical or revolutionary. It’s just about taking a bit more time and effort to think about where best to spend our cash, especially when it comes to our most basic of needs.It can’t possibly make sense to get your Sunday roast from the supermarketthe same cut of meat is available at your local butcher at a comparable price . And especiallythat butcher has sourced his meat from the crofter down the road.It takes a bit of extra effort to call in at the butcher, for sure, but add in important elements like food miles and provenance and there really is no excuse, except for our own inherent laziness.It has always amazed me how there is any fish at all on the shelves of supermarkets in this part of the world when the local fishmongers offer far higher quality at a lower price.And, in any case, it’s now perfectly possible to buy direct from the fisherman, with many of them now offering sales to the public.That may have come about through the closure of their overseas markets during lockdown, but what better example of necessity being the mother of invention.If west-coast prawns were coveted by sophisticated palates on the Mediterranean, then they should be more than adequate for consumption a bit closer to home.It’s not that long ago that our communities were completely self-reliant in food.We do demand a more discerning choice these days # no-one would want toto a diet made up entirely of fish, mutton and potatoes.But, with an abundance of quality produce on our own doorstep, surely it makes sense to take more advantage of that and in the process create greater community resilience through sourcing from independent, local retailers.If there’s a downside to that approach, I fail to see it.ONE aspect that looks certain to change, certainly for the foreseeable, is that there will be less air travel.Through the lockdown it is estimated that carbon emissions have been reduced by over  per cent by planes being grounded alone.That’s not even taking account of reductions in car journeys and it is a staggering figure from just one simple change.There are certain elements in the environmental lobby who would have you believe that methane emissions from cattle make a signicant contribution to climate change.Never mind that bovineshave roamed the land for thousands of years without causing much harm.Never mind that it’s only the last  or  years, as our economy became ever reliant on fossil fuels, that the damage to our planet has been made.The reduction in air travel will be for economic, more than environmental, reasons.But the staggering statistics of these last few months should at least mean that when it comes to a real determination in tackling environmental damage the finger of blame will be pointed in the right direction.Then again, maybe cows are a much easier target."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image.jpg","title":"royal celtic societys unique music","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineWork has begun on processing the twenty entries received for a unique competition which set the country’s musicians the challenge of creating a new shinty composition.

PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappA mum whose son was traumatised after being left alone in a room by his teachers wants the department to bring in minimum standards for Covid isolation in schools. Jessica BlackAugust   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA mum whose son was traumatised after being left alone in a room by his teachers wants the department to bring in minimum standards for Covid isolation in schools.Current guidance requires children who show coronavirus symptoms to be taken from class and put in a room behind a closed door until they can be collected - but there are no restrictions on how these spaces are set up.Earlier this week a school in the Republic of Ireland was reported to have set aside a garden shed for kids to self isolate.The Co Tyrone woman, who asked for her name not to be used, said the practice should be standardised to protect pupils.Her son has become terried of being left alone after he was repeatedly taken from his classroom and left behind a locked door at his former school. The mum-of-two added: As a parent who has navigated a child through this pre-Covid I am aware of the seriousness of this issue.We had to remove doors from the house. He only recently got the bedroom door put back on his room but we can#t close it.The minimum should be a standard size, access to water and a window for ventilation.One child#s experience should not dfer from another due to #lack of space#. The Department of Educationhas previously updated its guidance to require adult supervision, and for schools to keep a record of whenever a child is isolated.Children#s Commissioner Koulla Yiasouma welcomed the changes made so far - but said more clarity was needed.She also wants ventilation to be mandatory - instead of ideal, as the current guidance says.She added: I recognise iations in physical capacity and space across schools, however, emphasise the need for a consistent approach to be taken by schools when separating isolating symptomatic children until they are collected by a parent and that ventilation should be provided.A DoE spokeswoman said guidance was based on public health advice.It states: A child awaiting collection should be moved,possible, to a room where they can be isolated behind a closed door. Appropriate adult supervision must be provided. Ideally, a window should be opened for ventilation.She added: This allows schools the flexibility to manage cases as they arise on their sites, without being overly prescriptive. The Department will continue to keep the guidance under review, working closely with the sector.Department of Education guidance states: A ventilated space should be available for pupils  staff who become symptomatic to wait in until they can be collected or safely get home. Education settings may wish to draw on the broad principles illustrated in these examples to help inform bespoke local solutions. There should be no restriction on how spaces are configured to best support the educational needs of learners whilst adhering to social distancing requirements. Education settings will be best placed to consider the right approach for their own inidual circumstances.A child awaiting collection should be moved,possible, to a room where they can be isolated behind a closed door. Appropriate adult supervision must be provided.Ideally, a window should be opened for ventilation. If it is not possible to fully isolate the child, they should be moved to an area which is at least m away from other people.A risk assessment should be undertaken by the school to address this.Schools should fully document this process to ensure a record is held of who made the decision, who was contacted, who provided supervision and who picked up the child.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus cases reported at MS supermarket in Belfast and a Fermanagh nursery schoolBBC NI#s Tina Campbell: Precious family time in lockdown, her father’s friendship with Van Morrison and the ambition she still wants to fulfilBelfast#s George Best Hotel now #derelict# as brides miss out on dream weddingsMixed emotions: Poignant journey taken by son of Shankill Protestant father and a Falls Road Catholic mumDouble century as NI#s oldest couple celebrate another birthday,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Tony Stevens has come out of retirement to take up the post of interim chief executive of the Regulation and Quality Improvement Authorityfollowing the departure of Dermot Parsons. It comes after it emerged Mr Parsons threatened to resign from the top post at the height of the Covid- pandemic, claiming the Board of the RQIA had no confidence in his ability. Mr Parsons wrote to the Chief Medical OfficerMichael McBride in May stating he felt his position was untenable after the RQIA Board raised concerns over the decision to scale back care home visits during the pandemic. The board also expressed concerns about the redeployment of a number of RQIA#s senior executive team with critical loss of experience in the months before Mr Parsons was appointed interim chief executive. The row culminated in the mass resignation of the RQIA Board. The RQIA is the body tasked with ensuring healthcare providers such as hospitals and care homes meet minimum safety standards. A spokesman from the RQIA refused to say whether Mr Parsons remains with the organisation or provide an explanation for him stepping down as interim chief executive.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDermot Parsons FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDermot ParsonsHowever, Christine Collins, interim chair of the RQIA Board, said: I am delighted that Dr Stevens has agreed to take up post of interim chief executive at the RQIA on September . Dr Stevens brings considerable leadership experience and knowledge of the health and social care system, which will be invaluable as we reinforce and reshape the RQIA to face current and future challenges. Meanwhile, Dr Stevens said: I am pleased to be joining the experienced and dedicated team at RQIA at this challenging time for health and social care and the wider community. I look forward to leading RQIA in assuring the quality and safety of the health and social care services that people experience, and responding to the particular challenges that the current pandemic presents. Mr Stevens is the third person to be appointed as chief executive of the RQIA in six months. Olive Macleod stepped down as chief executive in March this year to take up the top job at the Public Health Agency. She was replaced by Mr Parsons who has now also left the job. The performance of the RQIA has come under the spotlight in recent years. It came under fire following a damning investigation into conditions at a care home in Dunmurry, which is currently at the centre of a police investigation. The Commissioner for Older People in Northern Ireland expressed concerns that the RQIA did not act quickly enough to protect residents at Dunmurry Manor, which has since been renamed Oak Tree Manor. And in June this year, Mr Parsons came under pressure to explain why he told the Stormont health committee in May that the RQIA was in agreement with a direction from the Department of Health to reduce care home inspections. In response to the question on the issue from chair Colm Gildernew, Mr Parsons said: Our approach towards that was agreement. However, in an email sent to CMO Dr Michael McBride on April , Mr Parsons referred to an appearance of a fundamental dference of approach between that promoted by the CMO, chief social worker and RQIA executive team members, and that upheld by the RQIA board. He continued: I would also be grateful for your urgent advice as I believe that my position as interim chief executive in RQIA may be untenable... I am content to step out of this roleit will help resolve this dilemma.In an email sent to Dr McBride on May , Mr Parsons reiterated a desire to resign: It is clear that RQIA Board does not have confidence in my performance in this role... I am unsure as to with whom I should discuss resignation... unfortunately I now believe my position is untenable.

There has been talk today about drive-through vaccinations andI do think this is the sort of infrastructure that we#re going to have to be looking at to deliver this in order to ensure there is the maximum uptake.Not everyone is going to feel safe about going into a clinical setting at the moment, so perhaps that will be more acceptable to people.On encouraging more front line health workers to get the flu jab, he added: Obviously the worry for them will be the impact of a potential second wave of coronavirus.So we need to make sure more people aren#t being sick for regular reasons, enabling them to be fully al to fight any second wave.It#s also vital they don#t have a lower immune system when working in clinical settings.On the scale of the challenge, he said: It#s no small obstacle, in Northern Ireland we#re looking at trying to get close to two million people immunised.So we will need large-scale, almost medical camps set up in places to access the vaccine. In a way it will also be a practice run for when we hopefully do get a Covid- vaccine.Mr McGrath said the fast response earlier this year to setting up a Nightingale hospital in Belfast was an encouraging sign.He added: When we put our minds to it I#m very sure that we can achieve massive things.I#ve every faith we can do that but we would certainly want to see evidence that we#re progressing towards that quickly.This week, experts have also warned that complacency over the flu jab could risk overwhelming the NHS across the United Kingdom.Analysis showed a decline among vulnerable groups in England to getting the vaccine.Local authorities in England had an average of % of people with serious health conditions under  getting the jab, a % drop since . In Northern Ireland the respective figure for vulnerable groups under- was % - the target here is %.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said this week: The vaccine is more vital than ever.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus cases reported at MS supermarket in Belfast and a Fermanagh nursery schoolBBC NI#s Tina Campbell: Precious family time in lockdown, her father’s friendship with Van Morrison and the ambition she still wants to fulfilBelfast#s George Best Hotel now #derelict# as brides miss out on dream weddingsMixed emotions: Poignant journey taken by son of Shankill Protestant father and a Falls Road Catholic mumDouble century as NI#s oldest couple celebrate another birthday,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The union has warned this figure could rise even during .Last month a report by the Northern Ireland Audit Office said £m is spent every year on temporary staff to cover nursing shortages here.The RCN has said a recent survey of , RCN members showed % are thinking of leaving the profession this year, with over half citing pay as a factor.The union said it will continue to work with other health unions to call on all the devolved governments to provide nursing and health care staff with an early and substantive pay rise. Pat Cullen, director of the RCN NI, who warned in June that nurses couldto the picket line after holding strikes earlier this year for increased pay and better conditions, said wages for the profession must be attractive to secure safe nursing levels.Nurses in Northern Ireland are only too aware of the impact of not having enough nurses to care for patients, she said. This is why they took the dficult decision to take industrial action earlier this year and why we fought so hard for the guarantee that safe nurse staffing legislation would be implemented here.The union chief continued: We need to ensure that nursing remains an attractive profession and that we are training and retaining the right numbers of nurses in order to do this. The public have made it clear that they value the profession - we must ensure their pay reflects this. Dame Donna Kinnair, RCN chief executive and general secretary, insisted the campaign is about recognising the skill, experience and responsibility shown by all members of the nursing profession. This is about more than the profession#s response to Covid- - it is about increasing the attractiveness of the profession, to fill tens of thousands of unfilled nursing jobs and reach safe staffing levels. It is time to pay nursing staff fairly, she said.Meanwhile, Graham Revie, chair of the RCN#s trade union committee, said the pay demand reflects the knowledge, skills and responsibilities of the complex job we do. RCN members have told us they expect things to change, and we will fight for that change. The RCN is its members and together we can achieve fair pay for nursing, he said.Nursing... has been underfunded, understaffed and undervalued.

It is not the first time he faced a challenge in that part of Ulster. He tells Liam Tunney his gripping story, outlining his reasons for wanting to break the stigma of addictionA County Derry man has spoken of his experience with addiction as he prepares for a fundraising challenge in aid of the organisation who helped him deal with it. Dean Groogan, from Ballinascreen, is raising money for the Cuan Mhuire rehabilitation centre in Newry by climbing the seven peaks of the Mourne Mountains this weekend with a number of friends. The -year-old, well-known in south Derry for his story-telling and recitation talent, has spoken about his story to encourage others who may be struggling to seek the help they need. “I know a lot of people that need help, but they dont know where to get it or how to go about it,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I wasnt originally going to talk about myself, but I was talking to my girlfriend and people close to me and they said, why are you beating about the bush  “They saidI wanted to break the stigma, I had to be straight and honest, and it made sense. The more I tell my story, itll help people come forward and get help themselves.” Dean had been struggling with drug addiction for a number of years before attending the Newry rehabilitation centre, and says the continued fight to cover up his problems took its toll. “For a lot of years I was struggling. I can make all the excuses in the world about mental health problems, anxiety, depression and guilt, but I got deep into addiction with fake highs,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “I was covering up for a lot of years. I can wear a hundred and one masks and people would think I was in great form, but deep down I was a broken person. “I was hiding that for a long time and I tried a thousand times to get myself sorted, but I would not do it on my own. “It was put to me a few times about getting residential help, but I didnt want it, because it was a pride thing for me. I was embarrassed people would find out. “Eventually I had to put my hands up and say I needed help. I didnt lose my job or my family, so it wasnt rock bottom that way, but emotionally, I was at rock bottom. “I didnt know where to go, I was just a broken person in the depths of depression. Just a broken man. I had to get help and Cuan Mhuire was a le-saver for me.” Dean and Pat McGinn met up a few weeks ago to record a video about Cuan Mhuire. Dean was introduced to Pat McGinn, a former Lord Mayor of Newry and someone who had been through Cuan Mhuire previously. He admits though, thatit wasnt for the intervention of his girlfriend Emma, and close family and friends, he might not have taken that step. “Cuan Mhuire saved my le, andit hadnt been for my girlfriend Emma and my close family and friends, I wouldnt have gone,” he said. “I wont say Cuan Mhuire did it all for me, because they dont just put a magic wand over your head and say thats you free, because you have to put in the work yourself. “I went in and gave it my all and Cuan Mhuire gave me three months to get my head sorted, myself straight, allowed me to recharge the batteries and I came out a dferent man.” Cuan Mhuire was set up in  by Sister Consilio in Athy, County Kildare. The Newry centre was built in  and originally catered for those suffering from alcohol addiction. These days, the spectrum of addiction is much wider. “In this day and age, its not as simple as a man lying drunk in the street. Drugs are everywhere, in every bar you go into, and its so easy for a young person to get hooked on something,” said Dean. “They try it for a bit of craic and the next thing they know, its a few months down the line and theyre in something they cant get out of. It destroys lives. “Drugs are a new thing, people dont really understand. I was speaking to a man who was drinking for years. He said he never touched drugs, butthey had been about in his day he probably would have. “Its so easily available these days and it wrecks families. It rips the soul clean out of you. For me, I detested myself. I knew what I was doing was wrong and that it was wrecking my le. “I just couldnt stop. Addiction is something that you cant get enough of, but that you detest. It was just ruining me and Cuan Mhuire was a le-saver for me.” The Cuan Mhuire centre in Newry. On Saturday, August , Dean and a group of friends will climb the seven peaks of the Mourne Mountains to raise money for the centre. They are already well on the way to their pound, target, and are hoping the trip will be a fun way of raising money and awareness for Cuan Mhuire. “Eight of us are going to start off at six in the morning and tackle the highest peaks in the Mournes,” said the Ballinascreen native. “I know a few boys that have done it in around  or  hours, but were not going to break any records! There are a few men going to meet us halfway up and do us a barbeque, so itll be a days craic as well. “I know money donated to the charity is great, but stigma is the main thing, so Ill be pushing online about the residential care for people suffering with drugs, gambling or drink.” Dean wants to ensure that anyone who finds themselves in need of help knows where to access it, and is especially keen to help men who may be struggling and reluctant to act. “As men, we bottle a lot of things up, personal things like depression or anxiety and people turn to drink or drugs or other highs to mask them things,” he said. “They are taught from no age not to show any emotions, to bottle it up and be a man, and thats not the reality. Theyre turning to other substances to mask the pain and thats just not the way to go. “This is to let them know that places like Cuan Mhuire are out there and will help themthey come forward. “Anything can go through that door thats one thing I found out about it. There are all dferent age groups and all dferent backgrounds and religions. “There are people with plenty of money and people with none. There were even a few people who were homeless whose families want nothing to do with them. “Addiction doesnt care who you are, it will come for you regardless. Putting yourself out there warts and all isnt easy, butit helps someone, thats the reason for doing it.” For more information, visit the Mourne Mountain Challenge Facebook page, where you can find links to the Just Giving page, for those wishing to donate. Anyone who is in need of help or support with addiction can contact Cuan Mhuire by phone on  or via email – newry@cuanmhuire.ie  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The -year-old performed a haunting version of Sinead O’Connor’s ‘Nothing Compares  U’ that received a standing ovation. Dara saw off tough competition from Paloma Faith’s other acts, Isla and Hayley, to become her representative in the final four. ”You have this amazing talent that’s technical but feels so sensitive,” said the coach. ”That feeds into the way you sing because it’s just pure beauty.” The St Colm’s High School pupil was congratulated by his family after his performance and can now look forward to the final round of the competition. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Micky Doherty was presented with the Foyle Pride Mark Ashton Award for Outstanding Contribution to the LGBTQ+ community by the citys real Mayor, SDLP Councillor Brian Tierney, at a ceremony at the Holywell Trusts Garden of Remembrance on Saturday night. A spokesperson for Foyle Pride said Mr Doherty, who fronts the citys Pride parade each year, was a truly deserving winner who does so much, for not only the LGBTQ+ community, but also the wider city and district community. Mr Doherty is a tireless charity fundraiser and helped set up a special fund to help local people in need during the oronavirus crisis. googletag.cmd.push Im known in the local area as being a charity fundraiser-theres a charity fundraiser Ill host it, said Mr Doherty. Its just part of me that I like helping people. During lockdown I knew people had started to struggle and they were coming to me and I started to think about how I could help. Because I have been working with charities for a long time people put their trust in me. Mr Doherty was hosting a drive through bingo event last week when he got a phone call to say he had won the Foyle Pride award. I just burst out crying, he admitted. I really didnt expect it so I was just overwhelmed. googletag.cmd.push I just have so much gratitude for the award and for everyone who nominated me and I want to thank them all. Mr Doherty said he wished his late mum, Cathy, could have been there on Saturday to see him receive his award. Its hard to accept that my mammy couldnt be there, he said. Its just not the same without her but I am still filled with so much gratitude for it, he said. Derry LGBT+ campaigner, Suzanna Toland, who passed away earlier this year, was remembered at Saturdays ceremony. It was really nice to see Suzanna recognised for everything that she did, said Micky. She was a very special person.Before she passed away she had set up an LGBT+ disco at Rosie Joes so that people would have a safe place to socialise.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The guidance, announced this evening by Peter Weir, comes into effect from August . The Minister said: “My key priority is that pupilsto school on a full-time basis, as soon as it is safe to do so. “Following further advice which I have received today from the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientic Adviser, I am recommending that pupils and teachers wear a face covering in corridors and other communal areas of post-primary schools from next week when schoolsfull-time. googletag.cmd.push ”This updates the existing guidance on the use of face coverings in educational settings. “The current public health advice is that the use of face coverings provides some benefits, however, it is not a replacement for frequent hand washing, social distancing where possible, covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze and regular cleaning of surfaces. “It is also important to remember that evidence suggests that the risk of transmission in schools is relatively low compared to some other settings. “My existing guidance on the reopening of schools already deals with the use of face coverings. “In terms of school transport, the advice remains the same, that we strongly recommend that all pupils wear a face covering on all dedicated school transport including buses and taxis where it is appropriate for them to do so. googletag.cmd.push “In relationto communal areas in schools, the guidance already strongly encourages face coverings for activities that entail large numbers of staff or pupils within an enclosed space where social distancing is not possible.  “Given the risk mitigations in place in schools to limit and contain the spread of Covid-, face coverings are not recommended as being compulsory for routine use in education settings. “However, staff and pupils may wish to use them during the routine school day and this is acceptable. “Schools should also be aware that some personsare exempt from wearing face coverings. “I will continue to keep all guidance in respect of education settings under review in light of the latest medical and scientic advice. Peter Weir added: “The first step in keeping our schools safe is that anyone with symptoms should not attend school. Parents should not send their children to schoolthey have any of the Covid- symptoms including: a high temperaturea new, continuous cougha loss or change to your sense of smell or taste.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Oisiacuten Campbell achieved a triple distinction in Level  Extended Sports Diploma at Northern Regional College’s Magherafelt campus, the equilvalent of three A*s at A-Level. Next month, he will be begin to study Sports Psychology at Liverpool John Moores University, with the long-term goal of helping special needs athletes prepare mentally and phsyically for sport. “The College teams up with local sporting organisations, giving us the option of volunteering with them,” said Oisiacuten, who plays Gaelic Football for St Martins GAC in Desertmartin. googletag.cmd.push “This gives me the opportunity to work with some fantastic groups, including Magherafelt Marvels Special Olympics Clubs and Peace Players which promotes ersity through sport. “The practical sessions could sometimes push you out of your comfort zone which was always a good learning experience.” Oisiacutens was awarded the Inspirational Student of the Year award at the end of his first year at the College and while lockdown put sport on hold, he continued to volunteer with Magherafelt Marvels. “Volunteering with the Special Olypmics has given me greater confidence in my own ability and reinforced the importance of giving clear instructions and listering to others,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “We kept in touch and posted home videos on Facebook so the athletes could continue their training at home during the lockdown.” Bronagh ONeill, Sports lecturer at Northern Regional College, said she was delighted with Oisiacutens success. “Oisin was a pleasure to have in the class and the accolade ‘Inspirational Student of the Year’ was so well deserved,” she said. “He was quite shy when he started the course, so it was great to watch him progress and grow in confidence. “He really benefited from volunteering with the Magherafelt Marvels but they have also benefited from his expertise and enthusiasm. I wish him every success at university and in his future career.“ Northern Regional College offers a range of full-time and part-time Sports courses.

Mrs Patricia Herron, Music Co-ordinator at St Eoghans Primary School, Draperstown, has watched Daras talent grow and develop from an early age. “He was maybe P or P when I realised that there might be a little voice in there that needs to be heard,” she told the County Derry Post. “The routine in our school would be that I askany children want to have a go at auditioning for a solo piece, so Dara would come up to the piano and this beautul, soft, quiet voice would come out. googletag.cmd.push “He sang solo at ious religious ceremonies as well, but it was really towards the end of P when his voice was developing so much more. “He was using a lot of ornamentation and trills and it came to light when he was singing an Irish song, with the traditional voice.” It was while singing an Irish song at his primary school show that the wider community began to take notice of the -year-olds phenomenal talent. Patricia recalled the moment his mum, Donna, was overcome with emotion watching her son hold an audience spellbound. “At that concert, when Dara sang the Irish song, I was sitting behind Donna,” she said. googletag.cmd.push “He hadnt sang it for his mammy purposely, and Donna just turned around and looked at me, and I looked at her, and there were tears in her eyes. I just nodded asto say, I told you so.” In a nod to the community ethos in Ballinascreen, Mrs Herron said the fact Dara is so grounded and kind is testament to his upbringing. “He is such a lovely young man, so mannerly and kind. Even when I watch him on The Voice, hes always worried about everybody ,” she said. Pupils and staff at his former primary school, St Eoghans, beside a poster in support of Dara McNicholl “His voice is an absolute gt, and a gt that he must share with the world, because anybody Ive spoken to just wishes him so much luck. “Behind that is a lovely young man, and we wish him all the best. Hes very grounded and so are his family.” Daras exploits in The Voice Kids competition have enthused pupils and staff alike at a school where they take performance and the wholistic view of the child seriously. “In St Eoghans, we place a lot of importance on performing, and getting to know childrens talents, discover what they are and develop them,” said Mrs Herron. “Some schools think nowadays that concerts and opportunities to perform take away from learning time, but that is when you learn things like resilience, self-confidence and self-esteem. “The children from this area seem to be very musical and its an important part of our school, but Dara is such an inspiration. “From Primary  right up to Pimary , and indeed the staff, they just want to be like Dara. Any chance to sing now in school, Ill have a line of about a hundred children waiting to audition for a solo part!” After securing his place in the final with a beautul rendition of Sineacutead OConnors Nothing Compares  U on Saturday, Dara will take on fellow contestants George Elliott, Victoria Alsina and Justine Afante in the final. Coach Paloma Faith described his voice at the weekend as one of pure beauty and his primary school music teacher agrees. “To see a young child come in in P, get to be such an amazing singer by the time he leaves school, and then to excel and develop, I just cant wait to see what the future holds for him,” she said. “I heard him in an interview, and one of the lines he used was, I just want people to listen to my voice. “Now people have heard it and theyre sitting up, waiting to hear what comes next.” You can watch Dara in the final of the The Voice Kids this Saturday, August , at .pm on ITV.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Another site, Vessel Finder, also states that it received the latest position of the boat at .pm on August . googletag.cmd.push FSR were tasked on Sunday last, following reports of a grounded vessel. Pat Carlin, of FSR, said the boat was likely to be there until mid-September when the tide would be high enough for it to re-float. “She’s stuck solid,” he added. “We went and assessed the boat, determined that the crew were safe and passed that information on to the police service,” Mr Carlin explained “We provided them with some basic supplies that they needed and basically the vessel is grounded and can’t be move until the tide is lted. “All relevant services were notied and are aware that it’s there.” googletag.cmd.push Mr Carlin continued: “I think they were up on the council pontoon and to the best of my knowledge they may have come from outside the area, I don’t know exactly. “They’ll have no choice but to wait, maybe with the sudden floods tonightthey’ll be lucky and might get re-floated otherwise they’ll have to wait until the tides are high enough.” The PSNI confirmed that police assisted partners, including FSR and Coastguard in liaising with the crew. A report from , shows that Day Dawn N  was bought for the purposes of fishing from Portavogie. It was said to be the first time the vessel had been based anywhere  apart from Kilkeel since her arrival in  from Banff where the wooden-hulled boat was built by John Watt  Sons as a trawler. Harbour master at Portavogie, Neil Warnock, yesterday said Day Dawn was based there but left a couple of months ago. “Somebody bought it for a pleasure craft,” he explained. “It’s not a fishing boat any more, the licence on it was sold off a while ago there. “The last I heard the boat was in Portrush, I saw a picture of it at Portrush harbour after it left here.” At Portrush, the assistant harbour master said the boat owner was only there for three days and he believed the man travelled from the Greencastle direction. He was trying to get himself a permanent mooring, he said, but wasn’t able to secure it. The owner left Portrush heading towards Derry where he tried to get a mooring in the town and ended up on the mud flats. “I just know that he bought that for pound. None of the fishermen like decommissioning so they basically would rather they go off. “So I think he bought it for a pound and wanted to change it into an Air B ‘n’ B, but we couldn’t offer him a permanent mooring in Portrush, so he was only here for three days,” the Assistant Harbour Master added. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Foyle Port added: “Foyle Port is aware that a small trawler has run aground at Madams Bank in the River Foyle. “There is no environmental threat or impediment to other marine craft. “Once conditions are right we expect the vessel to become buoyant again.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Shortly before nine oclock to be precise. Peter Buzzers back bar in Maghera is sparsely populated. Apart from the commentary, as Gaeilge, from TGs GAA  programme humming out of the TV on the wall, you couldve heard a pin drop. Its a Monday club with a dference. There are no boom boxes, no empty take away pizza boxes strewn around the tables nor half drunk people roaring into your ear while making little or no sense. Less than  hours earlier, two decades of concerted Slaughtneil planning and effort morphed into a slick hunger Loughgiel simply couldnt deal with. By the tenth minute, the maroon and white hooped juggernaut had broken into the orbit of Ulster hurling. Nine points clear and  months after the hurt of an extra time defeat by Cushendall, there was no catching them. googletag.cmd.push In his victory speech, Chrissy McKaigue thanked every man, woman and dog involved in their success. Everyone except Thomas Cassidy, who had passed away days before. He waited until the inner sanctum of a packed Slaughtneil hall later that night, when back among their own. The Four Seasons Cup was clasped by one victorious outstretched fist. The index finger on his other hand gestured to the hall floor scarcely visible below the throngs of fans, where Thomas taught him how to play hurling all those years ago. There wasnt a dry eye in the house. Even the walls wouldve had goosebumps. googletag.cmd.push On the Monday night, his brothers Mark, Declan and Bungazed at Buzzers TV with a look and a body language that money couldnt buy. Slaughtneil were at the top of the tree. The new Ulster champions had many helping hands to shape them along the way. But the Cassidys fingerprints were always prominent. Taking over the mantle of the Kellys, who sowed the seeds in the s. Mark and Declan seemed like eternal minor managers when, in the beginning, silverware didnt always reward their toil. On a monsoon afternoon at Kevin Lynch Park, a saturated Bun thumped the roof of the then prefab dressing rooms to the sound of campeones. A team he managed with former minor winner Eoin McGuigan, that included Cormac McKenna and Chrissy McKaigue, had brought home the bacon. It was another building block. Also seated for that Monday viewing was Dermot Doherty, a selector under Michael McShane who is now running his eye over the minors. The apple doesnt fall far from the tree. His father Barney and the late Eugene Babs Kelly managed the clubs  winning team. It was a fitting reward for Barneys ferrying of average underage teams, year after year, in the back of his blue Mercedes van. Often on the lookout for a th player to make up a team that would iniably be on the end of many a hammering. An U shield at a blitz in Dungiven and a South Derry minor hurling final win against Lavey were the modest s for the effort. A FIRST FEacuteILE Below it all, another batch was coming to the fore to cut new ground. In , under Thomas and Barney and captained by current minor selector Adrian Quigg, Slaughtneil won their first ever Feacuteile title. By minor level, with direction from Mark and Declan Cassidy, back to back Ulster minor titles followed, from a group that also won a football title at St Pauls and lost in the final the following year. A generation that also produced current senior football boss Paul Bradley. Under Thomas wing, they won the senior title in  before being beaten out the gate by Dunloy in the Ulster final. It couldve been the beginning of dominance, but instead it was a last senior title for  years as Kevin Lynchs and Lavey ruled the roost. Armed with more coaches coming forward, the Slaughtneil underage hurling production line succeeded Ballinascreens time at the top. No longer was the journey south to the Feacuteile a novelty. It was a permanent fixture in the calendar. With it, came families bonding together and each success inspired the younger teams to follow. A new wave of minor glory at Ballinascreens Ulster tournament followed, but Kevin Lynchs were still the standard at senior level.  was supposed to be the breakthrough year. After winning a league title, Slaughtneils young guns were the pretenders to the Fr Collins Cup only to be sent home with their tail between their legs again by the Lynchs. It was neighbours Swatragh that took the cup for the first of eight seasons into the Granaghan parish where it still remains. The following year, under Mickey Glover, Slaughtneil eventually wrestled clear of Kevin Lynchs on their way to glory. In Ulster, their gung-ho tactics and bravery put Loughgiel to the pin of their collar in a moral victory to ascertain the level required. For the next two years they faced Cushendall in Ulster, but again came up short. All the while the underage production line continued. The Fr Collins Cup was present at one of the underage management meetings, almost as a sign of the level that needed maintained. With every year, came one or two new players into the squad. The fact that Michael McShane handed Shane McGuigan his senior debut in an Ulster final, while still a minor, was a sign of their commitment to growing the team to a height to challenge the big boys. McShane built a management team to match the players ambitions. Every base was covered. Cormac Donnelly came in as trainer. Their games were all analysed. Like the footballers and camogs, the strength and conditioning made them a finely tuned engine. The pre-game routine was planned to the nth degree, so that all the players had to do was turn up and deliver. And they did. Three Ulsters later and their stature on the national stage has soared. Cuala beat them in the manner Dunloy did in . It was followed by defeat to Na Piarsaigh, a game they surrendered from a position of strength. How times had changed. In the s, when Tom Magill had Lavey at their peak, just winning a championship game was a challenge. Now, not being happy after putting up a performance on the All-Ireland stage told enough about the ambition. The Ballyhale game was the greatest statement of intent, taking the giants of club hurling every step of the way. In the physical stakes, they were able to match them and in the skills of the game they were not found wanting either. In an epic, they came so close to the biggest day of all. This weekend, they enter the knockout championship stage again. They will have the favourites tag. There are no two ways around it. Last week, they saw off Na Magha with virtually a reserve team. Only Jerome McGuigan, suspended against Lavey, started from their All-Ireland semi-final team. Thats how far Slaughtneils hurling story has come. From the days when getting  players for a game was an achievement, they have set a standard of skill, attitude and athleticism that the rest of Derry must strive to reach. Success comes in cycles. In recent times, Kevin Hinphey has followed his father into coaching and led Kevin Lynchs to back to back Ulster minor hurling titles. They have been swimming in Slaughtneils wake, searching for ato the top table. The overall Derry hurling landscape needs them, and others, to narrow the gap. To do so, they will need to match an unrelenting hunger for more success.

Shortly before nine oclock to be precise. Peter Buzzers back bar in Maghera is sparsely populated. Apart from the commentary, as Gaeilge, from TGs GAA  programme humming out of the TV on the wall, you couldve heard a pin drop. Its a Monday club with a dference. There are no boom boxes, no empty take away pizza boxes strewn around the tables nor half drunk people roaring into your ear while making little or no sense. Less than  hours earlier, two decades of concerted Slaughtneil planning and effort morphed into a slick hunger Loughgiel simply couldnt deal with. By the tenth minute, the maroon and white hooped juggernaut had broken into the orbit of Ulster hurling. Nine points clear and  months after the hurt of an extra time defeat by Cushendall, there was no catching them. googletag.cmd.push In his victory speech, Chrissy McKaigue thanked every man, woman and dog involved in their success. Everyone except Thomas Cassidy, who had passed away days before. He waited until the inner sanctum of a packed Slaughtneil hall later that night, when back among their own. The Four Seasons Cup was clasped by one victorious outstretched fist. The index finger on his other hand gestured to the hall floor scarcely visible below the throngs of fans, where Thomas taught him how to play hurling all those years ago. There wasnt a dry eye in the house. Even the walls wouldve had goosebumps. googletag.cmd.push On the Monday night, his brothers Mark, Declan and Bungazed at Buzzers TV with a look and a body language that money couldnt buy. Slaughtneil were at the top of the tree. The new Ulster champions had many helping hands to shape them along the way. But the Cassidys fingerprints were always prominent. Taking over the mantle of the Kellys, who sowed the seeds in the s. Mark and Declan seemed like eternal minor managers when, in the beginning, silverware didnt always reward their toil. On a monsoon afternoon at Kevin Lynch Park, a saturated Bun thumped the roof of the then prefab dressing rooms to the sound of campeones. A team he managed with former minor winner Eoin McGuigan, that included Cormac McKenna and Chrissy McKaigue, had brought home the bacon. It was another building block. Also seated for that Monday viewing was Dermot Doherty, a selector under Michael McShane who is now running his eye over the minors. The apple doesnt fall far from the tree. His father Barney and the late Eugene Babs Kelly managed the clubs  winning team. It was a fitting reward for Barneys ferrying of average underage teams, year after year, in the back of his blue Mercedes van. Often on the lookout for a th player to make up a team that would iniably be on the end of many a hammering. An U shield at a blitz in Dungiven and a South Derry minor hurling final win against Lavey were the modest s for the effort. A FIRST FEacuteILE Below it all, another batch was coming to the fore to cut new ground. In , under Thomas and Barney and captained by current minor selector Adrian Quigg, Slaughtneil won their first ever Feacuteile title. By minor level, with direction from Mark and Declan Cassidy, back to back Ulster minor titles followed, from a group that also won a football title at St Pauls and lost in the final the following year. A generation that also produced current senior football boss Paul Bradley. Under Thomas wing, they won the senior title in  before being beaten out the gate by Dunloy in the Ulster final. It couldve been the beginning of dominance, but instead it was a last senior title for  years as Kevin Lynchs and Lavey ruled the roost. Armed with more coaches coming forward, the Slaughtneil underage hurling production line succeeded Ballinascreens time at the top. No longer was the journey south to the Feacuteile a novelty. It was a permanent fixture in the calendar. With it, came families bonding together and each success inspired the younger teams to follow. A new wave of minor glory at Ballinascreens Ulster tournament followed, but Kevin Lynchs were still the standard at senior level.  was supposed to be the breakthrough year. After winning a league title, Slaughtneils young guns were the pretenders to the Fr Collins Cup only to be sent home with their tail between their legs again by the Lynchs. It was neighbours Swatragh that took the cup for the first of eight seasons into the Granaghan parish where it still remains. The following year, under Mickey Glover, Slaughtneil eventually wrestled clear of Kevin Lynchs on their way to glory. In Ulster, their gung-ho tactics and bravery put Loughgiel to the pin of their collar in a moral victory to ascertain the level required. For the next two years they faced Cushendall in Ulster, but again came up short. All the while the underage production line continued. The Fr Collins Cup was present at one of the underage management meetings, almost as a sign of the level that needed maintained. With every year, came one or two new players into the squad. The fact that Michael McShane handed Shane McGuigan his senior debut in an Ulster final, while still a minor, was a sign of their commitment to growing the team to a height to challenge the big boys. McShane built a management team to match the players ambitions. Every base was covered. Cormac Donnelly came in as trainer. Their games were all analysed. Like the footballers and camogs, the strength and conditioning made them a finely tuned engine. The pre-game routine was planned to the nth degree, so that all the players had to do was turn up and deliver. And they did. Three Ulsters later and their stature on the national stage has soared. Cuala beat them in the manner Dunloy did in . It was followed by defeat to Na Piarsaigh, a game they surrendered from a position of strength. How times had changed. In the s, when Tom Magill had Lavey at their peak, just winning a championship game was a challenge. Now, not being happy after putting up a performance on the All-Ireland stage told enough about the ambition. The Ballyhale game was the greatest statement of intent, taking the giants of club hurling every step of the way. In the physical stakes, they were able to match them and in the skills of the game they were not found wanting either. In an epic, they came so close to the biggest day of all. This weekend, they enter the knockout championship stage again. They will have the favourites tag. There are no two ways around it. Last week, they saw off Na Magha with virtually a reserve team. Only Jerome McGuigan, suspended against Lavey, started from their All-Ireland semi-final team. Thats how far Slaughtneils hurling story has come. From the days when getting  players for a game was an achievement, they have set a standard of skill, attitude and athleticism that the rest of Derry must strive to reach. Success comes in cycles. In recent times, Kevin Hinphey has followed his father into coaching and led Kevin Lynchs to back to back Ulster minor hurling titles. They have been swimming in Slaughtneils wake, searching for ato the top table. The overall Derry hurling landscape needs them, and others, to narrow the gap. To do so, they will need to match an unrelenting hunger for more success.

At the end of a dire game of football, substitute Ciaron Harkin latched onto a cross from Colm Horgan to volley City into the lead with just one minute left on the clock. A clearly dispirited Drogheda then conceded a second in added time as another substitute, this time Stephen Mallon, fired in a second goal to flatter Derry, who responded to their Europa League exit with a valuable win. In a game of few chances, Drogheda were on the front foot early on, showing a lot of energy and enterprise as they did not take Derry settle into the game at all. The home side could well have been celebrating an early goal. Darren Cole gave the ball away down the right and Drogheda countered, with Kane working his way in from the left, and he got a sight of goal only to blaze his effort high and wide without testing Peter Cherrie. googletag.cmd.push It took Derry  minutes to finally threaten the Drogheda goal, and it all came from another brilliant surging run forward from Eoin Toal, this time down the right-wing. Toal’s cross from the right won City the first of two successive corners, the latter of which saw Ada, Hammill cross brilliantly to Cameron McJannett who somehow headed over from under the crossbar when it seemed he must surely score on his debut. City were on the front foot immediately at the start of the second period and Ibrahim Meite, after a quiet first period, went for a spectacular effort almost immediately, his left-footed effort from the edge of the area curling wide of goal without testing Ross Treacy. googletag.cmd.push The visitors were asking the questions at the start of the second half but a Drogheda break, led by Mark Doyle, saw the home side very nearly take the lead. Doyle went on a mazy run through midfield right to the edge of the City penalty area, where his attempted shot was blocked. The ball however ran straight to Brandon Bermingham who tried a low first-time effort which had Cherrie scrambling across goal but it went just wide of the target. The game was heading to extra time before one decisive moment decided it – Colm Horgan breaking into the area and crossing for Harkin to fire in a fantastic finish at the near post with just  seconds left on the clock. There was still time for another goal to really flatter Derry as Meite’s threaded pass put Mallon through on goal and he smashed in his third goal of the season to send the Candystripes through to the quarterfinals.

He took trains from Milan to Torino, and then up the Susa Valley and around six hours later he was installed in Susa where it was  degrees.Race day dawned without a cloud in the sky and with the temperature already soaring, Hanna joined the front row of the grid designed for social distancing wearing his mask. The mask was obligatory for the first m. Hanna tucked into a front bunch that was a whorsquos who of Italian mountain racing. Hanna covered the first mile in :, and then at km the race became steep. He climbed well, as ever, encountering a dficult patch around the middle and then at about .km he spotted Baldaccini ahead of him, a past winner in  and .By now Hanna was in tenth place and with his climbing legs feeling good again set about moving up the field. He caught Baldaccini and kept pushing and on to the final k, with  flats and true flats at over , feet altitude, Hanna surged to cross the line in a brilliant eighth place.In the process he had taken the scalps of, not just the former winner of the race Baldaccini, but also Puppi, who had taken second place in last yearrsquos World Long-Distance Mountain Racing Championships, and Bernard Dematteis, the former European mountain racing champion.At Down Royal on Saturday, the sound of hi-tec racing flats reverberated around the horse racing turf as the ChampionChip Ireland Road Race Series continued following its event at Eikon, Balmoral, three weeks ago.It was only August , but could easily have been mistaken for late autumn as the blustery conditions from the remnants of tropical Storm Ellen continued to cause havoc in the quest for personal bests.It was a testament to the consistent running many had done during lockdown and throughout the winter before that there were many personal bests achieved.First up was the km, won by Mourne man Andrew Annett in : in a sprint finish with Annadalersquos Eskander Turki . Three weeks ago, David McNeilly, who now graces the ranks of the M category, ran a k PB of :and came home in : for a PB of  seconds dating back over seven years.Next clubman home was Niall Goodman in :, just three seconds outside the time he set at Eikon, he was slightly disappointed but the run consolidates the improvement he has made this year. The ever-improving Francis Tumelty is now in the M category and after just missing out on his K PB three weeks ago with a : clocking in Eikon, he smashed his : from the Bay Road k in  with a : PB here at Down Royal.Fteen year old Tom Crudgington doesnrsquot much like running on the flat mdash instead he loves the hills and mountains. However, hersquos learning that he needs to improve his running on the flat to take it into the mountains and here he set a PB by around a minute with his : time. Phil Murdock broke the -minute barrier for the first time clocking :.Mark Holland has shown steady improvement in training and is another who is getting faster as he gets older, now in the M category. With a previous best of around  and a half minutes, he smashed that with a brilliant : clocking, a fine product for all the work he has done.Nichola Watson has had injury troubles, but over the past couple of months has been training consistently again. Wondering beforehandshe would be strong enough to dip under  minutes, she put any doubt to rest with a brilliantly paced race to record a letime best of :.Also ing to racing, this time less than six months after giving birth to baby Roacutenaacuten, Ashlene Mussen surprised herself in recording a very strong :.Next up was the half-marathon and as ever a glutton for real punishment, Thomas OrsquoGorman toed the line on the back of his :: PB at Eikon three weeks ago. With conditions a bit harder here, he had to settle for :: and a th place.The final race of the day was the k where Lisburn ACrsquos Chris Madden won in an excellent :.Three weeks ago, Aidy Brown was gutted to run  seconds outside  minutes and  seconds outside his best and he vowed totoday and put the record straight.

He found Joe McKenny coming through from midfield and passed to full forward Shea Boyle, who was subsequently fouled and put the ball over the bar to level the match.It was that man Aaron McClements again who scored five of his sidersquos six points by the th minute to put Loughinisland one in front. Eoin Mageean showed guile, skill and composure with a mazy run from wide on the right to the centre and put the ball over from  metres to level things again in the th minute.Ben OrsquoReilly was getting his fare share of possession and fed Conor Megoran to put Loughinisland - to - at the second water break.It appeared the game could swing any way at this stage and Darragh Cross equalised again after Marcus Miskelly scored a magnicent point off the upright from  metres. However, that was as good as it got as Loughinisland dominated the final quarter to secure the win.In a free-flowing move McClements found Ben OrsquoReilly, who scored a delightful point in the th minute. Aiden Nixon came on to replace Rory Deegan for Loughinisland but suffered a reoccurrence of an ankle injury and was replaced by Eddie Nixon just seconds after coming on.Rory Mason scored a great point from  metres with his left foot in the th minute just before Mark McMahon received a yellow card for the Darragh Cross.With victory in sight, Conor Megoran passed to substitute Eddie Nixon and he fisted the ball over the bar for Loughinisland to send his team safely through to the next round of the championship.Darragh Cross: R Miskelly P Branny, M Monan , E Sweeney M Boyle, O McConvey, C Murray M Hardy, J McKinney M McMahon, M Miskelly , J Murray, S Dineen, S Boyle , C Sweeney .

Pictured are favourites Sue Gray and Peter MayIn a circular process, mandarins were then chosen by the Senior Appointments Selection Committee, a body itself made up of the most senior civil servants, each of whom was selected for the committee by the Head of the Civil Service, who was in turn advised by the committee.Jobs were neither applied for nor CVs reviewed, with the acerbic observation that “few senior officials have ever drawn up their own CVs or would know how to do so”.Despite criticism that such a situationwas untenable in a modern democracy, Plowden, an academic who was himself a former civil servant, said in his  book Ministers and Mandarins that it represented “a powerful symbol of the traditional civil service” which “reflects the confidence of the civil service as a profession in its own judgements about its own future and about the national interest, and about the congruence between the two”. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...As with much of le in Northern Ireland, things here have always been slightly dferent.But until recently two broad elements of Plowden’s analysis of the Whitehall machine would have been largely analogous – civil servants had enormous power in choosing each other for the top posts, and that practice was a manestation of a government bureaucracy which was firmly self-confident.Where the confidence of Whitehall mandarins could be traced back to their predecessors who had run an empire, the confidence of Stormont’s officials had been forged in their knowledge thatit was the fledgling Northern Ireland Civil Service which – as much as the politicians of the Ulster Unionist Party – had built Northern Ireland and had been critical to sustaining it throughoutthe Troubles.For decades as Northern Ireland burned, as blood ran in the streets and as politicians proved incapable of finding workable governmental arrangements, it was the quiet bureaucrats of the Civil Service – as much as the military might of the Army, the resolve of the police or the restraining influence of churches – which held society together when it could have imploded into outright and uncontainable chaos.But now, on the eve of Northern Ireland’s centenary, the institution which in the years after  was central to making the new creation work when so many expected it to fail is now battered and a byword for irreformable ineptitude.The RHI scandal brought to view long-buried incompetence, along with new problems – officials’ limp subservience to their political masters’, a culture of deliberately not taking minutes or even recording who took major decisionsthey believed it might embarrass their ministers, and incompetence so extreme as to be scarcely believable.But as the chairman of the public inquiry into that scandal, Sir Patrick Coghlin, repeatedly noted during its hearings, many of the indefensible activities revealed by cash for ash had been raised time and time again by the Audit Office and the Assembly’s Public Accounts Committee, and assurances had been given by senior civil servants that “lessons will be learned”.They weren’t, and by failing to weed out incompetence in their ranks and speak truth to power, now Stormont’smandarins are greatly diminished – a collective punishment in which honourableand competent officials are now paying for the sins of their colleagues.The fact that in monetary terms not a single civil servant of any rank has yet lost a penny, much less their jobs, as a result of RHI does little to convince the public that this is an institution capable of holding itself to account .All of this is relevant because on Wednesday the first interviews of those who have applied to succeed David Sterling – who was implicated in the practices revealed by the RHI scandal – as Head of the Civil Service were conducted. According to a source, five internal candidates were interviewed – Sue Gray, Peter May, Richard Pengelly, DenisMcMahon, and Hugh Widdis – along with at least one external candidate.The identity of the external candidate or candidates remains unclear. Another source said that at least one senior DUP figure had wanted Francis Campbell, an Ulster-born former British diplomat who served as Ambassador to the Vatican, to apply for the post.The fact that Mr Campbell is a devout Catholic may make that seem surprising to those whose view of the DUP is as inflexiblysectarian party but it would in many ways be entirely logical – not only is the -year-old Rathfriland man a highly regarded bureaucrat and spoken of as a person of integrity, but the DUP has enthusiastically endorsed other senior appointments of Catholics, most notably that of John Larkin as Attorney General.It is unclear whether Mr Campbell – who earlier this year went to Australia to be vice chancellor of Notre Dame University – is even interested in the post, but the appointment of a Northern Ireland Catholic as head of the Civil Service would powerfully symbolise how this society has changed since .Until now, the Head of the Civil Service has – as in Whitehall – almost iniably been an internal promotion. But it is indicative of the shrunken authority of the civil service that internal candidates now probably begin with a handicap in a situation where the central requirement for the post will be to reform the institution.Multiple Stormont sources point to Department of Justice permanent secretary Peter May as the pre-eminent internal candidate and the closest to a continuity candidate of those most likely to get thejob.Department of Health permanent secretary Richard Pengelly is another strong and experienced candidate butthe fact that he is married to not only a senior DUP figure but one who is the special adviser to the First Minister in the department he would then lead is at least a complicating factor in a post requiring not just actual neutrality but the perception of neutrality.However, experienced Stormont figures largely agree that the clear favourite is Department of Finance permanent secretary Sue Gray.Despite that title, she is very much an outsider, having suddenly and unexpectedly arrived months after the RHI Inquiry had begun to reveal Stormont’s entrails and to some shrewd observers it appeared that Whitehall was putting one of its most senior figures in the Stormont department which controls the budget at a time when the culture of ‘free money’ was being laid bare.In person, she is warm and unstuffily personable, a sort of bureaucratic Mo Mowlam unwilling to accept conventionit cannot be cogently defended.To some, she is therefore a crusading reformer belatedly bringing reluctant officials into the st century and they see the fact that she has unsettled some of her new colleagues as evidence of that.But to others, her words too often don’t match her actions – especially around the secrecy which has long surrounded how she operates, a major problemshe is the person to reform a civil service whose aversion to openness was revealed by RHI to have been such a liability.Mrs Gray has a remarkable and atypical background. During the Troubles – in what The Sunday Times later described as “an unusual ‘career break’ in the s” – she came from London take over the Cove Bar on the Hilltown Road between Newry and Mayobridge, less than ten miles from the border, with her husband, Portaferry-born country and western singer Bill Conlon.If Mrs Gray did get the job, it would represent the shattering of another glass ceiling for women and would for the first time see a triumvirate of women in Stormont Castle’s most senior roles.However, all this speculation may be academic. Several years ago the rules on choosing the Head of the Civil Service were changed to give the First Minister and deputy First Minister full final say on who is appointed.Therefore, with this huge choice ultimately in the hands of Arlene Foster and Michelle O’Neill, they will get who they want – unless, as is not infrequent, they cannot agree.Read More Read MorePay hike as Executive makes last-minute search for top civil servantPowerful official working to end Stormont secrecy presided over suppressing materialConor Murphy’s top civil servant also answerable to Cabinet Office ministers________A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

 years onMr Evans, of Cardigan in West Wales, but now living in Brecon, said: ldquoIrsquod taken a call back in  to check my availability for a small comedy for BBC Three and set in South Wales.ldquoI met up with Christine Gernonand Ruth Jonesat the Castell Mynach pub near Llantrisant one afternoon to discuss the script and the locations they wanted me to scout.ldquoAn hour or so after the meeting, I got the call from the production company Baby Cow offering me the job.ldquoMy first task was to sit with Dave Ferrisand discuss the vision for Gavin  Staceyrsquos backdrop and get a feel for the key locations.ldquoStaceyrsquos hometown was scripted as a South Wales coastal town, but I was given a free run on this so the hunt took me to Aberavon, Porthcawl, Tenby, Saundersfoot, and Weston-super-Mare - a cheatit had been suitable.ldquoBack in  there were a few areas in Barry which were beginning to look a little tired, but it also came with a timeless charm that provided us with the perfect texture and feel that Dave and I had discussed.ldquoAdded to this was the welcome we were given by residents and, in particular, the support of the local council.ldquoPorthcawl was also a serious candidate for the backdrop to this show, but having scouted tirelessly the whole of Barry and Barry Island, I knew that this ticked every box.Mr Evans said Trinity Street was an instant favourite.ldquoI knew Gwenrsquos house was here, he said. ldquoThe terraced houses on a steep hill and its far-reaching views over to Barry Island and docks meant that no matter which direction the camera was pointing, there would be interesting textures and views.ldquoThe next objective was to get inside as many houses as possible to seeany worked for us as Gwenrsquos house.ldquoI letter dropped about  houses to gauge the interest.ldquoIrsquod heard that Matt Lucas was going to be involved so I used his name get to my foot in the door.ldquoThis usually helps.ldquoIn those days very few had heard of James Corden.ldquoI viewed and took pictures of about five houses on that street and Glendarsquos who was one of the first to contact me.ldquoThe decor and character of Glendarsquos house fitted my brief perfectly, but my first thought was that house was a little on the small side.ldquoTo get a film crew and the actors to work in such a tight space would be quite a challenge, butI could convince our director and designer that it could be achieved Gwenrsquos house was found.ldquoI took Dave and Christine along to Trinity Street and both fell in love with the location within minutes.Mr Evans continued: ldquoGlenda was so accommodating.ldquoI remember very well discussing with her the details of how filming on location works, how disruptive the whole process can be and also the location fee.ldquoWhat I do remember was her reaction when I mentioned the amount.ldquoGlendarsquos reply was: ldquoIrsquom so sorry Clive, but I donrsquot think I can cover that.ldquoGlenda thought that she needed to pay for the privilege of having us there and not the other way round.ldquoShe is a lovely lady and still loves being a part of the Gavin  Stacey world.During the locationsrsquo breakdown meeting, we discussed how Pam and Mickrsquos house might look in Billericay so homes were viewed in and around Llandaff and Sully until Dinas Powys was selected thanks to the welcome that was received.ldquoSt Cattwgrsquos Church at Llanmaes was not the first-choice wedding venue for Gavin and Stacey, Mr Evans said. ldquoThey were due to be married at St Nicholas Church at the village of St Nicholas, but a last-minute change of heart by the Church in Wales meant that we needed to find an alternative at the th hour.ldquoA friend and another locations manager called Chris Hill pulled in a favour and we were able to use St Cattwgrsquos.ldquoI dont recall any candidates other than Island Leisure .ldquoWhile filming on the front, Marco opening up early for the crew to be able to get a nice coffee as the weather was pretty unkind.ldquoWe didnt use the interior of the coffee shop as a location in series one, but as it was so cold when we filmed on the seafront the coffees were very welcome.ldquoWe also filmed at the Vale of Glamorgan Resort for the exterior of the wedding fair.ldquoThe interior was shot at the Copthorne Hotel at Culverhouse Cross.ldquoWhile at the Vale resort, the Wales rugby team came into the reception of the hotel.ldquoRuth Jones askedIrsquod be able to set up a photograph of the cast with the Welsh team.ldquoWe got them to agree so out there somewhere are pictures of the Gavin  Stacey cast with the Wales rugby team.ldquoUncle Brynrsquos house was only an exterior in series one so very little was involved in its search.ldquoQuiz night at the Colcot Arms was interesting.ldquoWe were close to completing our filming when the pub opened to the public - so the last few shots took a little while longer than wersquod planned.Mr Evans lives with his we Rhiannon and daughter Cerys Mim and runs his own Film and TV Facilities company.He added: ldquoThe actors usually donrsquot get to see the locations beforehand.ldquoThey are brought to set, run through a quick rehearsal then go for the real thing.ldquoThey then have to go through the whole thing over and over with the camera shooting from dferent angles.ldquoIt is a slow process and  hours on camera gives us around three minutes of footage.ldquoI get a real buzz from seeing locations that I have found on TV, but when it comes to Gavin  Stacey the story I always bring up is that while scouting in the very early days with the series producer in the car he askedI would consider reading for Dave.ldquoMy le could have been so dferent, but I have no regrets as no-one could have played it better than Steffan Rhodri.ldquoMy daughter Cerys Mim was born during filming and James Corden was the first to congratulate me when I ed to work on the show after her birth.ldquoHe joked about us naming her Nessa or Stacey.ldquoBarry and the Vale have always provided me with a fantastic hunting ground for film and TV locations.ldquoIts a huge contributor to South Wales becoming a hotspot for filming in the last decade or so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Morgan of Penylan.The best bitch was a mongrel, ldquoTopsy, owned by Mrs Alexander of Raglan Close, Dinas Powys.ldquoTrixie, an eight-year-old Alsation took the prize in its class for the best dog handled by a child, Sally Woodward of Dinas Powys.The best sporting dog was ldquoTippy a Welsh Springer owned by Paul Wingren of Ludlow Street, Penarth.In the small breeds class, the winner was a Welsh Corgi owned by Miss Mary Jenkins of Plymouth Road, Penarth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Peter Cardwell at Hillsborough Castle.“I hope the book is a fun, frank and honest account of what it’s like to work in Westminster.”It’s his first time as an author and already his book has set tongues wagging across social media.Special advisers are a part of the government, yet who they are and what they do is much misunderstood. Key advisers to Cabinet ministers and the Prime Minister since the s, their role is shrouded in mystery, despite acres of newsprint devoted to high-profile members of the cohort, such as Alastair Campbell and Dominic Cummings.Peter Cardwell’s book lts the lid on the people Piers Morgan called ‘these miserable little creatures’, revealing who spads are, how Cabinet ministers use and interact with them, how much influence they have and how they deal with the civil service. Featuring numerous anecdotes from dealing with counter-terror emergencies in COBRA to explaining what a dental dam is to the Justice Secretary, to having your inside leg measured in a Minister of the Crown’s office, this book has it all.BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg said: “Peter allows you to peep behind the curtain of a much caricatured but little understood part of our political universe. With the structures of government in flux it’s a timely look at how some of the key relationships in Westminster work, and how they sometimes misfire.”Michael Crick, veteran political journalist and investigative authorsaid: “A book we have long needed.Peter Cardwell’s book fizzes with stories and humour from his experience as an adviser to four dferent ministers, and his years as a Westminster journalist with BBC Newsnight, ITV and Sky News.”https:www.portadowntimes news uk-news ni-man-peter-cardwell-loses-job-boris-johnson-reshuffle-A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Over my years as principal, we have had great support from the club and some of our past pupils have gone on to represent their county.For me, the notable achievement has been to see the way in which past pupils have progressed in a iety of chosen careers and been successful in so many walks of le.Another achievement is the way in which the staff both past and present have worked together as a team to have accomplished so many things over the past  years, not least to have been awarded Outstanding in our last inspection report.The development of the St. Cairealls Community Playschool on the school site has also brought me great joy over the past ten years to see it now as a successful pre-school provider with DENI status and funding for our local children.Having spent so many years of my le in St Cairealls P.S., it has become a second home and the staff and pupils a second family. Retiring for me brings mixed emotions. However , I am looking forward to having more time to spend with my family, my husband Kevin, our daughters Emer, Niamh and Fionnuala and their partners. Also our son Michael and his partner and my two precious grandsons Micheal and Braidan. Mrs McHugh concluded: I want to offer good wishes to the future of this very special school – St. Cairealls Primary School, Aghyaran and success and happiness to my successor, Mrs Michelle Ellis.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_beadbcebdfb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cbcbcffceaffabfcb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1598431969897.jpg--post_primary_pupils_now_to_wear_face_coverings_in_corridors.jpg?159843197000","title":"post primary pupils now to wear face coverings in corridors ","story":"Education Minister Peter Weir has announced that guidance on face coverings will be updated to include wearing them in corridors of post-primary schools. This will come into effect on  August when schoolson a full-time basis. The Minister said: “My key priority is that pupilsto school on a full-time basis, as soon as it is safe to do so. “Following further advice which I have received today from the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientic Adviser, I am recommending that pupils and teachers wear a face covering in corridors and other communal areas of post-primary schools from next week when schoolsfull-time. This updates the existing guidance on the use of face coverings in educational settings. “The current public health advice is that the use of face coverings provides some benefits, however, it is not a replacement for frequent hand washing, social distancing where possible, covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze and regular cleaning of surfaces. It is also important to remember that evidence suggests that the risk of transmission in schools is relatively low compared to some other settings. “My existing guidance on the reopening of schools already deals with the use of face coverings. In terms of school transport, the advice remains the same, that we strongly recommend that all pupils wear a face covering on all dedicated school transport including buses and taxis where it is appropriate for them to do so. “In relation to communal areas in schools, the guidance already strongly encourages face coverings for activities that entail large numbers of staff or pupils within an enclosed space where social distancing is not possible. “Given the risk mitigations in place in schools to limit and contain the spread of Covid-, face coverings are not recommended as being compulsory for routine use in education settings. However, staff and pupils may wish to use them during the routine school day and this is acceptable. Schools should also be aware that some personsare exempt from wearing face coverings. “I will continue to keep all guidance in respect of education settings under review in light of the latest medical and scientic advice. Peter Weir said: “The first step in keeping our schools safe is that anyone with symptoms should not attend school.
