At the same time, the volume of disinformation from doctored photos to false rumours and hoax videos spreading online has grown at a worrying pace.In etymological terms, the word “viral” comes from the stem word “virus”. And the viral misinformation can be a danger in itself. Just think of the recent petrol bomb attacks on 5G phone masts because of a widely believed – but unfounded – link to coronavirus.There’s so much noise on social media that false theories are easily spread: whether that’s forwarding an email attachment containing a computer virus without reading it properly, or sharing a faked photo because you’re in a rush.The claim: “5G mobile phone towers emit radiation that attacks the immune system, thus affecting those vulnerable to the coronavirus.”The truth: There is no evidence that 5G weakens immune systems or is harmful to humans, with international radiation experts reminding us that Covid-19 has spread in many countries that don’t have the high-speed phone system, such as Iran. The cause of the disease is still unknown, but appears to have started in a Wuhan food market where wild animals were illegally traded.See also: Other false claims about the causes of coronavirus, such as eating bat soup a manmade bioweapon for population control and fortune cookies.If in doubt ... Don’t trust information on social media if you don’t know where it came from one video claimed new £20 notes show symbols of 5G towers, and dozens of phone masts have been vandalised, including one serving Birmingham’s NHS Nightingale hospital. If a cause is confirmed, it’ll appear in reports issued by the World Health Organization (WHO). Rather than trusting celebrities or influencers, try Googling the information to see whether trusted sources such as reputable news organisations like the BBC or the  have reported it.The claim: “Gargling water mixed with salt or vinegar can wipe out coronavirus.” Or so a post shared many times on email and WhatsApp tells us, often accompanied with information that “holding your breath for 10 seconds can prove there’s no fibrosis in the lungs”.The truth: At present there is no cure or treatment for Covid-19.See also: Bogus claims that coronavirus can be cured or prevented by: oregano oil, lemon juice, sunbathing, using vodka as hand sanitiser, or drinking bleach.If in doubt ... Check the latest advice on the NHS website, the WHO website or the Q\u0026ampA page on the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.The claim: In March, a photo emerged on social media purporting to show troops clad in army fatigues walking around London’s Clapham Junction. Many wrongly interpreted this as evidence that the military had been deployed to ensure people stayed home.The truth: The “soldiers” were actually students at a nearby military preparation college and had nothing to do with Covid-19, something confirmed by the Ministry of Defence and the college.See also: Other fabricated photos and videos, such as footage of a man in Wales wiping his hands on a public lift (actually filmed in Bangkok), or the picture of worshippers crowded outside a mosque (taken before lockdown, 23 March).If in doubt: Remember that many doctored photos and videos, plus images with misleading captions, exist online. You can trace the possible source of the photo with a simple image search online.What’s happening: Despite global demand for face masks, a quick online search reveals vendors apparently offering to sell protective gear in bulk.The truth: Hundreds of bogus websites have been set up by criminals since the crisis began, many claiming to have face masks for sale. Police recently revealed British firms and iniduals have lost more than £1.86m to coronavirus-related fraud from bogus companies with no intention of selling masks.See also: The websites recently caught selling fake hand sanitisers or unregistered coronavirus testing kits - another scam.If in doubt ... Never purchase anything from an unverified website - check the padlock symbol in the address bar that indicates a secure connection and report any misleading websites, emails or text messages you think may be suspicious.The claim: “The government has been sending texts alerting people that they’ve been fined for ignoring social distancing measures during lockdown.” For example, one text reads: “You have been out of your house three times today, you are in breach of government guidelines. Your £30 fine will automatically be added to your bill.” A link leads to a non-governmental website asking for bank details.The truth: Hackers have spied an opportunity in the many people working from home, attempting to access their networks or steal login and password details. Up to 21 April, Action Fraud had received more than 1,000 coronavirus- related reports, with losses topping £2.3m.See also: Any email that asks you for personal information such as passwords or credit card details.If in doubt ... Never click on a link in the email or attachment, and refuse any request for money or details. Scan any suspicious text or email for clues.

Translated from Yuin, the language of the country, it means “dancing grass”.Pascoe and his small team of coworkers have never done a harvest like this before. There’s so much grass that both sheds are full, and Pascoe says they are “racing against the clock to refine our methods so we can extract the seed and make the flour. We have got to get this done in two or three weeks before the seed completely drops.”The team had a ceremony for the the beginning of the harvest because they think it’s the first time in 200 years that mandadyan nalluk has been harvested for food.“And some of these people are descended from those who would have done the last harvest,” Pascoe says. “That’s what this farm is all about – trying to make sure that Aboriginal people are part of the resurgence in these grains, rather than being on the periphery and being dispossessed again.”They had intended to harvest a different, more promising crop of kangaroo grass but it was destroyed by the summer’s catastrophic bushfires. As a CFA volunteer, Pascoe spent weeks on the fire and recovery efforts. His sheds burned down but his house survived.As he battled the fires, Pascoe was under increasingly vitriolic attack over his 2014 book Dark Emu, which used historical sources, including the journals of explorers, to show that Aboriginal people engaged in complex agriculture and were not just hunter-gatherers.The personal attacks, largely driven by the Herald Sun columnist Andrew Bolt and a prominent Aboriginal businesswoman, Josephine Cashman, escalated. Cashman asked the Australian federal police to investigate allegations that Pascoe had received financial benefit from claiming to be Aboriginal. The AFP said Pascoe’s Aboriginality “was not relevant in determining whether a commonwealth offence had been committed, as such there was no need to undertake these inquiries”. Then the provenance of a letter Bolt and Cashman relied on to denounce Pascoe was called into question by NITV. Cashman was removed from the senior advisory body to the minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt.Pascoe had little to say publicly at the time and withdrew from some scheduled appearances. But he says book sales went up and he could afford to hire four young people to work with him.“When Andrew Bolt attacked me a lot of Australians took it as a personal attack on them, because a lot of people have read Dark Emu,” he says. “The same people, booksellers have been telling me, bought 10 copies as Christmas presents.But Pascoe says it was “the worst, worst time of my life”.“It was hard for me, that period,” he says. “I’m not trying to downplay it. I’m not trying to say I’m this resilient character because I’m not. But I was totally supported by Aboriginal community. Not every Aboriginal person, obviously, because people tell me that social media was rife with other opinions. But basically the elders stuck by me firm, and some of them came down here, some of them stopped me in the street, to tell me to keep doing what I was doing.”Pascoe says he took solace from the number of Australians “who want their children to learn a better history, a more true history”.“It’s a wave that is washing over these dinosaurs,” he says. “There’s an extinction event happening, and the dinosaur, of course, is never aware of his demise.”Pascoe’s team has been able to work right through the coronavirus: “We just carry on. This is a very isolated farm and we’re isolated on it, so it’s pretty good.”This week they milled some of the mandadyan nalluk seed into flour and baked a loaf of bread.“It’s beautiful bread. It’s a really dark, rye-like flour. Incredibly dark, incredibly aromatic, but also very tasty,” Pascoe says, and it’s not like anything he has smelled before.He gets seven or eight requests a day from bakers and restaurateurs to supply seed or flour, which they will do when they get the milling right.He also wants to show local farmers that letting these plants grow is worth the effort.“In future years it’ll be commonplace because we can grow these grasses on degraded land. I think there are a lot of farmers on marginal land now. They want some consistency, and they want reduced costs. Perennial grain is a way to do that.”The dancing grass is only one of several perennials the team is working with, including kangaroo grass, warrigal greens, samphires and water ribbons.“We cooked with murnong the other day in a recipe we hadn’t tried before and it was sensational,” Pascoe says. “Water ribbon tubers are absolutely delicious. We found a plant, we still don’t know what it is, which came back after the fires, a lovely little onion type thing, absolutely sensational.“There’s nothing new about it at all, but we ignored it. We turned our back on anything of Aboriginal provenance, such was our sensitivity to the history of the country.“It’s time to embrace the history of the country, and with that we will be able to embrace its food.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b70267315be15c59af9c6cdeee19667c80038fba/0_301_2226_1335/master/2226.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d97f2ab4dbb278cdd4d596b39db4c6b8","title":"coronavirus frontline hero rocky mountain gp healed america doctors w eugene smith","story":"As doctors battle coronavirus across the globe, we recall how one tireless Colorado medic became a hero in the 1940s – thanks to the stunning work of legendary photographer W Eugene SmithIn September 1948, an American physician working in Kremmling, a remote rural community in Colorado, briefly became a national celebrity, appearing on television and radio to talk about the demanding nature of his work. The reason for his fame was a striking photo essay by the pioneering American photographer W Eugene Smith, which appeared in the 20 September  issue of Life magazine.Entitled Country Doctor, the series opened with a brooding portrait of the subject, medical bag in hand, striding purposefully across a field beneath glowering storm clouds. In another more intimate image, fraught parents hug each other as they watch an emergency procedure being carried out on their injured infant.The accompanying text told an equally dramatic story: how the selfless 32-year-old physician single-handedly tended to the wellbeing of a rural population of about 2,000 people, many of whom were scattered across 400 square miles of inhospitable terrain in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains.“These 2,000 people are constantly falling ill, recovering or dying, having children, being kicked by horses and cutting themselves on broken bottles,” Life informed its readership. “A single country doctor, known in the profession as a ‘GP’, or general practitioner, takes care of them all. His name is Ernest Guy Ceriani.”Now recognised as one of the landmarks of 20th century photojournalism, Country Doctor was a pivotal moment in the development of the extended photo essay. It signalled the beginning of a golden age of editorial photojournalism that would peak in the 1960s and 70s, when such essays by the likes of Don McCullin, Gilles Peress and Eve Arnold brought dramatically affecting images of conflict, protest and political struggle into millions of living rooms.As print media has suffered a decline in sales and advertising revenue, the photo essay has become an increasingly rare element in contemporary journalism, especially as our digitally driven image-culture feeds our insatiable appetite for short, sharp hits of information.It was Country Doctor that immediately sprang to mind, though, when a few weeks ago I came upon Italian photographer Lorenzo Meloni’s series about the impact of Covid-19 in Italy. Entitled Silent Squares and the Scent of Death: Scenes From an Italy Laid Low by Coronavirus, and published in Life’s one-time sister magazine, Time, the series stood out in its stillness and solemnity amid the relentless deluge of single, often very similar news photographs of the global emergency.Including such quietly stunning images as a white hearse waiting in an empty cemetery car park, and a health worker in a hazmat suit taking the temperature of a masked elderly woman in bed, Meloni’s photos seemed firmly rooted in the old-fashioned humanistic documentary tradition that Smith, perhaps more than anyone, believed in and lived by.“Smith hated bureaucracies and was drawn to iniduals that fought for the benefit of others,” says Stephenson. “He saw himself as one and he recognised Dr Ceriani as one also. There was undoubtedly a heroic quality to what Dr Ceriani did and Smith wanted to make that come to the fore for Life’s readers.”Country Doctor was published in Life the same year that the National Health Service was launched in Britain. In one telling image, Smith shows Ceriani stretched out in his scrubs, exhausted, on an operating table. The text refers to the doctor’s long hours, poor pay and almost impossible workload, describing him as “a physician, surgeon, obstetrician, paediatrician, psychiatrist, dentist, oculist, and laboratory technician” and notes that “his income from covering a dozen fields is less than a city doctor makes by specialising in only one”.For all that, it was the doctor’s dedication to his calling that transfixed the nation rather than the ethical and economic inadequacies of an American healthcare system that worked him to exhaustion. Eager for all-American everyman heroes, the postwar public found one in the beleaguered but doggedly determined physician, whose quiet heroism seemed in tune with the fragile optimism and lingering uncertainty of the times.“America was coming out of the torpor of the Great Depression and epic tragedy of human suffering that was world war two,” says Stephenson. “In the pages of Life, people discovered an inidual doing some good to make people feel better. The message of these photographs was essentially hopeful.”One wonders what Smith, a neurotic and notoriously combative character who saw photography as both an art form and a means of highlighting injustice and inequality, made of the media canonisation of Dr Ceriani. We do know that, having spent 23 days tracking the GP’s every move at close quarters and amassing hundreds of shots in the process, he was perhaps inevitably dissatisfied with the Life magazine layout, later saying: “I don’t really like hearing compliments about it. I have stopped looking at it because I see so many defects every time I look at it. It could have been done much better.”In the 70 years since, though, the Life spread has come to be revered as a well-nigh perfect meeting of images and words. Author and curator David Campany recalls seeing Smith’s prints in a London exhibition in the 1980s and, while appreciating “his sincerity and commitment”, found the work “a little overwrought”. In contrast, the Life photo essay still fascinates him.“It comprises 27 images and quite a lot of text so it is a much richer and more complex account than we get from the three or four of Smith’s photographs from the series that are now well known. We learn the doctor was something of a rebel, holding out as a general practitioner against forces of specialisation. That’s not immediately obvious from the photos but it’s important.”For his part, Dr Ceriani found the experience initially demanding but, as with everything else in his life, adapted to it remarkably quickly. Sometimes, as with the portrait of him striding across the field, Smith was not averse to choreographing the shoot for maximum dramatic effect. More often, he simply hovered at Ceriani’s shoulder, photographing him at work, on call, and occasionally relaxing with his family.“I never made a move that Gene wasn’t sitting there,” Ceriani recalled later. “I’d go to the john and he’d be waiting outside the door, so it would seem. He insisted that I call him when anything happened, regardless of whether it was day or night … He would always be present. He would always be in the shadows.”Dr Ceriani spent the rest of his working life in Kremmling. He died aged 72. His demanding vocation, which he considered ordinary, was captured for posterity and given the validation it deserved by Smith’s stark, inquiring gaze. One could argue, with hindsight, that Country Doctor had little impact politically, but it radically changed the nature of photographic storytelling in ways that resonate even more deeply in a time of global public health crisis.• Country Doctor can be found at magnumphotos."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b906532f8602a7f5abf12e26d1d333840805b267/0_0_15833_9500/master/15833.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a68795eb56a69757f1eb3d140098ef5b","title":"the best books childrens poetry audiobooks 2020","story":"Hilary Mantel’s trilogy was finished at last, Blake Gopnik exposed Warhol’s private life and Richard E Grant brought new life to Iris Murdoch.

The scale of payouts to customers forecast by Lloyd’s this year are equivalent to other big claims years for insurers, such as the aftermath of 911, when Lloyd’s paid out $4.7bn, and in 2017, when hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria caused widespread damage and loss, leading to $4.8bn in payouts.The insurance market estimates the industry will face underwriting losses this year of approximately $107bn due to Covid-19. In addition, insurers have seen a slump in the value of their investments which they use to pay claims, of about $96bn, creating a total loss for the industry of over $200bn.The Lloyd’s of London chief executive, John Neal, said the pandemic was an unparalleled event. “What makes Covid-19 unique is the not just the devastating continuing human and social impact, but also the economic shock.“Taking all those factors together will challenge the industry as never before, but we will keep focused on supporting our customers and continuing to pay claims over the weeks and months ahead.”Neal does not expect the underwriting floor at the firm’s headquarters to reopen before August.Bars, restaurants and nightclubs in the UK and other small businesses are pursuing legal action against the insurer Hiscox for non-payment of business interruption insurance after they were forced to close by the government shutdown.Lloyd’s is considering an initiative called “recover re” insurance, a reinsurance scheme that would offer cover “after the event” for businesses, to enable them to get back on their feet after a pandemic, including Covid-19."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2564e6d80cc9813f13c3307890ad4f956bb3c26b/0_167_5000_3002/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c3ddf56634463a87a282e0522805928","title":"us oil gas companies coronavirus relief loan ppp","story":"Recent review finds at least $50m in taxpayer-backed loans meant for small businesses have gone to fossil fuel industryAmerican oil and gas companies were often in financial trouble well before the coronavirus economic crisis, and now many are asking for taxpayer assistance to cushion their fall.Texas-based Battalion Oil, which recently changed its name from Halcón, has taken a $2.2m coronavirus relief loan, after going bankrupt twice within the last four years and facing accusations of excessive spending on an executive pay, private planes and luxury vehicles.Despite a history of financial woes, Battalion is receiving assistance under the paycheck protection program (PPP), the US government’s strategy for getting cash to small businesses so they can continue to pay workers during the coronavirus shutdown as part of a more than $2tn aid package. The company will not have to return the money if it spends it on approvable expenses, including payroll, rent and utilities.Many independent drillers were already mired in debt from chasing the fracking boom, according to analysts. They were finding it harder to secure investment and even facing bankruptcy.Other companies that analysts have flagged as having risky levels of debt have received loans too, including the Oklahoma-based Laredo Petroleum, which took a $1.2m payment. Laredo’s former CEO also lobbied the Trump administration to scrutinize what he saw as uncertainty in climate science. PDC Energy took a $10m payment but repaid it, citing new guidelines from the government.Oil and gas companies – even large ones – are not breaking any rules by taking the loans. But government oversight and environmental advocates, as well as Democratic lawmakers, are warning the payments are bad investments that will only prolong the lives of already-troubled companies, contribute to the climate crisis and eat into government assistance meant for mom-and-pop businesses and iniduals.A recent review by the  and the investigative research group Documented, found that at least $50m in taxpayer-backed coronavirus loans meant for small businesses have gone to the fossil fuel industry. That figure has since grown to at least $113m.Donald Trump in early April met with oil and gas industry representatives seeking government help during the crisis and since then, the aid has flowed. In addition to doling out PPP loans to fossil fuel companies, the government has expanded the Federal Reserve’s Main Street lending program in a way that could potentially help indebted independent oil and gas companies, including Occidental Petroleum Corporation, one of the companies that met with Trump.The Fed also plans to offer bond buybacks that could benefit at least 90 fossil fuel companies, including giants such as ExxonMobil, Chevron and Koch Industries – which are feeling the huge decrease in oil demand but are not expected to be hit as hard as smaller companies.One top Democrat – the House majority leader, Steny Hoyer – has endorsed purchasing oil to restock the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which other leaders in the party have resisted.The Democratic senators Brian Schatz and Sheldon Whitehouse in a letter to the Fed this week said the pandemic “was not the source of the oil and gas industry’s dire financial condition”, and that accommodating it “poses both a credit risk and a more profound climate transition risk to taxpayers”.Lawmakers in the House have proposed prohibiting the oil and gas industry from taking coronavirus funds to make sure “they are not used to pay off bad debt taken on by fossil fuel corporations before the public health crisis”.Government assistance to fossil fuel companies during the pandemic comes as scientists warn the world must stop extracting and burning coal, oil and gas to avoid the worst of the already-severe climate crisis.An activist investor last year accused Battalion of “excessive” spending, including on executive pay and a private plane used by its former CEO, Floyd Wilson.A company controlled by Wilson sold the plane – a Raytheon Hawker 800A – to Battalion for $2.4m, according to a regulatory filing. His contract also guaranteed his membership of a Houston country club and the use of a “late model luxury automobile valued at up to $100,000”.Wilson’s total compensation rose to $24m the year the company first filed for bankruptcy in 2016. He also received a $5m severance package when he stepped down in 2019.Battalion confirmed receiving the government coronavirus aid when queried by the  during an earnings call on Tuesday, after declining to disclose the loan’s value in recent regulatory filings.Battalion has 69 employees, and its market capitalization, or total value of its shares, is $74m, according to Bloomberg.Battalion saw the 12th biggest bankruptcy in its sector since 2015, according to Documented.The company isn’t alone in its debt problems in the sector. Seven North American exploration and production firms have declared bankruptcy just in 2020, according to the law firm Haynes and Boone.US drillers expanded immensely when they discovered hydraulic fracturing, a new technique for extracting oil and gas. Independent producers borrowed money to fund their exploits. But capital has begun to dry up as investors see the companies can’t make as much money as they hoped.Leslie Hayward, the director of business and content development at the analysis firm Rapidan Energy Group, said the outlook for US shale companies was bad before the pandemic and the recent steep decline in oil demand that forced oil prices negative.“The sector has been experiencing some strain for quite some time, and going into 2020 it was clear that there was going to be consolidation, a drop in production, and likely some bankruptcies. The pandemic poured gasoline on that fire,” Hayward said.Andrew Grant, the head of oil, gas and mining at Carbon Tracker – a thinktank that analyzes the impact of climate change on markets – said investors have begun to turn away from shale companies.“You have to wonder if trying to bail out the industry indefinitely would amount to just trying to defy gravity essentially,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bffa9e6254a4f58d22065649a532ebf68e2dacbc/0_164_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a7b5b520de79fd95d0275bc4b89fdbc","title":"china global leadership beijing coronavirus","story":"For years Beijing has spoken of its global leadership. As democratic states score Covid-19 own goals, that narrative is stronger than everWhen a new decade dawned a few short months ago, many predicted that the dominant theme would be China’s continued emergence and role in a world that was changing quickly. Few suspected that the rivalry and antagonism between China and the west would be framed by a global pandemic, and by the challenges – and opportunities – that it has offered to countries around the world, not least China itself.China was where Covid-19 struck first and it is where life is getting back to normal, albeit slowly. Manufacturing and production are rising, with factories open and starting to get back to similar levels to the second half of last year. Although fewer than three cases a day had been reported, alongside a handful of asymptomatic cases in the past two weeks, the emergence of a cluster of infections in Shulan, in north-east China, and the announcement that the entire population of Wuhan is to be tested in the coming days, show how nerves are still jangling about new waves of the disease. Still, data released by customs authorities last week shows that although there was a large decline in imports, exports rose year on year for the month of April – largely due to massive shipments of healthcare products.It is quite a turnaround. The catastrophic handling of the outbreak of coronavirus in Wuhan led to infections on a global scale. Many outside China wondered whether the failings of the authorities in Hubei province and beyond would lead to major political change in the country. Instead, we find Li Keqiang, the premier, telling us that “the virus is the common enemy of mankind” and saying that Chinese people are “willing to join hands with the people around the world” in an effort to defeat the disease.Not surprisingly, China is less keen to talk about what it got wrong than about what it is doing right: face masks, surgical gowns and ventilators have been distributed around the world, as we keep being reminded. China alone can’t supply a pandemic-gripped planet with ventilators, one industrial ministry official was quoted as saying in April. It wants to play the role of saviour, rather than villain.Control of that narrative is helped by the open goals provided by countries that have – or perhaps had – reputations for competence. In the UK, the prime minister missed crucial meetings, boasted about shaking hands before being infected and taken to intensive care. In the US, where infections are well past the million mark and the death toll is anticipated to double this month alone, the president has said “we have it under control”, urged citizens to “liberate” states that have locked down and recommended highly unusual areas of medical research as possible cures for the coronavirus.The high infection rates across many developed, democratic countries have helped ert the narrative away from China and its supposed “Chernobyl moment” to one of why democracies have performed so badly with the pandemic. It is a message that falls on fertile ground in many parts of the world. For example, the Saudi-owned Al Arabiya news station remarked that “China is the only country that has performed well in dealing with this crisis”. Solidarity in Europe “does not exist”, said Aleksandar Vučić, the president of Serbia, in an angry statement about import restrictions imposed by the European Union. “The only country that can help us is China,” he said.Such comments, made in the heat of the moment, can flatter to deceive – although China-watchers know how carefully Beijing has been cultivating its contacts in central and eastern Europe, including EU members, before the pandemic began. Likewise, the dispatch of medical equipment may well win short-term thanks, such as in Africa, where every country has received 100,000 masks (and more) from Chinese entrepreneur Jack Ma, but also strengthens the narrative of Chinese global leadership that has been articulated by Beijing in multiple countries, regions and formats for many years.It can be easy to over-emphasise the idends, as a report by a thinktank affiliated to the Ministry of State Security in Beijing reveals. Despite the efforts to win hearts and minds, for all the investment and focus on other parts of the world, global anti-China sentiment is at its highest point since 1989 and the Tiananmen Square protests, according to sources familiar with the report, which was presented to the country’s leadership. This has been led and fanned by the US. As a result, it warned, in the worst-case scenario, China needed to be ready for armed confrontation –\u0026nbspand for war.That too needs to be taken with a pinch of salt. Although the threat of military conflict is one that Chinese president Xi Jinping has repeatedly spoken about, this is best understood as being designed for domestic consumption and as a means of framing an economy that was slowing before Covid-19. In fact, successive defence white papers issued by the Chinese military have emphasised both the low risks of serious confrontation, and the awareness that tensions need to be understood and managed carefully.In that sense, the reference to the potential for military conflict (and the fact that this was leaked) is most usefully interpreted as a sign of deliberate messaging: China recognises that the situation is serious, febrile and dangerous. Donald Trump’s threat to seek “hundreds of billions” in compensation is less of a concern, especially in a presidential election year, than his comments that “we can do something much easier than that … we have ways of doing things a lot easier than that”. Even though Trump says many things that have to be retracted, clarified or dismissed, those words sounded ominous.Gathering reliable information from China has always been difficult and has become more so with the expulsion of highly experienced journalists in recent weeks. Decisions about how to understand, let alone respond to, China are being taken blind, the result of educated guesswork and wishful thinking. When Trump’s top Asia adviser made an eloquent speech in Mandarin in favour of pluralism, to mark the anniversary of the 4 May 1919 protests, it was met by excitable commentaries in the US suggesting it might seed a democratic political movement in China. Such thinking shows how much easier it is to see the patterns that westerners might want to see, rather than deal with the more prosaic realities.Ideological, political and security tensions between the US and China have a long history. But, as the distinguished scholar Evan Feigenbaum stresses, in the past coordination has been possible, not least economically, because of overlapping interests. Now the problem is that, for all China’s talk of global leadership, it is doing little to lead international collective action. Nor, for that matter, is the US, the EU or anyone else. And in our me-first world, where states put their interests first, and find collaboration either increasingly difficult or unpalatable, this indeterminacy could have very significant consequences for global affairs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08e7173a69c91f13b76df02c9036c03799d24937/0_2023_3333_2000/master/3333.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=45c997d05a24cb076e0b8206b82182e8","title":"everyones on top of you sneezing and coughing life inside irelands meat plants covid 19","story":"Workers share Covid-19 fears over lack of social distancing, crowded accommodation and being forced to buy their own PPEMarco* felt the phlegm gather heavily on his chest for five days before he called his local health centre and told them he worked at the meat plant. He was tested within hours – the result was positive.“One hundred per cent, I know I got it in the factory,” he says. “If the disease was in the animals, they’d have closed the place. But for workers, the factories can do what they want.”Marco is one of a number of workers who have contacted the  about conditions in some meat plants since the pandemic began. Speaking on condition of anonymity, workers in factories across Ireland and Northern Ireland say that not enough was done at the start of the outbreak to minimise their exposure, and that though some protective measures are now in place, they still don’t feel safe at work.For Marco, who has worked at the same factory for more than a decade, it’s too little, too late. “I felt frightened, “ he says. “The damage has been done.”Life as a meat plant worker is a low-wage, bloody business, workers told the . “It’s horrible killing cows, when you see how they do it,” says Florin*, a Romanian worker who has been employed in a meat plant in the Republic of Ireland for more than five years said. “They kill it – shoot it, cut the neck, cut the legs. I don’t like it. The cow is slow, an emotional thing. And you see the blood, and they go from being alive to being in pieces. That’s the way. When you see the conditions – it’s a dirty and nasty place, nobody is happy.” Temperatures in the factories can hover at 4C, with industrial ceiling fans that circulate cool air to keep the meat free of microbes. The job is repetitive and tough workers take painkillers to get through their shifts.Now countries across the world with industrialised meat supply chains are grappling with serious coronavirus outbreaks in meat and processed food plants. Official figures show that there have been outbreaks at 12 plants in the Republic of Ireland and 571 workers have tested positive. In Northern Ireland, union officials have raised serious concerns, and last week one worker died. Workers point to bottlenecks in toilets and washrooms the locker-rooms, where workers pile in before and after work and the canteens, where they gather to eat. The greatest risks are during eight-hour shifts on the factory floor where they work half a metre or less apart from colleagues on the production line.They say factories have not been making sure that workers had personal protective equipment, or abiding by social distancing guidelines. “There was no social distancing,” says Marco. “You had to go through areas where everyone was on top of themselves, sneezing and coughing.”“They didn’t give us masks or gloves. We had to buy our own,” said Florin. “People are scared, they say it’s not safe.”On top of the lack of safety equipment, the fact that migrants make up the vast majority of the workforce in the meat industry is also a problem, with many travelling from Timor-Leste, Lithuania, China, Poland, South Africa, Romania, Bulgaria and Brazil to work. Marco says that in his factory not enough information was given to non-English speakers about how they could keep themselves – and those around them – safe from infection.In general, migrant workers have settled well into Irish life. Pablo*, who was recruited from his home town in Africa, says he has always felt welcomed by local people. But in the factory, where he earns about €11.80 (£10.40) an hour, life is hard. Workers feel intimidated and vulnerable, and are unable to stand up for their legal rights, he says. “People are not being treated with dignity and respect.”Pablo says that until a few weeks ago, apart from posting government notices about Covid-19 on the walls, his factory didn’t put anything in place to protect its workers. “There was no checking of temperature, no masks, no 2-metre social distancing. When we asked for masks, they said no.” He says he he doesn’t feel safe at work, and is sure that he will get infected with the virus. “New workers are brought in to replace people who are out sick, but we don’t know if they’ve been screened.”Because of their low pay, many migrant workers live in communal houses and some have to share bedrooms. “They don’t feel safe, but they have to work,” says Adriana*, a Polish worker at a meat factory in Northern Ireland. There are perspex screens in parts of the factory and workers’ temperatures are now checked, but there is still no distancing inside the factory, and workers are afraid.Santos*, a Brazilian worker in a meat plant south of the border, says that many of his fellow workers have poor levels of English and aren’t aware of their rights, such as welfare support if they are sick. “If these people have the virus, who will help them? How will they get food?”Following his positive diagnosis for the virus, Marco is now recovering at home. He gets a weekly payment from the government, and he says his health is OK. But he wants an investigation into what has gone on in the meat factories. “I’m so angry – how can a government allow this? They forgot about us, they did not care. It’s shocking.”* Names have been changedWe want to hear from you about your experiences and stories from inside the farming industry. Please get in touch.

Here’s how to get it right It’s behind you! Look over your shoulder!No, it’s not panto season yet. It’s pandemic season (still). But the battle cry is the same. Time to stop fretting about when you can get your roots done and tidy your bookshelves because in the video-conferencing age, you win or lose according to your backdrop.With a Zoom parliament, a Houseparty social life and a Microsoft Teams meeting schedule, our lockdown lives are being played out against a backdrop of bookshelves and kitchen cupboards. The pandemic turns out to be a bit like living on the National Theatre set of a Harold Pinter play. Around now, we would usually be bombarded by red carpet images from Cannes instead, we’ve got Joe Wicks’s back garden and the stoutly furnished studies of MPs. A list of surprising lockdown winners – and unexpected losers – is emerging. Meryl Streep nailed a pitch-perfect performance in a virtual staging of Stephen Sondheim’s musical Company. In honour of the composer’s 90th birthday, Streep charmed everyone. It wasn’t just her earrings (vintage-looking, fabulous), her martini (the classy choice for heavy drinking, don’t @ me) and her bathrobe (bow down) but the bookshelves behind, bare save for a wooden duck of the generic seaside-gift-shop variety – less an objet, more an afterthought. No Oscars. No colour-coded books. So relatable. A quarantined audience fell in love with Streep all over again. Anna Wintour’s Zoom backdrop, by contrast, has not been as scrupulously curated as one would expect from one the most valuable personal brands in Manhattan. On the Vogue Instagram, the editor’s lockdown looks have been exacting, low-key chic: in her lush spring garden with an adorable dog, at her elegantly curated desk in tailored sweatpants. But hosting Vogue Conversations videos, or on Naomi Campbell’s YouTube channel, she is in sunglasses framed against a window with drawn curtains. Closed curtains and sunglasses in the middle of the day make for a shifty, motel-room-scene-in-a-heist-movie look, even in the Hamptons. It’s all wrong. What I want from Anna is a crystal vase of peonies, a Smythson notebook with a silk ribbon and a Diptyque candle.There is a good reason we are obsessed with backdrops. You have seen the faces – your colleagues, your favourite Pilates teacher, the Duchess of Cambridge – 1,000 times but you haven’t seen inside their homes. The pandemic has forced us to make our private spaces public. And what may have begun as a voyeuristic interest is morphing into something else as the potential “new normal” sees us spend much more time at home long term. Your house is no longer just your home. It’s your HQ. In the new world order, the bookcase and the gallery wall are king of the power Zoom. Both backdrops can bridge the gap between authentically homely and rigorously professional. If the ideal power backdrop was once the skyscraper skyline view from your glass-boxed top floor office, a wall of books or black-and-white photographs makes for a passable lockdown substitute – the same busy, masculine right angles, the same solidity. You don’t have an office filled with leather-bound reference tomes or a study lined with weighty hardback biographies? No problem – a sitting-room shelf of battered paperbacks will do, at a push. Messaging is about simplicity and clarity, as every politician knows (or so we used to assume).) A bookshelf backdrop is a visual reassurance – to your constituents, or your boss, or your tutor – that although you are at home you are working hard, not skiving.Assessing celebrity bookcases is a pandemic parlour game. The Twitter account Bookcase Credibility assesses backdrops with a pithiness to match Craig Revel Horwood on Strictly Come Dancing. On the Conservative politician Liam Fox: “The bold grab at credibility is somewhat undermined by the hardback copy of The Da Vinci Code.” Meanwhile, more visually oriented public figures recreate the same mood with a gallery wall, with lots of images of various sizes jigsawed together to create a pleasing but undistracting backdrop. One arresting arty image rarely works, especially if it’s a portrait – as Matt Hancock discovered, when a video shot in front of a Damien Hirst image of the Queen made him look as if he was photobombing a royal photocall. Just like live theatre – which, in a way, it is – the magic of the Zoom backdrop is in the potential for disaster. (Who can forget Prof Robert Kelly, upstaged by his daughter Marion?) There are shelves with a distracting number of books about Nazis. (I get that there’s nothing wrong with reading books about Nazis, it just looks odd to have them front and centre.) There is the rookie error of placing the laptop too low, framing your head in silhouette with an expanse of ceiling behind you. This gives the viewer the feeling that you are looming down threateningly on them, which is not great for a chat. There are pop stars who forget to make their beds before broadcasting to the world, as Charlie Puth did.Even fashion obsessives have taken to poring over decor, not dresses. When that Adele photo landed last week, my social media was full of comment – not about her weight loss, but the grey clapboard architecture and cutesy rose arbour, which one Twitter wit skewered as making her look like “a sorority treasurer about to marry into old money”. Marc Jacobs has, inevitably, the most fabulous Zoom look I’ve seen to date – red manicure popping against his yellow velvet sofa, wooden panelling oozing order and luxury.But the backdrop equivalent of the crisp white shirt is proving to be a serene, unadorned room with only a closed door and perhaps the edge of a framed picture in the background. A closed door makes you look like you are in serious, Do Not Disturb mode. Designers Marine Serre and Simone Rocha, on Zoom for the Vogue Conversations, each sat in a calm-looking room with a shut door behind. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge Zoom from a grey room with a white closed door with a lovely arch above it, which makes them look slightly holy. Am I reading too much into a Zoom backdrop?

Approaching his 50s, with a string of hair-raising injuries (he has been hospitalised eight times for concussion), and in recovery for alcohol and drug issues, Cassandro is having to wind down the high-impact part of his career. Now he’s doing more coaching, touring, media work and public appearances. (His tour stopover in London sees him wearing an outfit inspired by his heroine: “Lady Di.”) But the imminent end to his warrior-phase in the ring inspires real melancholy in Cassandro with fears about falling off the wagon.There are many shots of him schooling young people in various techniques, including the vital art of ing out of the ring. But there are also gloomy shots of him ruminating silently in his lonely, chaotic house.Losier’s previous documentary, The Ballad of Genesis and Lady Jaye, about artist Genesis P Orridge and their partner, Lady Jaye, looked at similar ideas connected with gender. This film is a erting study of Cassandro’s belief in himself as a dramatic, suffering character, in art as in life.I couldn’t help remembering Roland Barthes’ comments in his essay collection, Mythologies, about the wrestling bouts he witnessed in seedy Paris halls, with their cast of characters as fixed as those in the commedia dell’arte Barthes pondered the character of “Orsano (an effeminate teddy boy first seen in a blue and pink dressing gown) … a vindictive salope, or bitch …” Cassandro is gentler than that.• Cassandro, the Exotico! is available on Mubi from 18 May."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b542cba18a68ca5d9d22049d93565297b7424f50/217_132_2247_1348/master/2247.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eae48249973f5923d5104bfdb2f8566a","title":"matt damon ireland lockdown fairytale dublin leo varadkar covid 19","story":"Actor, who is staying near Dublin, says country’s leader Leo Varadkar is a ‘badass’ and he worries about lack of Covid-19 testing in USMatt Damon says lockdown in Ireland feels like a fairytale, that the country’s taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, is a “badass” and that he worries about returning to the United States because of inadequate testing for coronavirus.The actor has been staying with his family in Dalkey, a seaside village of south Dublin, since March after filming in Ireland for The Last Duel, directed by Ridley Scott, was shut down.Local radio station Spin 1038 scooped Irish media by nabbing an interview that must have brought smiles to Ireland’s tourism agency.“It feels like a fairytale. When I first came in, people were saying, ‘Well, Bono lives over there, Enya lives over there’,” said Damon. “It’s been incredible. This is one of the most beautiful places we’ve ever been. Obviously what’s going on in the world is horrible, but I’ve got my whole family I’m with my kids and we have teachers with us because we were planning on missing school for about eight weeks.“We’ve got what nobody else has, which is live human beings teaching our kids, so we feel guilty. We’ve got this set-up in this incredible place. It’s absolutely gorgeous. Even in the 2km lockdown, we’ve got trees, and woods and ocean. I can’t think of any place you’d rather be in a 2km radius of.”Damon called Varadkar “a badass” for returning to medical work during the pandemic. He said he was a “little worried” about returning to the US. “We don’t have adequate testing, so there’s going to be another surge it looks like back home.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2765aedad44aaa143024088f0be592e32cebfd6/0_295_8026_4819/master/8026.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca540228087fceeb007eed66b8f3c806","title":"how to make kimchi recipe felicity cloake masterclass","story":"How to make the Korean staple that conquered the worldLittle known outside Korea until relatively recently, this fiery fermented cabbage has taken the world by storm. Used more like a condiment than a side dish in its homeland, a little spicy cabbage peps up no end of dishes – plus it’s surprisingly easy to make and keeps for months. Which might just come in useful.Prep 25 min, plus salting timeCook None, but allow at least 5 days to fermentMakes 1 x 1-litre jar180g coarse salt, plus 2 tsp extra1 large cabbage – preferably a Chinese one, but any will do300g daikon or other radish1 large carrot3 spring onions4 garlic cloves4cm root ginger, peeled40g salted shrimp (saeu-jeot), finely chopped (optional)50g Korean red chilli flakes (gochugaru)1 tsp sugar2 tbsp fish sauce (optional)There are hundreds of types of kimchi using different vegetables, seasonings and even fruits this is a simplified version made with ingredients that should be fairly easy to get hold of locally or online. If you’d prefer to keep it vegetarian, or can’t find either dried shrimp or fish sauce, leave them out. Equally, other chilli flakes will do, if need be, though they’ll have a different flavour.Put a litre and a half of water into a saucepan with the salt, and put over a medium heat. Heat, stirring, until the salt has dissolved, then pour into a cold bowl and leave to cool while you prepare the cabbage. Some say that you should use non-chlorinated water, which for most of us will mean mineral water, but tap water works for me.While the brine is cooling, wash the cabbage and chop it lengthways into quarters. Carefully cut out and discard the woody core from each quarter (or save for veg stock), then, working across rather than along the leaves, cut the quarters into thick slices about 4cm wide, though it doesn’t matter if they’re a little bigger or smaller.Put the cabbage slices in a large bowl and pour over the cooled water, tossing so all the leaves come into contact with the brine. Leave to sit at room temperature, turning occasionally, until the tough white stems have wilted, which will probably take two to three hours.Wash and cut the radish and carrot into bite-sized cubes (if using small radishes, this may just be a question of cutting them in half). Sprinkle with two teaspoons of salt, leave to sit for half an hour, then drain. Wash and roughly chop the spring onion, using all but the toughest bit of the green part.Crush or finely chop the garlic, ginger and salted shrimp, if using (if not, you may wish to add a quarter-teaspoon of fine salt to make up for them). Put these in a bowl with the chilli flakes, sugar and fish sauce, if using, mix well and loosen with 150ml cold water.Rinse the cabbage very well under cold water, washing in between the leaves to get rid of any salt still clinging on, then drain thoroughly. Shake the leaves dry in a clean tea towel, then tip back into the large bowl. Pour in the seasoning and toss to coat – gloves are advisable if you use your hands.Spoon the kimchi into a clean jar, crock or pot, pressing it in very firmly to minimise the amount of air trapped between the leaves. As much of the cabbage as possible should be submerged in the liquid it emits, so you need to weight it down – a clean plastic bag full of cold water should do the trick – then seal the jar.Put the jar in a cool place out of direct sunlight for five days, checking on it and pushing it back down under the liquid as necessary (it will give off more as it sits), then taste it should be mildly tangy by this point. Once it’s sour enough for your taste, refrigerate it to pause the fermentation process, and consume at your leisure – it will keep for months."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32a8015073951d00a45d619e30e355e2dc56feee/0_1292_7819_4689/master/7819.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f452e4f07637582cb9a8d76593cf3a66","title":"its about time 10 meals that take 10 minutes and 10 that take 10 hours","story":"Whether you need a quick fix or have hours to while away, there is a delicious recipe for you.What you cook in lockdown can depend heavily on time. Some people suddenly have to feed multiple hungry mouths several times a day. Others have hours to while away and need a task absorbing enough to take their minds off the people and places they miss. Whichever camp you fall into, there are recipes here for you.Pea soupBettina Campolucci Bordi, a plant-based cookery writer, heats through 600g frozen peas with a little olive oil and a can of coconut milk, before blitzing until smooth. Divide between 2-3 bowls and serve with a dollop of yoghurt and fresh herbs.Pitta pan toastieOllie Templeton, of Carousel, London. fills a pitta (any bread would work) with cheese, salad leaves and sriracha, then toasts it in a heavy-based pan, with another pan on top to flatten it.Pasta with courgetteFelicity Cloake’s courgette carbonara is a thing of beauty. If you like the combo, another option is this pasta nerano by Robin Gill, of The Dairy, London. Cook 400g spaghetti to al dente – about eight minutes. Meanwhile, fry four medium courgettes sliced in rounds, in batches and in olive oil, until lightly browned. Sauté three sliced garlic cloves, add in the cooked pasta with a ladleful of the pasta water, then the courgettes and mix vigorously. Add a handful of grated provolone cheese and fresh basil, and mix until fully melted.Cornershop noodlesCarl Clarke, chef-founder of Chick ’n’ sours, London, says to boil a full kettle, and make an omelette with two seasoned eggs and some finely sliced spring onion, then slice into strips. Slice and fry on a high heat for a few minutes half an onion, a pepper (any colour) and a handful of button mushrooms. If you like, throw in some cubed tinned meat (Spam, ham, corned beef etc). Add 4cm sliced fresh ginger and four cloves of garlic, along with a handful of green leaves. Pour over 170ml boiling water and add half a packet of chicken-flavoured instant noodles, along with the packet seasoning, and cook until most of the water is absorbed. Add the omelette. In another bowl, mix together 1 tbsp curry powder, 3 tbsp soy sauce, 3 tbsp fish sauce, 1 tbsp rice wine or dry sherry, 1 tbsp sugar, 1 tbsp sesame oil and 2 tbsp cold water, and at the last moment, add to the noodles and stir. Garnish with sliced spring onion to serve.Chicken noodle soupFood writer Molly Wizenberg, meanwhile, has this even simpler chicken noodle hack (serves two), using tinned soup, vermicelli, egg and parmesan.Buckwheat noodle saladAs a post-home-schooling quick-fix for two, Nicholas Balfe of Salon, in Brixton, south London, says boil a full kettle then pour 1.5 litres into a saucepan on a high heat. Soft boil two eggs (six minutes – set a timer). Meanwhile, dress very thinly sliced carrot (use a peeler) with a pinch of salt and 50ml each of sesame oil and rice wine vinegar, some sesame seeds and some nori seaweed, cut up finely. In another bowl, season cucumber half-moons with 50ml soy sauce and a teaspoon of sugar. When cooked, plunge the eggs into cold water, then peel. In the reserved hot water, cook 250g buckwheat (soba) noodles according to the packet instructions (two to three minutes), then drain and rinse briefly. Divide the noodles between two bowls and place clusters of carrots, cucumber and protein (it could be shredded roast chicken, smoked fish, cubed silken tofu or red beans, seasoned with salt, lime zest and juice). Top each bowl with a halved egg, fresh herbs and toasted nuts, and serve with kimchi, pickles, andor hot sauce on the side.Spicy vegan bao bunsThese pineapple-glazed treats from chef Denai Moore (@dees_table) are reason enough to keep a packet of ready-made bao buns in the freezer … In a saucepan, mix 120ml pineapple juice, half a de-seeded scotch bonnet chilli (or a milder one if you prefer), two tablespoons each of coconut sugar and soy sauce, and two thinly sliced garlic cloves. Bring to the boil, then reduce for six to eight minutes until sticky and glossy. Meanwhile, slice 10 asparagus spears and 10 button mushrooms and fry in olive oil until caramelised and brown (four minutes) and season with a pinch of sea salt. Add the pineapple glaze, then remove from the heat, stirring to coat evenly. Microwave four frozen buns according to packet instructions, then fill with thinly sliced cucumber topped with the mushroom and the asparagus on top. Garnish with fresh herbs to serve.Eggs kagianaAsimakis Chaniotis, the Michelin-starred executive chef of Pied à Terre, London, says: grate three large tomatoes into a pan, over a medium heat. Stirring continuously, add in seven whisked eggs to form a thick paste. Season to taste with salt, pepper and oregano and pour into an overproof dish. Top with 200g crumbled feta and bake at 220C, until the cheese begins to caramelise. Serves 2-3.Chickpeas with feta and red onionMix a drained tin of chickpeas in a large bowl with a sliced red onion, 100g of feta cheese, cubed, a handful of cherry tomatoes, some chopped black olives and fresh basil. Drizzle with olive oil and a teaspoon of sherry vinegar, and season to taste. Tom Kitchin serves this with roast hake portions, which you can easily do in the same 10 minutes (season then pan fry, skin side down, for a couple of minutes then place in a 180C oven for four minutes more). Cheat’s chicken shawarmaAfter a long day, chefs Itamar Srulovich and Sarit Packer, of Honey and Co, London, often turn to this dish. Dice an onion and fry in a hot oily pan, add as much garlic and chilli as you want, dice a breast of chicken and toss it in, mixing until almost cooked. Then, they say, hit the spice rack: choose from baharat, Lebanese seven spice, ras el hanout, curry powder or a mix of cumin, paprika and a pinch of cinnamon with lots of black pepper. Serve with sliced tomato, flat breads and yoghurt. GumboThe night I spent meticulously following Sara Roahen’s recipe (live-chatting colour swatches with her to check my roux was asdone as it should be) is etched in my brain as the foundational culinary experience. I measured, dredged, sweated. There were times when I hallucinated … No wonder Matthew McConaughey pictures his father up in heaven in his pants, Miller Lite in hand, and a big pot of this southern wonder on the go. Read Roahen’s Gumbo Tales to get a taste …Roast porkThe Michelin-starred Andrew Wong’s char siu involves a six-hour marinade and lengthy oven roast followed by a six-hour steep in sugar syrup. For his pork shoulder, meanwhile, Ottolenghi makes a marinade with Szechuan pepper with citrus and pomegranate molasses and leaves the joint in the oven all night. Jane Baxter, by contrast, uses fewer aromatics, instead drying the meat overnight to ensure perfect crackling.Chocolate sourdoughIf you have spent the past six weeks of lockdown nursing a sourdough mother into bubbling life, take things up a notch and bake a chocolate-studded loaf. Sliced hot and slathered in mascarpone, it is enough to make anyone weep. There are several recipes online – Jennine Walker’s is simple Shiao-Ping on The Fresh Loaf gives more complete instructions.Pie artAs Lokokitchen’s Lauren Ko put it recently:“Don’t try this at home, kids. Or do because it will occupy you for approximately 469632154239 hours.” Ko has mastered the art of the geometric pie, an edible cross between string art and high-stakes tiling. Other decorative pie accounts to ogle at include Thida Bevington, Julie Jones and Jo Harrington. To start, get a hold of some rhubarb and a protractor, and make Bevington’s pink herringbone number.A Bake Off showstopperBaking will take as many hours as you can put in, really, as Kim-Joy’s two-tiered lavender lemon curd fox cake proves. The Spanische windtorte was one of 2015’s technical challenges: it will see you spooning oversized meringues, shaping fondant violets – replete with stamens – and piping Swiss meringue borders on it. So much sugar to get lost in.The 20-hour applesIn his 1999 reference tome, Desserts, the pastry chef and chocolatier, Pierre Hermé, gives a recipe – for the Melody cake – which is almost 10 pages long. One of the cake’s seven layers is comprised of wafer-thin apple slices slow-cooked in butter and sugar for 10 hours, then rested in the fridge for 10 more.MufulettaThis only takes 10 minutes to prepare – but it’s the overnight press in the fridge that makes it sing. You gouge out a boule of bread, then fill it up with layers of deli meat, cheese, salad and pickles. Put the lid, as it were, back on, wrap tight in clingfilm and foil, then weigh down with something mighty heavy. Just the kind of celebratory door-stopper you will need once we’re allowed to spend the day picnicking in the sun.Cure some egg yolks (they make superbly savoury rice toppings) and make candied fruit. You can glacé wedges of citron, slices of orange, halved and stoned stone fruit, stalk-on cherries, whole clementines or even a pineapple with its crown intact. To be sure, it is the very definition of non-essential cooking. But what with the wildly protracted escapist prep time, the glistening jewel-like hues and the luxe touch even the smallest sliver gives whatever you pop it on, making a batch of fruits confits truly is a kind of holiday. Arrange in old-school muffin cases under cellophane wrappers with little gold ties, and pretend it’s August in Aix-en-Provence.

Rovers went to Anfield on 14 May but ended up losing 2-1 against Liverpool. Fans in the away end were left hoping Alex Ferguson’s side would be denied by West Ham.The game at Upton Park ended in a draw to hand Rovers the title in one of the most dramatic finishes to a season in the English top flight. The triumph completed the transformation, led by Jack Walker – a local businessman who bankrolled the club – and manager Kenny Dalglish, from small-town club to champions of England.Twenty-five years since the historic triumph we speak to some of those who were at Anfield that historic day and one who wasn’t.Kenny Dalglish was meticulous in everything he did, recruitment, tactics, scouting the opposition. He personally rang about 10 different people about my character and temperament before signing me. He would sometimes join in at training and at 44 he was still sometimes the best player we had!At Anfield it was such a weird atmosphere. I remember being at the Kop end when Alan Shearer scored in the first half and all the Liverpool fans cheered as they didn’t want United to win the league. When things went silent in the second half I thought we had blown it. When Jamie Redknapp scored the winner and I landed on the deck I thought we’d lost it. But within a few seconds our fans got news from West Ham. Kenny was so superstitious he didn’t even organise a party. We didn’t want to go out in Manchester so we went to somewhere called “Bistro French” in Preston. They cleared the tables and a band came on playing Buddy Holly tunes.Jack Walker put on a parade around Blackburn the next day. He was the most down-to-earth geezer. You would never know he was worth anything. I called him Mr Walker the first time I met him and he said: “Don’t call me that. Call me Jack.” He would come in the dressing room every single match, before and after, win, lose or draw to talk to us and would never get the hump. He would play “Penny Up the Wall” with all the players for £20 a pop and would never lose.That Rovers team was full of leaders. There was an edge, all the time, people would get angry if mistakes were made. The training sessions were immensely physical and there was no hiding place. It was sometimes harder than the games, even on a Friday. The winning mentality was there for all to see.My cruciate injury in April was devastating. Now the recovery is routine but back then these injuries were finishing careers. I was 23 and in a knee brace at Anfield but had travelled on the team bus and was in the dressing room beforehand. I watched the game from the dugout, which is really tight at Liverpool and my leg was all squashed. All the Liverpool fans were keeping us updated on the United score. We tried to block it all out but it was impossible. When the final whistle finally blew it took forever for me to get on the pitch but I threw my crutches away and managed it.With Kenny as manager, being the legend he was, winning it at Anfield was surreal. The way the Liverpool fans were was special but it was a mixed day for me because of the injury: I felt angry, sorry for myself but also delighted and proud. I nearly didn’t pick up a medal as I didn’t think I deserved one but Kenny and Tim Sherwood gave me a bit of a rollicking and made me pick one up.Tim was fundamental to us winning it, especially after David Batty’s injury. He was a hard guy, a brutally honest, understated, undervalued player, despite being captain. But he also had real courage on the ball in tight situations,was a tough tackler and got into the box, often got beyond the strikers. Him and Mark Atkins were superb in central midfield, another player who never gets mentioned but scored some really important goals.My dad is from Darwen and the reason I support Rovers. I have loads of family who still live up on Blackburn Road. We went to Wembley to watch them beat Leicester to get promoted to the Premier League in 1992 but this was on a different level. I’ll never, ever forget watching on TV. I was in the lounge with my best friend, my dad and another friend, who was a United fan. I remember watching Kenny Dalglish looking completely lost on the sidelines, like he was standing on the side of a motorway. We all felt the same.At the final whistle my dad went absolutely nuts. He threw and smashed the Sky remote against the wall in excitement. My mum stormed in to tell him off because my other mate was upset, the United fan. But he wasn’t having it and screamed: “Lynne, I don’t fucking care. Rovers have won the league!” That is etched into my memory and will be until the day I die. Football has been the greatest thing I share with my dad and our team winning the league is one of the high points of my life. Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen - The last day of that season was a huge day for Sky Sports. It was the first time we had two games broadcast simultaneously but our Anfield buildup was completely ruined by the live FA Trophy final overrunning by about 45 minutes, with extra time causing chaos. It was my team, Woking, that scored the winner, so I was hopping around on the gantry when the Liverpool and Blackburn teams were read out.It was a massive day for Blackburn and for Dalglish, who had only left Liverpool in 1991. When Redknapp scored I hadn’t heard about the United result but the Blackburn supporters’ reaction told us something. I had a moment to ponder the consequences and Andy Gray took the lead. He was always spot-on in those situations.Our reporter Nick Collins spoke to Kenny after the match. All season, Kenny had given Nick cautious answers about taking it one game at a time. So after the match they swapped roles and Kenny played the interviewer to Nick, who gave him drab answers, even though both were laughing. It was a lovely moment. I can’t imagine what the whole day must have meant to Kenny, the only Premier League title ceremony there has been at Anfield.I’m 83 and first started going to watch Rovers in 1946. I’ve been a season-ticket holder for decades. We believed Jack Walker was putting Blackburn back where they should be. Shearer was magic, wasn’t he? And Sherwood held the thing together. We’ve been down a bit since Jack died but we’re on the up again and don’t need too much more to get us back in the Premier League."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74d63773aa3aee4e6c68c4c27c4f6cb8d87ba4c7/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8196be96a7e70f7be3a55cfe64cb7033","title":"chelsea and juventus open talks over pjanic jorginho swap deal","story":"Juventus and Chelsea have begun negotiations about a possible summer swap deal involving Miralem Pjanic and Jorginho.

The 30-year-old Pjanic, who has been at Juve since 2016, could potentially have ended up at Barça in a swap involving Arthur but the Brazilian decided to stay in Catalonia. The PSG sporting director, Leonardo, is a huge admirer of Pjanic.Arthur’s decision meant Juventus stepped up negotiations with Chelsea to see whether they would consider letting Jorginho go. The midfielder joined the west London club two years ago, in the same summer as Sarri, and after a difficult first season has become one of Chelsea’s best performers.Paradoxically, the improvement in form came after Sarri left for Juventus and was replaced by Frank Lampard.

Why can’t we just wait sort of a month or so to see if things go to plan?”Murray said the long, in-depth call was mainly focused on the first phase of returning to the training grounds on a physical-distancing level. The 36-year-old believes most players are “pretty happy” with phase one but, given the variety of inidual situations, believes “there is a little bit of reluctance in certain pockets of players” to move to phase two.“When I say some players may be reluctant to return, I don’t want that to be perceived as sort of this snowflake mentality and ‘we’re worried about ourselves’ because I don’t think that’s the case at all,” he said.“It’s more about the people that we’re going home to that we’re worried about and, like I say, everyone’s in different situations and have different people at home with possible illnesses or pregnancies or children, young newborns. We just need to take everyone’s situations into consideration.”When it was put to Murray that the phasing is in place for a gradual return to action, he said: “Yeah it is, but what’s the point in getting halfway through the phase and stopping? Why not see how the country deal with softening the lockdown first before we even think about starting unnecessary sport when people are dying all around us and the death rates are still high?”The league hopes to get the backing of clubs for its plans at a shareholders’ meeting on Monday, after seeing the Bundesliga kick-off over the coming weekend - the first of Europe’s main leagues to resume“Obviously we’re all going to be watching the Bundesliga because it’s football and we all love football,” Murray said. “It’ll be nice to see a live sport on TV without doubt. But I think what we’re not taking into consideration is that Germany have only had seven, eight thousand deaths, I think, and they’ve got 20 million more people than us.“We’re up to like 34,000 now - we’re the worst hit in Europe. No one seems to take that in consideration.”"},{"url":null,"title":"did you meet via guardian soulmates","story":"We want to hear from couples who met via the  dating serviceWith thousands of people introduced to one another, weddings that have taken place and families created, we want to hear from couples who met via  Soulmates.If you met your partner on  Soulmates, we’d like to hear from you.

Here are expert tips for how to get it organised – and what you should never put in thereDo not feel guilty if you neglect your freezer. It happens to the best of us. “I don’t think I cleaned ours at home in a year until lockdown,” confesses Nina Matsunaga, the chef-owner at the Black Bull Inn in Sedbergh, Cumbria. “We do our work freezer every couple of days.”You can work productively with whatever you have, from giant chest freezers to single compartments in small fridges. All sub-zero space is useful. But how many of us know how best to utilise what in her book The Ice Kitchen Shivi Ramoutar describes as an “unfashionable” preservation method? What freezes well? What doesn’t? How do you manage those icy depths? We asked the experts.Freezing produces structurally damaging ice-crystals. Slow freezing produces bigger crystals. Therefore, “drier” ingredients freeze best. Peas thrive at -18C, while berry fruits turn to mush as they defrost. If you are making jam that is fine but freezing can ruin less flexible foods.For instance, the Michelin-starred chef Tom Kerridge, owner of the Butcher’s Tap butcher in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, warns against freezing prime cuts – even high-grade, dry-aged beef – and particularly cheaper, watery steaks: “The muscle fibres get stretched and when it defrosts water comes out and that steak’s juiciness becomes insipid. You’ve broken its body.”Exposed to freezing air, loosely wrapped foods become dry, icy and corroded – so-called “freezer burn”. To avoid that, place food in reusable silicone pouches or heavy plastic food bags, push as much air out as you can, and seal. Freeze each pack laid flat at first to minimise ice crystals. “Flat surface areas freeze quicker,” says Dan McGeorge, the head chef at Rothay Manor, Cumbria, which also allows you to arrange your freezer like a filing cabinet.We tend to dump stuff in freezers where it sits for years, unlabelled and unidentifiable. Avoid that by labelling your flattish packs of rice, soups, sauces, shredded meat, chopped vegetables etc top right and storing them upright in a freezer drawer like files, rotating the oldest to the front. “You just riffle through to find the right pack and pull it out,” says Lulu Grimes, the managing editor of BBC Good Food.Ramoutar’s labels include the date the food was frozen (her general rule is to use everything within three to six months) and: “How I reheat it, so H for hob, O for oven, a temperature and time.” You can buy special freezer labels, but paper, pen and sticky tape works. Avoid washable markers that rub off easily.Tip! From bacon rashers to egg whites, portion food into identifiable, user-friendly quantities. “Don’t freeze berries, sausages or meatballs in blocks,” advises Si Toft, the chef-owner at the the Dining Room in Abersoch, Gwynedd. “Lay them on greaseproof paper, freeze for two hours, then bag them and take out inidual handfuls.”Very little gets a flat no. Defrosted boiled eggs and raw potatoes are grim, however, and raw egg yolks go rubbery. “Whisk them slightly and add a stabiliser – salt or sugar, depending on what you’re doing with them,” suggests Ramoutar.Generally, this is a question of preparation and end use. Can you be bothered to protect a food’s textural integrity and will that matter? Deseeded, salted, sliced, rinsed, dried and frozen cucumber makes lovely crunchy batons for dips, but that is a lot of graft. Conversely, soft herbs that turn into dark mulch as they defrost taste fine in soups and sauces – as do finely chopped vegetables. Large pieces of raw vegetable become spongy in the freezer, which will not enhance your Sunday roast. Cook before freezing for a better result.Broadly, if you are going to blitz it later, if you just need the flavour and not the mouthfeel, you can freeze anything. But blanching soft herbs and vegetables – submerge briefly in boiling water, plunge them into ice, dry them thoroughly – helps to retain colour and flavour.Milk, yes. Cheese is complicated. “I don’t recommend it,” says Dan Bliss of the cheesemonger Paxton \u0026amp Whitfield. “The moisture and fat splits. Defrosted cheese has a weird texture. But avoiding food waste is close to my heart. Hard, mature cheeses and firm blues freeze better – they are fine in a toastie, and you get amazing pockets of molten cheese in scones when you add grated frozen cheese to the mix. With soft cheeses, make lasagne or sauces and freeze those.”Historically, “fresh” fish was regularly frozen at sea and defrosted for sale, which meant you could not freeze it at home without cooking it first (on the basis that you should not refreeze defrosted food). That is no longer always true. Ask your fishmonger for guidance or check the label, which may explain: “This product was previously frozen and has been restored to chill temperature under carefully controlled conditions. It is still suitable for home freezing.”Molnar dislikes freezing seafood – although, interestingly, freezing helps to tenderise fresh squid and octopus – but, carefully separated and wrapped, scallops work well: “Stacked like a packet of Rolos.”If you want them to look great, yes. If you just need flavour, no. Soft herbs can be blitzed and frozen in cream or oil, and you don’t need to carry a vast array of fresh spices to make curry. “I freeze whole spices to keep them fresh: tamarind paste, curry leaves, blitzed ginger, garlic and whole fresh turmeric, which I grate when needed,” says Sumayya Usmani, a Pakistani food expert and owner of Glasgow’s Kaleyard Cook School.Ramoutar makes no-cook, soft-set freezer jam (“Blitz fruit, sugar and a little citrus and pop it in”) and Carl Clarke, the chef-founder at Chick ‘n’ Sours, London, creates instant ice-cream by freezing, for example, bananas, dark chocolate, peanut butter and coconut yoghurt and combining them in a powerful, Nutribullet-style blender.“Professionally, I’m not keen,” says Kerridge. Indeed, most chefs use the freezer as a tool for meat rather than for storage. If you want perfectly cubed pancetta or incredibly thin beef for carpaccio, firm the meat by freezing it for 30 minutes, then slice it. James Cochran, the head chef at 12:51 restaurant in London, uses a Microplane to grate frozen beef on to poached eggs (“like fancy tartare”) and bone marrow into mash, “like parmesan, to add umami”.Kerridge is more open to freezing meat at home – “cured meats work fine” – and in braises, curries or stews, where the sauce is the main flavour, it will be impossible to detect if the beef shin, ham hock or chicken breasts used were frozen. “Packet chicken breasts are just protein which takes on the flavour of whatever they are cooked in,” he says.It certainly lends itself to cool hacks (sorry). Chilling layers of a celebration cake makes them less fragile as you trim and level them, but also, says Rachel Stockley, the head chef at Baratxuri in Ramsbottom, Bury, if you freeze the icing as you complete each layer it produces a smooth, hard finish, so the cake “sits in those even layers the pros get”. After glazing sausage rolls and pies, Andy Waugh, of Mac and Wild, London, freezes them for 30 minutes and repeats that before cooking: “It gives you an extra-lush finish.” The freezer will even save wedges of dry fruit cake, advises Scott Paton, the head chef at Boringdon Hall, Devon: “The fruit plumps up and makes the cake moist.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/caa313ea1c48ebd22686fbc34e8809b4dd8eb515/0_0_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=8e77a9a6fc2e9e489b482dad52bde40e","title":"the greatest uk no 1s ever no 17 kylie minogue cant get you out of my head","story":"This perfect fusion of hypnotic dance pulses with melodic majesty and is a global smash that even the anti-pop brigade can enjoyLast month, Kylie Minogue shared on Instagram a viral video of a dog, eyes closed in blissful repose, nodding along to its favourite song. The tune in question was Minogue’s 2001 classic Can’t Get You Out of My Head, a minimalist, timeless smash that, as the dog’s reaction clearly shows, affects the head as adeptly as the feet. A global No 1 that even the anti-pop brigade can enjoy, it is both the sweaty highlight of any wedding reception dancefloor and the crux of an argument in Words and Music, a gloriously verbose book by critic Paul Morley in which he calls it an example of pop’s “occasional odd shine of mind-changing art”.Written by then semi-retired pop star Cathy Dennis and the former Mud guitarist Rob Davis, it was initially offered to S Club 7. Quite rightly, their manager Simon Fuller rejected it, before it was rejected again, more surprisingly, by Sophie Ellis-Bextor. It took Kylie 20 seconds of listening to the demo for her to realise the track was special. And what an opening 20 seconds it is: straight out of the gate there is that pulsating, unnervingly timeless bass line, instantly recalling electronic pioneers such as Kraftwerk and New Order (Kylie performed the song’s bootleg mashup with Blue Monday at the Brits in 2002, arriving on a giant CD) before the chorus arrives earlier than expected on a hypnotic flurry of “la, la, las”. (Also of note: the oft-ignored meandering organ flurries that lurk behind the verses, subtly massaging the song’s forward momentum.)Preferring constant shape-shifting and delayed gratification (the title line and the “la, la, la” chorus only coalesce, brilliantly, in the song’s final 30 seconds) over traditional verse-chorus-verse structure, Can’t Get You Out of My Head is the perfect fusion of dance music’s hypnotic pulse and the melodic majesty of pop. It’s also surprisingly mid-tempo, giving it the eerie sensation of always being slightly slower than you remember it, almost as if the memories she sings about are fading.Despite the song’s near fatal brush with S Club 7, this was always a Kylie classic in the making. Blessed with the perfect pop voice, she delivers each line with just enough blank space for the listener’s own interpretations. Is it about a crush? A recent heartbreak? Does the person Minogue is singing about know about the obsession? What is the dark secret she is harbouring? Even those infamous “la, la, las” take on several functions, catalysing an irresistible earworm, a delirious, dancefloor-ready singalong moment and a distraction mechanism for the recently brokenhearted.If 2000’s more straightforward Spinning Around rightfully brought Kylie back to pop’s top table after a few years lost in indie, then Can’t Get You Out of My Head – complete with its sleek, retro-futuristic video of robotic dance moves and fashion-forward hoodies – elevated her to a new level of pop-culture ubiquity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87d1b316c71d49e6b6e72e44e2e08f529fc33bc9/0_31_2121_1273/master/2121.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d198210d47ff3dda326051babdc9c7b","title":"naomi klein how big tech plans to profit from coronavirus pandemic","story":"As the coronavirus continues to kill thousands each day, tech companies are seizing the opportunity to extend their reach and power. By  Naomi KleinFor a few fleeting moments during the New York governor Andrew Cuomo’s daily coronavirus briefing on Wednesday 6 May, the sombre grimace that has filled our screens for weeks was briefly replaced by something resembling a smile.“We are ready, we’re all-in,” the governor gushed. “We are New Yorkers, so we’re aggressive about it, we’re ambitious about it … We realise that change is not only imminent, but it can actually be a friend if done the right way.”The inspiration for these uncharacteristically good vibes was a video visit from the former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, who joined the governor’s briefing to announce that he will be heading up a panel to reimagine New York state’s post-Covid reality, with an emphasis on permanently integrating technology into every aspect of civic life.“The first priorities of what we’re trying to do,” Schmidt said, “are focused on telehealth, remote learning, and broadband … We need to look for solutions that can be presented now, and accelerated, and use technology to make things better.” Lest there be any doubt that the former Google chair’s goals were purely benevolent, his video background featured a framed pair of golden angel wings.It has taken some time to gel, but something resembling a coherent pandemic shock doctrine is beginning to emerge. Call it the Screen New Deal. Far more hi-tech than anything we have seen during previous disasters, the future that is being rushed into being as the bodies still pile up treats our past weeks of physical isolation not as a painful necessity to save lives, but as a living laboratory for a permanent – and highly profitable – no-touch future.Anuja Sonalker, the CEO of Steer Tech, a Maryland-based company selling self-parking technology, recently summed up the new virus-personalised pitch. “There has been a distinct warming up to humanless, contactless technology,” she said. “Humans are biohazards, machines are not.”It’s a future in which our homes are never again exclusively personal spaces, but are also, via high-speed digital connectivity, our schools, our doctor’s offices, our gyms, and, if determined by the state, our jails. Of course, for many of us, those same homes were already turning into our never-off workplaces and our primary entertainment venues before the pandemic, and surveillance incarceration “in the community” was already booming. But in the future that is hastily being constructed, all of these trends are poised for a warp-speed acceleration.This is a future in which, for the privileged, almost everything is home delivered, either virtually via streaming and cloud technology, or physically via driverless vehicle or drone, then screen “shared” on a mediated platform. It’s a future that employs far fewer teachers, doctors and drivers. It accepts no cash or credit cards (under guise of virus control), and has skeletal mass transit and far less live art. It’s a future that claims to be run on “artificial intelligence”, but is actually held together by tens of millions of anonymous workers tucked away in warehouses, data centres, content-moderation mills, electronic sweatshops, lithium mines, industrial farms, meat-processing plants and prisons, where they are left unprotected from disease and hyper-exploitation. It’s a future in which our every move, our every word, our every relationship is trackable, traceable and data-mineable by unprecedented collaborations between government and tech giants.If all of this sounds familiar, it’s because, pre-Covid, this precise app-driven, gig-fuelled future was being sold to us in the name of friction-free convenience and personalisation. But many of us had concerns. About the security, quality and inequity of telehealth and online classrooms. About driverless cars mowing down pedestrians and drones smashing packages (and people). About location tracking and cash-free commerce obliterating our privacy and entrenching racial and gender discrimination. About unscrupulous social media platforms poisoning our information ecology and our kids’ mental health. About “smart cities” filled with sensors supplanting local government. About the good jobs these technologies wiped out. About the bad jobs they mass produced.And most of all, we had concerns about the democracy-threatening wealth and power accumulated by a handful of tech companies that are masters of abdication – eschewing all responsibility for the wreckage left behind in the fields they now dominate, whether media, retail or transportation.That was the ancient past, also known as February. Today, a great many of those well-founded concerns are being swept away by a tidal wave of panic, and this warmed-over dystopia is going through a rush-job rebranding. Now, against a harrowing backdrop of mass death, it is being sold to us on the dubious promise that these technologies are the only possible way to pandemic-proof our lives, the indispensable keys to keeping ourselves and our loved ones safe.Thanks to Cuomo and his various billionaire partnerships (including one with Michael Bloomberg for testing and tracing), New York state is being positioned as the gleaming showroom for this grim future – but the ambitions reach far beyond the borders of any one state or country.And at the dead centre of it all is Eric Schmidt.Well before Americans understood the threat of Covid-19, Schmidt had been on an aggressive lobbying and public-relations campaign, pushing precisely the Black Mirror vision of society that Cuomo has just empowered him to build. At the heart of this vision is seamless integration of government with a handful of Silicon Valley giants – with public schools, hospitals, doctor’s offices, police and military all outsourcing (at a high cost) many of their core functions to private tech companies.It’s a vision Schmidt has been advancing in his roles as chair of the Defense Innovation Board, which advises the US Department of Defense on increased use of artificial intelligence in the military, and as chair of the powerful National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, or NSCAI, which advises Congress on “advances in artificial intelligence, related machine learning developments and associated technologies”, with the goal of addressing “the national and economic security needs of the United States, including economic risk”. Both boards are crowded with powerful Silicon Valley CEOs and top executives from companies including Oracle, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook and of course, Schmidt’s former colleagues at Google.As chair, Schmidt – who still holds more than $5.3bn in shares of Alphabet (Google’s parent company), as well as large investments in other tech firms – has essentially been running a Washington-based shakedown on behalf of Silicon Valley. The main purpose of the two boards is to call for exponential increases in government spending on research into artificial intelligence and on tech-enabling infrastructure such as 5G – investments that would directly benefit the companies in which Schmidt and other members of these boards have extensive holdings.First in closed-door presentations to lawmakers, and later in public-facing opinion articles and interviews, the thrust of Schmidt’s argument has been that since the Chinese government is willing to spend limitless public money building the infrastructure of high-tech surveillance, while allowing Chinese tech companies such as Alibaba, Baidu and Huawei to pocket the profits from commercial applications, the US’s dominant position in the global economy is on the precipice of collapsing.The Electronic Privacy Information Center (Epic) recently got access, through a freedom of information (FOI) request, to a presentation made by Schmidt’s NSCAI in May 2019. Its slides make a series of alarmist claims about how China’s relatively lax regulatory infrastructure and its bottomless appetite for surveillance are causing it to pull ahead of the US in a number of fields, including “AI for medical diagnosis”, autonomous vehicles, digital infrastructure, “smart cities”, ride-sharing and cashless commerce.The reasons given for China’s competitive edge are myriad, ranging from the sheer volume of consumers who shop online “the lack of legacy banking systems in China”, which has allowed it to leapfrog over cash and credit cards and unleash “a huge e-commerce and digital services market” using digital payments and a severe doctor shortage, which has led the government to work closely with tech companies such as Tencent to use AI for “predictive” medicine. The slides note that in China, tech companies “have the authority to quickly clear regulatory barriers, while American initiatives are mired in HIPPA compliance and FDA approval”.More than any other factor, however, the NSCAI points to China’s willingness to embrace public-private partnerships in mass surveillance and data collection as a reason for its competitive edge. The presentation touts China’s “Explicit government support and involvement eg facial recognition deployment”. It argues that “surveillance is one of the ‘first-and-best customers’ for Al” and further, that “mass surveillance is a killer application for deep learning”.A slide titled “State Datasets: Surveillance  Smart Cities” notes that China, along with Google’s main Chinese competitor, Alibaba, are racing ahead.This is notable because Google’s parent company, Alphabet, has been pushing this precise vision through its Sidewalk Labs ision, choosing a large portion of Toronto’s waterfront as its “smart city” prototype. But the Toronto project was just shut down after two years of ceaseless controversy relating to the enormous amounts of personal data that Alphabet would collect, a lack of privacy protections, and questionable benefits for the city as a whole.Five months after this presentation, in November, NSCAI issued an interim report to Congress further raising the alarm about the need for the US to match China’s adaptation of these controversial technologies. “We are in a strategic competition,” states the report, obtained via FOI by Epic. “AI will be at the centre. The future of our national security and economy are at stake.”By late February, Schmidt was taking his campaign to the public, perhaps understanding that the budget increases his board was calling for could not be approved without a great deal more buy-in. In a New York Times article headlined “I used to Run Google. Silicon Valley Could Lose to China”, Schmidt called for “unprecedented partnerships between government and industry” and, once again sounding the yellow peril alarm, wrote:“AI will open new frontiers in everything from biotechnology to banking, and it is also a defense department priority … If current trends continue, China’s overall investments in research and development are expected to surpass those of the United States within 10 years, around the same time its economy is projected to become larger than ours.Unless these trends change, in the 2030s we will be competing with a country that has a bigger economy, more research and development investments, better research, wider deployment of new technologies and stronger computing infrastructure … Ultimately, the Chinese are competing to become the world’s leading innovators, and the United States is not playing to win.”The only solution, for Schmidt, was a gush of public money. Praising the White House for requesting a doubling of research funding in AI and quantum information science, he wrote: “We should plan to double funding in those fields again as we build institutional capacity in labs and research centres … At the same time, Congress should meet the president’s request for the highest level of defence R \u0026amp D funding in over 70 years, and the defense department should capitalise on that resource surge to build breakthrough capabilities in AI, quantum, hypersonics and other priority technology areas.”That was exactly two weeks before the coronavirus outbreak was declared a pandemic, and there was no mention that a goal of this vast, hi-tech expansion was to protect American health. Only that it was necessary to avoid being outcompeted by China. But, of course, that would soon change.In the two months since, Schmidt has put these pre-existing demands – for massive public expenditures on high-tech research and infrastructure, for a slew of “public-private partnerships” in AI, and for the loosening of myriad privacy and safety protections – through an aggressive rebranding exercise. Now all of these measures (and more) are being sold to the public as our only possible hope of protecting ourselves from a novel virus that will be with us for years to come.And the tech companies to which Schmidt has deep ties, and which populate the influential advisory boards he chairs, have all repositioned themselves as benevolent protectors of public health and munificent champions of “everyday hero” essential workers (many of whom, like delivery drivers, would lose their jobs if these companies get their way). Less than two weeks into New York state’s lockdown, Schmidt wrote an article for the Wall Street Journal that both set the new tone and made clear that Silicon Valley had every intention of leveraging the crisis for a permanent transformation.“Like other Americans, technologists are trying to do their part to support the front-line pandemic response …But every American should be asking where we want the nation to be when the Covid-19 pandemic is over. How could the emerging technologies being deployed in the current crisis propel us into a better future? … Companies like Amazon know how to supply and distribute efficiently. They will need to provide services and advice to government officials who lack the computing systems and expertise.We should also accelerate the trend toward remote learning, which is being tested today as never before. Online, there is no requirement of proximity, which allows students to get instruction from the best teachers, no matter what school district they reside in …The need for fast, large-scale experimentation will also accelerate the biotech revolution … Finally, the country is long overdue for a real digital infrastructure … If we are to build a future economy and education system based on tele-everything, we need a fully connected population and ultrafast infrastructure. The government must make a massive investment – perhaps as part of a stimulus package – to convert the nation’s digital infrastructure to cloud-based platforms and link them with a 5G network.”Indeed, Schmidt has been relentless in pursuing this vision. Two weeks after that article appeared, he described the ad-hoc home schooling programming that teachers and families across the country had been forced to cobble together during this public health emergency as “a massive experiment in remote learning”.The goal of this experiment, he said, was “trying to find out: how do kids learn remotely? And with that data we should be able to build better remote and distance learning tools which, when combined with the teacher … will help kids learn better.” During this same video call, hosted by the Economic Club of New York, Schmidt also called for more telehealth, more 5G, more digital commerce and the rest of the preexisting wish list. All in the name of fighting the virus.His most telling comment, however, was this: “The benefit of these corporations, which we love to malign, in terms of the ability to communicate, the ability to deal with health, the ability to get information, is profound. Think about what your life would be like in America without Amazon.” He added that people should “be a little bit grateful that these companies got the capital, did the investment, built the tools that we’re using now, and have really helped us out”.Schmidt’s words are a reminder that until very recently, public pushback against these companies was surging. Presidential candidates were openly discussing breaking up big tech. Amazon was forced to pull its plans for a New York headquarters because of fierce local opposition. Google’s Sidewalk Labs project was in perennial crisis, and Google workers were refusing to build surveillance tech with military applications.In short, democracy – inconvenient public engagement in the designing of critical institutions and public spaces – was turning out to be the single greatest obstacle to the vision Schmidt was advancing, first from his perch at the top of Google and Alphabet, and then as chair of two powerful boards advising US Congress and the Department of Defense. As the NSCAI documents reveal, this inconvenient exercise of power by members of the public and by tech workers inside these mega-firms has, from the perspective of men such as Schmidt and the Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, maddeningly slowed down the AI arms race, keeping fleets of potentially deadly driverless cars and trucks off the roads, protecting private health records from becoming a weapon used by employers against workers, preventing urban spaces from being blanketing with facial recognition software, and much more.Now, in the midst of the carnage of this ongoing pandemic, and the fear and uncertainty about the future it has brought, these companies clearly see their moment to sweep out all that democratic engagement. To have the same kind of power as their Chinese competitors, who have the luxury of functioning without being hampered by intrusions of either labour or civil rights.All of this is moving very fast. The Australian government has contracted with Amazon to store the data for its controversial coronavirus tracking app. The Canadian government has contracted with Amazon to deliver medical equipment, raising questions about why it bypassed the public postal service. And in just a few short days in early May, Alphabet has spun up a new Sidewalk Labs initiative to remake urban infrastructure with $400m in seed capital. Josh Marcuse, the executive director of the Defense Innovation Board chaired by Schmidt, announced that he was leaving that job to work full-time at Google as head of strategy and innovation for global public sector, meaning that he will be helping Google to cash in on some of the many opportunities he and Schmidt have been busily creating with their lobbying.To be clear, technology is most certainly a key part of how we must protect public health in the coming months and years. The question is: will that technology be subject to the disciplines of democracy and public oversight, or will it be rolled out in state-of-exception frenzy, without asking critical questions that will shape our lives for decades to come? Questions such as these, for instance: if we are indeed seeing how critical digital connectivity is in times of crisis, should these networks, and our data, really be in the hands of private players such as Google, Amazon and Apple? If public funds are paying for so much of it, should the public also own and control it? If the internet is essential for so much in our lives, as it clearly is, should it be treated as a nonprofit public utility?And while there is no doubt that the ability to teleconference has been a lifeline in this period of lockdown, there are serious debates to be had about whether our more lasting protections are distinctly more human. Take education. Schmidt is right that overcrowded classrooms present a health risk, at least until we have a vaccine. So how about hiring double the number of teachers and cutting class size in half? How about making sure that every school has a nurse?That would create much-needed jobs in a depression-level unemployment crisis, and give everyone in the learning environment more elbow room. If buildings are too crowded, how about iding the day into shifts, and having more outdoor education, drawing on the plentiful research that shows that time in nature enhances children’s capacity to learn?Introducing those kinds of changes would be hard, to be sure. But they are not nearly as risky as giving up on the tried-and-true technology of trained humans teaching younger humans face-to-face, in groups where they learn to socialise with one another to boot.Upon learning of New York state’s new partnership with the Gates Foundation, Andy Pallotta, the president of the New York State United Teachers union, was quick to react: “If we want to reimagine education, let’s start with addressing the need for social workers, mental health counsellors, school nurses, enriching arts courses, advanced courses and smaller class sizes in school districts across the state,” he said. A coalition of parents’ groups also pointed out that if they had indeed been living an “experiment in remote learning” (as Schmidt put it), then the results were deeply worrying: “Since the schools were shut down in mid-March, our understanding of the profound deficiencies of screen-based instruction has only grown.”In addition to the obvious class and race biases against children who lack internet access and home computers (problems that tech companies are eager to be paid to solve with massive tech buys), there are big questions about whether remote teaching can serve many kids with disabilities, as required by law. And there is no technological solution to the problem of learning in a home environment that is overcrowded andor abusive.The issue is not whether schools must change in the face of a highly contagious virus for which we have neither cure nor inoculation. Like every institution where humans gather in groups, they will change. The trouble, as always in these moments of collective shock, is the absence of public debate about what those changes should look like, and who they should benefit – private tech companies or students?The same questions need to be asked about health. Avoiding doctor’s offices and hospitals during a pandemic makes good sense. But telehealth misses a huge amount. So we need to have an evidence-based debate about the pros and cons of spending scarce public resources on telehealth – rather than on more trained nurses, equipped with all the necessary protective equipment, who are able to make house calls to diagnose and treat patients in their homes. And, perhaps most urgently, we need to get the balance right between virus tracking apps, which, with the proper privacy protections, have a role to play, and the calls for a “community health corps” that would put millions of Americans to work, not only doing contact-tracing, but making sure that everyone has the material resources and support they need to quarantine safely.In each case, we face real and hard choices between investing in humans and investing in technology. Because the brutal truth is that, as it stands, we are very unlikely to do both. The refusal to transfer anything like the needed resources to states and cities in successive federal bailouts means that the coronavirus health crisis is now slamming headlong into a manufactured austerity crisis. Public schools, universities, hospitals and transit are facing existential questions about their futures. If tech companies win their ferocious lobbying campaign for remote learning, telehealth, 5G and driverless vehicles – their Screen New Deal – there simply won’t be any money left over for urgent public priorities, never mind the Green New Deal that our planet urgently needs. On the contrary: the price tag for all the shiny gadgets will be mass teacher layoffs and hospital closures.Tech provides us with powerful tools, but not every solution is technological. And the trouble with outsourcing key decisions about how to “reimagine” our states and cities to men such as Bill Gates and Schmidt is that they have spent their lives demonstrating the belief that there is no problem that technology cannot fix.For them, and many others in Silicon Valley, the pandemic is a golden opportunity to receive not just the gratitude, but the deference and power that they feel has been unjustly denied. And Andrew Cuomo, by putting the former Google chair in charge of the body that will shape the state’s reopening, appears to have just given him something close to free rein.• Republished with permission from The Intercept.

Between 75 and 100 children are now receiving treatment across the country. Typical symptoms include a fever, skin rashes, red eyes, cracked lips and abdominal pain.Doctors suspected early on that coronavirus played a role in the new disorder by triggering an excessive immune reaction in the children, but there was no proof that the two were linked.The latest evidence comes from doctors in Bergamo, the city with the highest rate of coronavirus infections and deaths in Italy. Medical records at the Papa Giovanni XXIII hospital showed that since the outbreak reached Bergamo, cases of Kawasaki-like disease rose to about 10 per month compared with one every three months in the previous five years.Of 10 children treated for the disorder between mid-February and mid-April, eight tested positive for antibodies to the virus. The two negative cases may be explained by faulty test results, the doctors believe.“Our study provides the first clear evidence of a link between Sars-CoV-2 infection and this inflammatory condition, and we hope it will help doctors around the world as we try to get to grips with this unknown virus,” said Dr Lorenzo D’Antiga, director of child health at the hospital. “I have no doubt that Kawasaki disease in these patients is caused by Sars-CoV-2.”Writing in the Lancet, the medics warn that the “strong association” between the virus and the inflammatory condition should be taken into account when governments ease their lockdown restrictions. They stress, however, that the disorder is very rare, affecting no more than one in 1,000 children exposed to the virus. A fraction of these require intensive care.Dr Annalisa Gervasoni, a paediatric specialist at the hospital, said: “In our experience, only a very small proportion of children infected with Sars-CoV-2 develop symptoms of Kawasaki disease. However, it is important to understand the consequences of the virus in children, particularly as countries around the world grapple with plans to start relaxing social distancing policies.”Kawasaki disease, which overwhelmingly affects infants, causes inflammation of the blood vessels and in some cases a swelling of the heart. Swift treatment can prevent potentially lethal coronary aneurysms. The cause is not known, but studies suggest it is a post-infection inflammatory response that turns against the body.The rise in cases points to a form of Kawasaki disease that affects young schoolchildren more than infants and is triggered specifically by coronavirus. Since the first cases were reported in Britain, dozens more have emerged in the US, France, Spain, Italy and Switzerland.Health officials in Britain launched a surveillance study this week to monitor cases of the disorder, which they have tentatively named PIMS-TS, for Paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with Sars-CoV-2.Prof Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of paediatrics and child health, said it remained the case that children were largely unaffected by Covid-19, but that surveillance for the new syndrome would shed light on who it affects, how, and what the longer-term outcomes are. “The great majority of children with this condition have been well treated and are getting better and have gone home,” he said.Dr Liz Whittaker, a clinical lecturer in paediatric infectious diseases and immunology at Imperial College London, said cases followed the curve of the coronavirus outbreak and appeared to have peaked, though she could not rule out more as restrictions are lifted. “We are not seeing many children who are really unwell with this condition,” she said. “It shouldn’t be a factor when we reopen the schools.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5338cbc67f70b23a5fdf94db237441d2c238cdfb/0_290_8688_5213/master/8688.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=66a871ee8d81305811342d52b99146aa","title":"charities report rise in older people struggling for food in lockdown","story":"People too scared to go out and lacking usual support networks during coronavirus crisis There has been a dramatic increase in the number of older people malnourished or at risk of malnutrition since the coronavirus crisis began, according to Age UK and the Malnutrition Task Force.Age UK delivers almost 19,000 food packages a week to older people and has reported a rise in numbers without food or the support to plan, to cook and eat by themselves.“We know there are older people living on their own in the community who are running out of food and struggling to replenish their supplies because they are too frightened to go out, confused by the guidance or because their usual support networks have collapsed as a result of a pandemic,” said Caroline Abrahams, the charity director of Age UK.“These people are not on anyone’s list,” she added. “Typically they are not online. However, the pandemic has pulled the rug out from under them, so that their usual strategies for getting by are no longer working.”The charity said that since the pandemic began there had been an unprecedented number of inquiries to its advice line, peaking at almost double the usual rate of calls. Age UK and the Malnutrition Task Force have reported an increase in contacts about older people being discharged from hospital with no food or support in place, and people struggling to access social care support or manage without the informal help usually available from family and friends.The charities are also hearing of increased stress and anxiety among people with ongoing health and care needs, causing them to reduce their intake of food and drink.Abrahams said she had a conversation recently with an elderly man called Nigel. “He has no food in his house but he is scared to leave it because of coronavirus,” she said. “Nigel isn’t online. He was recently discharged from hospital but no longer gets any support at home. Nigel was told that food parcels would be delivered but has only received one some time ago. He is now out of food and has no family or friends who can help him.”Another Age UK frontline service reported the case of 79-year-old Betty, who relies on her friend to top up her gas meter. “She doesn’t have funds to do it herself and is unable to go out. She has emphysema but is just using a blanket to keep warm,” said Abrahams.“She hasn’t got any food, only some bread and bacon that a neighbour gave her. She is worried and lonely, with no support. She is unable to contact her GP because she does not have much phone credit or enough money to top it up,” she said.Dianne Jeffrey, the chair of the Malnutrition Task Force, said: “We are extremely worried that the number of those suffering malnutrition is rising. Many of these people will eventually be admitted to hospital.”A government spokesperson said: “Vulnerable iniduals can refer themselves to the NHS Volunteer Responders programme by calling 0808 196 3646 to be linked with a volunteer who can shop for them.“There are also commercial food delivery options available, including food boxes and prepared meals. A list of these has been shared with local authorities and charities, including Age UK. Anyone in urgent need of support should contact their local authority, most of which have dedicated Covid-19 helplines.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a72d357e55ef0b32ca2190c9b07100ccaa1b1cf8/0_170_5036_3023/master/5036.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28f2a068838f389e5ebec007f85ff8d8","title":"a and e attendance england record low covid 19 lockdown","story":"A\u0026ampE attendance in England has fallen to a record low as people stay away from hospitals during the coronavirus pandemic, figures show.The World Health Organization (WHO) guidance on face masks has remained consistent during the coronavirus pandemic. It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers – not the public.\u0026nbsp“Wearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,” the WHO has stated.Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to inhibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.\u0026nbspThere is no robust scientific evidence – in the form of trials – that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.Also underlying the WHO’s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play, especially on crowded public transport as people return to work..The number is the lowest for any calendar month since current records began in August 2010.NHS England, which published the figures, said the fall was “likely to be a result of the Covid-19 response”, an indication that people have been avoiding A\u0026ampE departments because of the coronavirus outbreak.Data also shows the number of patients waiting to start treatment at the end of March was 4.2 million, down from 4.4 million in the previous month.The UK lockdown was announced on 23 March.This compares with an average of 95,600 calls a day in March 2020 - more than double the average for March 2019.NHS England said 111 service levels had been heavily affected by increased demand caused by coronavirus, but figures so far for May showed a return to call volumes only slightly higher than the demand expected at this time of year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c76b7e129bea5046f787dbe565097e8ddab34090/0_849_1377_826/master/1377.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b71a611c87015e788a97c1783ea0d3ee","title":"golf tennis players return to action after coronavirus lockdown","story":"Of all the thousands of golfers and tennis players who were reacquainted with the reassuring swoosh and snap of club and racket on ball on Wednesday, few surely heard a sweeter sound than the 18-handicapper Ed Sandison.When the 34-year-old stepped on to the 176-yard first hole at the Styal Golf Club in Cheshire at 9.04am, he was merely happy to be back after eight weeks of lockdown, happier still when he made good contact with his ball, and stunned to the point of disbelief when he realised he had made his first ever hole-in-one.“At first I couldn’t find my ball anywhere so I was getting a little annoyed – until I checked the cup,” he told the . “I spent the next 17 holes laughing with my father-in-law Tony. But everyone I saw seemed to be in such a good mood – and no wonder with golf being back.”However, physical distancing rules meant that Sandison, who runs an environmentally friendly golf company Ocean Tee using sustainable materials, had to celebrate a bit differently than tradition dictates. “Usually I would be buying everyone a drink at the 19th hole. But as I’ve been living with my in-laws for the past eight weeks I bought them a couple of bottles of champagne and a nice takeaway instead.”Sandison’s boundless joy at golf’s resumption was reflected on courses across England and Wales, with many reporting tee times being quickly booked out. Chris Winters, the captain of Northamptonshire County Golf Club, said there was a “widespread sense of relief and enjoyment” in the club – with players quickly adapting to the government’s new guidelines for sport.“The only place where two metres apart even felt like an issue was on tee boxes and greens,” he said. “We used the putter length as ‘gimme’ range for putts. The holes have been packed so the ball will only drop an inch into one and can be easily fetched out.”Jeremy Tomlinson, the chief executive of England Golf, said many of the 1,800 courses in the country had reopened on Wednesday and praised staff for their “Herculean efforts in trying to keep clubs afloat” during the lockdown.However, he also warned: “The financial issues raised by temporary business closure during the pandemic means that there are tough times ahead for all clubs. We are not out of the woods on this one. The threat from Covid-19 is also still very real.”Meanwhile the Wimbledon club, opposite the All England Lawn Tennis Club where the Wimbledon championships are played, also reported that courts were full of people gently scraping the rust from their forehands and backhands.“Every single outdoor court is booked from 8am to 8pm for the next week,” said one player, Susie Reid. “It’s extraordinary, but to be expected. People are sensible and have been good with the rules around here, and there is a high percentage of people who either work from home or are retired, who have been desperate to get back, knowing tennis and golf is low risk.“Online booking helps a lot. It’s lovely to say ‘hi’ to people we haven’t seen, and feel part of our tennis community again, albeit without a coffee catch-up.”Reid insisted that physical distancing rules had been easy to observe with players leaving their courts five minutes before the next pairing were due to arrive. “The tennis was better than we expected, even in the wind, although the footwork was pretty off to say the least,” she said. “The whole thing just felt joyous, and right. It’s time. It’s also nice to see the coaches back, giving lessons and earning some money.“It’s tough to see the club houses shut and bar and cafe areas closed but we’ll get there. People really value their clubs – it’s a way of life for so many.”The LTA, tennis’s national governing body, said there had been a three-fold increase in the number of courts booked via its online portal Clubspark compared to the same day last year.Meanwhile Gary Walker, the head coach at Grafton Tennis and Squash Club, said coaches were delighted to be back working – even if it was just for two to three hours a day for the moment. “Most of the coaches were doing five, six, seven hours every day until the lockdown,” he said. “Suddenly, they’re doing less. But it’s less rather than none at all.”Walker also accepted that it would take a little while yet for the social life to return, too. “There’s usually something going on here every week – a pub quiz, a little tennis tournament or something like that, so the social distancing is a bit eerie. You can’t go to the bar and have a beer or anything like that. You can’t even use the toilet facilities. But I think when push comes to shove, basically you’ve got to say: ‘At least you’re playing tennis.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06bbcd3eb9913ad44cce4cfd96e0cd839167eb19/0_9_4292_2574/master/4292.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f774046d937c51b8b446cf630c9f6d77","title":"from aaron cruden to maa nonu are big money rugby signings worth it","story":"High-profile signings in France and beyond have been driven by owners rather than coaches, but Covid-19 may change that“We hoped for something else.” The words spoken by the Montpellier owner, Mohed Altrad, after he had released the New Zealand fly-half Aaron Cruden eight months early would be a fitting title for a book on the big-name signings made by clubs in France and England over the years.Cruden, who joined Super Rugby’s Chiefs this year, was reportedly paid an annual £700,000 by Montpellier, whose ambitions are funded by Altrad rather than the income generated by a club that have one of the lowest average attendances in the Top 14. Not bad for someone who for most of his international career was second choice, first to Dan Carter and then to Beauden Barrett.The All Blacks are the biggest brand in the game and their players command a price that excitable French owners, who appear to do little research beyond where potential recruits come from, have been happy to pay. Toulon’s Mourad Boudjellal harvested New Zealand players when he owned the club, often lamenting that his purchases quickly depreciated in value after reaching France, with even Ma’a Nonu singled out for attack.Nonu was one of six backs who started the 2015 World Cup final against Australiawho went on to join a Top 14 club. Julian Savea went to Toulon and was also singled out by Boudjellal. Nehe Milner-Skudder signed for Toulon in 2019 but never made an appearance because of a shoulder injury there were suggestions his contract was not approved by the league. Conrad Smith went to Pau, Ben Smith’s destination after last year’s tournament in Japan. Carter was tempted to Paris by Racing 92’s offer of more than £1m a year, and only Aaron Smith has stayed at home.Cruden’s time at Montpellier was blighted by injuries, as was Carter’s at Racing. Another All Black 10, Lima Sopoaga, has struggled since joining Wasps in 2018, although he was in his best form for the club before the lockdown. A couple of months ago he talked about the difficulties of adjusting to life in a new country, saying: “We do not have our support networks here. There’s a whole bunch of things, but I make no excuses for my poor form over the last year or so.”There have been many examples of successful signings, not least Nick Evans at Harlequins who quickly adapted to the slower, more structured nature of the Premiership. When Gareth Anscombe arrived at Cardiff Blues from New Zealand, he took time to adjust to the wavelength of the team, at times making plays that would have been read by Super Rugby teammates but confounded his new colleagues.Boudjellal struggled to understand why a player who had been part of a World Cup-winning team could not make the same impact in the Top 14. His most successful recruit from outside France was Jonny Wilkinson and he expected every other big-name signing to have as profound an influence as the fly-half he signed from Newcastle.Wilkinson was exceptional, sacrificing everything in his pursuit of excellence, and became fluent in French as he immersed himself in his new surroundings. The England World Cup winner was handsomely paid but was driven, as ever, by the desire to succeed and be the best he could, helping Toulon reach the summit in Europe.Which is why owners should do their homework. Simply expecting a player with a wealth of caps and a track record of success to fit in immediately, yielding an instant return on a substantial investment, is a folly that should be tempered by the current crisis that is stretching every professional club. High-profile signings, especially in France but on occasion in England, have been driven by owners rather than coaches, vehicles to sell season tickets and merchandise.Backs are more attractive in that regard than forwards, although the latter tend to offer more value for money. Carter was treated like royalty on his arrival in Paris and mobbed by crowds, but he admitted to being surprised by the more hands-on approaches of coaches in Europe, with less input sought from players than he was used to.The Top 14 is a 10-month grind, with 28 matches before the play-offs and European games on top. Expensive imports are expected to play a full part. With these players used to being managed and rested when needed, is it a surprise that so many pick up injuries regularly? There is no urge to entertain as there is in the south, and many become absorbed in the largely unambitious nature of club rugby in Europe. It is a theme Eddie Jones tellingly touched on in the England head coach’s recently published autobiography.Were it not for the offers to more than double their salary, how many would give up their international careers for life in a foreign country? What was a superannuation package for players whose time at the top level was all but over has changed, with younger players such as Sopoaga and Charles Piutau tempted over in recent years. Does the lack of an international place to play for affect players who are inherently competitive?It is not just players who travel from the other side of the world whose footprint is hard to make out. The Wales scrum-half Rhys Webb left Toulon in a flurry of insults and the Lions No 8 Taulupe Faletau has spent much of his time at Bath in the treatment room, like Liam Williams at Saracens and Leigh Halfpenny at Toulon. On the other hand, Finn Russell has settled at Racing while Luke McAlister had a successful six years at Toulouse."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfd30fd22f4ef2d991e4ca383bbb85c1aca08db6/186_103_4614_2769/master/4614.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c92742bfb9d25ac0c2e4f5d6fb509087","title":"renault daniel ricciardo carlos sainz mclaren f1","story":"Carlos Sainz will race for Ferrari in 2021 as the replacement for the four-times world champion Sebastian Vettel.

For teachers in the remote recruiting market, here’s how to make the most of the virtual experienceWhether it’s your first job after teacher training or you’re an experienced hand, evaluating a potential school is a crucial part of the interview process. But how do you do that remotely? Here are top tips for teachers applying to work at a new school under lockdown.Prepare for remote interviewsAlthough the coronavirus pandemic presents us with many challenges, it’s worth remembering that schools and supply agencies have been recruiting teachers online for almost 20 years. Independent and English language international schools are increasingly recruiting teachers via video to work with them overseas. The current lockdown has forced all schools across the UK to reconsider how they recruit teachers.Be tech-readyOn both sides of the camera it is critical to check the video technology, the microphone and your background environment when conducting an interview via video. What apps will they be using? Have you used them before? If not, rehearse with a friend.Think the process throughIt is crucial to find a school which best meets your needs. Find as many schools as possible before you begin any application process. This will give you motivation, as well as building up a network for future job opportunities.Visit the school – virtuallyIn order to determine which type of environment you feel most comfortable with, one important planning aspect to consider is your journey to and from the school, should you be successfully appointed. Under normal circumstances it’s worth considering a trial journey during peak commuter hours to see if the journey is manageable. Under the current conditions, it’s worth trying to arrange for a virtual tour of the school site – just as you would for a position that involves relocating to the other side of the country, or an international job. A conscientious school leader should be more than happy to take candidates on a video tour. This is even more critical during lockdown when all schools are struggling with recruitment.Prepare your applicationLook at the key facts listed on the job advert, and evaluate how they match up with the person specification – not the job description. Think carefully about what you can offer the school. Initial research on examination performance, pupil demographics and inspection reports will help you identify key priorities in the application. It would also be wise to consider why you want to work at the school. For more on this, see the five-minute interview plan. Regarding referees and references, it is always worth asking permission and giving those key people a “heads-up”. References are frequently requested with limited time for the referee to respond, putting them under pressure. You don’t want to put your job application in jeopardy!Submitting your application Spellcheck, spellcheck, spellcheck! Whatever you do, do not copy and paste bog-standard educational cliches and fire off application after application without due diligence. I’ve seen thousands of applications thrown in the bin because they accidentally mention another school’s name, have grammatical errors or include inappropriate information (no one needs to know your astrological birth sign!). Ask a friend to proofread your application. Show the reader that you have conducted some research, posing questions and thoughts, as well as some solutions with evidence of things that you have contributed towards in your current role. Remember, you can discuss finer details during the interview, so keep the facts concise.Plan your questions The easiest way to discover if a school leadership team is on track is to ask direct questions at the interview. For example: “How many teachers left your school last year?” “How much of the overall budget does the school protect for professional development?’’ “Why should I work at your school?” “Is the school budget in deficit, if so by how much?” If these questions are avoided, it’s a good indication that this might not be the school for you.Nail that interview!Be prepared, rehearse potential questions and answers, pick out what you will wear on the day – even for an online interview. Show interest and be conscientious by keeping your questions and answers concise. Whatever you do, do not be late: in an online interview, there really are no traffic excuses.Have your answers readyBe prepared to answer a range of challenging questions, and rehearse a variety of scenarios where you can provide concise answers. What would colleagues say about you? What area of the teaching standards do you most need to work on? What has been the greatest challenge in your career to date? Where do you want to be in three years’ time? Why do you want to work in this school? When it comes to “awkward” questions, they can often be a test of how professional and measured you will be in your response, rather than the answer itself.Final questionsFinally, asking questions at the end of an interview, always have two or three questions prepared. Whatever you do, make sure you ask them. It shows the interview panel that you are prepared, interested and it is your one opportunity to put them on the spot and turn the tables in the process.If you are currently recruiting for your schools please contact us by going to recruiters.the and if you are seeking a new role at a school please visit our jobsite"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff1f1cf142ad2be9a00dd43913e650ca762c95dc/0_155_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c89ce0432441d46ab0ebc9aab733027","title":"bourdain buena vista social club readers travel heroes","story":"Writers, chefs and musicians have instilled a wanderlust in our readers but so, too, have heroic grandads and intrepid auntsAnthony Bourdain every time.

I started watching his shows in my 20s, and it was because of him that we roughed it across Morocco, landed in Mumbai with no plans, and went to the most expensive wineries we could on a shoestring in Italy (arriving sweaty on bikes – they weren’t impressed).

My earliest memory is of Christmas Eve when I was two, and my aunt randomly turning up on our doorstep in Birmingham, fresh off a flight from Australia. As I grew up, I would get so excited when, every few months, we’d receive a postcard from her from Jordan, the US, Germany, Lebanon, Greece or wherever. It was so exotic: no one from Erdington did that. Subsequently, I did a decent amount of travelling and have lived abroad. All because of those postcards, with their funny-looking stamps and indecipherable postmarks. I’m looking at the boomerang she gave me that Christmas. I’m 44 now.

After the war, he helped establish the Ethiopian navy and got to know the country’s emperor. He instilled in me such a wanderlust, that it has truly become the core of who I am today.Kim L’Orange SørenssenWhen Brian Keenan and John McCarthy were held hostage in Lebanon in the 1980s, they dreamed of setting up a yak farm in Patagonia. Between Extremes is the account of their real trip to Chile five years after their release. They revel in the freedom to travel the length of that erse country, bringing alive the wonders of geysers in the Atacama, Pablo Neruda’s poetry and pumas in Torres del Paine national park. I was inspired to follow them and had the best holiday of my life – stargazing in the desert, street art in Valparaiso, palafitos (stilted seaside houses) on Chiloé island, and the sight of a puma in Patagonia. Their trip was tailor-made by Journey Latin America, as was mine.Jane LawI don’t know this man. In fact, I know very little about him. I don’t know where he lives, his name or even if he is still alive. This photo was taken by my father in August 1977 in a town called Guelmim, while on a road trip around Morocco. Hanging in my father’s house, the Bedouin nomad – AKA “the blue man” – filled my inquisitive mind with daydreams of the unknown and the world outside my four walls. To this day I credit this picture with igniting my love for travel, people and culture. I sometimes wonder if it would ever be possible to meet this man on a future adventure.Elena Mura-BatesMy travel hero is Cheryl Strayed. I read her Wild: A Journey from Lost to Found during this lockdown. Her determination to stick with a journey full of uncertainties and challenges is empowering. More than the physical journey, it is her quest for discovering herself anew from the bruised past she left behind that is touching. The honesty with which she dealt with all the emotional and physical challenges left me in awe of her spirit. Her every step felt like a personal journey, and in the process I’ve found confidence to take a leap like hers after the pandemic is over.Simanta BarmanElizabeth Gilbert’s Eat, Pray, Love not only inspires the traveller in me, but also the woman in me, empowering me to live more, seek more and be open to newer experiences. Gilbert braved every stereotype and travelled in 49 countries before she even wrote the book. Her confidence to explore new places alone, her sheer enjoyment of relishing food, her craving to learn new languages and nuances of the cultures and her desire to rediscover herself might just remind you of everything that you have always loved about escaping and exploring.Ashiqua AhmedIt was early 2016 when I met Clifin (pictured above), a 26-year-old Keralite, on the patio of a hostel in remote Bagan, an ancient city in Myanmar. We spent the evening chatting over beers, and agreed to wake up at 5am to cycle and see the sunrise over the temple plains. On our way there, I discovered Clifin had embarked on a mammoth, overland, one-year journey from Kerala, through Bangladesh and into Myanmar. His budget? $1,000. His intention? To show dedication was more important than money. A few years later, he cycled from Dubai to Moscow for the World Cup. He is truly inspiring.Dawn Mickley"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfef76e42da6298d528fb31c11e6361facff69f7/0_1_4981_2989/master/4981.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b7f41c0deffe24243d2ee99dc2404ad","title":"are you planning to return to your workplace on wednesday","story":"If you’re preparing to go back to work – away from home – we’d like to hear from you.

The government said this amounted to 2.5 million people across the UK, of whom 2.1 million are in England.Steve Reed, the shadow communities and local government secretary, said there needed to be an explanation about why so many people had initially been left off the list.“The government’s inability to work collaboratively to provide PPE and roll out testing has already put people at risk and now it appears they left vulnerable people in danger because of their disjointed approach to shielding,” he said.“People currently shielding have been led to believe they could be asked to isolate for an indefinite period they deserve clarity from the government about how long they will have to put their lives on hold.”Labour said it was concerned that vulnerable people were still being left off the list, leading to rises in the number shielding even though the UK is seven weeks into its lockdown.Angela Smith, the Labour leader in the House of Lords, said: “What are the government doing to improve their efforts to identify and notify those in high-risk categories? Local authorities are reporting huge errors. They initially raised their concerns that the numbers seemed too low, but were not asked to contribute their knowledge as data identification was being undertaken centrally.“It now appears that thousands of people were initially missed off, and in some areas local authorities have been told that the numbers of citizens to be shielded have more than doubled in the last week.”GPs claim the process of drawing up and updating the “shielding” list has been complicated.One GP said: “It was a stupid idea for the government to give the public the impression that it would be a simple thing to do – that all doctors had to do was push a button on their computer to find those patients who needed to be on the ‘shielding’ list.”People who did not need to be on the list, for example because they only had a mild form of asthma or hypertension, or recovered many years earlier from a disease such as cancer, were initially included.Conversely, others were excluded, because the extraction and analysis of data from various NHS records systems – some maintained by GPs, others by hospital doctors – failed to correctly identify their extra risk from Covid and thus the need to stay indoors.The list has also risen to 2.5 million because patients not on the original list approached their GP to request to go on it, often because they were scared of contracting Covid as a result of going into work.The government’s review of shielding iniduals is being led by the Department of Health and Social Care and will report by the end of next month.“As each day passes we learn more about this virus and its impact on people, and we will continue to do all we can to protect people.”Those currently in the shielding group include people with specific cancers, solid organ transplant recipients, those with severe respiratory conditions, people with certain conditions that suppress the immune system and pregnant women with significant heart disease.The review is likely to produce advice that is more nuanced about which categories of people are facing the greatest risk, advising some they may be able to take more risks and others that they need to be more cautious.The government’s medical advisers are also considering the impact of other risk factors such as how the virus disproportionally affects older people, men, people who are overweight and those with other underlying conditions. It is conducting a separate review of the impact of coronavirus on the death rate for those from minority ethnic backgrounds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3465951f1eb6c102c584cf0372dbbf526c81ee50/0_140_1464_878/master/1464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=421d50a4d01fe44e1e388a29e87670a6","title":"mixed messages tories wealth ahead wellbeing coronavirus","story":"The government’s revised lockdown advice is muddled and rife with contradictions, but their priorities are crystal clearBoris Johnson has urged the public to rely on their “British common sense” as lockdown restrictions are progressively eased over the coming months.But as estate agents joined nannies and cleaners on the list of workers allowed to enter people’s homes, while friends and family can’t come round for a cup of tea or to visit their grandchildren, questions are being raised about whether the latest rules make any sense, British or otherwise.One anomaly was highlighted by Kate, the teacher who asked Johnson a question at Monday’s press conference: why was it OK for her to mix with a class full of children when schools reopen on 1 June, but not acceptable to see members of her own family?The truth is that while they can’t quite bring themselves to say it plainly, ministers are prioritising getting the economy moving again over cheering up those who are lonely and sad after seven weeks’ isolation.English schools are set to reopen because, as the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, put it on Wednesday, they are “the best place for children to be educated and to learn”, but also so that at least some working parents can increase their productivity by not having to juggle their jobs with home schooling.It is not hard to discern why. Wednesday’s catastrophic data from the Office for National Statistics suggested a deep recession is brewing and job losses are accelerating, despite the taxpayer subsidising 7.5m workers’ salaries.Allowing some aspects of economic life to resume may help to limit the longer-term scars inflicted by the overnight shutdown at the end of March – but it does not come without risks.What the government is having to decide is which risks are worth taking first. And as Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation, puts it: “In the short term, they’re prioritising the risk that comes with a money payoff, over the risk that comes with an emotional payoff.”In Monday’s “Plan to Rebuild” document, the government describes its approach as “saving lives, saving livelihoods”.“The longer the virus affects the economy, the greater the risks of long-term scarring and permanently lower economic activity, with business failures, persistently higher unemployment and lower earnings,” it says, pointing out that many of those worst affected by a prolonged recession would be the young and the low-paid.But while the government’s roadmap repeatedly makes reference to “fairness”, the risks of the gradual reopening will not be borne evenly.Stark Office for National Statistics data on which occupations have seen the highest death rates from the virus underlined the fact that low-paid workers have been most at risk – and many more are in the sectors, including construction and manufacturing, now being asked to return, albeit with new safety rules in place.It hasn’t helped, either, that Johnson bungled the messaging about what would change this this week and when – and urged workers to avoid the crush of public transport, which for many will be impossible.Despite the unprecedented generosity of the furlough scheme, that may ultimately make it harder to maintain Rishi Sunak’s insistence that “we are all in this together” – a claim last used by a Conservative chancellor when George Osborne was slashing the welfare bill.The public may have a different understanding of the risks, and a different appetite for accepting them.The devolved nations certainly appear to, and are continuing to stick to the “stay at home” message – though ministers in Westminster argue that’s understandable, because the outbreak is at different stages in different places.Even if the focus on the economy may be understandable, the emotional and social cost of the lockdown is intensifying.A report for Conservative thinktank Onward warned last week of the heavy toll on the nation’s mental health, with the potential for “increased levels of depression, harmful use of alcohol and drugs, as well as self-harm or suicidal behaviour”.That is one reason it may be hard to maintain consent for nitpicking restrictions about who can meet whom in the park, and in what circumstances, as people increasingly yearn for contact with their loved ones.Another is that the public may apply the “British common sense” that Johnson is trumpeting, and decide that if the government thinks an encounter with an estate agent is a risk worth taking, it’s fine for their mum to pop round.• Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bb37aea897aabacda2bcbf8ae376239345527e7/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eae70eb68828fbdd5514067678af3cee","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:The number of lives lost worldwide in the coronavirus pandemic is nearing 300,000, according to Johns Hopkins University figures, with 297,197 deaths reported.

The mysterious condition emerged last month when NHS bosses issued an alert to doctors after hospitals admitted a number of children with a mix of toxic shock and symptoms seen in an inflammatory disorder known as Kawasaki disease.Chinese authorities have plans to test every resident in Wuhan, after a small outbreak was reported this week. The city in Hubei province, where the virus is believed to have originated with the first recorded cases, had reported few daily cases since early March and none since early April, until a cluster of six was confirmed at the weekend.

Without a fully functioning government, Israel has been unable to pass a budget.While he managed to break the stalemate, Gantz saw his Blue and White party break apart with resentment that he had joined its nemesis, Netanyahu, who faces three damning criminal corruption cases.For Netanyahu, the deal was a stunning turnaround after he appeared to be flagging in recent weeks under the strain of the charges, which he denies. He is now likely to remain in office throughout his upcoming corruption trial.On Thursday, ministerial appointments were still being negotiated, although Gantz will serve as defence minister before taking over as prime minister in November 2021.The deal envisions a huge 32-minister cabinet, which will rise to 36 members in six months – the largest in the country’s history – in part to accommodate the demands of multiple ergent parties within the coalition who have little in common.Writing in the country’s top-selling newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth, columnist Ben-Dror Yemini, said the new administration was “a far cry from being what most Israelis would consider to be their dream government”.“It is inflated, it is wasteful, and it’s unclear if it has any ideology,” he wrote, before adding further down: “Nevertheless, we must wish this government success.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d5df3e244753a3ea2aaca82916f5d22aff19d90/1_0_4997_3000/master/4997.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=994a8c69da4157123d1eb90546595ab9","title":"mutual aid coronavirus pandemic rebecca solnit","story":"Amid this unfolding disaster, we have seen countless acts of kindness and solidarity. It’s this spirit of generosity that will help guide us out of this crisis and into a better future. By  Rebecca SolnitPeople behaving badly is a staple of the news, and the pandemic has given us plenty of lurid snapshots. In the US alone, we have seen protesters with guns in Michigan’s capital demanding an end to lockdown, anti-vaxxer women in a frenzy at California’s capitol, opportunists stockpiling hand sanitiser to resell for profit.One of the biggest cliches about disasters is that they reveal civilisation as a thin veneer, beneath which lies brutal human nature. From this perspective, the best we can hope for from most people under crisis is selfish indifference at worst, they will swiftly turn to violence. Our worst instincts must be repressed. This becomes a justification for authoritarianism and heavy-handed policing.But studies of historical disasters have shown that this is not how most people actually behave. There are nearly always selfish and destructive people, and they are often in power, because we have created systems that reward that kind of personality and those principles. But the great majority of people in ordinary disasters behave in ways that are anything but selfish, and if we’re stuck with veneer as a metaphor, then it peels off to reveal a lot of creative and generous altruism and brilliant grassroots organising. With the global pandemic, these empathic urges and actions are wider and deeper and more consequential than ever.A dozen years ago, the term “mutual aid” was, as far as I can tell, used mostly by anarchists and scholars. Somehow it has migrated into general usage in recent years and now, in the midst of the pandemic, it is everywhere. Mutual aid has generally meant aid offered in a spirit of solidarity and reciprocity, often coming from within struggling communities, empowering those aided, and with an eye towards liberation and social change. Generally it meant volunteer coalitions doing work such as rebuilding or food distribution or supporting resistance camps. One of the most striking aspects of this global crisis is how many forms of aid and solidarity there are. These new forms of generosity we are seeing – organising, networks, projects, donations, support and outreach – are numerous beyond counting, a superbloom of altruistic engagement.This work has been made more difficult by the great withdrawal – the empty schools, shops, streets and offices. And that withdrawal is itself altruism in action – a withdrawal carried out by billions for the benefit of their communities, as well as their own safety. In the initial phase, we withdrew from the spaces we share out of solidarity: we moved apart to come together. We intentionally produced, in the form of business and school shutdowns and staying home, an unprecedented economic calamity as an alternative to accepting mass death.In March, many small business owners and service workers in the US willingly shut down their enterprises, and thereby their livelihood, even before the official orders came. In April, 50 restaurant owners in the Atlanta area publicly rejected the Georgia governor’s invitation to reopen. Together they took out an ad in a local newspaper and wrote: “We agree that it’s in the best interest of our employees, our guests, our community and our industry to keep our dining rooms closed at this time.”For some, staying home may be a strain, but for others it means financial ruin. Sacrificing your own financial security for the common good was a solemn commitment that people made across the world. It was one of the things that made this crisis distinct: how often refraining, not doing, not going anywhere, not continuing activities, was also an act of public-spirited generosity. This is willing sacrifice for the public good. But people have been doing more than that.In March, the UK’s National Health Service called for 250,000 volunteers to sign up to help seniors, people who were isolating and medical staff who needed deliveries. More than three times that many signed up. Appreciation for the NHS grew even stronger, and the widespread weekly rounds of applause for its workers became one of the welcome interruptions of isolation. In mid-March, a website was launched listing several hundred new mutual aid groups across the country, so people could search their local area.A few weeks ago, I heard someone complain that Lexington, Kentucky, had four mutual aid groups – they were concerned that so many volunteers would be redundant I was awestruck by the abundance. In the course of writing this piece, I looked at various new mutual aid projects: meal deliveries to the elderly in Paterson, New Jersey the Twin Cities Queer and Trans Mutual Aid group in Minneapolis-Saint Paul projects to aid the Hopi, Zuni and Navajo on reservations in the US south-west a Washington state project to support the undocumented sex workers organising to raise emergency funds.I saw people stuck at home in isolation teach dance and drawing classes, tell stories, play music online to encourage others quarantining in place Italians singing together from their balconies and Iranians reciting poetry from theirs a young native Nevadan going fishing to feed members of her Pyramid Lake Paiute tribe. Most of us have seen, or performed, one-off acts of kindness – running an errand for a frail neighbour, chalking a cheerful message on the pavement, picking up the shopping bill for the struggling couple at the checkout, donating to a fundraiser for an acquaintance who has been laid off or taken ill. But such inidual actions are not enough to address this triple catastrophe of a viral pandemic, a financial collapse and the emotional, educational and other consequences of the great withdrawal.Thus there are also people building organisations to provide broader, ongoing practical aid – such as the young people in more than a dozen US cities delivering groceries and supplies to older and immunocompromised people via a network called Zoomers to Boomers – and others organising emotional support for those who feel isolated, including the UK’s adopt-a-grandparent programme. There are new groups, projects, organisations and networks, and old ones retooling for the crisis.Fiji-based climate organiser Thelma Young-Lutunatabua told me about the return of traditional Fijian forms of equitable, cooperative food distribution to make sure no one was left out. “The way we get through this is together,” she said.Fifteen years ago, in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, a mutual aid organisation called Common Ground Relief was founded by a handful of people inside the damaged area, including the former Black Panther Malik Rahim. (In the US, perhaps the most famous past examples of mutual aid are the Black Panther party’s 1960s-era food programmes to assuage hunger in inner-city neighbourhoods.) The group’s slogan was “solidarity not charity”, a phrase inspired by the Uruguayan writer Eduardo Galeano: “I don’t believe in charity. I believe in solidarity. Charity is so vertical. It goes from the top to the bottom. Solidarity is horizontal. It respects the other person. I have a lot to learn from other people.”As a definition of mutual aid’s ideals, “solidarity not charity” surfaces constantly today. Charity often implies that the afflicted population is powerless or incompetent to address its own needs. Sometimes, it can take away confidence and pride even as it gives tangible aid. Solidarity is, first of all, an affirmation that we are in this together, and mutual aid demonstrates that even in crisis we have strength and capacity to care for ourselves. The term comes from the anarchist philosopher Peter Kropotkin’s 1902 book Mutual Aid: a Factor of Evolution, which argues that aiding and protecting others and serving the needs of the group rather than the inidual has been essential to the survival of many species, and is evident in early and traditional human societies. In the time of coronavirus, mutual aid has been used to describe myriad new volunteer cooperative projects that have arisen in response to disaster. But the landscape of outreach is complex and varied. Take, for example, the creation and circulation of masks. There is a whole spectrum of mask economies from corrupt profiteering and outright theft – including by the US federal government – to the very different world of creative mutual aid. Many of us, myself included, have made a few masks for those we know. Others have gone into bulk production.San Francisco local government supervisor Matt Haney fundraised and organised the distribution of thousands of masks for the impoverished, densely housed – and houseless – residents of the city’s Tenderloin district, which he represents. Adriana Camarena, a lawyer from Mexico City, realised that the undocumented day labourers near her home in San Francisco’s Mission district had few supplies and little access to health information to meet the crisis. So she began making and distributing cloth masks and hand sanitiser, and giving brief educational talks to go with them.Meanwhile, the artist and art professor Stephanie Syjuco settled into mask mass production to meet the needs of people in Oakland and Berkeley, starting with masks for a group working to address food insecurity among UC Berkeley students. By late April, she had personally made 700 masks. And the Auntie Sewing Squad, founded by Los Angeles performance artist Kristina Wong, now includes more than 500 members, and has produced more than 20,000 masks, by Wong’s count.The aunties (and uncles, but mostly aunties) began by making masks for hospital workers, and then for farmworkers, people released by ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) or getting out of prison, immigrant communities and other vulnerable groups. It’s a model of decentralised, volunteer-driven organising: whoever finds a need obtains pledges from makers until the required number is reached, and the beautifully made masks are gathered and shipped to their destination. Many pay for their own materials and shipping, and donations support others. This week, the squad is sending a van full of supplies, including masks, materials and three sewing machines, to the Navajo nation, which has been hard hit by the virus. The Navajo is just one of several indigenous communities they have reached out to.The Auntie Sewing Squad even expanded to include cooking to support those who sew. “When you’ve been bent over a sewing machine for 12 hours, a nice order of pad thai is really welcome,” one auntie told me.The US mask-makers, like donors to food-distribution programmes, are in part compensating for governmental failure. Had the federal government prepared for crisis, and supported the scientific advice on how to respond to pandemics, the need for these mutual aid efforts could have been smaller. There has been much talk of the underlying health conditions that make iniduals more vulnerable to Covid-19. The US as a whole has underlying conditions – systemic racism, poverty and financial precariousness, lack of access to healthcare and the internet for rural and poor families – that have made this crisis far worse than it should have been. The old conservative argument against social programmes was that these needs should be met by inidual and independent institutions’ generosity. In unequal societies, these were never enough to meet the need.What is noteworthy for me about this crisis is that there is no clear distinction between purely volunteer- and donation-driven projects, and a host of other endeavours trying to meet the needs of the moment. There are many ways that businesses and workers are stepping up or shifting what they do and how they do it, out of altruism. A Buddhist group in Tallahassee, Florida, raised $500,000 to purchase masks from China for medical workers in their area. The jet belonging to the New England Patriots football team brought 1.2m masks directly from China to circumvent the federal government’s outbidding of Massachusetts on personal protective equipment (PPE).Elsewhere, the New York Times reported on Amish families who, as other jobs dried up, turned to mass-producing cloth masks, face shields and other PPE for the Cleveland clinic, which urgently needed them. (This, like the California government program that lets otherwise shuttered restaurants deliver meals to isolated senior citizens, is when aid becomes literally mutual, meeting needs on both sides of the interaction.) Then there’s the 43 Pennsylvania factory workers who chose to isolate themselves in their workplace for a 28-day marathon of 12-hour days, during which they produced tens of millions of pounds of polypropylene, the raw material from which a lot of PPE is made. Like the Amish, they were paid for their work, and were working in intense new ways, fuelled by social commitment, to meet an urgent need. One of the workers said: “We’ve been getting messages on social media from nurses, doctors, emergency workers, saying thank you for what we’re doing. But we want to thank them for what they did and are continuing to do. That’s what made the time we were in there go by quickly, just being able to support them.”During the final 1,000 days of the second world war, shipyard workers in the San Francisco Bay Area produced 1,000 warships – a warship a day. Something like that epic, urgent industry seems to be at work now, but outside the federal government, or any government. In early April, the Bay Area branch of the news site Hoodline reported: “On Thursday morning, two tons of rolled sheet plastic arrived at a warehouse in Alameda. By the end of the weekend, it had become 16,000 plastic face shields. That remarkable turnaround is entirely owed to self-organisation by Bay Area makers, who have transformed maker spaces, universities, fabrication shops and almost anyone with their own sewing machine, CNC machine or 3D printer into an ad-hoc corps of medical supply manufacturers.” The report called the self-organised effort involving industrial-design students and teachers a “distributed factory”. Such decentralised efforts, organised without top-down authority, are exemplary mutual aid.In April, 14 nurses and seven doctors from the same institution set off for a one-month assignment on the Navajo reservation, whose residents are facing high levels of infection. They were coordinated by the existing UCSF Heal Initiative (Health, Equity, Action and Leadership), which works with impoverished and vulnerable communities from Haiti to Nepal. Its mission statement is: “We seek to embody solidarity and contribute to the movement for global health equity led by communities themselves.” This initiative, based on the principle of “solidarity not charity”, has been working with communities under stress for six years, and will still be there when the immediate crisis is over.During “ordinary” disasters – a hurricane, an earthquake – there’s a phenomenon called volunteer convergence, whereby people eager to help gather in the impacted areas. Sometimes so many people and so much donated material shows up that they pose management problems for those at the centre of the crisis. This is not an ordinary disaster – the impacted area is all over the world, and convergence is banned – but people are showing up in many ways. Some of this work is always going on – there is always suffering and injustice to assuage, and there are always people trying to do so.Even ordinary disasters never really end. There are many ways in which Hurricane Katrina’s impact on New Orleans and other parts of the gulf coast lasted – though there are, at least, some positive aspects to this lingering impact. The Common Ground Health Clinic spun off from Common Ground Relief. Fifteen years on, it’s still delivering free medical care in the New Orleans region.The Covid-19 pandemic and economic crisis will not end – if ending means things going back to the way they were. Whatever “normal” meant on 1 January 2020, it will never return, and neither will millions of the jobs financed by the disposable income that has just dried up. It’s worth remembering that, in the past few decades, the return to 19th-century robber-baron capitalism – via the dismantling of social safety nets, and the transformation of education, healthcare and other basic human needs into for-profit schemes that served shareholders first – meant that everyday life had already become a disaster for too many billions of people before this crisis.There is a long, rough road ahead. Without radical change, the way food, shelter, medical care and education are produced and distributed will be more unfair and more devastating than before. It seems likely that conservatives will argue for brutal austerity and libertarian abandonment of the most desperate, while the rest of us are going to have to argue for some form of post-capitalism that decouples meeting basic needs from wage labour – perhaps the kind of basic income that Spain is planning to introduce.The devastating economic effect of the pandemic will make innovation essential, whether it is rethinking higher education or food distribution, or how to fund news media. The Green New Deal offers a model for how to move forward on jobs and leave fossil fuels behind as that sector founders and climate catastrophe looms. Protests in many fields – including nurses demanding PPE, and warehouse, delivery and food-service workers protesting against exploitative or unsafe working conditions – suggests that workers’ organisations may be gaining strength.I believe the generosity and solidarity in action in the present moment offers a foreshadowing of what is possible – and necessary. The basic generosity and empathy of most ordinary people should be regarded as a treasure, a light and an energy source that can drive a better society, if it is recognised and encouraged. Mostly, it’s overlooked, undermined and sabotaged. Capitalism, and its octopus arms of entertainment, advertising and marketing, endeavour to reduce us to consumers. This means making us the kind of miserable, selfish, lonely people who seek fulfllment through buying stuff, and believe in competitiveness as a basic social force. Competitiveness, that driving word behind free-market ideology, means we are rivals and there is scarcity each of us gets more by seeing that someone else gets less.Competition is the antithesis of mutual aid, which is not only a practical tool but an ideological insurrection. The fact that even in places like the US, where these competitive, isolating messages have bombarded us for at least 150 years, millions still reach out in generosity, and are still moved to meet the needs that become visible in moments such as this, is testament to something about human nature and human possibility. Those urges are strong and deep, and they can be a foundation for something different. Indeed, they often have been before, when European social welfare was built up, when US social safety nets were created, and when people self-organised on smaller scales to take care of each other.Some of that sense of urgency and shared destiny will fade away, as it often does after a disaster, but one of the important things to remember is that some of it was here before this pandemic. I sometimes think that capitalism is a catastrophe constantly being mitigated and cleaned up by mutual aid and kinship networks, by the generosity of religious and secular organisations, by the toil of human-rights lawyers and climate groups, and by the kindness of strangers. Imagine if these forces, this spirit, weren’t just the cleanup crew, but were the ones setting the agenda.What I have seen after earlier disasters is that a lot of people aspire to “go home” and “back to normal”, but some find in the moment a sense of self and a sense of connection so meaningful that something about who they were and what they did in the crisis carries forward into how they live the rest of their life. Sometimes this is as intangible as a change of priorities and habits, and a new sense of agency not uncommonly, it’s as substantial as a new coalition, a new network, a new set of policy priorities, a new political career or a decision to go into work that supports the whole. And even those who want things to get back to normal often find they are changed permanently in their sense of who they are, and what matters most.The pandemic marks the end of an era and the beginning of another – one whose harshness must be mitigated by a spirit of generosity. An artist hunched over her sewing machine, a young person delivering groceries on his bicycle, a nurse suiting up for the ICU, a doctor heading to the Navajo nation, a graduate student hip-deep in Pyramid Lake catching trout for elders, a programmer setting up a website to organise a community: the work is under way. It can be the basis for the future, if we can recognise the value of these urges and actions, recognise that things can and must change profoundly, and if we can tell other stories about who we are, what we want and what is possible.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1dc26c7073d8fa265575b4a992e1850d97edd58/0_188_5832_3500/master/5832.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04b5da8e1934a87a701923934d0b3f31","title":"the coronavirus slayer how keralas rock star health minister helped save it from covid 19","story":"KK Shailaja has been hailed as the reason a state of 35 million people has only lost four to the virus. Here’s how the former teacher did itOn 20 January, KK Shailaja phoned one of her medically trained deputies. She had read online about a dangerous new virus spreading in China. “Will it come to us?” she asked. “Definitely, Madam,” he replied. And so the health minister of the Indian state of Kerala began her preparations.As such, Shailaja Teacher, as the 63-year-old minister is affectionately known, has attracted some new nicknames in recent weeks – Coronavirus Slayer and Rockstar Health Minister among them. The names sit oddly with the merry, bespectacled former secondary school science teacher, but they reflect the widespread admiration she has drawn for demonstrating that effective disease containment is possible not only in a democracy, but in a poor one.How has this been achieved? Three days after reading about the new virus in China, and before Kerala had its first case of Covid-19, Shailaja held the first meeting of her rapid response team. The next day, 24 January, the team set up a control room and instructed the medical officers in Kerala’s 14 districts to do the same at their level. By the time the first case arrived, on 27 January, via a plane from Wuhan, the state had already adopted the World Health Organization’s protocol of test, trace, isolate and support.As the passengers filed off the Chinese flight, they had their temperatures checked. Three who were found to be running a fever were isolated in a nearby hospital. The remaining passengers were placed in home quarantine – sent there with information pamphlets about Covid-19 that had already been printed in the local language, Malayalam. The hospitalised patients tested positive for Covid-19, but the disease had been contained. “The first part was a victory,” says Shailaja. “But the virus continued to spread beyond China and soon it was everywhere.”In late February, encountering one of Shailaja’s surveillance teams at the airport, a Malayali family returning from Venice was evasive about its travel history and went home without submitting to the now-standard controls. By the time medical personnel detected a case of Covid-19 and traced it back to them, their contacts were in the hundreds. Contact tracers tracked them all down, with the help of advertisements and social media, and they were placed in quarantine. Six developed Covid-19.Another cluster had been contained, but by now large numbers of overseas workers were heading home to Kerala from infected Gulf states, some of them carrying the virus. On 23 March, all flights into the state’s four international airports were stopped. Two days later, India entered a nationwide lockdown.At the height of the virus in Kerala, 170,000 people were quarantined and placed under strict surveillance by visiting health workers, with those who lacked an inside bathroom housed in improvised isolation units at the state government’s expense. That number has shrunk to 21,000. “We have also been accommodating and feeding 150,000 migrant workers from neighbouring states who were trapped here by the lockdown,” she says. “We fed them properly – three meals a day for six weeks.” Those workers are now being sent home on charter trains.Shailaja was already a celebrity of sorts in India before Covid-19. Last year, a movie called Virus was released, inspired by her handling of an outbreak of an even deadlier viral disease, Nipah, in 2018. (She found the character who played her a little too worried-looking in reality, she has said, she couldn’t afford to show fear.) She was praised not only for her proactive response, but also for visiting the village at the centre of the outbreak.Nipah prepared Shailaja for Covid-19, she says, because it taught her that a highly contagious disease for which there is no treatment or vaccine should be taken seriously. In a way, though, she had been preparing for both outbreaks all her life.The Communist Party of India (Marxist), of which she is a member, has been prominent in Kerala’s governments since 1957, the year after her birth. (It was part of the Communist Party of India until 1964, when it broke away.) Born into a family of activists and freedom fighters – her grandmother campaigned against untouchability – she watched the so-called “Kerala model” be assembled from the ground up when we speak, this is what she wants to talk about.The foundations of the model are land reform – enacted via legislation that capped how much land a family could own and increased land ownership among tenant farmers – a decentralised public health system and investment in public education. Every village has a primary health centre and there are hospitals at each level of its administration, as well as 10 medical colleges.This is true of other states, too, says MP Cariappa, a public health expert based in Pune, Maharashtra state, but nowhere else are people so invested in their primary health system. Kerala enjoys the highest life expectancy and the lowest infant mortality of any state in India it is also the most literate state. “With widespread access to education, there is a definite understanding of health being important to the wellbeing of people,” says Cariappa.Shailaja says: “I heard about those struggles – the agricultural movement and the freedom fight – from my grandma. She was a very good storyteller.” Although emergency measures such as the lockdown are the preserve of the national government, each Indian state sets its own health policy. If the Kerala model had not been in place, she insists, her government’s response to Covid-19 would not have been possible.That said, the state’s primary health centres had started to show signs of age. When Shailaja’s party came to power in 2016, it undertook a modernisation programme. One pre-pandemic innovation was to create clinics and a registry for respiratory disease – a big problem in India. “That meant we could spot conversion to Covid-19 and look out for community transmission,” Shailaja says. “It helped us very much.”When the outbreak started, each district was asked to dedicate two hospitals to Covid-19, while each medical college set aside 500 beds. Separate entrances and exits were designated. Diagnostic tests were in short supply, especially after the disease reached wealthier western countries, so they were reserved for patients with symptoms and their close contacts, as well as for random sampling of asymptomatic people and those in the most exposed groups: health workers, police and volunteers.Shailaja says a test in Kerala produces a result within 48 hours. “In the Gulf, as in the US and UK – all technologically fit countries – they are having to wait seven days,” she says. “What is happening there?” She doesn’t want to judge, she says, but she has been mystified by the large death tolls in those countries: “I think testing is very important – also quarantining and hospital surveillance – and people in those countries are not getting that.” She knows, because Malayalis living in those countries have phoned her to say so.Places of worship were closed under the rules of lockdown, resulting in protests in some Indian states, but resistance has been noticeably absent in Kerala – in part, perhaps, because its chief minister, Pinarayi Vijayan, consulted with local faith leaders about the closures. Shailaja says Kerala’s high literacy level is another factor: “People understand why they must stay at home. You can explain it to them.”The Indian government plans to lift the lockdown on 17 May (the date has been extended twice). After that, she predicts, there will be a huge influx of Malayalis to Kerala from the heavily infected Gulf region. “It will be a great challenge, but we are preparing for it,” she says. There are plans A, B and C, with plan C – the worst-case scenario – involving the requisitioning of hotels, hostels and conference centres to provide 165,000 beds. If they need more than 5,000 ventilators, they will struggle – although more are on order – but the real limiting factor will be manpower, especially when it comes to contact tracing. “We are training up schoolteachers,” Shailaja says.Once the second wave has passed – if, indeed, there is a second wave – these teachers will return to schools. She hopes to do the same, eventually, because her ministerial term will finish with the state elections a year from now. Since she does not think the threat of Covid-19 will subside any time soon, what secret would she like to pass on to her successor? She laughs her infectious laugh, because the secret is no secret: “Proper planning.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee21b24d91f3532f3599c93126facc938e4230e0/0_260_3898_2339/master/3898.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d3a9ef2038531e3597d6fec1c8234d6","title":"us mexico border factories coronavirus","story":"Companies – and US government officials – have urged Mexican government to keep factories running at any costWhen the coronavirus pandemic reached the Mexican border city of Mexicali, operations at first continued as normal at the US-owned factory where Sergio Ayala has worked for the past three years.Eventually, workers went on strike at the Autolite plant, which makes spark plugs for export, in protest at the management’s alleged failure to introduce sanitary measures, and the state labor secretary shut shut it down.A few days after the stoppage, Ayala got a text message inviting him back to work – on condition he did not drive to work: the factory parking lot had to stay empty. “They offered us a bonus of 250 pesos and a vacation day,” he said.Ayala decided it wasn’t worth the risk but dozens of workers accepted the terms – and the factory kept operating.Last week, the Autolite factory – and several dozen other maquilas in Baja California state – officially reopened. But Ayala says that when he returned, he and several dozen other workers who had joined the April strike were fired.Mexico’s border states are home to more than 6,000 maquiladoras – largely foreign-owned factories that manufacture products for export – and the plants, which employ hundreds of thousands of people, have been the focus of several coronavirus outbreaks.But official efforts to keep the factories shut and contain the spread of Covid-19 have come under intense pressure from companies – and US government officials – who have urged the Mexican government to keep maquiladoras running at any cost.Baja California, the Mexican state with the largest number of maquiladoras, is the now the state with the second-greatest number of Covid-19 deaths.“There are maquiladoras that say it’s cheaper to pay a fine for noncompliance than to lose million-dollar contracts,” said Mago Avalos, director of the Tijuana-based labor rights organization Ollin Calli. “It’s better to have workers working – even if they get sick – than to have them resting and getting paid.”On Wednesday, the Mexican government released a plan to gradually reopen the economy, beginning on 18 May, and starting with construction, mining and transportation manufacturing industries – although many factories never stopped.All along the 2,000-mile border maquila workers have died of Covid-19: in Ciudad Juárez, 18 workers at a textile factory owned by the US-owned Lear Corp have reportedly died of coronavirus. The company has said that it stopped production there on 27 March and that it moved affected employees to a private health care centre for treatment at the company’s expense. In a statement on its website, Lear said it is “adhering to the guidelines provided by the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as all orders and directives regarding business operations issued by federal, state and local authorities”.Twenty-four cases have been confirmed among maquila workers in Tijuana and 17 in Mexicali, said Avalos, but the real number is probably far more, as testing is severely limited and the health system is chronically overloaded.“There are workers who have gone to be tested and seen that the lines are 12, 15, 20 hours long,” Avalos said. “They won’t wait for over 10 hours in line if they feel sick.”Cramped conditions make some maquiladoras prime areas for contagion. Nanci Ramos used to work at Terminados Rogers in Mexicali, making paper products such as notebooks and calendars.When the pandemic was declared, she and her coworkers received a pamphlet advising them to wash their hands and maintain a safe distance – but no measures were taken to keep workers apart.“You practically have to hug each other to get to the bathroom stalls,” she said.A report from the Border Committee of Women Workers noted that some maquiladoras lack soap in bathrooms and eating areas. Many lack windows and proper ventilation.The Baja California reopenings came after weeks of pressure from US officials.The US ambassador to Mexico, Christopher Landau, has tweeted that “it is possible and essential” to preserve international supply chains while protecting workers’ health.Much of the debate has focussed on defining which factories are engaged in essential work.The complexities of the global supply chain make it hard to determine which maquiladoras play essential roles: some produce minute electronics parts used in transportation or medical equipment, but labor organizers argue that most factories produce goods which have nothing to do with the fight against the pandemic.Many maquiladoras in the border area manufacture parts used in aerospace manufacturing, and the work stoppage has particularly affected supply chains in the defense industry.The undersecretary of defense for acquisitions and sustainment, Ellen Lord – the former CEO of a defense contractor that owns maquiladoras along the border – said that shutdowns in Mexico were affecting supply chains “especially important for US airframe production”.One of those factories is Collins Aerospace in Mexicali.The maquila, owned by a subsidiary of defense contractor Raytheon Technologies, produces equipment for aviation GPS systems. Sergio Ramírez, a quality control inspector at Collins Aerospace, said the factory shut down only for a few days after orders from the state labor secretary.“They called to say we should go back, and I asked, ‘But what about this thing about essential businesses?’” said Ramírez, who asked not to be identified by his real name. “‘No, well, the secretary said we can go back to work.’” By the end of April, the factory had returned to normal.Ramirez says the factory has taken sanitary measures to implement social distancing and provide protective gear. But less than two weeks after the opened, a worker was diagnosed with Covid-19.A spokesperson for Collins Aerospace said that the factory’s labors are considered essential because it produces parts for Mexican airline Aeroméxico, whose planes have been used to transport medical personnel. The spokesman declined to say which authorities had deemed its work essential.In a statement on its website, Collins said it had “ensured our sites have appropriate resources available to support ongoing operations in accordance with local regulatory requirements”.The Baja California government has insisted that reopened maquiladoras will observe strict hygiene standards. But the state employs only 15 labor inspectors across all sectors. “Those inspectors can’t have hands and eyes everywhere,” said Avalos.Autolite and Terminados Rogers did not respond to requests for comment.The fired Autolite workers say that they now face another obstacle: getting paid. According to the laid-off workers, Autolite has offered them just half of the severance pay they were owed.The state’s labor arbitration boards are closed until June, so workers cannot file complaints for withholding of payment or wrongful termination.For the fired Autolite workers, that means months could pass before their situation is settled. Because of the backup of cases, Avalos said, workers may have to wait until early 2021 for their first hearing before the labor board.“The problem is, workers need to eat both now and in 2021,” Avalos said. “The economic and health crisis is not coming after Covid. The working class is living it right now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2026a0da1339013c83d70aea837ea4969c89beb5/0_114_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34b027c44ce4d11736135f454adac661","title":"why should you cry ghanas dancing pallbearers find new fame during covid 19","story":"Benjamin Aidoo, the group’s leader, wants to teach the world to hold joyful funerals, and is planning to expand his business across the globeThe Nana Otafrija pallbearers might look slick, but they are not afraid to get dirty. Their signature moves, carried out with a coffin in tow, include dropping to all-fours and crawling in unison or lying on their backs, the coffin balanced on top of them, legs moving in time to the music – as though they have been crushed by the casket.The dancing pallbearers first became famous in 2017 when their so-called “coffin dance” featured in a BBC documentary. Then, someone added an EDM track and a meme was born: footage of the dancers was spliced with botched feats of strength and other accidents and posted all over the internet.Now, the coronavirus pandemic has transformed their performance into a way to warn people of the dangers of ignoring social distancing.In India, policemen dressed in uniform danced along to the track while carrying a (healthy) man on a stretcher. In Peru, police dressed in riot gear did the same, with a mock coffin.The dance has even been used by protesters mourning the economy in Lebanon: in Beirut men dressed as the pallbearers marched a mock coffin decorated with the fast-depreciating Lebanese Lira down the streets.Fans can buy miniatures of the Nana Otafrija dancers from Hong Kong, or go to a Taiwanese bar where drinks are served by pallbearers. There’s also a video game-inspired version, where Mario dies and the pallbearers appear in pixellated form, moving in time to chiptune.Benjamin Aidoo, the lead pallbearer, lists the Mario version among his favourites. His dancers have also taken it upon themselves to warn the public about the dangers of ignoring social distancing measures, with the help of a new slogan: “Stay at home or dance with us”.Speaking from his home in Accra, Aidoo told the  that he started working as a pallbearer while in high school in 2003. He came up with the idea of dancing with the coffin because he wanted people to be able to celebrate their dead. He also noticed that people would often grow so upset at their solemn funerals that they would faint or injure themselves. If they could focus on the dancing, he reasoned, they would be less likely to get hurt.Once the pandemic is over, Aidoo hopes to teach people around the world to hold uplifting funerals.“Most people love the display”, said Aidoo, “because they want to be happy.” When people’s parents die, for example, “You know what your mom and dad did for you,” said Aidoo. “Why should you cry?”“When you know the life that he or she spent before dying, I think it’s a great thing for you to celebrate.”Things changed for Aidoo’s business when the family of a member of parliament who had died hired Aidoo and his fellow pallbearers – but insisted they wear all-white, matching outfits. The MP’s family paid for the outfits and the funeral celebration went so well that they tipped handsomely, too.“That was the first time I ever saw a $100 bill,” said Aidoo.After that, he said, “I had a vision for what I am doing.” Aidoo now employs about 100 staff: 95 men and five women. Two of the women are lead pallbearers, like Aidoo: they march in front of the coffin with a cane – decorated with the Ghanaian flag – and top hat.Aidoo has also recently hired a manager and together the pair are trying to build a global brand. Asked how the coronavirus pandemic is affecting his business in Ghana, Aidoo explained that funerals are now restricted to 25 people – including pallbearers – and are sombre affairs. There’s no singing and dancing – so some people are keeping their loved ones’ bodies in the morgue until restrictions are lifted and they’re able to hold a large burial, with his dancers.Once the pandemic is over he hopes to travel and to open branches of his pallbearing business in other countries, where people will be able to hire Adioo-style coffin dancers.He urged his fans to “Stay safe, stay alive, respect the rules and regulations given to them.”“One day we will surely get there. This pandemic will be over and then we’ll all meet.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3c1c1d7ad3459d4227fe5ad0cf8fdd2dcb216d6/1863_547_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84a7c087f96ec237590b3a4fa15b7cf3","title":"tokyos state of emergency in pictures","story":"As Japan considers lifting state-of-emergency conditions in many regions this week and the country inches towards a gradual return of economic activity, photographer Dai Kurokawa looks at life in the capital"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

The Health Service Executive plan will form a core part of new safeguards that will support the process of gradually easing restrictions from May 18th. The HSE testing arrangements will contain a series of key performance indicators, including the number of tests per week, the turnaround time for results and targets for contact tracing.It comes after criticism of the nine-day average turnaround from when a test is taken to results returning to the patient. Most experts recommend a 72-hour timeframe.Health officials have promised improvements, and have highlighted a range of technical issues including data-entry errors, a lack of automation and systems that cannot interact with each other which are delaying the issuing of results.The State claimed in March that it could achieve as many as 15,000 tests each day, later revised to 100,000 a week. However, until recent weeks the number of tests carried out has fallen well short of targets, which has contributed to the delays.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said on Wednesday he accepted some targets had not been met, but he said the HSE was now in a position to carry out 100,000 tests per week. He was confident the HSE could achieve a 72-hour turnaround time for test results and tracing.“I absolutely accept criticisms from anyone that says we should have done that sooner, but I can also guarantee that absolutely everyone across the system is pulling out all the stops to get to this point.“The target is absolutely to have a test result turnaround time of 72 hours, but it’ll never be 100 per cent, you know. There isn’t a test that I’m aware of where you get the results within 72 hours 100 per cent of the time.” Three daysFianna Fáil health spokesman Stephen Donnelly said the median turnaround for test results was currently five days, far short of the target of three days. He said the figures supplied to him by the HSE were “hugely underwhelming… It is very disappointing to hear it is taking so long.”His Sinn Féin counterpart, Louise O’Reilly, said it was more than six weeks since the target of 15,000 per day was announced. “They missed it and there is nothing to suggest that another target will help. The target is meaningless without the necessary tracing and isolation facilities.” The HSE said on Wednesday evening that the median time from referral for testing to the completion of contact tracing was “circa four days when you consider hospitals and community together”.Community tests – those not taken in hospitals or residential settings – take a median time of five days to complete the process, whereas hospital cases take a day to complete testing and another day for tracing, although this can be longer in complex cases. Such complex cases are more common in hospitals and care homes or direct provision centres as there may be more contacts, or there may be language barriers or complications arising from a person’s illness or even death. Challenging“The recent testing of residential care facilities was particularly challenging in ensuring the timely notification of results as there were thousands of residents and staff across over 600 settings. This process obviously pushes out the average time for contact tracing,” the HSE said.It said that it had no accurate figures on the split between complex and non-complex cases at the moment, but prior to the mass testing of nursing homes, “approximately 80 per cent of cases were marked as routine”.A senior HSE source told The  that the majority of tests would be turned around in 72 hours, but there would “always be outliers for more complex cases”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Scouting Ireland makes an \u0026lsquoorganisational apology\u0026rsquo to survivors of child sex abuseChief executive Paul Reid acknowledges service \u0026lsquoneeds to improve\u0026rsquo turnaround timesSenior officers frustrated at perceived Government delays in helping to remove officers\u0026lsquoEveryone who tested positive was removed very quickly\u0026rsquo, Minister tells D\u0026aacuteilScheme to offer childcare to frontline workers scrapped after only six providers applyNZ\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquowellbeing\u0026rsquo approach understood to have influenced FG, FF framework documentConfidential document prepared as frontline workers scheme is scrappedFF health spokesman Stephen Donnelly says median turnaround for test results is currently five days, far short of three-day target\u0026lsquoVery desirable\u0026rsquo that nursing home residents get to see loved ones againThe Food Cult project seeks to understand the social, economic and political relevance of food in 16th century IrelandResearch lives: Barbara Gormley, post-graduate researcher at DCU School of CommunicationsTravel agents are \u0026lsquothe worst off\u0026rsquo industry due to Covid-19, says association headMedical chief rejects Taoiseach\u0026rsquos view schools could reopen earlier than plannedHarold\u0026rsquos Cross bridge was blocked to traffic after object was removed from Grand CanalChild protection expert Ian Elliott\u0026rsquos awaited report into past child sex abuse completedNew system will see space reallocated for pedestrians and cyclists, says councilT\u0026aacutenaiste says government needs \u0026lsquolegitimacy and a majority\u0026rsquo to make decisions requiredIncident involved a tractor on a family farm in the Malin areaOnly six providers volunteered for scheme set up for workers during Covid-19 pandemicEverything you need to know about Ireland\u0026rsquos current test and trace systemStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4252739.1589396614!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus holohan dismisses possibility of reopening schools early","story":"Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan says he is concerned that contacts per Covid-19 case will be driven up should people attend social gatherings during phase one of the easing of coronavirus restrictions. Video: RTÉ\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Tony Holohan, Chief Medical Officer, Department of Health. Photograph: Colin KeeganCollinsThe possibility of schools reopening earlier than planned was dismissed by the State’s chief medical officer as he played down the Taoiseach’s enthusiasm that it could happen sooner.Dr Tony Holohan rejected any view that there there was “mounting evidence” showing that children do not appear to be super spreaders of the coronavirus as previously thought.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said earlier on Wednesday that reopening schools for children was “among the safest things” that the State could do, pointing to a report by State regulator, the Health Information and Quality Authority, and comments by WHO official Mike Ryan.“The emerging evidence is that among the safest things that we can do over the next couple of months is to reopen our schools and to reopen our childcare facilities to allow children to return to education and to return to normal life,” Mr Varadkar said.Later, Dr Holohan said that there was “a very small number of studies” involving “small numbers of children” and insufficient evidence to change advice on the reopening of schools.He told the Department of Health’s evening briefing on the Covid-19 epidemic that the State’s National Public Health Emergency Team would be meeting on Thursday to consider whether the first wave of the lockdown relaxations could be proceed as planned next Monday, May 18th.He was “not anticipating at this moment” any changes on schools reopening before planned at the start of next school year from September or in the advice that NPHET would give on that.“We don’t have very many studies at this point in time that looked at this question. Those that have looked at this question haven’t identified a significant pattern of transmission among children,” said Dr Holohan on the studies on transmission of the coronavirus among children.“It is an entirely different thing to conclude in policy terms that we have enough evidence to say that transmission from children doesn’t occur but as yet it hasn’t been identified as a significant issue in the small number of studies that have been done.”New casesThe deaths of another 10 patients from Covid-19 were announced by National Public Health Emergency Team at its briefing on Wednesday. There have now been 1,497 Covid-19 related deaths in the State.There were 159 new cases of Covid-19 confirmed bringing the total number of cases confirmed over the course of the pandemic to 23,401.The median age of confirmed cases is 48 years, according to data from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC). Fifty-seven per cent are female and 43 per cent are male.Thirteen per cent of cases, a total of 3,050, have been hospitalised, with 389 cases admitted to ICU.Dublin has the highest number of cases at 11,242 (49 per cent of all cases), followed by Kildare with 1,344 cases (6 per cent) and Cork with 1,238 cases (5 per cent).Community transmission accounts for 60 per cent, close contact 37 per cent and travel abroad 3 per cent. Eighty-four per cent of people have recovered from coronavirus.ResearchEarlier, the Government has signalled its concern at the increasing numbers of people in the population who feel the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic is over. Research conducted for the Department of Health showed that 43 per cent now believe the worst has passed, which might lead to less adherence to social distancing rules. “We have so far avoided a situation where the system is overwhelmed,” said Liz Canavan of the Department of An Taoiseach at the Government press briefing on Wednesday. “We need to be conscious of the devastating impact of Covid-19. The risk is still there.”She pointed to the World Health Organisation opinion that the virus will recur in waves. She said that even when restrictions were relaxed the public should continue with safe practices as there will be periods when numbers will increase again. “The public are asked to stay the course,” she said.Ms Canavan pointed to more positive figures from other research conducted this week that showed a marked increase in the number of people who will use sanitiser (up to 71 per cent from 59 per cent) who will sit further apart in future (up to 61 per cent from 36 per cent) and who intend to stay at home (up to 34 per cent from 6 per cent). She also said that over 90 per cent were washing their hands regularly and standing the required distance apart in queues. She added that 78 per cent of respondents now said they coughed into their elbow and adhered to the guidance on coughing etiquette.Water shortageMeanwhile, the prolonged period of dry weather has led to the possibility of water shortages, the Government has said. In the daily briefing at Government buildings, households were asked to introduce measures to conserve water. The conservation advice does not apply to hand-washing with people being advised to wash their hands as regularly as they can. That should have priority over less essential uses of water.Ms Canavan said that households should avoid using power washers, use watering cans rather than hoses in gardens, and also to fix leaky taps. She said that Irish Water had issued guidance for households, businesses and farms on how best to conserve water.At a Government briefing, it was also disclosed that the Garda has invoked the Covid-regulation a total of 192 times since March. That includes arresting people for not observing the emergency laws, as well as taking names and addresses of those who have failed to comply with the rules. The Garda continue to report a very high level of compliance throughout the State.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4252512.1589399706!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus q a why does contact tracing matter","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tExperts have said in recent days the entire testing and contact tracing continuum has to be completed within three days.. Photograph: Francesca VolpiBloombergWhy does test and trace matter?As we move out of lockdown, breaking the chains of transmission – identifying and contacting people who have been in touch with known cases before they asymptomatically spread the virus – is the cornerstone of returning to a “new normal”. If this is not effective, we may lose control of the virus again, and end up back in lockdown.What does it involve?Experts have said in recent days the entire testing and contact tracing continuum has to be completed within three days. That means from the time you’re referred for swabbing to the time all your contacts are interviewed.According to information released by the HSE on Wednesday evening, the median time from referral for testing to completion of contact tracing is “circa four days when you consider hospitals and community together”. It did not provide updated information on average times, but previously it has said the contact tracing element takes on average 36 hours, and testing takes on average 2.4 days.For tests taken among the community, ie not in residential facilities or hospitals, the median turnaround time is five days. Hospitals can get the whole process done in around two days.The HSE says a positive test result is uploaded to the Covid Care Tracker system in 90 minutes. The aim then is to do three calls as quickly as possible. Call one informs someone of their status, call two gathers close contact information, and call three is to the close contacts. Unanswered calls are repeated, which can add time.Is it going fast enough?Based on information the HSE released on Wednesday evening (the figure changes every day), across the last seven days it takes a median of 0.6 days to get swabbed, 3.5 days to get a lab result for a community test, and one day for contact tracing to commence and be completed.It is not clear how contact tracing can commence and be completed in one day if, as the HSE has said, it takes a median time of 20 hours to complete the first of three calls in the process.It seems a best case scenario, say for a healthcare worker who is not a complex case (and therefore easy and fast to trace), the process might be completed in two days. The process in the community is now taking a median time of five days. But as the HSE says, these figures are medians, so routine tracing may be faster and very complex tracing can take longer.The information supplied suggests that on most occasions outside hospitals, the process is taking much longer than experts believe it should.What is slowing it down?Because testing was targeted last month at residential facilities, direct provision, care homes and hospitals, there hasn’t been a vast amount of community testing done, and only around half of our capacity for testing was used last week. Therefore, there was less tracing to do as well.But there has been a lot of complex cases. Interviewing someone who has no English, or who has dementia, about their contacts in the past 10 days can be hard. Also, healthcare workers might come into contact with dozens of people, including vulnerable patients.While these complex cases are certainly slowing things down, other factors should be positively affecting turnaround time. For example, fast testing for healthcare workers should positively affect average turnaround times, while low numbers of contacts during lockdown should also be aiding speed.Is anything else slowing it down?Yes. Much of the testing system was built from scratch, in a hurry. Manual data entry results in errors. Sometimes key contact information is missing. Computer systems aren’t talking to each other. The failure to complete significant IT infrastructure upgrades like unique patient identifiers and lab information management systems appears to be playing a role.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4252795.1589434264!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"annual budget to focus on wellbeing of people as well as economic measures","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar confirmed  that the State would “probably” borrow €30bn  this year, which was at the outer limits of the Government’s worst-case scenario calculations  a month agoA new method of calculating the annual budget to focus on the “wellbeing” of people as well as economic measurements is being discussed in government formation talks.The Green Party has raised a new “wellbeing budget” with Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil. The party has cited the New Zealand “wellbeing budget” model first introduced by prime minister Jacinda Ardern’s government last year.The New Zealand approach is based on the idea that the long-term impact of polices on people’s lives is better than measuring progress from economic data.The first wellbeing budget in New Zealand saw significant investment in mental health, measures to combat domestic violence and major funding for improving children’s wellbeing, such as tackling child poverty. It also focused on climate measures, a digital economy and supporting minority groups such as the Maori community.The idea was discussed in a session on the economy on Wednesday, with sources saying budgeting must focus on “quality of life rather than economic growth”.The approach of Ms Ardern’s administration is understood to have influenced key people in Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil as they drew up the framework document – which included an “overriding focus...to improve the wellbeing of the Irish people and society” – between their two parties.It was pointed out by a well placed source that Gabriel Makhlouf, the governor of the Central Bank, was a key figure in the New Zealand treasury when this new approach was implemented, and that an Irish model should be driven by the Department of Finance.The meeting on the economy between the three parties was given a presentation by Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe. He is said to have “laid it on the line”, with sources in both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael saying that all parties in the next government must be aware of the challenges and choices that lie ahead as the country emerges from the Covid-19 crisis. TransitionTánaiste Simon Coveney is said to have spoken about the risk of Britain exiting the post-Brexit transition with the EU without a deal at the end of the year.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar confirmed on Wednesday that the State would “probably” borrow €30 billion this year, which was at the outer limits of the Government’s worst-case scenario calculations less than a month ago.The Stability Programme Update in mid-April said the deficit would be €23 billion, but Mr Donohoe said this could rise to €30 billion if economic recovery was delayed.Numerous government figures, as well as those involved in coalition talks, said a deficit of €30 billion is now the likeliest scenario.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4252788.1589403912!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord bickering d%C3%A1il flesh pressers try to un lay a report about alan shatter","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t The unsinkable Alan Shatter. Did he lay an egg along with everything else? Is there no end to the man’s talent?  Photograph: Brenda FitzsimonsSocial distancing is a terrible imposition on the professional flesh-presser. They are doing their best to cope in Leinster House.But political distancing? That’s no bother at all. How far? How wide? For how long do we hold our noses before settling down in government with the crowd we dislike the least? At the beginning of the week, the work of the much trumpeted 19-member Covid-19 Committee fizzled to an undistinguished start. Due to an unexpectedly robust outbreak of political distancing, members of the CoCo 1919 spent all day bickering behind closed doors, before eventually reaching an accommodation on their working arrangements. One bone of contention was the choice of witnesses for next week’s opening hearing. Despite passionate arguments from terribly miffed Fine Gael TDs against the non-inclusion of their illustrious leader Leo Varadkar in the line-up for the high-profile first meeting, the list remains confined to the country’s three most senior health officials.Working arrangements are a major preoccupation of the Dáil’s complement of political distancers. Like spoilt toddlers on the look-out for sharp practice when the sweeties are doled out, TDs and political parties are instinctively vigilant to the threat of being short-changed by political rivals. “Not fair. They got more than us!” Normal PeopleThis is why the Business Committee, with its power to vy out speaking time and schedule debates, holds more intense sessions in private than your average episode of Normal People. Deputies who sit on it are well used to receiving urgent summonses to discuss overturning their latest decision because the colleagues who delegated them to make it have suddenly decided they don’t like it anymore.The Divvy-out Committee had already agreed the schedule for this week’s two sittings when the House reconvened, but a blast from a tenacious politician past soon upset the plans. And by teatime the members were back in conclave. Included in their running order for Thursday was a motion to strike the Guerin report from the Dáil record. The report, commissioned by Enda Kenny’s government in 2014, found that then justice minister Alan Shatter mishandled Garda misconduct allegations. The unsinkable Shatter embarked on a successful legal campaign to clear his name, and a Supreme Court ruling sealed it.The motion to remove the report from the Dáil library was tabled at the behest of the Taoiseach and the Ceann Comhairle in light of the judgment. The Business Committee agreed it would be taken without debate. Sinn Féin’s Aengus Ó Snodaigh was firmly against the move but he was outvoted. ReservationsWhen it came up for mention on the floor of the Dáil on Wednesday, the TD for Dublin South Central expressed his reservations again. This time he got a torrent of support, and when the time came for TDs to rubberstamp the committee’s Thursday schedule (including the now heavily questioned Shatter motion) they voted to scrap it.The long-suffering Ceann Comhairle sighed heavily, and called an urgent meeting of his Business Committee for later in the afternoon, otherwise there would be nothing to do or talk about the next day. If he was looking in, Shatter, a controversial figure when he was minister, must have been feeling very hard done by. Are his erstwhile parliamentary peers so bitter they would rather overlook a Supreme Court judgment than allow him justice in parliament and an admission that he was right? (A concept Shatter never had any difficulty with himself throughout a long political career.)But this was nothing personal. It wasn’t about Alan. It was to do with procedure and precedent.“I don’t have any problem with the court judgment in relation to the Sean Guerin report. People might recall what that is – it was a vindication of former deputy Shatter,” explained Ó Snodaigh, who, while never the former minister’s biggest fan, was not trying to do him down.Un-lay an eggBut, as Brendan Howlin so delicately put it: “You can no more un-lay a report than a hen can un-lay an egg.” What’s this got to do with eggs?Did Shatter lay an egg along with everything else? Is there no end to the man’s talent?No. Varadkar laid the un-laying egg out of the blue, and then the Ceann Comhairle agreed to sit on it. Deputies were very surprised when they found out. They were taken aback, and expressed concern about this very unnatural idea of un-laying something which has already been laid in front of them. Then there was the whole other story of trying to pass a motion while reversing the laying process.Can it be done at all, wondered TDs on all sides? They demanded more time to work it out. It would be an unconscionable strain on the democratic process otherwise.The Ceann Comhairle moved to soothe ruffled feathers. “Our legal advice is that the motion before the House can un-lay the laid report. I know you can’t put the egg back after it’s been laid,” clucked Seán O’Fearghaíl, looking a bit broody after the Business Committee’s best laid plans were lying on the chamber floor in smithereens, like Humpty Dumpty.Legal adviceÓ Snodaigh said the committee had no legal advice regarding the motion, and there seemed no reason or justification for this sudden urge to rush through the un-laying of the Shatter egg. Withdrawing a report from the Oireachtas library has never happened before, he continued. Furthermore, the act requires the involvement of the Seanad, which currently only exists in the form of an unfertilised egg and won’t be pushed out anywhere until a new government is formed.“So I think we are being previous on this,” concluded Aengus, to the general agreement of all but the few Fine Gael TDs present.Social Democrat Catherine Murphy talked about the “specific” and the “general”. The majority of Deputies have no issue with the specific case involving the unlaying of the Shatter-shaped egg but “it’s the consequences or the unintended consequences that could follow on from doing this” which were causing concern. Government chief whip Peter Burke stressed “natural justice” should not be denied any former member of the Dáil. “This issue was discussed at the Business Committee and has been in gestation for a while.”Sticking his beak inMeanwhile, one of Shatter’s successors in Justice flapped into the chamber. Charlie Flanagan was like a hen on a hot griddle, anxious to stick his beak in. The motion was fully in order, and he took exception to Catherine Murphy’s remarks about “unintended consequences” when it was simply addressing the “result of misrepresentation, innuendo and debate of some years ago”. Her “further accusations” were unfounded. Murphy, nonplussed, repeated she has no issue with removing the Guerin report, but just wants to be sure it does not spark attempts to have other reports removed from the record. “What are the unintended consequences? Everything is a conspiracy for you,” roared the Minister. She told him TDs merely wanted to make sure things are done right from a legal perspective.But there was no convincing Charlie. “It’s a daily conspiracy,” he squawked, politically distancing himself from the Social Democrat’s co-leader.The House agreed by a large majority to reject Thursday’s timetable and the motion was thrown out, for now.It’ll be back though. Sure as eggs is eggs."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4253219.1589445995!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus shows society in better shape than we thought","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAnti-lockdown protesters  near the steps of the Michigan state capitol building in Lansing last month. Photograph: Paul SancyaAPIn Michigan, gun-toting men demand the reopening of businesses. In Florida, gym regulars do roadside push-ups to protest at the closure of their facilities. In California, Tesla starts its car plant again in the teeth of local restrictions. If impatience to resume normal life builds as spring becomes summer, the past few days will be remembered as the inflexion point.Until such time, though, the dissent is more striking for its smallness and slowness in coming. All of the flash points above stand out in a wider context of general compliance.For upwards of two months now, people in the US and other democracies have mostly gone along with mass confinement and economic torpor. They have done so on the guidance of a political class they are meant to despise and unelected experts that they are assumed to mistrust.It has been likened to wartime discipline, but this is to undersell it a tad. Wars at least give us an enemy with a name and a face to unite against. The virus is invisible and, except for those of a medical ken, hard to understand. The show of civic togetherness is all the more impressive for that.Nor can it be said that people have had no other choice. Had, say, one-fifth of the population bucked the rules, the government would have been left with very little recourse. Unable to police that many, the choice would have been martial law or some degree of capitulation. Civilised order ultimately rests on consent. We are forced to entertain the possibility that society is in better shape than billed. This stark news I address to conservatives but also to the left, as both sides have come to traffick in versions of cultural declinism.For the first, the problem is several decades of irreligion, permissiveness and the debasement of a national way of life through immigration. For the second, the problem is several decades of unfettered markets and the commodification of people. But both converge on the same bleak picture: an atomised and decadent society, less than the sum of its parts, brittle for all its outward riches. Both are nostalgic for the mid-20th century, when most western nations were more homogenous and more equal.Theirs is an analysis that makes intuitive sense. In fact, it is strange that it is not true. If liberalism means anything, it is that society has limited claims on the inidual. Collective action must therefore be harder to pull off.Hobbesian free-for-allAnd yet if it were as straightforward as that, the past two months would have been much uglier. We should have seen more resistance, more quickly, to a lockdown that has no precedent in peacetime. And cities, those pits of liberalism, should have been the most anarchic. The Republican senator Ted Cruz once referred to “New York values”, which he implied were selfish and nihilistic. Well, the city has been the worst-afflicted part of the US, and it has not yet curdled into a Hobbesian free-for-all.At the least, I expected public pressure for a more bespoke shutdown, isolating the old and the otherwise vulnerable. In fact, we are seeing almost the opposite clamour. By two to one, Americans worry that restrictions will be lifted too soon, not too slowly. That margin is unchanged since early April. Many did not even wait for their state governor’s edict before cloistering themselves.The dissenters are real and it takes only a small number to undo a whole nation’s public health efforts. They may yet multiply to ruinous effect. But their photogenic gatherings fool us that they, not general obedience, has been the story. And it is obedience that, at least in the US, is achieved through mutual social pressure as much as through uniformed agents of state. The lightness of policing in Washington, capital of the world’s most militarised democracy, has been scarcely believable.As the shutdown eases, it is natural to anticipate better days. But in one sense, there is good news already behind us. The shutdown was a test of the social fabric’s tensile strength. The cloth is still in one piece. Fiscal support helps, as does fear of infirmity or death. But there are cultural pessimists who would not have predicted such discipline, even with these things.It turns out that liberalism does not by definition breed egoism and irresolution. A lot of the easy calumnies against it (“We could never fight a war now”) appear less certain. And if the “horizontal” bond among citizens is a bit stronger than assumed, so is their “vertical” cord with government. Anti-elitism – the spirit of the age, we thought – is broad but it can also be shallow, or at least selective. The speed with which people deferred to the medical and bureaucratic establishment was telling. The crisis has found nothing more wanting than our cynicism. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"one sided view empire no way understand britains past","story":"Nothing better illustrates how moral perceptions change over time than Britons’ view of their erstwhile empire. When prime minister Benjamin Disraeli arranged for Queen Victoria to become Empress of India in 1877, he could not have flattered his monarch more yet today “imperialism” is used almost exclusively as a pejorative. I don’t think that it’s sufficient for us today simply to assume that we are morally superior to our ancestors (still less that we have achieved moral perfection). We need to understand how people at the time believed that they were doing good, as they created the world’s largest ever empire.A population that had been brought up studying the history of Rome did not think empires bad. The Romans had “civilised” Europe, spreading their literature, architecture and civil engineering. The emperors had latterly become Christian and when Rome was at last overrun by “barbarians”, a long “Dark Age” followed. Such thinking may have influenced those who saw a need to convert other people to Christianity.“We seem … to have conquered and peopled half the world in a fit of absence of mind,” wrote a historian at the end of the 19th century. There is much truth in that, although the English took some deliberate steps, such as when Elizabeth I, in 1583, granted Walter Raleigh a charter to found a colony (Virginia), or when Oliver Cromwell’s navy seized Jamaica from Spain in 1655. But Massachusetts was founded not by government but by religious refugees, while the colonisation of Canada and India was driven forward by private companies and Australia developed, accidentally, from penal colonies.Having grabbed Jamaica, England lacked the means to defend it and recruited pirates for the task. From Port Royal, the “privateers” set out to plunder Spanish ships. Given Great Britain’s weakness, it was a diplomatic coup in 1670 to wring from Spain recognition of its Caribbean and Atlantic colonies in return for suppressing piracy.The island required a new economic activity. The climate was ideal for sugar but deemed too harsh for white workers, so enslaved people were brought from West Africa to Jamaica (and Virginia too). In the seventeenth century, few people regarded slavery as a moral issue. It had been practised during all of history. Africans had enslaved other Africans. Barbary pirates had seized white Christians. Arab traders had systematically plundered Africa for slaves.However, the European powers enslaved Africans on an industrial scale. According to one estimate, the British shipped 3.4 million people to its colonies, second only to Portugal, out of a total of more than 12 million seized and transported across the Atlantic during the 16th and 19th centuries. The Caribbean islands were, for some time, Britain’s most prized colonies, and the profits helped to launch the industrial revolution.Britain suffered one of its worst humiliations with the loss of its 13 colonies that declared independence in 1776 and became the United States. Americans had established impressive representative systems of government (the Virginia General Assembly has been making laws since 1619), and they had developed a creed of liberty that drew on British political philosophers. The revolutionaries rejected not only Crown misrule but monarchy and aristocracy.Many Americans who opposed the revolution headed across the northern border and subsequent waves of immigrants from the British Isles into Canada established it as a monarchist stronghold. After the British Empire abolished the slave trade in 1807, and slavery from 1834, British Canada represented a moral rebuke to the US, where human bondage continued.The British in southern Africa fell victim to colossal greed. Both they, and the earlier Dutch settlers, known as Boers, regarded the lands as uninhabited, whereas in fact they were seized from indigenous peoples. The British battled first the Zulus and then the Boers, when gold was found in their settlements. Our resort to concentration camps to hem in the indigenous and Boer populations, with massive loss of life, remains one of the most disgraceful episodes in our history. Perhaps weakened by shame, after that war the British negotiated with the Boers a constitution for South Africa that segregated the populations on racial lines and granted to blacks only a tiny portion of the land. The origins of Apartheid clearly lie in the British colonial period.India was described by the British as the jewel in the imperial crown. That was not just because of its fabulous wealth, much of which was exported by the British East India Company or purloined by its corrupt managers. It was in India that Britain established the most perfect form of empire.After the Indian rebellion of 1857 the East India Company was sacked. The second sons of great families who thereafter went to administer the Raj dedicated their lives to the place, as did those of lesser rank who managed railways, post offices or settled as missionaries. You can argue that the ministries and railways were created so that a tiny number of whites could control a vast population of brown-skinned people. Undoubtedly so. However, those measures unified hundreds of ethnic groups and so created India (which then included Pakistan, Bangladesh and Burma). Peoples who spoke thousands of different languages acquired a common tongue: English. It is telling that Gandhi depended on the British-built railways to spread the message of independence, spoke in English, and employed his mastery of English law to embarrass the Raj.In the 21st century, we rightly condemn imperialism (and there remain plenty of current examples). The British began to repent long ago, leading the world away from slavery and closing down the rapacious East India Company. But it is important to understand that much that was done in the name of empire was regarded at the time as laudable, not wicked: it is important because, otherwise, we may think that we today have achieved “virtue”, whereas our values will surely prove as transitory as our ancestors’.“Portillo’s Empire Journey” starts on Channel 5 from this Friday at 9pmMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"matt hancock doesnt understand going holiday means us brits","story":"When Matt Hancock dismissively announced there would be no “big lavish international holidays” this year due to Covid-19, my first thought was entirely unrepeatable. My second thought went along the lines of “who-the-hell-are-you-to-crush-our-collective-hopes-of-blue-skies-and-Magnums-on-a-Costa?”On the evidence of his peevish podium performances a lot of us had already guessed the Health and Social Care Secretary lacks the empathy gene. Now we have cast-iron proof that Hancock-up is also afflicted by Type 2 pomposity, degenerative officiousness and, above all, a tin ear. Has the man no soul? Or just no idea? Package deals, boutique hotels, city breaks – these are what the British live for.Particularly the womenfolk. A full 88 per cent of us take the lead in organising the couple’s getaway or family holiday. Why? Because, in this regard, most men are at sea we alone know exactly what everyone in the household needs. A break. A change of air and dynamics and routine. It is this delayed gratification, this dizzy prospect of going somewhere else, just for a week, a fortnight, that enables us to keep calm and carry on at the best of times.Here, in what are the worst of times, trips to new parks, illicit picnics and schlepping toddlers on long car journeys to wave at grandparents through conservatory windows have become crucial stepping stones, the pleasurable punctuations guiding us through the drudgery of daily life.I think we can all agree that nobody should be whisking their family off to Covid-free Kiribati, recklessly shedding the virus like Gaugin passing round syphilis on Tahiti. But by the summer, parts of Europe, such as France, will be happy to have us. Perceived lavishness when we arrive remains in the eye of the beholder. But is the Government really saying that if and when international flights resume in earnest, we’re not allowed to take them? Unless Dominic Raab is willing to patrol Heathrow departures with a team of iels trained to detect contraband sarongs, I’m not sure how anyone can stop us.What is truly exasperating is that, despite his Cabinet brief, Matt Hancock seems to have a pitiful grasp of mental health and how to maintain it. Clue: isolation and staying indoors may safeguard us physically, but there’s real harm being done to our heads. Holidays are not a luxury. They are a necessity. In the current coronavirus climate they are the beacon of light at the end of the (Channel) tunnel, the Brenner Pass, the Sawantwadi-Dodamarg Wildlife Corridor.Hancock bossily telling us on television that they aren’t going to happen has hit public morale right in the solar apoplexus. Which is to say: we are furious. Maybe holidays could be rebranded as Mental Health Retreats? Would self-care sanctuaries chime better with the insistence on nanny state joylessness?The British public are not stupid. We understand that whole countries are in a state of flux and that the holiday we planned may not be possible. If that is so, we will improvise, but we will make it happen if we can.What we will not accept are peremptory lectures from a government minister slapping us down like children for daring to dream. In truth, Matt Hancock appears so socially distanced from common sense, he could probably do with a holiday.I suggest his wife goes ahead and books one.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"obstructive public officials could sorely use dose private sector","story":"At the supermarkets, one-way systems keep us all safely a few feet apart. The garden centres have closed their coffee shops and are using the space for collections instead. Marketing agencies, law firms, engineers and accountants have all started to find ways of mixing home and office working, even if it means taking the occasional shortcut. My local Indian is doing fantastic takeaways, and so is the pub, while my daughter’s prep school has cut its fees and is running home classes, even including chapel.Over the last few weeks, the private sector has adapted to a world in which a highly infectious, though not usually lethal, virus may be around for a long time. There’s one problem, however. The public sector is fighting change tooth and nail and, even where it is willing to adapt, it is holding both the Government and public to ransom by demanding ever-higher wages.As the UK economy faces up to its greatest crisis in three hundred years we are re-learning with a vengeance that the biggest strength of a free market is its ability to cope with uniquely challenging situations – and the biggest weakness of the public sector is its refusal either to change or to listen to its customers.There are many different ways in which private businesses are starting to create a socially distanced economy. Food production has been redesigned for a world without restaurants. Work is being done from home. Meetings are shifting online. Retailers are turning into home delivery companies, and tech start-ups are pivoting towards healthcare, wellbeing and home entertainment.All of this is happening in the blink of an eye. No doubt those companies would prefer not to be doing any of that. Few of us especially enjoy change. But until we have an effective vaccine or cure for Covid-19 there isn’t much choice. With every day that passes, however, the contrast with the public sector is becoming more and more painful.Teaching unions are virtually refusing to re-open schools, and are resisting moves towards online lessons, even though it means children will fall behind with their learning, and without the schools the rest of the economy can scarcely function. The transport unions are resisting redesigning train and tube travel to keep systems safe and operational, even though there is no way of re-starting production if people cannot get to work.We all salute the work of medics and care home workers, but in a year when the living wage has already been increased by three times the rate of inflation it is not obvious that pay rises are as much of a priority as the health unions seem to think they are.Meanwhile, Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, is demanding a bigger and bigger role for her shop stewards in policing whether a workplace is “safe” or not. Very soon we may have re-created a 1970s economy in which swaggering, power-hungry unions control every aspect of production, entirely for their own benefit, and with zero regard for their customers.Things were not like this during World War II, probably the only comparable national emergency of the last century. On the whole, the trade unions were wholehearted supporters of the war effort, switching the economy towards the manufacture of munitions and supplies, and improvising to keep factories open. No one downed their tools half way through the latest batch of Spitfires in an argument over health and safety.True, perhaps Churchill’s government of national unity, which bought in union leaders such as Ernest Bevin as Minister for Labour, helped. There might be a case for something similar as this crisis unfolds (although it is, to put it mildly, quite a leap to imagine Len McCluskey becoming the new Bevin).At present it is hard to see this happening. It seems far more likely that the unions will not be on the side of getting the economy working again, and nor will a Labour Party still dominated by public sector workers despite its new, supposedly moderate leadership.As ever, the private sector will adapt, change and evolve – but it would be a heck of a lot easier to weather this crisis if the public sector had just a slither of the same “can-do” spirit.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed educated guesswork uncertainty lead britain lockdown","story":"It was only a small cartoon, and probably intended as a joke.But the drawing chosen by the UK’s chief pandemic modeller to accompany a recent lecture was telling, nonetheless.Taken from the satirical magazine Private Eye, the cartoon showed a bespectacled scientist standing beside a graph marked ‘Covid cases’.Underneath, the caption read: “We have, according to the revised projection of the adjusted figures, something more or less approaching no idea.” The presentation to around 100 Cambridge University students and academics was delivered on Monday evening by Professor Graham Medley, the man in charge of predicting the impact of coronavirus on the UK.A recording of the hour-long speech, obtained by the , provides the most detailed insight yet into the deep uncertainty facing the government’s key scientific advisors, as they try to predict the course of a deadly virus never seen before.It also, however, casts serious doubt on the strength of evidence relied upon by ministers to chart the UK’s course out of lockdown.Professor Medley oversees mathematical modelling for the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, including the famous forecasts made by Professor Neil Fegsuon of Imperial College London.Scientists from nine other leading universities across the UK are working with the government’s SPI-M sub-committee, which he chairs.But during his online lecture, organised by the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences, Professor Medley admitted that a lack of reliable data meant his team were struggling to make solid predictions backed up by evidence.At the moment, we\u0027re having to do it by making educated guesswork, and intuition and experience, rather than being able to do it in some kind of semi-formal way,” Prof Medley told his audience.“But a half good answer given before the decision is made, is infinitely more useful than a perfect answer given after the decision is made.”None of the official models relied upon by ministers yet include critical data on how Covid-19 might be spread in shops, pubs, gyms and hairdressers, he said.“If we want to get an idea of when, for example, in the United Kingdom, we\u0027re going to be able to open pubs - we’re going to have to understand how people might use them. Professor Medley and his team are also in charge of calculating the national ‘R number’, the most important of five tests that must be passed before the UK can begin to return to normal life. But he admitted that making accurate calculations had been difficult because “many of the data streams immediately are missing”. Basic information such as age, occupation was often “quite reasonably” absent from forms filled out in busy hospitals, he said.Teachers are believed by the by scientists to be more at risk of catching coronavirus from their colleagues than from children in the classroom, Prof Medley revealed.As schools prepare to reopen, he said evidence showed that children are “not playing a key role” in transmitting the disease. Unions have fiercely opposed plans to reopen some classes over fears that staff would be put in danger, but Prof Medley suggested teachers would be relatively safe as long as they sat 2m apart in the staff room.The “current understanding” was that children are not playing a key role in transmitting Covid-19, he added.“In terms of teachers, actually data from Australia suggests that teachers are very good at transmitting to each other, but less good at transmitting to the children.So the staff room potentially is a kind of a bigger hub of transmission than the classroom. We\u0027re still watching that space very closely.Prof Medley said that a “policy science gap” meant scientists were struggling to explain their complex findings to ministers and officials, and were met with “blank faces” nearly every day.A key part of his role, he said, was to translate scientific ideas so people in charge could understand them.I think that infectious disease modellers have an intuitive understanding of the way in which the dynamics work, which is just not shared at all by other people, and I think that\u0027s part of the policy science gap,” he said. “Part of the translation is that I can use words and concepts which for me are third nature, and they meet with blank faces. It\u0027s very hard to think of a specific example, because, in fact, it\u0027s a daily occurrence.”Much of the work has been around changing scientific language into everyday words that ministers, officials and the public can understand.At the beginning of the epidemic, lockdown measures were referred to as ‘non pharmaceutical interventions’, but the term was changed to ‘behavioral and social interventions’, and then finally to ‘lockdown’, he said.Scientists in charge of predicting the next pandemic to hit the UK failed to advise the government on how to prepare for a national lockdown, Prof Medley admitted.Planning documents prepared by his own SPI-M committee had never explored how and why the British public should be kept in their homes.The biggest surprise so far this pandemic has been the public health response,” he said.“If you look at these SPI-M documents, nowhere does it talk about lockdown. Nowhere does it talk about a nationally coordinated reduction in contact rates.“A much overused word, but this really does have no precedent nationally, let alone to be repeated globally.Professor Medley also suggested that a lack of “battle rhythm” in the early stages of the epidemic meant the response to Covid19 had taken “some time to sort out”.As Sage was being stood up in early February, scientists and civil servants were suddenly thrust into positions of national responsibility, he said.As the epidemic begins to weaken, scientists are working on how to map the UK’s “social geography” to predict where new outbreaks might occur, Prof Medley revealed.Instead of locking down inidual towns and cities, he suggested that the key to stopping new outbreaks might be breaking social links between friends and family living in different parts of the country.Scientists are working on a new ‘R star’ value which maps the reproduction rate between households, he revealed.“Do we need geographically specific networks? I think we will. But just as important is the social geography, if you like,” he said. “The fact that personally, I have more connection with towns where I have friends and relations living, that might be 60 or 70 miles away from here than I do with the local town.”Mapping social geography will be especially important in tackling sporadic outbreaks as the overall transmission rate goes down, he added.Each country around the world will have to battle covid-19 on its own, and should not expect outside help, Prof Medley said.“Each country has its own kind of cultural and regulatory backgrounds and social interactions,” he said.So there will be international collaboration and cooperation in terms of trying to understand the epidemiology and hopefully doing the modelling as well. But I suspect that each country will have to find its own way through, from now until whenever the end is.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"schools start opening amid covid 19 children nothing","story":"Around the world school gates are reopening after months of lockdown which left playgrounds empty and classrooms forlorn.But where there were once excited shouts as children arrived for a new day, there are now instructions to keep your distance and regularly wash your hands.As children return to class in countries that have begun to ease their lockdown measures, new school regimes have been introduced to minimise the risk of renewed infections leading to a second wave of Covid-19.How countries manage the return of pupils is being watched closely in Britain, where the Government has asked primary schools to reopen on June 1 for reception, Year 1 and Year 6.Parisian nursery teacher Dominique Sicard has been pouring over a 57-page protocol from the French education ministry on how to respect social distancing with a class of five-year olds and is categorical.“If the people who govern us think we can respect all this to the letter, there’s no point in re-opening at all,” said the 53-year-old.“I’ve already warned parents that while children will have a table and chair with their name on, it is impossible for them to remain at that desk all day. Most are happy with it.”As France slowly re-emerges from two months of confinement, the Ecole des Trois Bornes in Paris is one of tens of thousands of the country’s nursery and primary schools opening its doors to around 1.5 million pupils this week, roughly a quarter of the total.While nursery and primary schools in France’s “green”low-infection areas began classes on Tuesday, those in Paris - deep red given ongoing contagion levels - only start widening intake beyond the offspring of essential critical workers on Thursday.Among a long list of sanitary measures, teachers must wear face masks and the children\u0027s chairs be separated to avoid spreading the disease.One Ms Sicard and colleagues have already written off is to coop children inside a metre-square enclosure in the playground far from their classmates.“It’s inhuman and impossible. Five-year-olds need to be able to run around and let off steam otherwise they lose the plot,” she said.Pupils are not supposed to touch teachers and vice versa. “But what about a child that hurts itself and requires treatment, can’t hang its coat up or goes to the toilet and can’t do its trousers up?,” she asked.“We can’t turn them into adults just because the context dictates they should act as adults. If they see their friends, they’ll want to go and play with them,” she said.That said, she said many of the rules will be applied, including disinfecting toys and surfaces.Despite her reservations, she said she approved of France re-opening schools in particular out of “solidarity for families whose parents have to work”.Paris’ town hall expects 600 of its 652 primary and nursery schools to open this week to welcome a quarter of its 130,000 pupils. Nation-wide, most will re-open but classes will be small - a maximum of 10 in nursery schools and 15 in elementary schools.“There are more risks in staying home than going to school,” insisted education minister Jean-Michel Blanquer.The return to school is on a voluntary basis and the vast majority of children remain at home. Teachers are supposed to juggle with real and remote teaching.Secondary school children are not due back until May 25.Unions have criticised the decision to reopen the schools calling it “premature and pointing out that the government overruled its scientific committee’s advice to keep them shut until September, like the UK.Why have we started with the youngest children to end the lockdown when we know they\u0027ll be the hardest ones to make apply protective measures? said Francette Popineau, chief of the primary school union, on FranceInfo radio.Parents have mixed feelings. Bruno Timsit, 41, is keeping his three children away from nursery, primary and secondary school for now.“It wasn’t an easy decision but we decided there is no rush. We weren’t sure how schools were going to cope and were a bit worried about the kids contaminating each other and us,” he said.“I also with the idea of leaving it to parents to decide whether to take risk of sending they kids back to school. The government should have taken responsibility and either called everyone back or no.”However, Tarek Elachkar, 45, said he “decided to trust the official guidelines”. His nine-year old daughter Olivia will return to primary school on Thursday.“She misses school. We tried to tell her it would be different but she said she was happy to go back. That nailed it for us,” he said.Nursery headmistress Pascale Chartier said she was not worried about infections. “We have been looking after children of high-risk health workers throughout the confinement period and have had no infections of teachers or pupils,” she said. Studies suggests transmission from children under 10 is very low.“We are being careful but we are confident it will be alright,” she said.Dutch parents have been instructed to ‘kiss and go’ at the school gates, as primary children in the Netherlands began a staggered return this week.It would be normal for parents in primary school to take their kids into the classroom in the morning. But most schools are now asking parents to drop their children at the school gates or at the doors and stay out of the premises to minimise the risk of spreading infection.Audrey Verschuren, principal of the Leonardo Da Vinci school in Amsterdam, which admits half its children in the morning and half in the afternoon, said: “The parents have had to get used to it. It\u0027s a bit nerve-wracking for them to see their four-year-old child who has been with us for just two months walk into the classroom on their own! But children get used to new situations quickly and always find the fun side.Each school has come up with its own solution to keep the required 1.5m distance between staff and pupils.Ribbons mark out one-way routes and there are separate entrances for different age groups. Older or vulnerable teachers do not have to return to work, while some schools have taped off a ‘safe area’ for teachers at the front of the class, while children sit at a greater distance at their desks and play outside in their half-class groups. Some parents are still anxious. At the British School of Amsterdam a third have kept their children at home.But Paul Morgan, the schools’ Principal, told The  of the joy of welcoming back those who came.“It has been so heart-warming to see the children back in school: smiling and enjoying seeing their teachers and friends again,” he said.Denmark pioneered the start of the European return to school from May 4 by keeping its primary school children in small groups and with as little contact with others as possible.These micro-groups arrive at a separate time, eat lunch separately, have their own zones in the playground and are taught by one teacher.Dom Maher, head of the international section of St Josef\u0027s school in Roskilde, on the Danish island of Zealand, said: There was anxiety in the community. A large percentage of parents were in two minds.But the Danish experiment appears to have been a success, so much so that the insistence on children washing their hands frequently has led to problems with skin irritation and eczema.Schools began to reopen in Germany last month, but parents and teachers have voiced frustration with measures to contain the virus.Most schools have reduced class sizes so social distancing can be observed, but many can only achieve this by iding classes and teaching children on alternate days. “It’s an absolute farce,” one parent in Berlin said, complaining that her child will only get four days of lessons before the summer holidays under the new timetable.Many parents say employers expect them to be able come back to work because the schools are open and don’t realise they’re still stuck taking care of their children three days a week.Pupils are expected to wear facemasks while entering and leaving but most schools allow them to be removed in the classroom.One school in a remote part of north-eastern Germany has won plaudits for coming up with an alternative solution. Henry Tesch, headmaster of the Carolinum School in Neutsrelitz, says iding classes and teaching on alternate days isn’t an option because of the long distances his pupils have to travel, with some travelling as far as 40 miles each way.So the school is offering coronavirus tests to pupils twice a week, in partnership with a local company.Switzerland has taken a radical approach to reopening schools because its government is convinced children are not at risk from the virus.Swiss authorities recently announced it was safe for grandparents to hug their grandchildren and they have taken the same attitude to reopening schools. “Young children very rarely get infected and transmit the virus to others even less,” Alain Berset, the Swiss interior minister said.Primary and secondary schools were allowed to reopen this week and in most regions they are teaching full classes as usual.A notable exception is Zurich, where classes have been ided in two to prevent overcrowding.Regions have been given considerable autonomy in deciding what measures to take.Authorities in Basel said iding classes “would not solve the problem of childcare for families and would pose additional challenges for teachers”. But there has been resistance to the government advice in areas which have been harder hit by the virus.In Taiwan, which has avoided a lockdown due to its successful pandemic strategy, schools were closed for the month of February, but have since functioned in a relatively normal fashion with some social distancing restrictions.Children have had to wear masks in disinfected classrooms, sit at least 70cm apart and wash their hands after every break. School assemblies were restricted and parents were not permitted to attend sports days but activities like swimming lessons have now resumed.Fergus Meiklejohn, a British filmmaker who lives in Taipei with his wife and two primary school age daughters, said: “For us parents we are happy that the school and government are doing their best. If we had the infection rates currently in the UK, we’d still be scared kids would bring infection back to the family even with these precautions.”.  Sean Kramer, an American teacher based in Taiwan, said: “Kids will be kids and interact with each other, their lives haven’t changed that much. But the school won’t take any chances if a student has a temperature. I’ve had noticeably more absences in my classes this semester.”China - where the coronavirus pandemic began - has been reopening its schools cautiously and in phases, running classes with a maximum of 20 pupils to allow children to sit a safe distance from each other. Some schools are even using video calls so that teachers can instruct classes from a separate room.Students now have shorter lessons and have been told to avoid public transport to and from school.In Hangzhou, children at one elementary school made their own bespoke “social-distancing” hats with metre-long wings to remind them to help them avoid getting too close to each other.In Greece, students in the final year of high school returned to school on Monday, with all other high school students, as well as middle school pupils, going back next week.Each class is limited to 15 to ensure social distancing regulations and break times will be staggered so classes.Schools are livestreaming classes so that they can rotate student attendance and keep classrooms at 50 per cent capacity or below.That decision has been criticised by a national teachers\u0027 union, which says it could infringe on children\u0027s privacy rights.By swiftly implementing a national lockdown, Greece managed to contain its coronavirus outbreak. So far the death toll is just 151 – compared with more than 30,000 in nearby Italy. Around 2,700 people have been infected.Austria was one of the first countries in Europe to lift its lockdown but it is taking a cautious approach to reopening schools.Classes resumed on May 4 for those facing school leaving exams, but for others they do not resume until May 18. Sixth formers who do not have exams will have to wait until June 3.Austria has formalised the practice of iding classes to limit numbers with a clear and simple system to be used across the country.All classes will be ided in two, with one half attending lessons from Monday to Wednesday, and the other on Thursday and Friday. Each week the two groups will swap over, so all children get the same number of lessons.Austria has also taken steps to get round the problem of childcare for parents returning to work.On the days they do not have lessons children will be able to study under supervision in school gyms, if parents wish.Facemasks will be compulsory while moving around the school but not in classrooms. Schools will be issued with “emergency masks” for pupils who forget to bring theirs.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"95000 people flew uk lockdown nearly 5000 may have infected","story":"At least 95,000 people arrived by air to the UK during coronavirus lockdown, a key scientific adviser has revealed.Professor John Aston, the chief scientific adviser to the Home Office, told the Commons science and technology committee that the plane passengers arrived between April 1 and 26, and included a total of 53,000 British citizens.He said: We believe that less than 0.5 per cent of those people arriving potentially had Covid-19.However, that would still mean that about 4,750 people entering the UK had the virus.Prof Aston attempted to clarify his evidence by saying: Less than 0.5 per cent of those arriving were due to the total cases of Covid-19 in the UK.He told the committee that the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) used complicated modelling to calculate the estimate.It requires you to understand the prevalence (of Covid-19) within overseas countries as well as the prevalence within the UK, he said.Yvette Cooper, the Home Affairs Committee chairman who was also part of the hearing, pressed Prof Aston to state how many people arriving in the UK are estimated to have had Covid-19.He said: We are confident that at no point so far from March 23 has the number of cases exceeded 0.5 per cent of the total domestic cases in the UK.Ms Cooper added: That period in the middle of March, we had 40,000 people a week still arriving from Milan, 40,000 people a week still arriving from Madrid.At the same point the peak prevalence in Italy was probably around 1 per cent, estimated for northern Italy at its peak, so that would suggest that you have hundreds of people arriving during that period from Milan and Madrid alone.Is that a fair assessment of the order? Talking about hundreds of people rather than tens of people, arriving with Covid-19 during that period?Prod Aston replied: I think it would depend exactly what prevalence estimates you were using, what fatality rates you were using.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/04/27/16/sunak-crop.jpg","title":"furlough workers wage support rishi sunak announcement","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.As chancellor announces employers will have to start contributing to furloughed workers’ pay, employees are left with uncertainty about\u0026nbspfutureSome aspects of being on furlough have been pretty good for Charlie Curley, a 61-year-old chauffeur who was put on the government’s job retention scheme by his employer six weeks ago.He certainly doesn’t miss the 4am starts he can have a beer or two in the evening with no danger of feeling guilty about it and, thanks to all that extra time on his hands, the lawn is immaculately mowed and his patio is — he reckons — now among the cleanest in the country.But, like many others of the UK’s 7.5 million furloughed workers, some of the novelty of being paid 80 per cent of his salary by the government wore off a while ago.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe household tasks have run out, the daily walk has become the main event of his day, and now there is growing uncertainty about whether he will have a job to go back to.Does it give you worries? Yes it does, definitely. I don’t think I’m going to get any proper work until the end of JulyThe chancellor’s announcement on Tuesday that the furlough scheme will be extended was almost universally welcomed. However, the fact that employers will have to start contributing in August to the wages of furloughed workers will mean tough decisions for many companies. Some jobs will undoubtedly go, as government wage support is withdrawn by the end of October.Questions remain about how exactly that support will be withdrawn. Rishi Sunak has promised they will be answered by the end of the month. It’s at that time that many employers will face tough decisions.“After that I don’t know.“Does it give you worries? Yes it does, definitely. I don’t think I’m going to get any proper work until the end of July because the government is paying the 80 per cent.“I think the moment my employer has to put their hands in their pocket they will have a decision to make, definitely.”There are many variables in that decision, says Mr Curley. One option is redundancy\u0026nbspperhaps some staff could be brought back part time as the more flexible furlough rules will allow from 1 August.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That’s a long time for senior people to be out.”“Whether it comes back ever is the $64,000 question.”Given the switch that many companies have made to using video-conferencing software, the continued concerns about spreading the virus and the pressure to reduce emissions, executive travel is forecast to drop off drastically.So might his employer keep him on? He suspects that, come August, the government might pay 50 to 60 per cent of his wage while his employer will have to pay 20 to 30 per cent. It may consider it’s not worth it.But Mr Curley is philosophical: “Furlough can’t go on forever and everyone knows that.“If the government mandates that employers have to start forking out 30 per cent of the wage bill while a lot of things are still shut down that will bring pain, without a shadow of doubt.”It also raises the question of whether the government is effectively subsidising jobs whose long-term future is in doubt. And how it deals with those potentially large numbers of workers who — despite its best efforts — are left without work when the support is withdrawn.The job retention scheme has been widely praised because it keeps those ties between workers and jobs. It prevents the destruction of productivity that results when businesses go under, people are put on the dole, ties are severed\u0026nbspand skills go to waste.In short, it helps to prevent\u0026nbspa painful but relatively short-term shock turning into\u0026nbsplong-term depression.But if the economy that emerges from the global pandemic is radically different to the one that entered it, many of the jobs and skills that are needed will be different, leaving a very difficult set of tasks for the Treasury to navigate. The\u0026nbsplaissez-faire\u0026nbspapproach that previous Conservative governments took to shifts in employment needs is well remembered in what was once known as Labour’s red wall.A somewhat easier call for Sunak, and one that has been universally welcomed by businesses, is the renewed flexibility of the furlough scheme. Instead of having to stop working for an employer completely while being entitled to furlough support, people can begin to go back to work part time.Rishi Sunak’s furlough scheme reforms look reasonablePrivately, many people admit that they have already been doing some work for their employer while the government has picked up the tab for wages. It is an obvious problem with the incentives of the scheme that has now been fixed.It will also allow those sectors completely shut down, like tourism, to gradually reopen, testing the waters with limited staff as demand slowly picks up.For Janet, who works for a group of holiday homes in the West Country, the furlough has saved an industry that she loves.“Initially it was a relief. It was going to be for a month but it’s been extended. I would personally rather be back at work.“Some people I know are struggling to get by on 80 per cent of their wages, but it is a very generous scheme overall.”The option to bring people back part-time is hugely welcome, she says, because it means that an important part of the economy can prepare itself for when it is allowed to welcome visitors again.Every day lost of the crucial summer season puts the hospitality industry under additional\u0026nbspthreat. If parts of the industry do not survive, the damage could be long lasting in areas\u0026nbspof the UK where options for new employment are limited.“Businesses will need to start to get up and ready to welcome visitors again,” says Janet. “You can’t just open your doors one day and everyone comes through the door.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

People have been staying at home and there will be more to come,” he told Sky News.“I think the most important thing is that all the measures that Chancellor Rishi has been taking have at least ensured that some protection has been brought about.”Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the first quarter fall was better than the 2.5 per cent\u0026nbspexpected by most experts and the 3 per cent\u0026nbspforecast by the Bank of England last week.“A quarter-on-quarter drop in the second quarter of about 20 per cent\u0026nbsplooks plausible,” he said.\u0026nbsp“Even if we make some allowance for a marginal recovery in output in May, as employees in the construction, manufacturing and real-estate sectors tentatively return to work, and then a more comprehensive recovery in June, when most shops and schools should reopen.”Office for National Statistics\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Reduced energy demand more generally also saw a drop in output from fossil fuel power stations.Recent data from multiple environmental organisations has revealed a massive\u0026nbspdrop in CO2 emissions in 2020, showing that the coronavirus pandemic has caused the biggest carbon crash on record.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesData from Carbon Brief and the International Energy Agency (IEA) reveal the unprecedented\u0026nbspscale of the emissions decline, which is six-times larger than the previous record reduction that followed the 2007-2008 Financial Crisis.Projected figures for 2020 forecast the biggest ever percentage drop in CO2 emissions - more than any previous war or global economic crisis.There has also been a huge reduction\u0026nbspin air pollution in the form of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions.NO2 is\u0026nbspreleased when fossil fuels are burned in cars, airplanes and other combustion engines, contributing to the formation of harmful smog that causes respiratory and other serious health problems.Stay at home orders that were in place across the UK throughout April saw NO2 emissions plunge, as people avoided driving, flying and using public transport.The reduction in NO2 and other pollutants as a result of the coronavirus lockdown has resulted in 11,000 fewer deaths from air pollution in Europe, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA).A recent CREA report also revealed that reduced energy demand during lockdown resulted in power generation from coal falling by 37 per cent across Europe in April.

The complaints have been investigated by Liberty Investigates, an arm of human rights group Liberty.The study aims to monitor the current rate of infection and find out how many people may have developed antibodies in the UK. Up to 300,000 participants are expected to be studied over 12 months.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesLaunched on 23 April, the first stage saw 10,000 households asked to take part, with participants providing a nose and throat swab to test. Adults in a smaller number of households were asked to provide a blood sample to see if they had developed antibodies.The survey is billed as a representative study of the UK population and is being led by the Department for Health and Social Care and the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The University of Oxford, data science company IQVIA UK and the National Biosample Centre in Milton Keynes are also working on the survey.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?When the study began, IQVIA’s capacity to cope with phone calls was limited and members of the public invited to take part said that they could not get through to make appointments. Since then, participants have made other complaints.One participant told Liberty Investigates they had concerns about their own health after being visited by testing staff. Another said they made 77 calls to arrange appointments, with only one being fulfilled and three appointments being missed.These are not isolated issues. Complaints made via social media to IQVIA, which is responsible for the doorstep data collection, show participants complaining about poor sample collection, systematic no-shows by testing staff, and a lack of test kits, resulting in missed appointments.One survey participant, who did not wish to be named, said they waited for a first appointment and nobody turned up. When a second appointment was booked, the participant was “surprised and concerned that a nurse arrived at my doorstep without PPE, other than a pair of gloves, especially as she offered to come into my house and do the swabs”.The participant added: “We had to stand close to receive the testing equipment and sign and return the consent forms. This nurse is going from household to household without any protection for herself or those whom she visits.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe person taking part emailed their concerns to the team at the University of Oxford, the institution group overseeing the project, before the email was passed to ONS. The statistics body then replied stating that the nurse should have engaged in social distancing.ONS’s deputy lead on data collection and tracking emailed the participant, promising to look into the case. The official said they were “concerned that you state you had to stand in close proximity to receive the swabs and sign the consent forms”.They added: “There are clear guidelines that state the materials are to be bagged and left for the respondent to collect whilst the study health worker retreats to the requisite distance. I can appreciate why this made you anxious for the health of yourself, the study health practitioner and others.”The paperwork given to all participants states: “The study healthcare worker will use all the recommended precautions to protect you and other people in your home from getting the virus. The study health worker will bring all the necessary equipment, including PPE with them to your home for a visit.”No health worker turned up for the woman’s second test, which was supposed to be a week later – and she has not been contacted since.The apparent failures raise concerns not only about communication, but the extent to which the data is useful if the weekly tests are not carried out as regularly as intended. Participants are supposed to be swabbed five times at weekly intervals, and thereafter every month for a period of 12 months.Paul Beauchamp told The Independent about his experience taking part in the infection survey, describing it as “a bit of a shambles from the start” because the test worker “clearly had almost no training”.Covid test results from commercial labs not shared with local NHS“I’m absolutely not blaming him. It was clear he’d been asked to do a job for which he hadn’t been properly trained or equipped.”Mr Beauchamp added: “Both my wife and I volunteered but he only had details for me so couldn’t also take samples from her. I was then told I’d get a call to make an appointment for the following week and have heard nothing a week later.”David Wilkin, who also agreed to take part in the survey, said that he and his family had made four appointments. It took 77 phone calls to get through. After one no-show and several more calls, a nurse appeared, wearing a clinical mask and gloves. However, the second and third scheduled visits did not happen.Mr Wilkin, who has now withdrawn from the survey, said: “I am absolutely disgusted by the incompetence. It is a sadly missed opportunity to collect important data. That opportunity has now been missed.”A spokesperson for the survey said: “Drawing on the proven research capabilities of highly experienced partners, this large collaborative study has been started at very short notice, during difficult and restrictive working conditions caused by the virus.“We have published initial estimates of the number of people in England positive for Covid-19, based on thousands of swabs and bloods already collected from across the UK in less than a month.”The spokesperson added: “We are unable to comment on inidual cases but are aware that our partners are working hard to deliver at pace whilst ensuring PPE and health and safety standards are observed by staff during swab and blood collection appointments. These are essential to protect the public and our partner healthcare professionals.“We’d like to thank everyone who has responded to our call to take part in this vital research. Over the coming months, the results of this work will be central to our understanding of how this virus spreads. By taking part they are helping with the international effort to understand and combat the impact of Covid-19.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Scientists at the University of Oxford started a human trial for their possible vaccine last month.

Professor Sir John Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University, said “several hundred” people have been vaccinated in the Oxford trial.The challenge now is to be able to manufacture at scale once it is approved by the regulators, he said. As the world rushes to develop a vaccine, the EU – which includes some of the hardest-hit countries in the world by the virus – fears it may not have sufficient supplies, especially if a vaccine were developed in the US or China.Mr Cavaleri said the EMA, in communication with more than 30 developers, was doing all it could to speed up the approval process. However, he said he was sceptical one would be ready in four months’ time. He ruled out the possibility of skipping the third phase of a vaccine trial in a bid to make things move quicker, which he said would be needed to be sure a vaccine is safe and effective.

The global health body – which is leading a global initiative to develop safe and effective vaccines, tests and treatments for Covid-19 – said in April this year a coronavirus vaccine would take at least 12 months. The EMA is also looking at 115 different therapeutics, or treatments, for the coronavirus, which has killed nearly 300,000 people globally.Mr Cavaleri said some of those therapeutics could be approved in Europe as early as this summer, but he did not specify which.More than 4.35 million people have tested positive for coronavirus in the world as of Thursday, with recorded cases in 220 countries and territories.

We needed to know the seismic properties of the iron-sulfur alloy thought to make up the core of Mars.”The Insight probe is a lander that measures the planet’s “vital signs” such as its “pulse” (seismology), “temperature” (heat flow), and “reflexes” (precision tracking), Nasa\u0026nbspexplains.Previously, it has found activity of seismic quakes, called “Marsquakes”, which helps identify geologic layers in the planet.Space debris from failed rocket misses New York City by minutes“The exploration of the deep interiors of Earth, Mars and other planets is one of the great frontiers of science,” said\u0026nbspNishida. “It\u0027s fascinating partly because of the daunting scales involved, but also because of how we investigate them safely from the surface of the Earth.”As part of the research, the scientists were able to calculate the seismic data that would be shown if Mars\u0027s core is made of an iron-sulphur alloy, or something else. Researchers now hope they can gather measurements from the red planet to compare, and so understand the truth of the inside of the planet, and whether it is made as scientists expect.Astronomers find \u0027regular rhythms\u0027 coming from distant starsUS Space Force debuts first recruitment ad and secret space vehicle From a deep-space mystery to the longest creature in the ocean“If it isn\u0027t, that will tell us something of Mars\u0027 origins. For example, if Mars\u0027 core includes silicon and oxygen, it suggests that, like the Earth, Mars suffered a huge impact event as it formed. So, what is Mars made of and how was it formed? I think we are about to find out.” Nishida said.Simulations of Mars allow for research on its structure and details, without travelling the up to 400 million kilometres between us and the planet.The Earth and Mars were both formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago, and therefore comparisons between their cores can provide vital information about how they were formed – especially as the two planets are so strikingly different.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It was a mess, like listening to a cat walking on a piano.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesInstead, by using the data from Nasa, team was able to make sense of those pulsations, with the help of brightness measurements of thousands of stars.The incredibly precise data from NASA\u0027s\u0026nbspTESS\u0026nbspmission have allowed us to cut through the noise. Now we can detect structure, more like listening to nice chords being played on the piano, Professor Bedding said.Nasa asks private companies to start making lunar landersThe new findings will allow scientists to understand the stars using a technique called astroseismology. Just as scientists can learn more about the inside of the Earth from tracking the reverberations from earthquakes, scientists are able to use similar principles to study the inside of stars by watching their pulsations.The stars in question are known as delta Scuti stars, and are named after the first of them to be found, a star that is visible from Earth in the constellation Scutum. They are roughly 1.5 to 2.5 times the mass of our Sun.Researchers had detected a huge number of pulsations from the thousands of\u0026nbspthose stars they have discovered. But the pulsations seemed to have no discernable rhythm or pattern, making them unable to learn further information about them.Now in the new research, published in Nature, scientists were able to pick up regularly pulsations from 60 of the stars, which were between 60 and 1400 light years away. Those are thought to be younger stars, meaning that their pulsations happen more rapidly – as they age, the frequency of the pulsations slows and they become jumbled with other signals.This definitive identification of pulsation modes opens up a new way by which we can determine the masses, ages and internal structures of these stars, said Professor Bedding.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

But it also takes regular images of the stars themselves, and it was in those pictures that the scientists could spot regular changes in the delta Scuti stars.The data from the telescope allowed them to gather a large enough dataset on the stars to watch their quick changes, over a long time. That allowed them to isolate the well-behaved examples, and conduct further follow-up observations using ground-based telescopes.This really is a breakthrough. Now we have a regular series of pulsations for these stars that we can understand and compare with models, said co-author Simon Murphy, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Sydney.It\u0027s going to allow us to measure these stars using asteroseismology in a way that we\u0027ve never been able to do. But it\u0027s also shown us that this is just a stepping-stone in our understanding of Delta Scuti stars.Astronomers have already used the findings to settle debate about the age of one recently-discovered\u0026nbspstar known as HD31901, which is part of a stream of stars that orbit within our galaxy. Some researchers suggested that the stream was about a billion years old, while others said it formed only 120 million years ago – and the new data suggests the younger age is correct.Delta Scuti stars have been frustrating targets because of their complicated oscillations, so this is a very exciting discovery, said Sarbani Basu, a professor of astronomy at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, who studies asteroseismology but was not involved in the study.Being able to find simple patterns and identify the modes of oscillation is game changing. Since this subset of stars allows normal seismic analyses, we will finally be able to characterize them properly.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But even if they were to open, separate research by online data firm Statista shows that a significant proportion of people would still be unwilling to visit them.More than half of the 713 UK adults questioned in the Statista Covid-19 Barometer survey, which was conducted between 4-10 May, said they would avoid restaurants, pubs, cinemas and large events, even if lockdown restrictions were lifted.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It was really scary. I was an alien for a while, I could barely speak. I wasn’t sure if I would make it.”Ms Khan rang 111, who told her to wait it out at home and see if she got worse. But within days, she said she couldn’t even walk. “I felt weak and dizzy. I couldn’t move at all, I was just on the sofa, trying to remember to breathe. I thought I might be having a heart attack or a stroke. My left side felt numb.”A friend called 999 on her behalf and medics came to her home. Ms Khan said: “They checked my vitals and they were happy enough with me. My oxygen levels were OK\u0026nbspand they said it might be that I was fatigued.“They said sometimes people get another blow when they are almost over the virus and that is what probably happened to me. It felt like an exorcism.” At the peak of her illness, Ms Khan went online to seek help.

The Rolls Royce owned and operated Core Production Capability facilities at Raynesway, where the department is replacing facilities so it can produce the latest nuclear reactor core designs at a forecast cost £474m, and\u0026nbspcompletion in 2026. And the BAE Systems owned Barros shipyard where work is taking place on the modular build of Dreadnought-class submarines at a cost of £240m and completion date of 2022.“The MoD said it ‘immensely regretted’ the huge waste of taxpayers’ money, which was caused by poor management of three nuclear infrastructure projects, resulting in a combined cost increase of £1.35bn and with delays of between 1.7 and 6.3 years,” the report states.“The contracts for the three infrastructure projects did not allow the department to share the financial risk. This means the taxpayer has borne the full cost of budget overruns, including those of its subcontractors.“The department accepts the National Audit Office’s criticism that its contracts were not well designed and says it would not operate in this way in the future”, said the committee.Meg Hillier, chairperson of the committee, said: “To utterly fail to learn from mistakes over decades, to spectacularly repeat the same mistakes at a huge cost to the taxpayer – and at a huge cost to confidence in our defence capabilities – is completely unacceptable. The department knows it can’t go on like this, it knows it must change and operate differently. The test now is to see how it will do that, and soon.”“We expect the MoD to report to us later this year, in its 2020 update on the Dreadnought nuclear submarine programme. We also expect a detailed assessment, of whether the current ownership arrangements for nuclear-regulated sites are in the best interests of the taxpayer, to be provided to us by the end of this year.”Ministry of Defence\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That fresh air, though. God, amazing.”Test everyone in Norwich for Covid-19 weekly, say scientistsJohnson and Starmer clash over care home deaths and global stats: liveMPs accuse Deliveroo of ‘putting people at risk’‘Very likely’ some unexplained care home deaths due to Covid-19She, along with housemate Holly Clifton and dog Charlie, had driven an hour and half to be at Ilam Park for 10am. They planned on staying all day: walking, exploring and taking photos. They’d ended up bringing that tent as it happened – “just in case”.Their enthusiasm was shared by many here. One couple, Gurpreet and Helen Randhawa, said the lockdown constituted the longest they had ever been without going on a hike together since they first met at a university hiking club. They were now 28 and 29, and had seven-month-old daughter Jasmine in tow.“Every walk we’ve done over the last couple of months has started and finished at our front door,” said Helen, a software developer. “That’s in Derby so not exactly the great outdoors.”Another visitor, Greg Butler, was a landscape photographer. “I’ve been taking a lot of pictures in my garden in Leek,” he said as he set up his camera at Dovedale Stepping Stones. “It’s not quite the same.”The only problem is, perhaps, that for people actually living here in the Peak District – a 550 square mile stretch of rural uplands spreading across six different counties – those roads signs which visitors encounter are not expressing an out-of-date sentiment. They are not there because the owners have forgotten to take them down. “Stay home” is still meant by many in the towns and villages here.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email“I understand the benefits to mental and physical health of people getting out into the countryside and I don’t wish to deny anybody that,” said Hardyal Dhindsa, Derbyshire’s police and crime commissioner, over the phone. “But what my constituents in the Peak District tell me is that they are genuinely concerned about the health risks to their communities from large numbers of visitors flocking to the area. People have spent nine weeks isolating and they fear that hard work will be wasted if the virus is brought into their communities now.”However, he accepts that visitors’ reasons for descending on the area appear well-founded enough.How coronavirus has changed life on a single UK streetNumbers coming here have already been on the rise over the last couple of weeks after a drop of 95 per cent in the first fortnight of the lockdown, according to figures compiled by the Peak District National Park Authority (PDNPA).Although there was no obvious uptick on Wednesday, the feeling is that eased restrictions will probably see significantly more people arriving over the weekend. That, in turn, could make social distancing far more difficult. If that sounds implausible in such a wide open space, think of the pictures of people snaking up Everest and you have an idea of what, for instance, Derwent Edge can look like on a summer’s day.As a result, both Sarah Fowler, chief executive of the PDNPA, and Richard Fitzherbert, chairman of Derbyshire Dales District Council, have, separately, urged people to reconsider any trips they may be planning.“Continuing to use local parks and outdoor areas close to your home can continue to provide the crucial breathing space for you and for us,” said Ms Fowler.Visitors, councillor Fitzherbert told The Independent meanwhile, brought considerable risk to locals but – given local shops, cafes, pubs, hotels and attractions were all largely shut – almost no economic benefits. Essentially: the worst of both worlds? “To some extent, yes,” he says.Yet, nonetheless, back at Dovedale, on a Wednesday morning, when visitors often have 20 metres, let alone two, separating them from others, it seems churlish to suggest they shouldn’t be here.“We’ve spent nine weeks unable to escape the concrete jungle,” said Simon Davis, visiting from Coventry with partner Leanne Farrell and their two children Annabelle, 6, and two-year-old Eden. They have been to parks, added nursery nurse Leanne, but “you have a toddler with you and they just end up getting upset because they see the swings and can’t go on them.”Do they appreciate why residents here may be worried? They do but believe a balance needs to be struck. “The Peak District belongs to us all,” said 32-year-old caterer Simon. “Just because you live here, you don’t have a right to ban others, do you?”The family were to have a picnic later. “We’re not going into any shops or even into the villages,” he said. “How can that be a risk to anyone?”It was a question that at least a couple of residents felt had some merit. Retired teachers David and Sue Crossfield were out walking in Ilam Park when approached – from two metres – by The Independent. As it happens, they explained, they lived in nearby Ashbourne, in the Peak.“We’re very lucky,” said Sue. “It’s a beautiful part of the world. We must remember that, be generous and not begrudge others coming here to share it, especially in a time of crisis.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He now needs to convince frightened Britons that we can safely overcome the pandemic’s brutal economic impact.Boris himself admits that we are entering a new danger zone. But there is little time left to get Britain back on track before the economy slides into meltdown.He needs to spell out when and how we can resume our everyday lives — without it damaging our health. The scale of the PM’s challenge is revealed in our poll today.Seven weeks after people were asked to accept unprecedented restrictions on their lives, a staggering  per cent are opposed to any easing at this time. The public’s response to this challenge has been magnicent, but there is an urgent need to get Britain working again.The cost of the furlough scheme alone is already an eye-watering £billion and is spiralling by an unsustainable £.billion a day.Our poll shows most people are far more afraid of a second wave of coronavirus than the risk of losing their jobs. Only one in  believe the measures should end, and just four per cent favour an immediateto work.Boris must use his address to the nation tonight to instil confidence that “unlockdown” will be measured and safe.But he must not underplay the uncomfortable truth: It is time people grit their teeth and get the economy going again.Give it to us straight, PM.CHANCELLOR Rishi Sunak’s furlough scheme has thrown millions of British workers a generous leline during the crisis.But it is outrageous when the mega-rich take advantage of it at the expense of the taxpayer.The latest are the Hinduja brothers, worth £billion, who are using the Government’s hand-outs to pay employees at one of their firms.As Britain’s richest family, why can’t they pay staff out of their own deep pockets CHINA has an enormous stake in Britain, with investments worth over £billion.As one of the world’s most powerful economies, it will also be crucial to post-Brexit trade.But this secretive and authoritarian country must not be let off the hook over its role in the coronavirus outbreak.Britain has been too slow to join other nations in pressing for a full inquiry. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I wanted him to die,” she told Channel  cheerleaders.The Harry Potter star is the authentic voice of Corbynistas who loathe this Prime Minister with a visceral hatred.If they can’t dance on his grave, the Dementors will do everything possible to kill his political career.Covid- has morphed from a battle for the nation’s health into a lethal struggle to stop Boris leading Britain successfully out of lockdown.An early victory came last night, as the PM unveiled his new slow-motion escape motto.Some ministers hoped for: “Back to work. Go to school. Save the economy.”Instead we heard a feeble “Stay alert. Control the virus. Save lives.”This is a Prime Minister paralysed by indecision, kicking himself for unforced errors, terried of being blamed for every new death.Downing Street is now hostage to the health-and-safety mafia, whipped into line by opportunist public sector unions who have, to coin a phrase, taken back control.Teaching unions, already on guaranteed public sector pay, even want to restrict some online lessons for education-hungry kids.Transport unions are making Tube, rail and bus travel impossible with draconian social distancing.Health unions blame ministers for blunders made by NHS and Public Health England managers.We are in thrall to a shroud-waving public sector “blob” warning of mass fatalitiesthe Government makes one  step.We must heed the experts who swallowed “Bonking Professor” Neil Ferguson’s crackpot forecasts of half a million dead without lockdown.They are the same experts whose advice on testing, PPE and care homes led to one of the world’s biggest death tolls.The nation’s long-term physical, mental and economic health is being held to ransom by a bug which has virtually no impact on children, young adults and most people under .That same low-risk generation faces a potentially catastrophic price for a disease which should leave them and their parents free toalmost immediately to normal le.Coronavirus is an old person’s disease. Out of ten million under-s in Britain, just two have sadly died from Covid-.For under-s, the risk is a “trivial” one or two per million, says respected statistician Sir David Spiegelhalter. Little more than the chance of dying by accident.For over-s, he says the risk is “ten thousand times” as high.This is no consolation for elderly victims, but it does suggest a speedy route back to a new normal with productive under-s kick-starting the economy.Getting people back to work will be hard. The work ethic propelling us out of bed each morning has been sapped by warm spring sunshine, online food and wine and a Treasury- funded cost of living subsidy.People are enjoying paid-for-time with their families. they are also scared witless by sermons about death and disaster and Downing Street’s daily mortality rate briefings.One day there will be a public inquiry. Everyone is covering their tracks.With hindsight, global lockdown is likely to be judged a terrible mistake, forced on a panic-stricken world by China’s authoritarian example.Sweden alone rejected lockdown, keeping schools open, and the economy ticking over, yet its death toll is lower per head than Britain, France, Spain and Italy.Former Swedish medical chief, Professor Johan Giesecke, believes we overreacted to a disease which is just twice as severe as winter flu and cannot be avoided anyway.“I don’t think you can stop it,” he says, “it’s like a tsunami sweeping across Europe.“We should do what we can to slow it so the health service can cope, but let it pass.”But he won’t say this in public.He will have seen the bizarre charges of betrayal and “fat shaming” against singer Adele for daring to lose seven stone.Yet Liverpool University researchers say obesity increases the risk of death from coronavirus by  per cent.Boris should say loud and clear that fat can be fatal. Losing weight prolongs le.Our health service, by the way, has coped brilliantly.Prof Giesecke says there are three golden rules: “Wash your hands, keep social distance, trust the people.”After Brexit, Boris should know more than most he can trust the people.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

These boys have been given up for dead. Funerals have been held. If it’s them, this is a miracle!”The boys were very much alive and, far from being starved and emaciated as you might expect, doctors marvelled at their muscular bodies — and the perfect setting of Stephen’s leg.But, while the families rejoiced at theof their lost sons, their ordeal was not over.As soon as they arrived in Nuku‘alofa police boarded the boat and arrested the boys, throwing them in jail for the theft of Taniela Uhila’s boat.Once again coming to their rescue Peter paid Uhila £ for the boat and they were released.Finally they couldto their families in Haʻafeva, where the entire population of  turned out to welcome them.Peter was summoned to meet the King of Tonga, Taufa‘ahau Tupou IV, who thanked him personally and asked himthere was anything he could do in .In a charming postscript Peter, who worked as an accountant for his father’s wealthy electronics firm in Australia, replied: “I would like to trap lobster in these waters and start a business here.”Peter resigned from his father’s company in Sydney, moved to Tonga and bought a fishing boat — hiring all six of the boys as the crew.Rutger Bregman’s Humankind, translated by Elizabeth Manton and Erica Moore, is published by Bloomsbury on May .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Government cannot afford to repeat such a shambles.“Stay home, save lives” was a simple and effective message. The next steps are far more nuanced.They did not need another vague Churchillian rallying call. That merely sowed confusion, even among the PM’s deputy Dominic Raab and the staunchest Tories, and exposed Boris to a tsunami of snark on TV and social media.It needed instead the level of detail we eventually saw in the Government’s guidance released yesterday afternoon — and then in Boris’s Commons QA.Supporters claimed the PM’s new “stay alert” message was merely common sense any fool could grasp. That misses the point. We are being asked to live in highly unusual and restrictive ways. One person’s common sense is another’s idea of dangerous risk.Our circumstances are all dferent and specics are important — especially when police are to hand out increased fines for transgressions.But while the Government’s recent messaging has been poor, we at least now have our first welcome, albeit ­tentative, steps out of this nightmare:Outside exercise without limit, including the freedom to drive for a day out. The first chance in weeks to see a friend. All assuming social distancing.More solid guidance on masks. Precious little relief on schools, but the glimmer of some sport. Some, many Sun readers included, are being told toto work, though they may justiably fear it is unsafe.Their jobs also make them some of those most likely to die from Covid-.Their firms, factories and sites must bust a gut to ensure their safety, take every precaution and heed reasonable concerns. The grim reality, though, is that our economy must get moving again.It is typical of the infantile Left to complain that profits are being put before people. The Government is not a bottomless well of money. That’s why Rishi Sunak is limbering up to cut the sums paid to furloughed staff. He has to.Only a healthy economy and the taxes it generates can keep public services afloat, the NHS especially.Bankrupt Britain with an endless lockdown and you wreck those too. And far more lives are then lost.DONALD Trump is now harbouring an international fugitive.His case for refusing Britain’s request to extradite Harry Dunn’s alleged killer Anne Sacoolas is blown apart.The Interpol Red Notice, ordering her arrest outside the US, shows the “diplomatic immunity” under which she left the UK after the death crash was bogus.Even the US public want her to face the music.

All you need is a TV and the inclination.But while many will have used this virtual house arrest to shake off some unhealthy old habits , the reaction to Adele’s weight loss suggests that, for some, her transformation is a betrayal of everything fat activists hold dear.Of the , largely positive comments about the star losing an incredible seven stone, some sniped that she looked “unhealthy”and questioned how she lost it — the inference being that she had succumbed to having a gastric band.But as Pete Geracimo, her former personal trainer, points out: “It was never about getting super-skinny. It was about getting her healthy.”Not least, one suspects, for the benefit of her seven-year-old son Angelo. He adds: “She embraced better eating habits and committed to her fitness and ‘is sweating!’ I could not be prouder or happier for her.”Hear hear. Yet alarmingly, research out earlier this year found that millions of women hid their efforts to slim for fear of being mocked or labelled “anti-feminist”.Saints preserve us. The truth, of course, is thatsomeone is deeply insecure about their own weight, they either pooh-pooh or, worse, lash out at the efforts of those who manage to transform their lestyle via willpower and hard slog.Far easier to do that than take a look at our own bad habits and attempt to change them. True, there are plenty of people who look overweight but are physically fit.And there are plenty of skinny malinkies who can’t run for a bus without needing oxygen. At the end of the day, being happy within yourself is not about how you look, but how you feel.Andyou feel that you are unfit thanks to lousy eating habits and lack of exercise, then you should be able to do something about it without being taken to task by those who don’t have the same self-discipline.Particularly as last week’s research from the University of Liverpool found that obesity increased the risk of dying from coronavirus by  per cent. You can’t argue with that.BOREDOM at Moore Towers has reached such a crisis point that, on Sunday, I linked my iPhone to our portable speaker, put the songs on Shuffle and said we had to endure enjoy whatever track came up.At first there were plenty of goodies from Floyd, Bowie, Prefab Sprout and Talk Talk, but then Twinkle Twinkle Little Star popped up, followed by You Spin Me Round by . . . Alvin And The Chipmunks.For the record, our youngest is now . It seems it’s not just the kitchen cupboards that need a clear-out.BRINGING million people out of lockdown was never going to be easy.But Boris’s much-trumpeted grand statement was a damp squib that’s left us as confused as Adam and Eve on Mother’s Day.In a nutshell, four-year-olds will be able go to school with lots of kids they’re not related to but not see other kids in their family, we can go to work with colleagues but not have a chat with them in their garden, we can do unlimited exercise which we could have done anyway,we go abroad we have to self-isolate for a fortnight . . . unless it’s France, and you can drive to other destinations but not too far, whatever that means.As for “stay alert”, is that the same as Police  presenter Shaw Taylor’s old mantra of: “Keep ’em peeled ”Except we could actually see someone coming at us with a crowbar.A virus that can fit squillion times on to the head of a pin might prove harder to spot.GIVEN that the use of face masks is being actively encouraged but not the professional ones needed by key workers, a number of DIY versions are being suggested.Some involve an element of seamstress skills, but for those who want a quick and effective mask they can drum up with the minimum effort, this is my favourite.Loop a child’s hair tieover each end until it resembles a boiled sweet, then fold over the ends to meet in the middle .Then simply place the wrong side against your face, loop the hair ties around your ears, and voila.You’re welcome.FASHION designer Freya Edmondson – daughter of Ab Fab star Jenner Saunders and actor Ade Edmondson – has posted this photo of herself doing a “sumptuous, heart-opening backbend”, while writing on a notepad.Freya, who teaches free online yoga courses, is just  and, therefore, wonderfully flexible.As a former enthusiastic gymnast, it reminds me of my youth, when I would watch TV while doing the box splits – with my legs stretched out at right angles to my body.With my th birthday looming this Sunday,I attempted it now it would take four paramedics and a system of pulleys to get me on my feet again.ACADEMICS may lord it over the rest of us when it comes to quadratic equations, subatomic phenomena or the three components of the epidemiological triangle, but when it comes to common sense they are often found lacking.Quite how “Professor Lockdown” Neil Ferguson thought he could preach to the rest of us about social distancing while inviting his mistress to his house is anyone’s guess, but he did, and now he’s rightly had to resign for hypocrisynothing .He says: “I accept I made an error . . . I thought I was immune.”From Covid- . . . or criticism THE latest series of Killing Eve may have had a lukewarm reception from critics, but central character Villanelle’s fashion choices have been attracting a lot of attention.One frock cost £,, another £,, and her red leather catsuit would set you back an eye-watering £,.I know these are desperate times for all businesses, but since when have fashionistas been clamouring to get their clothes on the back of a psychotic murderer It gives a whole new meaning to “dressed to kill”.HAIRDRESSERS are to stay closed until July  at the earliest.Up to now I have been making do with the occasional fringe cut using a pair of nail scissors.But given that my “style”is supposed to be choppy bob, and I now resemble Richard lll, it seems I will have to tackle the rest of it too.Worse, The Bloke will have to do the back and, God forbid, baldlygo where no man has gone before.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And I’ll admit, I didn’t correct the ­lawyer .But there’s a darker side to it. A generation of young city dwellers who know nothing about Britain were always bound to underestimate our four great nations.And so they did in the  referendum.The overlap between London and the Remain campaign has been well documented —  per cent of the capital voted in favour of remaining in the EU.Among London’s student population, the depth of ­support for the EU was overwhelming.And with some ultra-liberal friends, there were moments when it would have seemed easier to come out as a ­paedophile than a Brexiteer.Of course, ardent young Remainers convinced themselves that their love of the European Union was borne out of a sophisticated appreciation of all things global.But it seems more likely to me that they saw the EU as the ­saviour to a backwards, grisly country they imagined in their ignorance to be Britain.This summer, that ignorance could finally be shattered.Thanks to Covid-, the nation’s young people won’t have the option of scurrying to ­Heathrow the second their uni exams are over.Instead —they want holidays at all — they’ll be minibreaking in Manchester or camping in the English countryside.Yes, they might turn their noses up at rolling hills, stunning architecture and incredible free museums.But I have a sneaking suspicion they’ll be surprised and impressed with what they find beyond the confines of the M.And, reconnected to their roots at last, they might just begin to feel the first stirrings of patriotism running through their British veins.When the Government published its new guidelines for lockdown in England, I – like the rest of Twitter – found myself getting very worked up about whether or not I’m allowed to play tennis with someone outside of my household.The problem, as my mum gently reminded me, is that in my case it’s a bit of a moot point: I’ve never played tennis before and I’m not entirely sure how to hold a racket.I doubt either my housemate or my friends will be begging for a game any time soon.IT’S not often I find myself welling up at the radio. But LBC caller Liz, from Witham, Essex, got me in the gut this week.Through uncontrollable tears, she explained thatcoronavirus didn’t kill her, being forbidden from touching her grand-children surely would.She’s not alone. After nearly two gruelling months of lockdown, millions of us are experiencing real, gut-wrenching loneliness.They don’t like to complain – they know their suffering is dwarfed by that of frontline health and care staffers. But starved of the company of those they love, they are withering like plants out of sunshine.You’d expect a Conservative government instinctively to get this. For generations, Tory MPs have told us that family is crucially important to the ing of the UK.They’ve thrown their weight behind policies designed to strengthen families and made many moving speeches about how a family unit is more than the sum of its parts.But it seems all that was just for show. For in their admirable haste to propel Brits back to work, this Government seems to have forgotten about families altogether.Boris Johnson’s Sunday night speech – stuffed full of specic advice for workers – didn’t have a single word of hope for single adult relatives craving each other’s company.And the millions of young adults longing to know when they can next hug Mum will have been bitterly disappointed.Of course, the PM is right to say we need to get the economy going again.Forecasts from the Treasury on the upcoming recession could hardly be more alarming – and despite the best efforts of Chancellor Rishi Sunak and his bailouts, millions of businesses will go bustthey can’t get up and running again soon.Butwe’re expected to get up close with colleagues for the sake of the economy, surely we should get to see those we love best for the sake of our mental health The people of Britain are humans, not cash cows. Andthey are to get through this long, draining war in one piece, they need the support of the people they love.LISTENING to BBC News anchor Fiona Bruce casually describe carers as “low-skilled workers” really set my teeth on edge.To the shame of this nation, care home staff are indeed low paid.But low skilled  I reckon plenty of them would be more than capable of reading the news from an autocue for £, a year.And I’d like to see cofed Fiona feed, clean and comfort a newly widowed dementia sufferer without losing her cool.FOR the best part of the past decade, bespectacled “experts” gravely predicted that online dating would kill romance.Apps – they told us – would transform the dating scene into an endless virtual marketplace where singles could shop for each other , or  would turn dating into a minimal-effort pursuit of on-demand hook ups .How wrong they were.Rather than bonking their way round new digital acquaintances, millennial Brits in the st Century spend their downtime uploading photos and biographies to their smartphones and earnestly looking for love.And my, do they succeed.Last year a whopping  per cent of newly married couples met online, and Hinge – the dating app geared towards lelong relationships – is gaining users faster than any of its competitors.Granted, these apps aren’t perfect.We all like a good romance story, and Dad messaging Mum with a winky face because he liked her bikini selfie is hardly the stuff of Hollywood.But now that flirting in the pub is a thing of the past, let’s thank our lucky stars that the country’s poor singles have a shot at love at all.Rather than sitting on the sofa twiddling their thumbs, furloughed folk have been busy sculpting, chiselling and painting – and selling the fruits of their labours online.These plucky, small-time entrepreneurs are the very best of Britain.And with them around, I have no doubt this country will be back on its feet in no time.I’M absolutely loving Normal People on BBC.The chemistry between Marianneand Connellis really quite something.And as an ode to young love, the whole thing is pitch-perfect.In fact, my only quibble is why on earth are all the characters so darn sophisticated They’re , for goodness sake.Let’s see fewer candle-lit, red wine-soaked dinner parties and more tins of warm Foster’s. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Everybody , go home, dont travel, save lives.TfL said there were  per cent more Tube journeys made between am and am today than the same period last week, although demand has fallen compared with yesterday.And research found the level of road congestion in London at am on Thursday was  per cent, up from  per cent a week earlier.Shocking pictures emerged yesterday of commuters crushed into Tubes and buses and unable to stay two metres from other passengers.The Transport Secretary Grant Shapps even warned it was a le or death gamble, despite Government urges to get back to work.He told the BBC yesterday: This is a le and death situation and I do encourage people to look at the guidance for travelling on public transport.Commuter Chris Castillio said he has stopped using the politan Line this week, after travelling to work on it throughout the lockdown.He told the Sun Online: I work near Bond Street Station and Ive seen the increase in foot flow since Monday.Since yesterday morning Ive been walking in. Its too busy.When you get on at Bond Street the  isnt crowded but when the train arrived yesterday it was crowded. Thats when I took the picture.Ive been coming in since the beginning of the lockdown and felt very comfortable until the beginning of the week.It comes as:Transport for London reported a rise of . per cent in people using the Tube from am to am, compared to last Wednesday - nearly , additional journeys.Earlier this week TfL said even when  per cent of services are back and running, only  per cent of the usual passenger capacity would be able to travel and keep two metres between them.Yesterday a spokesman added they aim to have  per cent of Tube services and  per cent of bus services back by next week - after the Transport Secretary admitted yesterday even at full service only one in ten passengers would be able to be safely distanced.The manager of Waterloo station said services rose to  per cent of normal capacity on Monday after running at  per cent at earlier stages of lockdown. Services will rise to  per cent from next Monday, he said.Cabinet minister Robert Jenrick claimed he would be prepared to board a packed bus or train to commute to work.He told BBC Radio  Live: Yes, I would do. We have given guidance that to protect yourself and others you could choose to wear a face covering.You should be taking precautions like social distancingyou can - I appreciate that isnt always possible and some of the scenes... show buses and Tubes too full to be able to sit two metres apart and thats a problem.Downing Street said there had been no signicant increase in public transport use in London in response to the lockdown easing, claiming TfL had not reported signicant increases.The RMT trade union has told workers they can refuse to workthey feel unsafe due to a surge in passengers following the easing of lockdown rules.Yesterday London Underground workers slammed the conditions during peak travel as a joke, warning it will get worse. Services were suspended on the Victoria line as one person collapsed while commuting on the heaving Tubes.Many carriages were so full each seat was taken, with only some of the passengers wearing face coverings and unable to face away from each other or remain distanced.The message from the PM is to stay alert and stay at home as much as possible while the death and case toll continues to rise, but many Brits appear to have eagerly got back to work.Mick Cash, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, said: “One incident and we are reduced to crisis management with reports that social distancing is impossible with Tube carriages rammed. RMT warned this would happen and we were ignored.“We are monitoring the situation and will discuss any appropriate action with our local reps.” The Cabinet Office has announced that five ministerial-led task forces will be established to determine how to reopen pubs, beauty salons, places of worship and leisure centres, as well as re-boot the aviation sector.Among the slight changes to the rules yesterday is a relaxing of outdoors exercise restrictions - with cooped up Brits allowed to exercise as much as they want each day.Social distancing remains in place and only certain sports are allowed to be played within household groups.It is still not allowed to meet up with a group of pals in the park for a kickabout, but those living together can play tennis or golf and sit down in a park.Friends and family members not living together are finally allowed to meet face-to-face - but only two people can meet at a time, still must not hug and need to remain two metres apart.And many people unable to work from home are heading back to the office after weeks of coronavirus lockdown.Anyone who doesnt absolutely have to take public transport shouldnt - walk, run or cycle your way to work instead, keeping a safe distance from others, new guidance from the Government says.

And this virus may never go away.HIV has not gone away, weve come to terms with the virus and we have found the therapies and we found the prevention methods, and people dont feel as scared as they did before and were offering long healthy le to people with HIV.The doctor also said lockdown shouldnt be eased with appropriate surveillance measures in place otherwise it will be a case of counting the bodies in the morgue to seerelaxing the measures have worked.Dr Ryan echoed his colleague and said the best way to globally eradicate the virus would be developing a vaccine made available to everyone.But he warned the world has lacked the will and determination in the past to invest in health systems and distribute vaccines already capable of fighting diseases such as measles.The doctor continued: Its a massive opportunity for the world.The idea that a new disease could emerge, cause a pandemic, and we could - with a massive moonshot - find a vaccine and give that to everyone who needs it and stop this disease in its tracks will turn, maybe what has been a tragic pandemic, into a beacon of hope for the future of our planet and the way we care for our citizens.Meanwhile, British scientists who have been carrying out a coronavirus vaccine trial on humans have said their results could be available by mid-June.Professor Sir John Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University, said several hundred people have been vaccinated and the challenge now is to be able to manufacture at scale once it is approved by the regulators.At the end of April a team of researchers at Oxford started testing a Covid- vaccine in human volunteers.Around , are expected to take part in the trial, half receiving the vaccine candidate and the other half - the control group - receiving a widely available meningitis vaccine.Prof Bell told BBC Radio s Today programme: We also want to make sure that the rest of the world will be ready to make this vaccine at scale so that it gets to populations in developing countries, for example, where the need is very great.We really need a partner to do that and that partner has a big job in the UK because our manufacturing capacity in the UK for vaccines isnt where it needs to be, and so we are going to work together with AstraZeneca to improve that considerably.He rejected the idea of challenge therapy - that would deliberately infect healthy volunteers with coronavirus - and said there should be results on the vaccine trial by using normal exposure to the virus,you keep your head down.Prof Bell said: Well, weve got over , people that want to start phase   project.And so far so good, and were now starting to wait for an advocacy signal to see whether people whove been vaccinated, dont get the disease so thats the next step.He added that with the disease on the wane, there is a risk there may not be enough active disease to catch people.Were doing those calculations because we have quite good data now on how much disease there is around, Prof Bell said.He also explained that the researchers had discussed deliberately exposing people to the virus, but the practicalities are complicated, as there is no treatment yet to rescue peoplethey get sick.He added that to check its effectiveness, you would need to give the virus to those most at risk, and the risk of them dying would be very highit did not work.Earlier this week, Boris Johnson warned we may never find a coronavirus vaccine - as he warned of large epidemic waves in future.Mr Johnson said: While we hope for a breakthrough, hope is not a plan.A mass vaccine or treatment may be more than a year away. Indeed, in a worst-case scenario, we may never find a vaccine.So our plan must countenance a situation where we are in this, together, for the long haul, even while doing all we can to avoid that outcome.The PM also warned that despite the strict measures that have been taken, Brits could face living with the threat of Covid- for the long-haul.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

House viewings are allowed from today in England to kickstart the market, despite a legal ban on visiting other peopleaposs households remaining in force. Cleaners, nannies and boiler fitters have also already been allowed to go back to work in peopleaposs homes, as long as they maintain social distancing. That all means people can look round a strangeraposs house - but not visit their closest relatives. Instead the law only allows a maximum of two people, one from each household, to meet in a public place while staying two metres away. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps today defended the policy - saying there has to be a line somewhere. More than , coronavirus deaths have been recorded in the UK including thousands of newly-announced deaths each day.While some lockdown restrictions in England have been lted, the bast majority remain in place. You cannot have gatherings of more than two in public, unless from the same household, and aposnon-essentialapos shops are still shut. Mr Shapps said while there would be strict rules around house viewings, that would break downvisits happen with family who are likely to have close contact. Mr Shapps told TalkRadio the previous lockdown was strict, and as soon as you start to unlock that, you’re going to get a ‘why can I do X but I can’t do Y’ situation.He added: “My parents who I have’t now seen for months who are in their s - I’m desperate to see them. “But there has to be a cutoff line somewhere. “If you go and look at somebody’s house because you move home, it’s a one off activity. Of course when I see my mum it won’t be a one off activity, I’ll be going backwards and forwards - and it’s very dficult to maintain social distancing in a case like that, because it’s your family. “There has to be a line somewhere.” Mr Shapps said a line has to be drawn in order to gradually release things. He added to BBC Breakfast: We must understand, we have done so well in the last eight weeks we cannot throw that all away, and so these are baby steps. If someone visits a home , thataposs likely to be a one-off,you are starting to visit your family again, thataposs likely to be many more times. Somewhere there has to be a line drawn where we say this is OK but this isnapost, in order to gradually release things. And this is where that line is at the moment.  The experience of buying and selling a home will be dferent from normal times, meaning people will need to be flexible and prepared to alter plansthey cannot keep to social distancing rules.

Doctors used a special oxygen machine to keep Joseph Nicholson alive while they waited for an organ donor. Called extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, it uses a pump to circulate blood through an articial lung that oxygenates the blood. Doctors kept Joseph on it continuously until his operation – the first time that had been done in this country. In his nine-month stay at Freeman and Great North Children’s Hospital in Newcastle, Joseph celebrated his fth birthday with parents Fiona and Gary. Fiona, a teacher of Catterick, in North Yorkshire, said: “It’s been a rollercoaster. Throughout it, we’ve tried really hard not to think past the next day. “We didn’t want to panic, to think about worst-case scenarios. “Every time we spoke to the doctors we focused on what was the next step to getting Joseph better.” After receiving his new lungs from a donor in Europe, the youngster is ready to continue his “phenomenal journey”, according to paediatric respiratory physician Matthew Thomas. And yesterday Fiona and accountant Gary, both , enjoyed their first full day at home with Joseph, who is autistic, and his little brother, Henry. “We want to thank the hospital staff for everything,” they said. “All the team, Matt, [Dr] Malcolm Brodlie and surgeons – they have been absolutely wonderful, and are our heroes.”.” Until last summer, Joseph was a healthy boy who loved toy trains.  After developing what appeared to be mild pneumonia, he deteriorated rapidly and progressed to profound lung failure. Following aggressive and extensive treatment, it became clear Joseph would die without a lung transplant. ECMO is used at a handful of centres to care for babies and children suffering severe heart or respiratory failure. But it is rarely used as a bridge to lung transplantation, and the approach had not been successfully tried in the UK. Joseph’s story comes days before Mirror-backed Max and Keira’s law on organ donation comes into force. It means from May , all adults in England will be assumed to be donors when they die, unless they opt out. And Joseph’s parents want to raise awareness about donation, especially in children. Fiona said: “We never realised it could be months before a suitable donor was found but we were lucky and will always be thankful. It was a miracle, really.” With the country in lockdown, Joseph, who is still on ventilation and has a tracheostomy, will isolate at home. Both parents ided their time between hospital wards and the Sick Children’s Trust, which provides accommodation for families of poorly children.

A study has found one in five of those in the capital have already cancelled some of their non-essential monthly payments, and a further  per cent are thinking about it.Meanwhile, just  per cent of people in the east Midlands have put a pause on subscriptions like Netflix, veg boxes or National Trust memberships.Craig Tillotson, CEO and co-founder of payments service Ordo, which commissioned the study, said: The UK lockdown means many of us are having to take a much closer look at our personal finances. With growing uncertainty about their income, consumers want a tighter grip on money matters, and many are using this opportunity to undertake a much needed aposFinancial MOTapos. We know people are starting to cut back on those discretionary items or services as a first port of call, before they review essential everyday expenditure or charitable causes close to their heart. The research of , adults also found the south east is home to those most worried about their finances as the UKaposs lockdown continues. Londoners are much more likely than anyone  to try and get out of a car lease - due to living in a city where you are never too far away from a supermarket. Just over a thirdof people in the south west have binned their gym membership - or are thinking about it. And despite being confined to their homes, people in Scotland are most likely to have put a stop to their Spoty or other music streaming subscription.  It also emerged six in  Londoners plan on reinstating all direct debits they cancel during the lockdown period. However, just  per cent of east Midlanders will do the same, and only  per cent of people in the north east. The research also found people in the north east pay out the MOST in direct debits each month - on average, a huge £. per person.

Influential factors include whether the virus matures, the containment measures put in place and the development of a vaccine, she told the conference. She said that a vaccine seems for now the best way out, but there were lots of s and buts about its efficacy and safety, as well as its production and equitable distribution, the newspaper reported. Asked about the comments during the WHOaposs tri-weekly briefing from Geneva, Dr Mike Ryan, who heads up the organisationaposs health emergencies programme, said no one could predict when the disease would disappear. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.    But he also issued a warning about easing lockdown measures without appropriate surveillance measures in place adding: We should not be waiting to seeopening of lockdowns have worked counting the bodies in the morgue. He said: We have a new virus entering the human population for the first time, and therefore it is very hard to predict when we will prevail over it.  What is clear, and I think maybe what Soumya may have been alluding to, is that the current number of people in our population whoaposve been infected is actually relatively low. Andyouaposre a scientist, and you project forward in the absence of a vaccine, and you try and calculate aposhow long is it going to take for enough people to be infected so that this disease settles into an endemic traceapos  And it is important to put this on the table - this virus may become just another endemic virus in our communities. And this virus may never go away. HIV has not gone away, weaposve come to terms with the virus and we have found the therapies and we found the prevention methods, and people donapost feel as scared as they did before and weaposre offering long healthy le to people with HIV.  He continued: I donapost think anyone can predict when orthis disease will disappear. We do have one great hope -we do find a highly effective vaccine that we can distribute to everyone who needs it in the world, we may have a shot at eliminating this virus. But that vaccine will have to be highly effective, it will have to be made available to everyone, and we will have to use it. But citing unvaccinated populations for diseases like measles, he went on: Forgive meIaposm cynical. But we have some perfectly effective vaccines on this planet that we have not used effectively for diseases we could eliminate and eradicate and we havenapost done. Weaposve lacked the will, we have lacked the determination to invest in health systems to deliver that. And therefore, science can come up with the vaccine - someone is going to make it and weaposve got to make enough of it so everyone can get a dose of it and weaposve got to be able to deliver that. And people have got to want to take that vaccine. Every single one of those steps is fraught with challenges. But he added: Itaposs a massive opportunity for the world.  The idea that a new disease could emerge, cause a pandemic, and we could - with a massive moonshot - find a vaccine and give that to everyone who needs it and stop this disease in its tracks will turn, maybe what has been a tragic pandemic, into a beacon of hope for the future of our planet and the way we care for our citizens. Meanwhile, on countries reopening after lockdowns, Dr Ryan warned that surveillance systems must be in place or it could be days or weeks before officials know the virus is accelerating again. If that virus transmission accelerates and you donapost have the systems to detect it, it will be days or weeks before you know something has gone wrong. And by the time that happens, youaposre back into a situation where your only response is another lockdown. And I think this is what we all fear - a vicious cycle of public health disaster, followed by an economic disaster, followed by public health disaster, followed by economic disaster. He went on: If the health system gets time to recover, then it can cope with another rise in cases, and the health system can probably do that a few times. Iaposm not sure how many times the economic system can do that.

Howard Fisher, head of St Georgeaposs Church of England Primary School in Sheerness, Kent, said heaposd rather his pupils retake a year again than let one of them die.The heartfelt message has been shared more than , times on Facebook amid Boris Johnson aposs plans to reopen schools from June , Kent Live reports.The Prime Minister told the nation this week he expected early years, Reception and Year  children toto school from the start of next month. Mr Fisher told parents and s that in  years of leadership, he has learnt that being truthful and expecting the worst case scenario had served him well. So he continued by slamming the government announcement, saying he heard nothing that would put his mind at rest in regards to having four, five, six and -year-olds back in the school environment. The letter, dated May , said: We have no plans sent from the government before the announcement last night. No doubt they will arrive this week suggesting social distancing, less pupils in school, splitting them up, staggered lunches and drop offs, etc. I can be truthful here and categorically tell you there is no such thing as social distancing in a school it does not exist and would never exist. The reason childhood illnesses spread in a school is surprise, surprise, we are all in contact with each other. I can put two children in opposite classrooms and they will still get chicken pox because that’s how it is in a school. This virus we are lead to believe is a super spreader. Since then, the government has published a report of how it sees schools ing from June .  It cements Mr Fishersapos predictions, and encourages staggered break times, drop offs and pick-ups, and reducing numbers in classrooms. It also asks teachers to encourage regular  second handwashing, and for cleaning regimes to be ramped up. Parents who choose not to send their child into school due to fears they will contract COVID- will not be fined, it has since emerged. The letter continued: Do I want the staff and the children back of course. Are you at the end of your tether at home of course you are. However I am not going to sit here and write to you to say we can achieve social distancing in a school. We can always make things safer, we could perhaps reduce slightly the risk, but as soon as you open the school as far as my many years can tell you, the risk will be there. So that leaves us all in a quandary doesn’t it  How long can we go on like this for  Unfortunately I heard no answers last night, I heard no solutions. I heard that it is ok to put our youngest children back in a school and our oldest. I heard nothing that would put my mind at rest.  There will be some of you that say, ‘let’s just get on with it,’ I respect that, but get on with what  There is not a reliable test, a vaccine, an idea about what to do next, there is just the possibility that things will be ok that’s all we have at the moment and ‘ok’ is not good enough when it comes to the precious gt that is your child. The government policy says it has chosen to proceed with this measure because the scientic evidence shows it is the right time. Among the list of reasons, it says there is high scientic confidence that children of all ages have less symptoms than adultsthey contract the virus. It continues to say that there is a moderately high scientic confidence that younger children are less likely to become unwellthey do get infected. The evidence also suggests that limiting the number of children going back and then gradually increasing this number reduces the rate of transmission.

According to the latest Government figures, at least  people in Barrow-in-Furness, tucked away on the coast of Cumbria, caught the killer bug since the outbreak began in February. There are just , people living in the town on the Furness peninsula in the north west of England, so with a rate of  cases per , this means equates to . per cent. This means Barrowaposs infection rate is more than double that of Walesand over three times Englandaposs rateand Scotlandaposs . When compared to the rate in Northern Irelandaposs rate of  it is quadruple. Out of the cases in Barrow,  people have died after contracting coronavirus, giving it a death rate of  for every , – this is one the worst death rates outside of London. Officials are perplexed as to why the town has suffered so badly even though it attracts far fewer tourists than the number that visit the nearby Lake District. An Office for National Statisticsreport this month claimed that people living in the poorest parts of the country are dying at twice the rate of those in wealthier areas.  Experts say poorer people are more at risk as they are more likely to work in jobs that cannot be done from home, live in overcrowded homes and use public transport more. Lee Roberts, deputy leader of Barrow Borough Council, believes high levels of deprivation could be a factor of the high number of cases. He called the figures in Barrow a aposbig worryapos as lockdown measures are relaxed today.  He added: Most of Barrow is very compact:  to  per cent of Barrow is terraced housing and we’ve got a lot of flats, we’ve got a lot of deprivation, a lot of health inequalities. The poorest are also more likely to suffer from underlying health conditions and have compromised immune systems - putting them at an increased risk. Barrow has high levels of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseasecompared with the national average – both of which make symptoms of the virus worse.  Mr Roberts added: We have quite a lot of historic respiratory problems from people who worked in old industry, in the ship yards. Barrow also has higher than average numbers of patients with diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity, which are all risk factors for Covid-. According to some estimates, over s are  time more likely to fall critically ill with coronavirus and Barrow’s population is also older than average, with . per cent of residents aged  to .  In England the average is . per cent. But some of the cases can be traced to a house party in Barrow which took place before lockdown in March. It was attended by a apossuper spreaderapos resulting in at least six people contracting the virus and the townaposs first ever death, according to . But how the disease infected hundreds more in Barrow is a mystery.  The figures show Lancaster in Lancashire has the second highest rate at  and Cumbria is also home to the area with the third highest infection rate as South Lakeland, which is east of Barrow-in-Furness, having a rate of  cases per , people. Experts are unable to work out why the North West has become a hotspot for coronavirus cases but local public health officials think it might be because more people are being tested.  The University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay Foundation Trustcovers three hospitals treating coronavirus patients - the Furness general in Barrow, the Royal Lancaster Infirmary and the Westmorland general in Kendal in South Lakeland. According to NHS England the trust has recorded  deaths. Colin Cox, the director of public health for Cumbria, claims the NHS trust began mass-testing its employees and patients at the end of February and has done three times as much tests on average.  He told : The rate of testing in Barrow has been two to three times higher than in many other parts of the north-west, so that will explain a fair chunk of it, but I don’t think it will explain all of it. Ashford in Kent has the fourth highest infection rate of  cases per ,, followed by Gateshead , Sunderland , South Tyneside , Middlesborough , Carlisleand the tenth place has been named as Brent - the only region in London to feature in the top . ONS figures shows there have been  deaths around a small cluster of streets in Harlesden, which is in Brent, alone.  Hastings in East Sussex has the lowest rate in England with  in , contracting the virus. This is followed by Mendip, Somerset , Torridge in North Devon , Rutland in East Midlands , West Lindsey in Lincolnshire , North East Lincolnshire , Rother in East Sussex , South Hams in Devonand Arun in West Sussex . University Hospitals Birmingham has been revealed as the hospital trust to be hardest in the country by coronavirus with at least  deaths. Throughout England, every major hospital trust, except childrenaposs hospitals, has now recorded at least person who has died after testing with coronavirus but some have been hit harder than others.  The  worst-affected hospital trusts, in London, Birmingham, Derby and Manchester, have recorded , deaths. This equates to  per cent of the total death toll at just . per cent of the countryaposs hospitals. The figures also shows coronavirus is more prevalent in the big cities as  of the  worst affected hospitals have been in London, two in Birmingham, two in Manchester and the others in Liverpool, Leeds and Sunderland. The  people who have died at the hospitals in Birmingham make up . per cent of the , who are confirmed coronavirus death in Englandaposs hospitals so far. The death toll there is  per cent higher than Barts Health Trust in central London, the second most affected, where  people died. Exercise Unlimited exercise outdoors is to be allowed, with the previous aposonce-a-dayapos rule scrapped Sunbathing People will be allowed to sit on parks and beaches, provided they stay two metres away from other people Drive Boris Johnson said in his speech on Sunday night that people will be able to drive to other destinations from Wednesday, presumably to exercise there, although more detailed plans are likely to follow Meet others From May , people will be able to meet one friend or relative from a dferent household in a public place, provided they stay two metres apart. Gatherings of more than two people remain banned, so people cannot meet both their parents, for example Play golf and tennis Golf courses and tennis courts will reopen from May , with social distancing relatively easy to achieve, although you can play only with people in your household. Team sports such as football are not likely to be encouraged, as social distancing is dficult and more people than the average household would be required Fishing and swimming Angling and water sports are also to be allowed to resume in England from Wednesday. Again, you must be within your own household and two metres from other people Return to work Rather than a change to the rules, the government is now encouraging people toto workthey cannot do so from home. But they also urge people to drive, walk or cycle to work rather than use public transport,possible According to NHS England data London North West University Healthcare , Kingaposs College Hospital , Royal Free London , Imperial College HealthcareBarking, Havering  Redbridgeand Lewisham and Greenwichfill out the majority of the  hospitals with the most victims. The others have been named as University Hospitals of Derby and Burtonand Pennine Acute Hospitals in Manchester . Scientists say coronavirus is most likely to spread in cities because people live closer together than in more rural areas. They are more likely to come close to large numbers of strangers, rely on public transport and touch contaminated surfaces such as handrails or door handles. While  hospitals have recorded  or more deaths, and make up half of the entire victim count , there are only  which have recorded just one death each. Another  have recorded two deaths each and  have had  or fewer fatalities. Smaller, more niche settings such as community health partnerships, minor hospitals, private hospitals and childrenaposs hospitals, have recorded fewer fatalities.

In the winter, that is less true,” he said. And while flu all but vanished in Europe last month as coronavirus lockdowns slowed transmission, according to EU data and scientists - but have had less flu samples available to ready vaccines for next year. The northern hemisphere’s winter flu outbreak normally runs from October until mid-May and in some seasons has claimed lives on the scale of COVID-, despite the existence of a vaccine. Influenza killed , people in Europe in the - winter.  “The flu season ended earlier than usual this year and this is probably due to the measures taken regarding SARS-CoV-, such as social distancing and mask wearing,” Holger Rabenau, virologist at the Frankfurt University Hospital, told Reuters, using the scientic name of the new coronavirus. But laboratories have been so overwhelmed with COVID- and have had fewer flu samples at their disposal, meaning they “may not have the full picture of the virus circulating in the last part of the season,” said Pasi Penttinen, a senior flu expert at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control . Fewer data and delays in processing information could affect the quality of the vaccine for the  winter season in the southern hemisphere, whose composition is usually decided in September based on samples collected at the start of the year.

He went on to imply Mondayaposs guidance on safety was a “draft” and will be reissued after further consultation with Public Health England. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.  The adviser, speaking in a virtual Science and Technology Select Committee meeting yesterday, also said the re-opening decision had been made by the cabinet and not the Department for Education after modelling done by the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies . “The June  opening is dependent on a bunch of conditions being met as I think the prime minister announced, he continued.  So schools have been asked to prepare for that opening.” In relation to what the guidance is on when teachers will be required to wear personal protective equipment, Mr Rahman said: “I don’t know, I don’t think I was necessary at the PPE meeting. You’ll have to ask SAGE that.” The Government expects children in England to be able toto nurseries, and for Reception, Year  and Year  pupils to be back in school, from June  at the earliest. Mr Rahman went on to admit that it was possible hundreds of potential vectors for the virus could be brought together amid a wider reopening of schools, adding there is always a risk of transmission.  He also told MPs that he did not know exactly how many young people under  had died from Covid-. Carol Monaghan, MP for Glasgow North West, said: As a former teacher listening to this I donapost think the profession is going to be at all satisfied by what they are hearing at the moment. Addressing the chief scientic adviser, Tory MP Robert Halfon, chair of the Education Select Committee, said: Surely you must have the scientic evidence, youaposre able to tell me the base underpinning the Departmentaposs decision to reopen schools to Reception, Year  and Year  first   In response, Mr Rahman said: That was not a departmental decision. That was a Cabinet decision following advice from Sage via the Governmentaposs chief scientic adviser and CMO. His comments came after an alliance of education unions called on the Government to step back from its plan to reopen schools from next month. The unions, representing school leaders, teachers and support staff, have accused the Government of showing a lack of understanding about the dangers of the spread of coronavirus in schools. Addressing MPs in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said: When you have medical and scientic advice that is saying itaposs the right time to start bringing schools back in a phased and controlled manner, it seems only the right thing to do and the only responsible thing to do. He said: We continue to follow the best medical and scientic advice and believe that this phasedis the most sensible course of action to take.  Mr Williamson added he was more than happy to share all the advice that we have received from SAGE. He also revealed he’d asked scientic advisers “to give briefings for the sector” to “help them understand” the decision. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of parents have signed a petition asking for a choice about when their children shouldto school. It was started last Tuesday by mum Lucy Browne, , who has a five year old daughter in a reception class. On her petition, called: “Give parents the option not to send children back to schoolthey reopen in June”, she wrote: “As a mum I don’t want to face serious repercussions for making a choice I feel affects the safety of my daughter during a global pandemic.” Less than , had put their names to it before Mr Johnson addressed the nation about his plans on Sunday evening.

Coolio Carl Justin Morgan died just three days after he was born at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend, south Wales. His mum had tested positive for Covid-, and the baby boy was born with a low heart rate on May , an inquest into his death heard.The babyaposs father Carl Morgan told the Sun his partner, Kim, had collapsed crying and saying somethingaposs wrongapos as she began her agonising labour.The tiny newborn was rushed to intensive care at Singleton hospital in Swansea, but tragically died just three days after he was delivered. Follow our live blog for all the latest coronavirus news and updates  The babyaposs death was blamed partly on the Covid- virus suffered by his mother, an inquest heard. Coolioaposs primary cause of death was listed as severe hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy, meaning the brain is starved of blood and oxygen. Maternal Covid- was listed as a secondary cause. Coroner Graeme Hughes heard Coolio, whose family live in Maesteg, died on May , at just three days old. The inquest was opened in Pontypridd but was adjourned to await full results of a post-mortem examination into the cause of his death. A full hearing will be held next year with a provisional date of April , .  Speaking from the coupleaposs home, grieving Dad Carl, , reportedly said his partner told medics apossomethingaposs not rightapos before she collapsed. She was given pills, and then they had to get the baby out quickly - but it was too late, Carl added. He did not get permission to meet his son until the day he died as hospital workers feared the newborn had also contracted Covid-.Carl was later told his baby had tested positive for coronavirus, and so he was unable to see him or hold his hand before he died.The only time I saw him was on the last day of his le, devastated Carl added.

Leia Godwin has been forced to spend the last three weeks in hospital after doctors diagnosed her with a condition similar to Kawasaki disease. Health care professionals warned in April it could be a possible reaction in children to coronavirus, with youngsters under the age of five particularly vulnerable.The illness may be caused by coronavirus but experts are unsure as the reaction appears to be very rare, reports WalesOnline.Children have presented to hospitals across the UK with symptoms related to a hyper-inflammatory state and investigations are ongoing to learn more about the rare condition.Mum Hannah Godwin, , from Risca, Wales, was not worried when her five-month-old daughter, Leia, recorded a high temperature on Saturday April  putting it down to the hot weather.Leia had broken out in a slight rash which Hannah put down to a slight itch or allergy. Hannah contacted  and was told to take Leia to the out of hours service at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport. She said: When we got to out of hours, her temperature had spiked so she was referred to the childrenaposs AE. First of all , they were really concerned with her temperature. They didnapost really know what the rash was. When she was there a nurse and a doctor examined her and werenapost worried about the rash and were happy the temp was responding to calpol. Then the senior doctor did a check over and found three or four tiny petechiae, which is the pin prick rashes that donapost disappear under pressure.So they put her straight on antibiotics in case it was sepsis or meningitis, explained -year-old Hannah.After her first day in hospital, Leiaaposs condition deteriorated. A rash covered her whole body, her high temperature remained and she had developed a chesty cough, tonsilitis and tachycardia.  Hannah said she was sent for x-rays which came back clear before Leia was moved to the high dependency unit. At this point, coronavirus had not even entered mum Hannahaposs mind as the family, including dad Simon Godwin, older sisters Nia,  and Gracie, nine, along with twin sister Thea had been isolating for seven weeks due to Simon and Gracie having a heart condition. Due to the genetic heart condition shared by Simon and Gracie, both Thea and Leia had previously undergone scans and checks. However, by late April, reports of a suspected severe illness linked with coronavirus in children had started to emerge. Hannah had read about the coronavirus linked illness, but dismissed it as being a possibility for Leia due to her not coming into contact with anyone other than her family.  Another reason why Hannah dismissed this as a possibility was due to Leia testing negative for coronavirus twice on admittance to hospital. However, due to Leiaaposs symptoms, it was treated asshe had coronaviurus and doctors were increasingly concerned for her welfare and decided to transfer her to the Noahaposs Ark Hospital in Cardf where she was put on critical care for a few days, receiving high flow oxygen through her nose. The other symptoms Leia experienced included swollen feet, which Hannah was told were a marker for Kawasaki disease. She said the doctors were reluctant to label it as Kawasaki disease despite Leia experiencing a similar rash and swollen feet common to the disease, as she was not responding to the usual treatment. Other symptoms of Kawasaki, including skin peeling were also missing. Hannah said doctors were leaning towards a suspected diagnosis of inflammatory syndrome linked with Covid-.  When doctors kept using the term aposlinked to coronavirusapos to me I was getting frustrated when sheaposs never had it. But they did an antibodies test, which testedshe has ever had coronavirus, and it was the first result to come back positive, meaning at some point in the last five months she has had it but was asymptomatic. Since the antibody test confirmed Leiaaposs link with Covid- on May , Hannah said her condition has been up and down. She is no longer in intensive care and Hannah has been allowed to give her oral medication. But an echocardiogram carried out on Leiaaposs heart showed her left artery is inflamed, and the artery on the right appears to have an aneurysm, which she is now receiving two injections of blood thinners a day to prevent any clotting.   Hannah said this will be for the foreseeable future and will mean she cannot be discharged from hospital yet. It is really hard to take in everything the doctors say. The two scary things you donapost want to even think about are heart attacks and blood clots. When the doctor said that I just switched off, said Hannah. Husband Simon has also spent time with Leia at the hospital so the couple can spend time equally with all four of their children.  Leiaaposs heart is not currently responding to treatment to reduce the enlarged artery. They said regular Kawasaki should have responded to treatment so theyaposre not surethis is to do with Covid- link or not. It is an unknown entity and like everything with Leia it is watch and wait. She is fine in herself, you wouldnapost know she was ill, and sheaposs as strong as it gets so Iaposm sure weaposre just waiting it out.  Doctors have requested consent for genetic testing to understand why Leiaaposs body has reacted like this. They have also requested to take blood from Thea to seeshe has had Covid- and to understand why she hasnapost reacted in the same way. Leia has now been in hospital for two and a half weeks and is free of the rash but is stillbeing monitored by medics.Hannah has been documenting Leiaaposs time in hospital on a Facebook page called  Easy as one, two four .She wants to encourage other parents to seek help from doctorsthey think anything is wrong with their children. A spokesman for Public Health Wales said investigations were ongoing to learn more about the rare condition. They said: In recent weeks, paediatricians and paediatric intensive care specialists have identied a small number of children presenting to hospitals across the UK with signs of circulatory shock and a hyper-inflammatory state. Some children presented with symptoms similar to toxic shock syndrome and others had symptoms consistent with Kawasaki Disease, a rare inflammatory condition.

The Newcastle-upon-Tyne house buyer claims she has had six months of hell since moving into the £, three-bedroom detached house as ious snags have cropped up - although Barratt Homes insists all repairs were promptly dealt with. Pauline Collins, , was excited toto her native North East from Hertfordshire with hopes of a fresh start with her son Daniel, . But she claims herto the region has been ruined after enduring what she claims were six months of hell since moving into her Blakelaw home in November last year.The mum was immediately unimpressed as soon as she set foot inside her Barratt Homes new-build, reports Chronicle Live. Barratt Homes said all issues raised were completed promptly, other than garden work delayed by coronavirus, and vowed to continue working hard to look after Ms Collins. She said: I was really excited, it is the first time I have bought a brand new house. But now I want them to buy it back off me. Itaposs absolutely shocking. As soon as I opened the door I noticed the terrible plasterwork on my staircase. There were so many little snags that you would just expect to be right. The finish was very poor and I was fuming. In her kitchen, which she paid extra to be upgraded, she says she found part of the skirting board missing, a lump out of a door as well as her units and fridge freezer not being installed properly. Pauline claims her bath, shower and toilet all overflowed within weeks of moving into the property and she says the sealant on her tiles too were poorly finished. A few months ago, while having her garden shed installed, a workman pointed out her grass was soaking wet. She said: The grass was so wet you could barely stand on it. I called Barratt and they did come out and dug trenches in my back garden and installed the drainage. But surely this should have been done in the first place.They were supposed to be turfing my garden but then the coronavirus lockdown has meant itaposs gone unfinished. So weaposve had lockdown without a pleasant garden to sit in.The stress of the housing situation has come at a time when Daniel is recovering from a triple heart bypass after suffering a heart attack in February. Pauline, a retired British Airways worker, said: We have been through enough with Daniel then for all this on top has been incredibly frustrating and stressful. Barratt Homes agreed to come out to the house but I asked them to make appointments so I can make sure Iaposm in and itaposs a good time with my son ill. But on a number of occasions they just turned up. Pauline accepts that some of the issues have been rectied, but says they are jobs which should have been done correctly in the first place - brandishing the standard of work at her Prunus Walk home as diabolical.

Travellers looking to venture further afield have also been putting their plans back until later. One company has even reported doing six months’ business in the space of last month as the crippled sector vowed to bounce back from the impact of the pandemic. Business chiefs say that, with government help and the ramping-up of testing, the industry can see a way through the worst crisis many can ever recall.

We are seeing people wanting overseas holidays and even cruises, which is really strong.” The couple said their “peace of mind” guarantee – allowing customers to cancel or amend their holiday for free up to six weeks before departure – has helped. The couple, who have reduced their pay to minimum wage to cut costs, have no regrets about buying Thomas Cook’s retail arm.  Irene said they have an -month business plan that “doesn’t make for pretty reading,” but adds that no redundancies are planned. John says the one single thing that could help restore confidence is testing for the virus: “People could be tested before they got on the aircraft. “If there were good, reliable tests, it would reassure people. It could make a big dference.” Tui said it is ready to resume providing holidays this year, using new social distancing and cleaning measures.

The Met Office is warning overnight temperatures will once again plummet close to freezing for most and into subzero numbers for rural areas. But that will slowly be replaced by highs of C by the afternoon and much of the UK will remain dry and sunny. BBC forecaster Phil Avery said: We could have one or two temperature records set, thataposs how cold itaposs going to be, but at least itaposs accompanied by a bucketload of sunshine anywhere from central and southern Scotland to Northern Ireland and the greater part of England and Wales. He said much of the country will stay dry but the warmer temperatures will be accompanied by a keen northeasterly wind. On Friday a westerly wind will move in helping to tick the temperatures up a degree or two while dominant high pressure keeps things dry. Thataposs a trend that we continue on towards the weekend, Mr Avery added. Friday is likely to bring highs of C while the weekend is expected to see Britain welcome back temperatures in the s.  Met Office meteorologist Matthew Box said the current band of high pressure will remain for the end of the week, and it will be cloudy across the north and north-west of the country, with a potential for rain in western Scotland, Northern Ireland and parts of northern England. But Wales and much of England are forecast to remain dry with some sunny spells and temperatures more usual for May into the weekend. Temperatures will have recovered by then to be mostly near normal [for the time of year], and it could be warm even and parts of the south could see temperatures hit  or  in the south east on Saturday and, more likely, Sunday, he said.

The video shows friends and family members gathered round as a priest reads prayers while the person is being buried. However, as the camera zooms in on the white coffin, which has a clear glass  on it, there appears to be a hand and fingers moving underneath. The disturbing footage was filed in Manado, North Sulawesi, Indonesia on May .During the service, the priest is heard saying: God has said in the book of John. I am the resurrection and the le. Whoever believes in me he will live even though he is dead, Daily Mail reports.Just seconds after the speech is when the hand appears to be waving from the coffin. The video sparked debate as to whether the movement was from the corpse. One person wrote: Yes, he waved, maybe he was still alive and try to dig his way out. But another theory is that maybe itaposs a mouse, Toink Khan said. Despite the ious claims, it is likely that the corpse was moving due to decomposition.Last year, a study revealed that dead bodies move ‘signicantly’ as they decompose. Researchers at the Australian Facility for Taphonomic Experimental Researchcarried out the research, where they set up time-lapse cameras to study how dead bodies move. The cameras filmed the bodies at  minute intervals, and revealed that the the arms were ‘signicantly moving.’Speaking to  ABC News, Alyson Wilson, a researcher involved in the project, said: “What we found was that the arms were signicantly moving, so that arms that started off down beside the body ended up out to the side of the body.”While you might think that the movements would be subtle, according to the researchers, this isn’t the case at all. Dr Xanthe Mallet, who supervised the study, said: “I think people will be surprised at just how much movement there was, because I was amazed when I saw it, especially how much the arms were moving. It was astounding.” The researchers believe that the movement is caused by the build-up of gas in the body in the early to mid-stages of decomposition.

I can’t get over this, historian Laurence De Cock, who posted the picture on Twitter, said. This image is heartbreaking. We can’t call this aposschoolapos.Lionel Top, a TV journalist with the BFM news channel, took the photo on Tuesday and said the children had been told to stay in their zones. To ensure respect for distances, while taking advantage of recreation, the teaching team drew squares on the ground for the little ones, he reported. The children play, dance, jump, laugh together ... but from this square. From what we have seen, they do not view it as a punishment. But other commentators expressed their sadness and anger at a scene which looked like it was out of a ‘horror film’. I’ve never seen such a sad picture, said Myriam Cau. It’s horrible to subject children to this. Lily, another Twitter user, wrote: Just inhuman, shameful for children but also for teachers and institutes! What horror !!!!.Others said it was like a scene from the Halloween series of slasher movies.And Antoine Diot commented: The picture of the children in the chalk squares will eventually illustrate this very strange situation in the history books. A spokesman for the Ministry of Education in Paris said there were no ‘specic instruction’ for teachers to draw chalk squares for their pupils. But he confirmed that everybody was under instruction to ‘maintain social distancing’ and not to share anything.

It is claimed he has instructed North Korean hacker group, Lazarus, to use phishing scams to steal cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The secretive syndicate rose to notoriety in  after hacking Sony Pictures in revenge for the planned-release of The Interview - a comedy about assassinating Kim Jong-un. Along with two other hacking groups, it stole mof cryptocurrency from five Asian exchanges between January  and September , a US government report revealed. Now with North Koreaaposs economy rocked by the coronavirus pandemic and international sanctions, Lazarus has embarked on a new spate of APTattacks. The APT group Lazarus, which is allegedly sponsored by a certain government, is increasingly engaging in cybercrime activities in and out of South Korea, said Seoul-based EST Security. The government-sponsored Lazarus organization is conducting major APT attacks not only in Korea, but also in the international community including the United States.  One malicious document sent by Lazarus dealt with the pandemic response in a major city, the security firm said. Another dodgy file masqueraded as paperwork for the hiring of a US aerospace company. But the attacks primarily target people who trade cryptocurrencies, with malicious files typically disguised as blockchain software development contracts.

My plan was to work as hard as I could to be part of the team.“If they wanted things done a certain way then I was going to do that to the best of my ability thenit doesn’t work out, I’ve done all I can.“There were big changes to training but going away for three weeks in pre-season to Italy was a big one. Usually you’d only be away for a week but this was a long time.“They did lay everything that was to happen out in front of you, though. However, there was a strict menu on offer –you didn’t like it, you’d go hungry.”Training too was completely dferent as Dundee adopted a football strategy that had served the Bonetti brothers in their homeland.As a future coach and boss, Smith says he learned a lot during their time in the City of Discovery, evensome elements of their approach were dficult to get to grips with.“The way they structured training was completely dferent as well but dferent managers all have dferent views,” he added.“Training would change time but we’d train every day and there were a few double sessions.“They relied on doing the same thing rigidly over and over so you knew what you were getting and there was very little change.“I have to say I learned a lot about working on shape and positional play. Previous managers had done shape but not to the extent the Bonettis worked on it.“Training could be a bit off-the-cuff sometimes. They were obviously new to coaching themselves and learning as they went.”There were high-profile disagreements as foreign signings kept Scottish players out of the starting XI.The Bonetti brothers’ volatile nature also led to fall outs behind the scenes, but Smith focused on working hard in training and reaping the rewards.“I always treat people as they treat me and the Bonettis treated me very well,” he said.“I’m not saying they did that with every player – there were definitely a few not treated as well as they should have been.“I played with players I never expected to line up alongside at Dundee. Georgi Nemsadze was wonderful, Claudio Caniggia was a top talent, but they also needed the Scottish guys like myself, Gav Rae, Steven Tweed and Willie Falconer to make the core of the team.“I don’t think the foreign guys really understood Scottish football or knew what to expect.“We all just got our heads down and knuckled down to work. I think the Bonettis appreciated that.“They were good times and I’m sure the fans wouldn’t change seeing those players in dark blue even with what happened afterwards in administration.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/05/717515-1-548x564.jpg ","title":"dundee fc juan sara manager","story":"Juan Sara was heartbroken when he left Dundee as a player in  – now he’s eyeing up aas manager.Dens Park gaffer James McPake shouldn’t be too concerned by that statement, however, as the South American is still working his way up the ranks in Argentine football.Currently assistant manager at second-tier promotion hopefuls Estudiantes de Buenos Aires, Sara has great memories of his time in dark blue and hopes toone day soon.In an exclusive interview with the Tele, Sara said: “Dundee is one of the most important clubs in my le.“I would love to go back to Dundee. People always show they loved this time and always remember it. I’ve always said we’d love to go back but it is not easy with football to do so.“I am coaching just now and I have a hope that one day, one of my dreams is to go to Europe and, hopefully, be Dundee manager.”Sara arrived in the city as the Bonetti era got into full swing at Dens Park  years ago, coming in alongside fellow Argentine Fabian Caballero to form a potent front line.Immediately, the striker felt at home in Scotland.Speaking from his home in Buenos Aires, he said: “I have great memories. The people were great, I felt at home in Dundee. It was really comfortable.“The people in the city were very friendly and I made a lot of friends in the team. There were a few Argentines and Italians as well as Scottish guys.“I had been playing in Paraguay and doing really well for a big team. I had the same agent as Fabian Caballero and Dundee were looking for a striker. I had the chance to go to Portugal but I chose Dundee because I wanted to play in the UK and the football there suited my style.“Playing with other Argentines made it easy and to have an Italian coach when I spoke Italian was great for me, too. It was the perfect place for me.“We started the season well, I scored goals and it went well. I was one of the top scorers in the league in my first season with  goals.“Straight away I noticed it was a physical game, tough football with long balls and the ball in the air but we tried to play another type of football. We tried to play with the ball on the grass and more combination football.“I really felt good in that team and the way we played.”Then a -year-old, Sara made a strong start to le in dark blue with three goals in his opening nine games before etching his name into Dundee history books with a derby hat-trick in a - win at Dens Park.“The hat-trick against United was one of my best moments,” he added.“At that time I didn’t realise what I had done! It was the first derby I played in, we won - and I scored all three. I don’t know how many times that will have happened.“People always remember that match. I didn’t realise how big it was. For the fans it was so important and I still get messages on facebook from Dundee fans about it!“I scored at Celtic Park, scored against Rangers and a lot of goals but I think the hat-trick against United was one I will always remember.“It was a fantastic atmosphere. It was amazing with the stadiums so close and to be able to walk down the street was a great experience.”As was the chance to play with one of his heroes, Claudio Caniggia, after the Argentina World Cup star arrived as replacement for injured Caballero.“It was a dream for me to play with Claudio,” said Sara. “I didn’t believe it when he signed!“He knew Ivano and Dario and when Fabian got injured they brought him to Dundee.“I couldn’t believe I would have the opportunity to play with him. Both being strikers, we played together up front and it was a dream for me.“He was so easy to play with but not just him – Fabian, Beto , Georgi , Gavin , there were so many good players.”Sara’s departure, however, was more nightmare than dream as the club tumbled into administration in .Ending on a sour note, however, doesn’t taint the Argentine’s memories.He said: “Leaving was disappointing. I really felt at home and to leave in the way we did was very dficult for us.“We lost a lot of money and were very upset. My we was pregnant at the time and it was dficult being in a dferent country with no job and no living. I didn’t know what to do. There were a lot of players in that situation.“However, it was one of the best times of my career, in Dundee.

If you had to have them it would be in a final, but the draw was kind to us with Raith.“They’d been doing well under John McGlynn but it gave us an opportunity to go to Hampden.“One of the things that sticks in my mind is we had the Sunday game but on Saturday, Ross County were playing Celtic.“We were going to the Westerwood Hotel in Cumbernauld to stay overnight.“We’d trained at Tannadice and headed down. I was off to Falkirk to watch them play St Mirren but Gary Kirk and Paul Hegarty went with the team on the bus.“I was listening to the radio all the way and about half-way down Ross County went one-up.“By the time I’m in the car park at Falkirk, Ross County score again with minutes to go to make it - and it really hit me then.“That was the first time I thought to myself, ‘There’s only three teams left and we’re now the favourites for the cup’.“I felt a bit of pressure going into the Raith Rovers game that we had to go out and do our business.“We were nervous but, thankfully, I had a group of players behind me who were magnicent and we beat Raith comfortably after a slow -minute start.”Although they were indeed favourites at that stage to go on and lt the cup, Houston insists that wasn’t always the case.The -year-old believes the Tangerines still had to do it the hard way in beating Partick, St Johnstone and champions Rangers after a replay to get their shot at Hampden glory.He continues: “A lot of people say Dundee United had it easy because we played Ross County in the final but they forget about the journey.“The fact is we had an away game at Partick Thistle then we were away to Premier League St Johnstone in the next round. That’s never an easy fixture.“We went down there and I remember Gary’s father had died during that week.“The players decided they wanted to wear black armbands and dedicated the win to Bobby Kirk, who was an ex-Hearts league and cup winner way back.“It was a nice gesture for the players, that’s the type of boys they were.“We went to Ibrox after that to play a strong Rangers side, who were the champions.“That was three in a row away from home in the Scottish Cup so we didn’t have an easy draw.“We were - down after Rangers got a couple of penalties, the usual at Ibrox, but to our credit we scored goals.“To see Andis Shala and Mihael Kovacevic on the scoresheet was something unusual. We got a wee break as well with wee Morgaro Gomis’ volley being deflected in.“They thought the game was won at -. They had downed tools a bit and the crowd was away to miss the traffic.“That set us up for our only home tie, the replay at Tannadice. That was a memorable game for the supporters.“The treble-buster, as he calls himself, David Robertson scored with his backside in the last minute.“That was the best thing for us because there wasn’t much time for Rangers to go and put up a comeback.“We were the better team and deserved to win.”United would see off Ross County in the final thanks to a second-half strike from David Goodwillie and a Craig Conway double.Nearly , Arabs rejoiced in watching on as Houston  Co climbed the steps to lt the Scottish Cup for the first time since .He continues: “It hits you when you’re walking out prior to kick-off and it’s just a sea of tangerine.“There were , Arabs there and that was a sight to behold. It’s so colourful.“A lot of people thought it wouldn’t be a good atmosphere because it was Dundee United and a smaller club like Ross County but to be fair to them I think Dingwall emptied for that day.“It was a busy final and the pressure was on us that we should win this cup.“There’s an added pressure there because you’re desperately keen to not mess it up for the fans.“The Saturday night and Sunday celebrations at Tannadice and City Square were amazing.“It’s something you can’t take away from that group of players and it will never leave my memory.”The celebrations would go on for days after but it is only now Houston looks back at their win as greatness achieved not bestowed.He credits predecessor Craig Levein for laying the foundations and admits there is a special sense of pride at achieving Scottish Cup glory, something the man who started it all, Jim McLean, couldn’t do.“As you get older you start asking yourself, ‘Where did those  years go to ’” he says.“It brought joy to a lot of United fans who’d only seen them win it once prior with Ivan Golac.“It felt surreal that Jim, who was the best manager of them all, hadn’t been able to get it over line with the amount of times he took United to Scottish Cup Finals.“It was great for me, personally, being the manager of United then and doing that.“The big thing for me was we had a brilliant group of players.“Craig and I had went in a few years before and he deserves credit as well. Him and I worked really hard building a new squad.“We were bottom of the league when we went in back in . Wee Eddie Thompson’s only words to Craig and I were, ‘Just keep my team in the top ision’.“We managed to finish ninth that season then fth for the next couple of years.“I was delighted that when I took over and Craig went away to be the Scotland manager we finished third, won the cup and went into Europe three years in a row.“It had been a long time for the club since it had been on that stage and they haven’t been since.“A lot of people forget that, yes we won the Scottish Cup, but we finished third behind a very strong Rangers and Celtic, and nine points ahead of Hibs.“It was a magnicent achievement and turned out a wonderful season.”Dundee United#s Scottish Cup-winning boss Peter Houston hopes Robbie Neilson can lead Terrors to Hampden triumph\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-united-peter-houston-robbie-neilson embed # secretIXeWqxySKj\" data-secret\"IXeWqxySKj\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"jiving-gis-glasgows-george-square---ve-day-memories","story":"BONFIRES so hot they cracked tenement windows.

reconstruction lead","story":"Talks on SPFL reconstruction may not be completely off the table – despite a lack of support from Premiership clubs.A taskforce, with representatives from all four isions as well as the Highland League and Lowland League, was set-up by the SPFL last month to discuss possible reconstruction scenarios.They were also given the mandate to bring forward a proposed restructure of the Scottish Leagues for member clubs to consider.There had been talk of a -team Premiership with three leagues of  below or three isions of  or two leagues of  and -team third tier.But last Friday following a meeting of the Premiership clubs and Dundee United these clubs indicated they did support a rejig of the league set-up at this time.However, the  that is being chaired by Hearts chief Ann Budge and Hamilton Academical vice-chairman Les Gray have not yet submitted a proposal for member clubs to consider.The SPFL has still to officially confirm that reconstruction is off the table and that the taskforce has been wound up.That’s because member clubs have yet to receive an official proposal to vote on.The Evening Express understands that because Friday’s meeting was not one arranged by the SPFL and because the reconstruction group were given a clear mandate to come up with a proposal, a number of clubs are of the opinion that until such time as a proposal is put forward and considered then reconstruction is not off the table.In an attempt to sway Premiership clubs some believe a plan which includes a -team top flight may be brought forward.This could include the Championship or League Two being expanded to  teams to accommodate Highland League champions Brora Rangers and Lowland League winners Kelty Hearts, who many feel don’t deserve to be locked out of the SPFL.Although a proposal with an unaltered Premiership would not save Hearts from relegation it may gain the support of other top flight clubs.Eleven of the  Premiership sides would be required to vote in favour a reconstruction for it to pass, with % approval required in the Championship and Leagues One and Two.If a proposal is eventually put to clubs there may still not be the support across the four isions to vote it through, but there is hope that a formal plan will be brought to the table.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium

It is a joy working with folk in this area and I look forward to coming back to refresh their knowledge in a couple of years.#"},{"url":null,"title":"argyll sport decimated amid coronavirus response","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe coronavirus response has forced the cancellation of sporting events up and down the region.Just when the situation will settle down enough to allow sport to re-start is anyone#s guess at this stage, but early casualties have included shinty, football, athletics and a planned youth football trip to Europe.The committee of Mid Argyll Athletic Club took the dficult decision to postpone the Argyll final of Sports Hall Athletics which was due to take place at Atlantis Leisure in Oban this Sunday, March .With more than  young boys and girls qualying for the final from the four local area competitions and the possibility of another -plus family member spectators filling the games hall the organisers felt it was sensible to postpone the event.A statement from the organisers said: #After consultation with the management staff at Atlantis Leisure it was decided it was best to follow the guidance that is currently being issued by the Scottish Government and others to attempt to restrict the spread of the coronavirus.#We will revisit a date for holding the competition once the coronavirus situation is clear andnecessary this may be have to be after the summer school holidays. The boys and girls who qualied from the local area competitions in Lochgilphead, Oban, Tobermory and Campbeltown will be advised of the new Argyll final date and times through their local club or school.#We apologise for any inconvenience and disappointment this postponement may cause to the young athletes and their families.#The annual Crinan Puffer # an .-mile race between Crinan and Ardrishaig # has also been postponed.A fundraiser for Mid Argyll Community Pool organised with the help of Mid Argyll Athletic Club, the run was due to be held on Sunday March .Announcing the postponement, Kirsty Young of Mid Argyll Community Pool said: #In light of current government guidelines to avoid non-essential contact and unnecessary travel we feel that this is the right decision to make.#I will be contacting all stakeholders involved with the organisation and running of the event in the coming days to try and come up with a date to re-schedule the event.#Months of work to raise money for a trip to Holland in April for young Mid Argyll footballers has come to nothing, thanks to coronavirus.Lochgilphead Red Star  players, coaches, parents and supporters were left disappointed when the Amsterdam tournament was cancelled.A committee spokesperson said: #The team are devastated not to be going after nine months of fundraising for the event.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 3 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe join our communities in applauding the people at the sharp end of the coronavirus outbreak.In this time of crisis, we have nothing but admiration for frontline health, care and other local authority staff # and even management # who are having to deal with the virus close-up.Let#s not forget everyone  working on for the benefit of our society, from shop workers to lorry drivers and the emergency services # and many more besides.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club. In , he flamboyantly arrived in Inverness by helicopter for Inveraray#s Camanachd Final against Kingussie."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSuch is the all-consuming impact of the coronavirus pandemic and response on all our lives, it is something of a relief to report something away from the subject.The relatively new owner of Inveraray Pier wants to encourage community involvement, but people will need to raise moneythey choose to get involved. A community buy-out was, in fact, an option mooted in the bad old days, but negotiations proved dficult at that time.With a new spirit of openness, this has to be an opportunity worth grasping. Inveraray has pretty well lost its connection with Loch Fyne since the pier has been out of bounds. To have full control over the pier is something townsfolk have dreamt of for years. Now, with enterprise, hard work and co-operation, it seems like it is a distinct possibility.A pat on the back to all the volunteer stitchers # #sewers# doesn#t look quite right written down # out there working hard to provide protective equipment and clothing for health workers.

They feed on flying insects and spend most of their le in the air # including when they sleep # usually coming down to earth to breed. They are fast fliers, often chasing one another over buildings when they give a screeching call.Swts arrive back in Argyll in early May and breed in towns, villages and other buildings in Argyll. They spend around three months in Argyll, departing early-mid August to their wintering grounds in Africa.The British Trust for Ornithology’s Breeding Bird Survey indicates the population of Swts in Scotland has declined by around  per cent since . A similar decline has taken place in England and Wales. The reasons for the decline are not fully known but are believed to be related to changes in insect numbers and a lack of nesting sites as buildings are modernised.Argyll is at the north-western limit of the world range of Swts. Their distribution and numbers in Argyll is not well-known and the purpose of the Argyll Bird Club Survey is to try to find out the size of the breeding population and where they remain.If you have a Swt nesting in your building, or near you, or would like to take part in this survey further information is available at http:argyllbirdclub.org argyll-surveysFor more information about Argyll Bird Club, email Jim Dickson at Argyllbirder@outlook."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A few weeks ago I launched an appeal on social media aimed at supporting nurses and medics at the Mid Argyll Hospital during this terrible COVID- pandemic.I was initially trying to find outthere was anyone locally who might be interested in dusting down their sewing machine to make a few sets of protective ‘scrubs’ to donate to the hospital. Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture.

Harbour seal pups shed their whitecoat in the womb before being born and so can be in the water and swim almost straight from birth.

This year the figure fell to less than  per cent.The council also refuses to allow children whose parents opt to keep them home and fund the nursery place themselves to remain in school nurseries.Parents who decide to pay for an additional year of nursery themselves to keep their children out for a year face bills of up to pound, and a hunt for alternative child care places.Another mum who was refused funding said she had initially been supported in her view that her child was too immature to start school by her nursery.But they withdrew that support after pressure from the councilrsquos education department, she said.ldquoThey were told that they couldnrsquot support us because we didnrsquot meet the council policy criteria and withdrew their support, she explained.ldquoOur views meant nothing and the impact on our child meant nothing.And other parents expressed fears that their children were being robbed of nursery experience because they have been in lockdown for some of the vital months they would have had and would have no transition into school.One mum said: Children who start school at -years-old already receive a year less nursery time than those who are older, that has been reduced further by the closure of nurseries.ldquoHow can we ask these young children to go from months at home with their family to suddenly starting primary one with no transition A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: ldquoconfirmed they have now agreed to approve all deferral requests for the year ahead.They said: ldquoAs a result of the ongoing closure of schools and nurseries, we have been reviewing applications for deferred entry to P, ahead of session  . Due to the current situation, applications for deferred entry and a further funded year have now been approved.

At a crucial time in the survival of the language, graduates have helped create a Gaelic speaking workforce that now holds key posts across a wide range of sectors in Scotland.Sabhal Mograver Ostaig is one of the key partners in fulfilling the governmentrsquos objectives in the National Gaelic Plan, which aims to increase the number of people speaking the language and accelerate the growth of Gaelic.Many people are keen to learn more about the language because of its rich culture and the college provides a wide range of short courses in Gaelic language, song and traditional music. Ceilidhs, workshops, conversation circles and music sessions all create an encouraging atmosphere that bring together students from  countries across five continents.As a modern, innovative college, Sabhal Mograver Ostaig has excellent learning resources on campus including an exceptional library collection, residential student accommodation, broadcast and recording facilities and a Gaelic medium childcare facility on site. It also has a growing international reputation for academic research.The college was founded on the principle of being part of the local and wider community and its activities are greatly enhanced by co-operative links, being home to a number of signicant national creative and cultural projects such as Tobar an Dualchais, Ainmean Agraveite na h-Alba and Cagravenan Graphics Studio.

The festival has been cancelled and cultural gatherings across the country have been put on hold or postponed.It goes without saying that in these times our priority is the health and safety of our families, our loved ones ndash whether thatrsquos hugs with grandchildren, seeing friends or enjoying shared experiences such as the Spirit of Speyside Festival which should have been held last week. However, what I have witnessed emerging is hope, resilience and a strong Scottish can-do attitude. In the whisky industry, in particular, within days of lockdown being announced, distilleries rallied together to manufacture large quantities of vitally important hand sanitiser.Itrsquos a true testament to our Scottish fighting spirit that we will not take this lying down. We adapt and move forward as best we can. Irsquom extremely proud of the Speyside community and our wider Spirit of Speyside Festival family across the world for keeping the spirit of the festival alive.Whisky and tourism are pivotal sectors to the Scottish economy. Three out of every five tourists come to Speyside for whisky tourism. In fact, the Spirit of Speyside Festival welcomed visitors from  dferent countries to its th anniversary event last year. The Spirit of Speyside Whisky Festival has become an iconic event on the international whisky calendar, appealing to both the whisky curious and connoisseurs in a region that has become one of the fastest-growing tourist destinations in the UK.As well as being home to the highest concentration of distilleries of all whisky regions in the world, Speyside also produces the largest volume of whisky, as well as an increasingly wide range of spirits ndash we are now home to  dferent gin companies.This is why we introduced our Speyside Gin Festival in June, to create a new weekend for both locals and visitors to enjoy, then we celebrate all our great Speyside whisky companies and local gin and craft beer companies at our Distilled Festival, all under one roof in Elgin, normally at the end of August.This yearrsquos Gin Festival has sadly been cancelled and a decision is yet to be made about Distilled. However, based on current guidance, we feel itrsquos unlikely it will go ahead.But the appetite for whisky is there and it will remain. I am confident our economy will be rebuilt and we will work hard to do this together. According to VisitScotland, the Spirit of Speyside Festival welcomed visitors from  dferent countries to its th anniversary festival last year. This is a sector that is worth pound million to the regionrsquos economy. When we emerge from the other side of the pandemic Irsquom certain these figures will only increase.International travel is sure to take a downturn in the short term, while people look for local and regional travel opportunities on their doorstep. Domestic travel is set to be the first to bounce back when restrictions are eased, and I canrsquot wait to welcome tourists from all over the UK to beautul Speyside.Our Team Speyside approach to tourism will pull us through these tough times in our part of the world, of that I have no doubt. Our whisky distilleries will reopen, glasses will be raised to good health, and visitors from across the world will once again immerse themselves in Malt Whisky Country.

I wanted to bring culture into peoplersquos living rooms and to have a sense of everybody doing it at the same time, because one of the things that has been happening a lot is that people have been pre-recording these cultural experiences and sometimes they can seem dead on arrival ndash but I wanted this to feel very live.Beginning on Thursday at pm, Kay will launch this series of online literary and musical performances, produced by the National Theatre of Scotland and streamed on its YouTube channel. In its mix will be not only readings and singing, but conversation about art and poetry, as well as the strange times we are going through and the struggles they bring. Kay, who will host, hopes they will offer ldquofood for the soul.Having lost her father, pre-lockdown, and struggled with not being able to see her mother who is in a care home, she acknowledges that, like many, she has found these times hard. ldquoIrsquove been traumatised by lots of things. The last time I saw my mum I had to persuade the home to let me in just to say goodbye. Hers was one of the first homes in the country to go into lockdown, on March , and though at the time it felt shocking it was definitely a wise move. I know two homes, near hers, that have had many die just in the last few days. Itrsquos terrying. I find it worse, this situation, having my mum in the home at this time, than my dad dying. I know that loss canrsquot really be measured in scales butI had to say what was the most dficult experience I would definitely say this is the most dficult experience ever.One of the things Kay want to do is ldquoaccompany people through these times. That accompanying is partly what we have a Makar for. Itrsquos one of the reasons we turn to poets, singers and artists. In times like these we need such voices. ldquoI feel itrsquos important, now, to accompany people, she says, ldquobecause I think that this particular crisis has turned the volume up. Kind people have got kinder, anxious people more anxious. Itrsquos showed the huge problems we have in our society already. Poor people are more likely to die quicker of this virus, BAME people are more likely to die quicker ndash so I just wanted to create something that takes note of our time but also offers something up to them.The series is curated by Kay and produced by the National Theatre of Scotland in association with HOME Manchester and Edinburgh International Book Festival and School of Arts and Media, Salford. The writers and musicians are being paid in an attempt to support artists during this dficult period. The commitment to the four-month stretch of the series is also an acknowledgement that we will not be ing to social gathering, theatre-going and the live arts experience any time soon. Most of the summerrsquos live events, including Edinburghs festivals, are already cancelled.ldquoI think, says Kay, ldquoeven when people start trying to put their heads out of the door, theyrsquoll want to pull their head right back in. People are not going to gather publicly for some time. I donrsquot think theatres are going to be open till January next year, at the earliest, and even when things do open, people will be wary about gathering in public groups.Many artists, she observes, are shting to trying to deliver their work online ndash and this may be increasingly the way of the future. ldquoWe all needed to be travelling less, flying less, and so perhaps some of these new formats are new formats for our times and point the way to cleaner air.Makar To Makar will be part of the flowering of creativity that has already been happening online. ldquoWe know,\" says Kay, \"from reading about all dferent crises throughout time, that people will turn to poetry and music. During the siege of Sarajevo, they had years of no water, no electricity, very little proper food, bombs going off, but they still managed to erect these theatres and people still managed to come out and see shows.\"The Covid- crisis, she notes, ldquohas been musicrsquos defining hour\". ldquoPeople have been touched by things like the Italians singing on their balcony.But whats missing with much online art is that sense of us all coming together in a moment of time, as we would around a live event. This is what Kay hopes to create. ldquoRight now wersquove lost our communality because wersquore not able to do communal things together, like go out and eat together or go to the theatre together, and it seems to me this is one way of bringing the communal back.\" What she wants, she says is to give people ldquosomething stimulating, hopeful, thought-provoking, funny, sad, a whole range of things ndash and that people will get a chance to experience it all together."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-inspiration-helped-scots-chef-reach-final-great-british-menu","story":"Drawing on a scene from one of her favourite books Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Edinburgh-based chef Roberta Hall-McCarron made her way into the last week of the Great British Menu after winning the Scottish heat of the BBC show.This year chefs are competing to earn a place to present a dish at a banquet to celebrate childrenrsquos literature and for Mrs Hall-McCarron, chef and owner of The Little Chartroom, the menu brief could not have been better.ldquoThere have been some amazing banquet themes over the years of this competition, but when I learned this yearrsquos was childrenrsquos literature, I think we have the best yet, said Mrs Hall-McCarron.ldquoAs a young adult I remember reading the Harry Potter novels and the Goblet of Fire stood out for me. When it came to creating the menu there was a scene in the with Hagrid and Harry before the dragons arrived.

I used wood sorrel and mushrooms as well - things you might associate with a walk in the woods.ldquoIn the heats the judges asked for more theatre so for the final the starter was presented to them after a fire-eating display.

He got a result, too, securing an admission from Boris Johnson that a lack of testing capacity was the reason for the early halting of track and trace.Neilrsquos praise did not stop there. On his performance against First Secretary Dominic Raab while the PM was convalescing, the former Sunday Times editor declared that ldquothe UK now had a ing, probing, measured, informed official opposition. The government will need to raise its game.Not everyone is as impressed. An Ipsos Mori survey at the end of April asked a sample of the public who they thought was doing a good or bad job in holding the UK Government to account during the virus crisis. Top of the league were the journalists at the pm Downing Street press briefings, with % of respondents praising their effectiveness.: Poorest Scots twice as likely to die from virusBottom was the Labour Party, %, with its new leader faring not much better with %.With % backing him, Piers Morgan, motormouth co-presenter of Good Morning Britain, was hailed as being a better leader of the opposition than the actual leader of the opposition.As Ipsos MORI pointed out, Sir Keirrsquos low rating may be explained by his not yet appearing on many peoplersquos radars. Any leader of the opposition struggles to break through the noise of the everyday cut and thrust. Few have faced the roaring din of the coronavirus crisis.Slowly and surely, however, he is making his presence felt, whether it be in a televised response to Boris Johnsonrsquos address on easing the lockdown in England, at PMQs, and in the press generally.He has been interviewed for this paper by our Westminster correspondent Hannah Rodger, and last Saturday he was the cover star of the FT Weekend magazine, complete with arty, moody, black and white photography. He intends to make more visits to Scotland when circumstances allow, and has already begun a series of virtual meetings with the Scottish public.Other than wartime it is hard to imagine more dficult circumstances for a new leader of the opposition to be taking up his job. He must hold the Government to account at the same time as supporting its efforts to save lives and keep people afloat financially he needs to point out mistakes without appearing to gloat and he has to call into question the competence of a Prime Minister who remains popularin many parts, and who was himself a victim of the virus.Sir Keirrsquos approach has been one of offering ldquoconstructive opposition. Yesterdayrsquos PMQs was another illustration of what this strategy looks like in action.As the second time the two men have clashed at PMQs, the session was also a chance to see how their relationship is shaping up. Every leader hopes to be lucky in their opposite number at PMQs, to be the Thatcher to the Kinnock, the early years Blair to the IDS.: Iain Macwhirter, border war off but tensions remainMr Johnson and Sir Keir have sharply dferent styles, the PMrsquos bluster and waffle contrasting with his opposite numberrsquos clipped precision. The Labour leader did not get the better of the PM to the same extent he did last week. The run-up to his questions was too long and meandering, and he was laying the civility on with a trowel instead of a kne. There remains, too, the not so small matter of his personality. Perhaps it is newcomerrsquos nerves, but his voice does take on a certain John Major tone, or should that be drone, at times. If the Commons chamber ever gets back to its usual packed state at PMQs he could struggle to be heard. In general, he is a man not overburdened with charisma.Then again, one personrsquos charm is anotherrsquos smarm. Where he impressed most yesterday was in his ability to get under the PMrsquos skin, this time on international comparisons of death rates ndash an exercise the Government took part in until the UK figures became the worst in Europe. The Labour leader had an advantage, and he pressed it home.Scotland has a stake in whether Sir Keirrsquos approach to opposition works. We should be in the market to learn about any kind of effective opposition, because heaven knows we do not have much of one at the moment.Before coronavirus, the opposition parties at Holyrood were failing to hold the government to account on a long list of subjects, from not meeting NHS waiting time targets to falling education standards.We know how this state of affairs has come about. In a matter of years both the Conservatives and Scottish Labour lost their leaders and replaced them with less effective candidates the Scottish Greens keep the SNP in power, and as for the Scottish Liberal Democrats, two words: Willie, Rennie. You do not need to be a fan of Nicola Sturgeon to acknowledge that she is head and shoulders above the other party leaders. Which is good for her and her party, but it makes for a pretty poor show when it comes to holding government to account.There is another reason, other than the present crisis, to hope the opposition parties in Scotland get their act together soon. The next Scottish Parliament election is less than a year away. Who knows what position Scotland and the UK will be in then. Given the ever more dire assessments of the impact of coronavirus on the economy, governments around the UK will be dealing with levels of unemployment and hardship the likes of which have not been seen in generations.The economic landscape has changed utterly, and in time politics will catch up.Now, more than ever, we need governments that are up to the job, and oppositions to match.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

critically ill coronavirus patients requiring ICU treatment so far, admissions appear to have stalled.The Scottish Government had set a target of quadrupling Scotlandrsquos intensive care capacity to  beds amid fears that the NHS would be overwhelmed.But it comes as new statistics reveal that people living in the poorest areas of Scotland are more than twice as likely to die from the infection, with men also  per cent more likely than women to suffer fatal complications.As of May , a cumulative total of  patients confirmed to have the Covid infection had been treated in Scotlandrsquos intensive care units, according to the second report on the pandemic by Public Health Scotland.: Excess death rate from all causes during Covid % lower in Scotland than England and WalesCrucially, that figure was unchanged from PHSrsquos first report, when it stated that  confirmed Covid patients had been admitted to ICUs to date ldquoas of May . Although some patients lsquosuspectedrsquo of having the virus were brought into intensive care during the seven days in between, they subsequently tested negative.The number of confirmed Covid patients in ICU has also continued to fall since the weekend, from  on Sunday to  as of yesterday, although two lsquosuspectedrsquo Covid patients were awaiting the results of tests.The figures are likely to add to pressure on the Scottish Government to step up preparations to resume NHS elective operations, including some cancer and heart bypass surgeries, which have been put on hold to focus resources on the outbreak and limit the risk of exposing very vulnerable patients to the virus in hospital.Thousands of other routine procedures, such hip and knee replacements or cataracts removals, were also suspended for a three-month period from mid-March, with other services such as bowel, breast and cervical cancer screening also paused for the same period.The Royal College of Physicians Edinburgh this week urged ministers to ldquomove swtly but carefully towards the restoration of planned medical procedures, adding that this ldquomust include cancer services.: Scottish Government advisor back two-track exit from lockdown that would benefit majority earlierIntensive care admissions for Covid peaked in Scotland on March , when  patients with the infection were admitted on a single day.Since April , new admissions have been falling almost steadily, but it is unclear exactly when the last Covid positive patient was admitted to ICU in Scotland.According to the first report by the Scottish Intensive Care Society Audit Group, which covers a period up to May ,  per cent of intensive care admissions were male, the median age of patients was , and % had no pre-existing conditions.Of those who did, the most common were diabetes or respiratory disease , followed by cancer , and cardiovascular disease .People from Scotlandrsquos poorest areas accounted for % of ICU admissions for Covid, compared to % from the most affluent areas.Overall mortality, based on the  patients who had completed their ICU stay by May , showed that % of patients died. That is lower than the % death rate reported for intensive care Covid patients in England and Wales, but may be skewed by a smaller sample size and does not include the outcomes for those patients who remained in ICU as of May .It comes as the latest report by National Records of Scotland revealed that men are % more likely than women to die from Covid, with Scots from the most deprived areas are more than twice as likely to die from the virus as those from the wealthiest postcodes.: Poorest Scots twice as likely to die from coronavirusThis is in line with patterns seen where in the UK which have been linked to existing health inequalities, such as higher rates of obesity, smoking and chronic disease among the poor, as well as potentially higher risk of exposure in low-paid occupations.Research this week from the Office for National Statistics found that security guards, care workers, builders, cleaners, taxi drivers, bus drivers, chefs and retail staff are all at a greater risk of dying from Covid.In Scotland, % of those who died in April had at least one pre-existing condition. The most commonwas dementia, reflecting the fact that three quarters of Covid victims are  or older.According to NRS, which bases its figures on death certicates,  people had died with Covid by May , although the numbers are now falling.From May -, Covid was linked to  deaths in Scotland - down  from the previous week. It is the second weekly reduction in a row.Care homes continue to account for the largest share of Covid deaths - % last week and % of the total to date - but the actual number of people dying in care homes was also down for the second week in a row, to .Nicola Sturgeon welcomed the decrease, but stressed the Scottish Government will ldquocontinue to err on the side of caution.She added: ldquoAlthough we are seeing positive signs in the case numbers, those in hospital and those dying from this virus, we are not through this pandemic yet."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11368822.jpg?type=article-full","title":"coronavirus-half-scottish-families-children-financially-struggling","story":"Some , households with children in Scotlandare \"struggling to make ends meet\" or in \"serious financial dficulty\" according to the analysis which reveals the \"shocking\" toll that the coronavirus pandemic is having on family financies. This compares to  per cent of all households in Scotland reporting the same levels of financial stress.The leading think tank IPPR Scotland, which carried out the research is calling on the Scottish Government and the UK government to step in to provide new payments to financially-starved households.It comes as over  campaigners signed an open letter urging the First Minister to fund an ldquoemergency package to prevent a child poverty crisis.The key demand is for the Scottish Government to put the equivalent of pound a month into the pockets of low income families for every child.Child poverty in Scotland stands at around ,, but fears exist the Covid- crisis will increase unemployment and plunge more families into hardship.:Coronavirus in Scotland -Poverty warning for Scots hit by increased household billsAnd the IPPR Scotlands poverty survey of  households using the Standard Le Foundationrsquos Covid- Financial Impact Tracker created discovered what it described as a \"very worrying picture\" in the midst of the pandemic.The think tank extrapolated that around one in five families described themselves as being in \"serious financial dficulty\" while a further % said they were \"struggling to make ends meet\".Another % said they were \"potentially exposed financially\" while just % admitted that they were financially secure.Russell Gunson, director of IPPR Scotland said that despite current government support, including furloughing schemes which aim to protect up to % of workers earnings until at least the end of July, familes across Scotland were facing a \"signicant reduction in their income\" with many going into the crisis already struggling financially and without savings to cushion the blow.He said that meant a % reduction in earnings, and a potentially drastic drop in income to the levels of support offered by Universal Credit, would be \"impossible to absorb\".\"Our analysis shows that without question, hundreds of thousands of families with children in Scotland are struggling to make ends meet right now and we must look at what the UK and Scottish governments can do to help them with urgent support immediately,\" said Mr Gunson.\"The Scottish Government cannot shield low income families from the full financial hit many will face.\"Using the powers it has, the Scottish Government has moved to provide welcome additional funding to carers and to people in crisis through increased welfare funds, although more is needed.\"While the Scottish Government cannot do it all, it can do more.\"At the same time, and arguably to a greater extent, we must see action from the UK government to protect families with children in Scotland and across the UK. Most of the social security system is still reserved to Westminster, and the financial stress experienced by families in Scotland is being felt across the UK. So the UK government must act quickly to provide additional support to families with children.\"He said that in Scotland, the Covid- crisis has \"unfortunately\" forced the delay of one of the crucial measures that could have been used to help low income families in Scotland ndash the new Scottish Child Payment. The payment will see pound per week paid to low income families with children and was due to begin to be paid in late , starting with low income families with children under- before rolling out to all children under- by .He said this has now been delayed at least by months, while the crisis unfolds and limited administrative capacity becomes even more constrained.IPPR are now calling on the Scottish Government to urgently provide lump-sum payments of pound per child to low-income families this summer.This would get support equivalent to pound per week for the next six months to families now. It said it could be paid to families in receipt of Best Start Grantand through local authorities to those in receipt of the School Clothing Grantusing existing application, administration and payment routes to \"ensure payment is quick and the calls on administrative capacity are low\".It said the UK government should urgently increase the child supplements paid through Universal Credit by pound per week and provide a pound uplt in Child Benefit for the duration of the crisis. It said they should also end the two-child limit and benefit cap.\"We need to see the UK government act to support families with children,\" said Mr Gunson. \"To date this has been a key gap in its financial response to the crisis. By boosting child supplements paid through Universal Credit, by ending the two-child limit and Benefit Cap, and by providing an uplt in Child Benefit we could see at least some help provided to families at this point of crisis.\"As necessary as this action is, even this would unlikely be enough to prevent familiesrsquo levels of financial stress increasing. However, it would certainly help those facing the worst of the crisis so far.\"Governments across the UK have shown willingness to protect businesses and the wider economy through unprecedented levels of support. We must ensure we act to support families facing serious financial stress through higher levels of support, to ease some of the pressure on families now and to avoid some of the worst damage to children and familiesrsquo prospects in the future.\"Signatories to the open letter to the First Minister, which included Barnardos, Poverty Alliance, the Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland and Scottish Womens Aid, say the families they work with ldquoare reporting increased financial stress and associated anxiety, loneliness, and more complex mental health problems, and that the charitable hardship funds many of them operate have come under massively increased pressure. Aberlourrsquos Urgent Assistance Fund alone has, they say, seen a % increase in demand.The group urges the First Minster to use ldquoevery tool at your governmentrsquos disposal to deliver an emergency package of financial support to all low income families\".John Dickie, director of the Child Poverty Action Groupin Scotland, added: ldquoFamilies are already being pulled under by the financial impact of coronavirus, undermining childrenrsquos education, health and le chances, and putting progress on child poverty at real risk. Itrsquos right that government at every level should use every power at its disposal to provide an anchor of financial security through these extraordinary times. Boosting family incomes now is vital to shore up the foundations on which the recovery from coronavirus can be built and future progress on child poverty made.Peter Kelly, director of Poverty Alliance, said: ldquoEven before the current crisis, one in four children in Scotland were growing up in poverty. But in the last month we have seen record levels of applications for Universal Credit as people lose their jobs or see their working hours reduced.ldquoWhile many of us are struggling, families who were already getting by on low incomes have been hardest hit. Women have been particularly affected because they are more likely to live in poverty, have disproportionate responsibility for childcare and account for % of lone parents.ldquoUnless we take action now, there can be no doubt we are facing a child poverty crisis. The Scottish Government needs to use every tool in its box to protect children and families by putting money in peoplersquos pockets.A Scottish Government spokesman said: ldquoWe understand that this is dficult time for many families. That is why we are working on introducing the new Scottish Child Payment and will be paying carers in receipt of Carers Allowance an additional supplement this year.ldquoWe have invested more than pound. billion of support for businesses, which will enable them to keep people employed, and also specic targeted intervention for self-employed people experiencing hardship so we can ensure people are supported.\"In addition we have committed pound million of additional funding to support those most at risk, including more than doubling the Scottish Welfare Fund with pound million of new investment and over pound million to local authorities, with pound million targeted at food insecurity ndash investment which is supporting over , children to access Free School Meals. In addition, our social security benefits provide a higher level of support than the DWP benefits they replace.\""},{"url":null,"title":"sky-broadband-much-uk-impacted-outage","story":"According to Downdetector the service is down across much of the UK with Glasgow and London particularly affected.A screenshot from DowndetectorIt is not yet knownother Sky services have been impacted as a result of the outage.Some took to social media to voice their displeasure at the outage.How can people actually work from Home when #skybroadband keeps going down either once or twice a week.

Questions such as: why can supermarkets stay open and their competitors canrsquot  Or: whatrsquos to stop people sunbathing or hanging out in the park when the risk of transmission outdoors is so much lower  And: why on earth are golf courses and garden centres still closed These are all excellent questions, but it was Mr Kempe who came up with the neatest and cleverest solution. He quite rightly pointed out that ldquostay at home was becoming just as confusing as ldquostay alert ndash how, for example, does the Scottish Governmentrsquos stay-at-home advice fit with their latest guidance that itrsquos safe to go out for physical exercise more than once a day  Stay Apart, he suggested, would be a much better and clearer option.ldquoStay Apart is applicable to all areas of le, wrote Mr Kempe, ldquoand would provide a sound framework for managing Covid- for the foreseeable future. It would enable Scotland to reopen its garden centres, as the Welsh Government has agreed, and could be used to determine what other workplaces could reopen safely. Such a framework would also provide a clear message to businesses about how to re-think their workplaces and how they might interact with the public in future.I agree with Mr Kempe and why on earth such a slogan hasnrsquot occurred to the media and comms people advising the UK and Scottish governments I have no idea. The business owners Irsquove spoken to recently also think a Stay Apart message could work for them and that it could work right now. In some cases, it has to before they lose their livelihoods altogether.Irsquom talking about people such as James McKelvey, who owns the Wanlockhead Inn high up in the Lowther Hills. Itrsquos a fantastic, characterful pub ndash open log fire, chips as big as sailing ships, Elvis karaoke machine, everything you could possibly want really ndash but it also has lots of space indoors and plenty outside too in the beer garden.Mr McKelvey told me just how badly hersquod been hit by the shutdown ndash two months now with zero income with no end in sight ndash and hersquos obviously aware that a balancing act is required and that people are ill and dying. But hersquos having a crisis of his own ndash will his business survive  He also feels that he could now safely open, provided of course that the public was made aware that distancing was still in operation, which is where the stay apart slogan comes in.The McIndoe family, who own and run the Mill Garden Centre in Armadale, feel pretty much the same way. Theyrsquove been following the coverage of the crisis in The Herald and a major frustration for them is that big businesses like supermarkets and BQ are open and selling plants and compost, etc, while horticultural businesses like theirs have been forced to stay shut. Theyrsquove also noticed a big dference in the levels of frustration among their customers in the last two weeks. People are desperate for some small change to lockdown.Again, the answer is ldquostay apart. The Mill Garden Centre is mainly based outdoors and, once open, the staff there would reinforce the stay-apart message by cleaning the handles of the trolleys, limiting the number of customers in the garden centre at any one time, using a one-way system and clearly marking safe distances on the ground. The McIndoe family also make the good point that therersquos been a push by government towards claiming financial support rather than supporting businesses to operate safely.The ldquostay apart message would allow businesses to do that and to do it right now. The McIndoe family say both the Scottish and UK governments have given large and powerful businesses favourable treatment and that this has caused inconsistency and confusion ndash why is BQ open but not businesses like the Mill Garden Centre  The push and pull between ldquostay at home and ldquostay alert is also making the situation worse.The answer, obviously, is to make it simpler. Make it clearer. Make it ldquostay apart.

It can also arise from the spontaneous decay of unstable atomic nuclei.The phenomenon can lead to an increase in air conductivity in the atmosphere through a process known as ionisation, releasing electric charge.Scientists have long suspected electric charge in the air can affect the way water droplets combine in the clouds which, in turn, can influence rainfall.However, these changes have been dficult to observe from modern-day weather data.So the team turned to the radioactive legacy of the Cold War nuclear arms race and combined bomb test data with historical weather records gathered from stations at Kew near London and Lerwick in the Shetland Isles.Although thousands of miles away from the detonation sites in the US and around the world, rainfall patterns in the Shetlands showed ldquosignicant changes during the test period as radioactive pollution spread widely throughout the atmosphere.The researchers wrote in their paper: ldquoSignicant changes occurred in daily rainfall distribution in the Shetland Islands, away from pollution.ldquoDaily rainfall changed by %, and local cloud optically thickened, within the nuclear weapons test period.ldquoThis supports expectations of electrically induced microphysical changes in liquid water clouds from additional ionisation.Scientists believe learning more about how electric charge affects rainfall will improve understanding of the weather processes and could help relieve droughts or prevent floods.The findings are published in the journal Physical Review Letters."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"May ,  at : amWith low water levels reported where in Scotland, Orkney Islands Council is offering some handy tips to people in the county with private water supplies – in case they experience similar problems later in the year.

He also asked ministersthe businesses case would be reappraised in light of the impact of COVID- on air travel. In response, the transport secretary, Michael Matheson confirmed that the business case will not be reviewed and that work to implement the strategy “will continue in parallel with work to prepare the IIA ” rather than be deferred.As part of his answer to Mr McArthur, Mr Matheson said good air connectivity will continue to be essential to support economic recovery in all parts of Scotland and that recovery will benefit from having more reliable and sustainable air services.#The main argument for the centralisation of the ATC services has been that modernisation was needed and the use of new technologies at the airports affected, which includes Kirkwall, would maker services more reliable.After receiving the responses, Mr McArthur said: “This is a remarkable assertion by the Transport Secretary, which shows a blatant disregard for the provisions of the Islands Act. If a major procurement process can be allowed to continue before any island impact assessment is completed, it rather suggests that ministers have little interest in what that assessment might conclude.“At a time when the future shape of air travel is so uncertain, at the very least Ministers and HIAL should be taking stock. Instead, both seem entirely happy to press on asnothing has happened.“No-one disputes the need for investment in modernising air traffic control services at airports across the region. Yet, plans to centralise services was always recognised as the most risky and costly of the options available.  In light of current restrictions, the island impact assessment offered the perfect opportunity to review this decision. “Sadly, the Scottish Government and HIAL have chosen to pass up that opportunity, while also doing little to inspire confidence amongst islanders about the value of the Islands Act”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Some people and even businesses have been tricked into paying for protective face masks and hand sanitizers from companies that don’t exist.There have also been messages from criminals sending messages to trick people into thinking they are getting genuine offers of financial support from the government.At the same time hackers are stepping up attempts to access people’s networks and steal their log in details and passwords.However,you take sensible precautions, you can quickly spot signs of fraud and identy the facts from the fiction.Sharing the right information could save lives.When it, is shared,  information can take on a le of its own and have some serious consequences.It can lead to health scares,  accusations and potentially damaging hoax stories.

Now, why does not Nicola change the dictate for Shetland  We would love to sunbath also, between the snow showers!!!!!😂😂😂😂How fortunate that the Scottish, Welsh and Irish leaders are maintaining their more sensible , balanced and wary approaches .Enlighten us Haydn, why is the infection rate lowerin England than in Wales and Scotland  I for one am not the least confused by the messages, just what is confusing you She niver agrees wIth what the rest off the UK IS DOINGBruce, you make it look asNicola, is acting like a Tory##..The Tory policy being##..me, me, me and melolSince you appear to not know, there has been confusion in Britain today about the actual meaning of BoJo’s statement yesterdayand , as I write, he is trying to explain himself away on TV. THAT shouldn’t be necessary should it  But, in true B J fashion he is resorting to make do and mend bluster. I am mindful of the blind leading the blind.Let decisions be made by scientists not ill equipped dabbling politicians.That little pat on the head should appeal to you !!But never mind Nicola is letting us out exercise twice a day. It is a shame we are all being channelled into the same crowded places, through the same gates and chokepoints whilst the wide-open spaces and beaches of Shetland are closed down to the majority!!In the present serious crisis she is in full agreement with Wales and Ireland but not with England. How fortunate that is.Britain is no longer ruled by England now that devolution has taken place. Boris Johnson claimed to be PM of 🇬🇧 Britain.He surely meant🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 not 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Scotland or 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿Wales.Westminster is reluctant to let goIt is extraordinary sad news from Care Homes and Care Workers, but not unexpected. It takes months of training and years of experience to Barrier nurse to prevent cross-infection. Even the use of PPE requires extensive training. Our most vulnerable people conjugated into crowded homes was an accident just waiting to happen. Hopefully, next time, our care workers will have extensive professional training cross infection control with qualications and wages to match. Our most vulnerable, not all be herded into care homes but perhaps into a chalet system where separation and quarantine would be so much more effective..What is the R rate for Shetland  Looks like zero The politicians # all of them can #go away# .Do your gardening, go fishing, go for a walk whenever and where ever you want. Get the kids back into school. Get our economy open and people back to work.This is my opinion.Dive, e , e # incoming!!!What do you want  A Country with a minimised death toll but teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, or a country that#s suffered a higher death toll, and while perhaps shaken somewhat financially, is still resilient enough to continue without any great undue hardship for the survivors.England at present seems to be trying to steer an admittedly somewhat shaky course towards the latter, the rest of the UK, unfortunately seem hell bent on taking the direct route straight to the former.You cannot sustain increased Governmental expenditure and decreased Governmental income for any longer than the very short term, it called burning the candle from both ends#. We#ve been doing it now for  weeks### Very soon the time will come when Governmental leaders will have to make decisions on how many deaths are acceptable collateral damage to allow them to provide the services the majority need and keep their country afloat. The longer they leave it to make that decision, the more rushed, and by consequence, less appropriate, it is likely to be.There is no vaccine, there is no #cure#. Unfortunately some are going to have to take a hit for the team.It’s unfortunate that three centuries of free-market capitalism hasn’t generated enough wealth to feed the country for more than three months without going bankrupt but don’t worry Michael. Many people share your concerns about the economy and the government is onto it:A confidential Treasury assessment of the coronavirus crisis leaked to Theargues that it will require measures including a two-year public sector pay freeze in order to “boost investor confidence# in the British economy. So, a round of grateful applause for the NHS Staff, Care Workers, Police and everyone at London Transport.I hope the nurses are enjoying all the clapping and rattling of pots and pans every Thursday because that is all they are going to get.It is reassuring to know that things really are ing to normal.At least a public sector pay freeze will not discriminate. It will apply equally across the board and affect everyone from care home cleaners on minimum wage to the head of health and social care at Labour controlled North Lanarkshire council, salary £,“Some are going to have to take a hit for the team.”Yes Michael, in more ways than one.Well put, Malcolm.The simple fact is unavoidable this virus is here to stay. One day we will all meet it. The single most important thing is to keep the numbers down, so ICUs are not swamped, learn the best therapies to reduce the death toll as much as is practical and research for treatments and a vaccine. Try and avoid peak outbreaks, especially in winter, when the flu   covid combination will be nasty. Isolate our most vulnerable, maybe for a very long time and leave people to chose. I am approaching  years old and have no intention of isolating forever. In due course, I will get this virus and take my chances. I would instead rather enjoy my time than clamber fearfully into a sterile hole forever!!! As for Sturgeons exercise twice a day, she can stick that where the sun does not shine. The simple fact is being fit is perhaps my and everyone best chance for survival, twice a day exercising and the rest of my time on my sweet derriere is stupid, just as Nicola#s latest dictates!!!I’m reminded of the proud mother watching her son taking part in the passing out parade at Sandhurst.She noticed that everyone was out of step apart from her son!Oh dear, did I just read #BO JO#s policy actually worked# Thats plainly pants, pure and simple.Briefly, to Michael#s point, it is only recently that we paid off our war debt to the USA, so some financial mechanisms will be found.But I think I heard Portugal went into lockdown straight after their first COVID  death, whereas the UK waited for over a hundred. Plainly things could have been very dferent, very much better, and acting quicker would have been far cheaper, with far less loss of le, and a quickerto a ing economy.But it would have also required people being put before profit right from the start.So it really had been business as usual from the bottom feeding disaster capitalists that run the UK.#BO JO#s policy actually worked# indeed.That would be laughableit wasn#t so tragic.Sadly without vaccines and anti-virals, it is that simple. The fact is it has only just started and will be with us until we are all immune or dead. Let us pray for the former and immunity by vaccination. To coin a cliche, it will be total isolation for the most vulnerable until herd immunity develops, as with every infectious viral disease in human history! Development of immunity and resistance is what will stopCovid  eventually, nothing , as withPolio, Smallpox, Measles, Herpes et alNo. We need to keep as many people alive as possible until vaccine is developed.People are not simply expendable.Effective PPE supplies and speed of sufficient testing is critical to this.The Tory led, Tory delayed UK response has been woeful on these.No scope for argument there.Thousands have died that need not have.No scope for argument there either.It has been an ideologically misled catastrophe. genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #But now that you point out about all those genetic iations, we probably ought to phone them and tell them to call of the hunt since they#ve probably not thought of that. Best just let nature take its course and get the economy on track with hundreds of thousands of deaths, a swamped NHS and a profoundly sick and worried population.Bo Jo#s policy was actually endorsed and followed to the letter by all the devolved Governments of the Uk until we got our knickers in a twist about a slogan. I never realised Nicola was a # bottom feeding disaster capitalists # for endorsing Bo Jo#s policy for so long. She only on Sunday became confused and what a fuss out that she made. On the bright side, we may legally exercise twice daily now, what outstanding leadership!Ian your unwavering faith in BoJo the clown, in the absence of any logical rationale or evidence for doing so, is truly astonishing.Again, Tory apologist spin from Tinkler. From mid-Jan through Feb Boris missed  COBRA meetings on COVID  to which Sturgeon was not invited.Yes the UK#s other parliaments fell into line once the Bullingdon Club realised there was to be no Britains Open for Business, herd-immunity-now approach. Elements of that thinking lingered on and are resurfacing now, not the least within the twisted outpouring of local eugenicists.Act in haste, repent at leisure seems to sum up such weakness.I am trying very hard toto see things from your perspective, but I cannot ignore the indicators and commentary that indicates that the UK economy will officially be in recession by the end of  Q.GDP has fallen by % in the first quarter of this year and predicted to be possibly as high as % in the second quarter.The Bank of England has tried to put a brave face on things by saying #the impact is likely to be temporary with activity rebounding strongly once social distancing measures are lted#. The question is when will social distancing be lted.Are you advocating that we just wait and see how things pan out, maybe the idea of a V shaped recovery will happen in the rd and th quarters, a vaccine will be developed in time and the world can go back to the #old normal#A simple warning from history # Recession , Depression, War.Recession, depression, war. Exactly. We know that the mortality rate is roughly .%. UK population is approx  million. Let#s say we just let the virus take its course, albeit slowed due to some adjustments to how we work and % of the population catch it. An effective treatment or vaccine is by no means guaranteed. % of  million is . million. .% of that is about , deaths. Then there are the hundreds of millions of working days lost to people off sick with the virus. Then there are the people suffering long term consequences of the virus and the cost of caring for them. How is this a recipe for a healthy economy  How will this level of death and suffering motivate investment or spending  Where does this assumption that we can just get going again like things were before come from  The world has changed. I know it feels good to bury our heads in the sand and think we can just go back to how things were and let a few old folks die. But that is profoundly naive. There is no simple answer. Except Mr. Tinkler#s. Make of that what you will.Ali asks: # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #I don#t know Ali.I#m not a dentist.To my understanding there does not need to be an exact genetic match for vaccines to be sufficiently helpful, but as I can#t trace my male line back over countless generations maybe Ali should consult a bard or a sage instead.There is, and has been, something of a medical research race on for understanding of transmission, for patient management treatment and for vaccines.Prompter action would have kept more folk alive longer whilst progress was made. The usual suspects are welcome to argue that and which way they may like, but it won#t change matters..."},{"url":null,"title":"convener this isnt the time for national leaders to be playing politics ","story":"That was the call from Shetland Islands Council convener Malcolm Bell after Prime Minister Boris Johnson adopted a dfering stance on exiting lockdown than his devolved counterparts, including First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.But Mr Bell believes there is little distance between the prime minister and first minister on how best to progress, at least once the political posturing between the two is taken out of the equation.National media reports highlighted dferences of opinion in the two leaders after Mr Johnson set out plans to mody the lockdown south of the border with a broadcast on Sunday evening.He fleshed out the details in the House of Commons on Monday, amid criticism that there was a lack of clarity about the message emanating from Westminster.Officials and elected representatives are eager to keep the “R” infection rate below one, which means each existing infection causes less than one new infection, meaning the disease will decline and eventually die out.: “There’s maybe not as much distance between the prime minister and the first minister as the language suggests. The dference appears to be largely in emphasis and timing.“But this isn’t the time for our national leaders to be playing politics. It’s critical that we have a clear message that people continue to follow the advice and guidelines.”The convener said he was not too concerned that dferent parts of the UK were thinking about the lockdown exit dferently.“In one sense everybody talks about ‘the science’. There’s no such thing as ‘the science’. There’s ‘science’, and as long as they’re taking their evidence from the same science it could be perfectly reasonable for dferent parts of the UK to go at a slightly dferent pace.“You can find a scientist to back up whatever you want. I’m concerned they are now going to start using this to emphasise political dferences. I think I would expect more from our leaders at a time of national emergency.”Mr Bell stressed people had to get back to work at some time, especiallythey wanted to preserve things like the “world-class health service” which they benefit from.He added that, when that time comes, #we do have to show the same sort of courage and commitment that our key workers at the moment – our health workers, bus drivers, ferry crews, care workers and shop assistants – are doing.”Following the prime minister’s address, residents in England will be able to carry out more outdoor exercise as of Wednesday.Mr Johnson also said primary schools south of the border may begin to re-open in June, as well as non-essential shops, while the hospitality industry could see operations begin again from July.He added people in England should be “actively encouraged” to go to workthey were unable to work from home.Mr Johnson said it would “soon be the time” to consider imposing a -day quarantine on people coming into the country by air.But the prime minister’s comments came as official data showed infections had risen in Germany, just days after the country eased its lockdown restrictions.Mr Johnson was criticised for his new “stay alert” message which he was advising in favour of keeping the “stay at home” dictum that has been the key message in tackling the virus head-on.Ms Sturgeon said the “core principles” of the lockdown measures remained in place, although she was willing to loosen restrictions enough to allow people to exercise outdoors more than once a day.She told journalists: “The objectives now for all of us must be to consolidate and solidy that progress. We mustn’t squander our progress by easing up too soon or by sending mixed messages that make people think it’s okay to ease up.”She added: “Let me be very blunt about the consequenceswe were to do that. People will die unnecessarily, and instead of being able to loosen restrictions, hopefully in the near future, we will be faced instead with having to tighten them.“We must not take that risk.” raquoAnd any way I don#t thing we voted her inOnly way Shetland will get a world class health system ishe is planning to sell it to one of the Nordics# once lockdown ends the community will be back to fundraising for equipment, longer waiting lists due to lack of medical and dental services for months, commuting to mainland Scotland for treatment etc. Faroes had  deaths,  cases in care homes, is covid free and out of lockdown..."},{"url":null,"title":"job retention scheme extended with greater flexibility for return to work ","story":"A Shetland business representative has welcomed the extension of a scheme helping employers retain their workforce through the Covid- crisis.Living Lerwick#s project manager Emma Miller said today#s announcement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak was a #massive help#.Mr Sunak said the UK government#s job retention scheme would be extended by four months until October.Ms Miller had warned last week that without an extension to the scheme some businesses may have had to start considering redundancies.

Corona is incubated in the wider community.There are certain places where you do not want the virus to end up, because the death rates are bound to be very highit gets in there, and care homes are the most dangerous place of all.The failing in this case lies in the lack of oversight within Scotland, andwe are to learn anything from this, it is important that responsibility is fully and accurately apportioned.The Scottish Government have tried to say that care home owners themselves have been negligent.If this is the case, then anyone catching the virus since the outset must also be in some way negligent, orthey contracted it in a public institution, then it must have been negligent.Such is the downward spiral that arises when government chooses not to look at itself but wants to find some-one  to blame., Aberfeldy I would like to remind all reporters that Home Farm was a particular home at risk due to its persistent failure in even basic Infection Control Procedures.This has been evident since November .

It is also worth noting that the SNP have stated care homes will pay for the non-standard PPE issued by the Scottish Government.Not something I believe is entirely reasonable, given this being a global pandemic and the regulations enforced by the Government.Rest assured, our thoughts are with the victims of this horric virus. I hope accountability is aligned to where it resides here in Scotland. re Home Farm Nursing Home is not only inaccurate it is totally biased.I have a simple question for you#. the SNP and that woman Sturgeon are not responsible for anything why then do we need them So no doubt you will give them credit without hesitation but when truth and correct fact is required you cannot bring yourself to name and shame and there is indeed plenty to shame them for , including this.Perhaps your reporting needs closer scrutiny in future.I am disabled and use a rollator to get around. On Thursday last week I hurt my back and couldn#t walk even with the rollator.I needed to buy some food but discovered the co-op doesn#t do home delivery. They used to, but not anymore.I tried Skye community response and they put me on to the warehouse which is mainly vegetables.I found there was nowhere to turn to and was getting exasperated. Along with the pain it wasn#t doing me any good.My doctor suggested I increase the morphine that I#m already on to seethat helps.I#m angry that there is no help for people like me.The co-op could easily do home delivery. I don#t know why they don#t.The co-op could allow disabled people to go straight in and not stand in a queue and I mean disabled people # not the ones who can walk perfectly with a walking stick and have somehow managed to get a blue badge .There should be something in place to help people like me without having to go through reams of red tape.Meanwhile I#m just about out of bread and milk andit wasn#t for the kind actions of a neighbour I would be stuffed.Why isn#t there something in place for these who find themselves in a situation like mine. Andthere is then why is it being kept a secret last week reminded me that about  years ago, as part of the Their Past Your Future project, the Museum of the Isles at Clan Donald and the Archive Service in Portree collaborated on an oral history project relating to the second world war in Skye.One of the outcomes was a book The Crofters and the War, using excerpts from the many hours of recordings that were made, mainly by Mary Carmichael who was the project officer.The book included a chapter on the surrender. There were quotes from Annie MacLean of Raasay, and from Ruth Coghill, Vi Beaton, and Mary Black, who all remembered seeing the surrender, as well as a photo of German sailors at Kyle station which is in the Archive service collections.I seem to remember that Mary Carmichael located a film of part of the surrender, as I remember watching it, but I am afraid I can#t remember where it originated # maybe the Imperial War museum, maybe the Scottish Film Archive.There were probably many other references to submarine activity and the end of the war where in the book, and also in the actual recordings.I can#t remember whether both the Museum and the Archive service kept copies of the recordings, or whether it was just one of them.Every contributor got a copy of the book, as did local schools, and it was also for sale so you may have come across a copy. The museum at Armadale still have a few copies I think.Finally, thank you for keeping us informed online during this lockdown.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/lockdown-pic.jpg","title":"news round up isles virus testing lockdown guidance and lifeboat call","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineIn line with Scottish Government policy, NHS Western Isles has this week started a new long-term approach to addressing COVID-, known as Test, Trace, Isolate, and Support.The principles of this approach are to:NHS Western Isles Chief Executive Gordon Jamieson welcomed this new approach.He said: “The Test, Trace, Isolate and Support approach is at this point our best chance of suppressing and preventing transmission of the Covid- virus.

The Office for National Statisticsrevealed yesterday that activity plunged .% in March in the biggest monthly fall since records began in . Read MoreEsmond Birnie:Opinion Coronavirus casts dark shadow over Northern Ireland economy with risk of another prolonged recession and a badly damaged labour marketThe March tumble sent gross domestic productdown % overall in the first quarter - the biggest fall since the end of  when Britain was at the height of the financial crisis. The latest figures show the first direct effect of the Covid- pandemic on the UK economy after the country was placed in lockdown to control the spread of the virus. But with the lockdown only coming into place on March , the second quarter will show the full hit on the economy after the UK ground to a standstill. Experts said the first quarter data suggested the economy could contract by up to % between April and June as the full effects of the lockdown are captured. In an article for today#s Belfast , Dr Birnie stated: It will take several years to claw our way back to where we were in  and the implication will be that the Covid- recession will impose lasting costs.The last recession in NI, the one which followed the banking crisis, was extremely protracted. According to the official measure of the volume of regional output, output peaked in Quarter   and then declined all the way through to Quarter  . This time could be dferent but it would seem the NI economy has form in terms of allowing downturns to become very long -lasting recessions.There is a strong risk history will repeat itself, given that the virus has generated so much uncertainty and reduced business confidence very substantially.Unfortunately, there is precedent for not only very prolonged recession but also for the recovery phase being rather shallow, he added.The Bank of England last week warned coronavirus could see the economy plunge by as much as % in the second quarter and fall by % overall in  - the worst annual fall for more than three centuries. London#s FTSE  Index fell .% after the GDP data and amid concerns over a second wave of coronavirus cases in countries that have started to reopen post-lockdown. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said it is very likely that the UK will face a signicant recession as a result of the coronavirus crisis. He told the BBC: A recession is defined technically as two quarters of decline in GDP. We#ve seen one here with only a few days of impact from the virus, so it is now very likely that the UK economy will face a signicant recession this year and we are in the middle of that as we speak. The Institute of Directors said that the official data was a sobering first glimpse of the economic turmoil caused by the outbreak.

Michael McAdam said it was dangerous to mix sport and cinemas under the leisure banner, as each is dferent in its own right.The Executive launched its roadmap out of lockdown on Tuesday and under #sport, cultural and leisure activities#, leisure centres and other indoor leisure facilities, including cinemas, could open at stage four of the plan.Mr McAdam felt it was wrong to categorise every business and believes the decision on whether they should reopen or not should be judged on an inidual basis.It#s up to each of us who operate a business to convince those who make the decisions how we can operate our businesses. I think it#s wrong that every business is categorised, he said.It#s not just from a selfish business perspective, but I think it#s important for people to see something happening.In stage one, four to six people can meet up, but where are they going to go and what are they going to do Unless there#s going to be something that people can go to, I think people are going to become very depressed.In an effort to prepare his cinemas for reopening, Mr McAdam has installed sneeze guards at tills and ordered temperature scanners from China. He has also updated the chain#s software so customers can only buy tickets online, which will automatically keep patrons away from each other inside the screens.It#s all about trying to reassure customers.All in all, we have been looking at this the whole way through and even how we are going to get people to leave the cinema, he said.Speaking later on BBC Radio Ulster#s Evening Extra, Mr McAdam was asked about the feasibility of drive-in cinemas.When we knew the lockdown was coming I was investigating this, particularly at the Jet Centre complex in Coleraine.

Speaking to the committee, Mr Roberts said: The plan is progress, but we believe that there needs to be clear and indicative timings and dates in that plan.The recovery plan for the Republic has a target date of June for the reopening of non-essential shops - and we believe that is achievable for Northern Ireland, but we will also need appropriate childcare provision.He said footfall in towns and cities in Northern Ireland had all but collapsed during lockdown.It is now time for Executive to work on a reopening plan for towns and cities. He said such measures would mean provisions such as stewarding and cleaning would have to be put in place, and new arrangements made for car parking and public transport. But he added: It would start the ball rolling and preparation would now begin for reopening our economy in a safe way.Aodhan Connolly, NI director of the NI Retail Consortium, said the pandemic had ushered in the worst crisis for the sector in some time.Covid- is the biggest external factor to affect our business and consumers in generations. Retail has already had signicant challenges and a huge change, with more transformation over the last five years than in the previous .And he said that while the perception was that the pandemic had ushered in a boom period for grocers, that had not been the case.Sales were up % in the first part of March while people stockpiled even though there was really no need. But what they were stocking up on was the lower-profit margin, cheaper goods like cheaper toilet rolls, cheaper proteins and cuts of meat. Then in the second half of the month we had the lowest sales figures since .The committee also heard evidence on the plight of small businesses from executives in Enterprise NI and InterTradeIreland.Michael McQuillan, chief executive of Enterprise NI - which represents  enterprise agencies around Northern Ireland - said firms should receive grant aid to help them implement changes in the workplace to adhere to social distancing. Small businesses are having to put in screening to protect staff, as well as providing hand sanitiser and developing one-way systems within their premises, he said. We think firms should be able to benefit from a grant of say £, or £, to pay for equipment to make your workplace safe.Also addressing the committee, Aidan Gough, designated officer and director of strategy and policy at cross-border body InterTradeIreland, said the Government would have a part to play in economic recovery as well as in keeping companies going through the crisis. Large infrastructure programmes that are being planned should be brought forward as quickly as possible to help stimulate demand within the economy.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It#s about shielding them from the virus itself so we can protect their lives and support them in doing that.There is a role for the wider Executive to play in regards to how we support people with food boxes, community pharmacy deliveries and looking at where we are on our program to see that those who are shielding can be given additional support or access to loved ones or family members, even should that be to a closed numbers of iniduals.Dr Dorman, meanwhile, told this newspaper that shielding was having a huge impact on vulnerable people#s lives. It#s massive. If you are full shielding and you live with someone , you have to be in a separate bedroom and you have to eat your meals on your own. It#s really, really tough. Those are very stringent and dficult circumstances, he said.At the moment, it#s an initial  weeks. If that is to be extended, it will have a signicant impact on people#s mental health.He stressed that doctors were already beginning to see the adverse impact of the lockdown on the population.GPs are very keen to offer support and we#re already seeing an increase in our workload on mental health, particularly the low moods and depression, Dr Dorman said. But we also know the population is at an increased risk of domestic violence and increased risk of alcohol consumption, so all things tie into the holistic health of our population.He stressed his peers were poised to support those who required mental health support and maintained that any decision to extend the shielding period would be made by the Executive. In general practice, we are very keen to support people through this, whatever is decided at a higher level above us, he added.Dr Dorman said some GPs would be relying on their multi-disciplinary teams - made up of a physiotherapist, social worker and mental health practitioner - to offer support to those who need it.Those social care and mental needs will be massive. We can see a tsunami of mental health needs coming down the tracks in primary care, he explained.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePhil and Brian Bell from Eglinton FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappPhil and Brian Bell from Eglinton#We look forward to day our family can come in for hugs#Brian Bell and his we Phil, both in their s, started shielding on the advice of their family nine weeks ago, when the first community case of coronavirus in Northern Ireland was reported.Since then le has been very dferent for Mr Bell, who despite living with Parkinson#s enjoyed an active le, including the gym, shopping and daily Mass.From his home in Eglinton, Mr Bell said not being able to spend time with his family remains the biggest struggle.Along with our family we decided to shield as soon as the first community case of coronavirus happened because my we and myself have underlying health conditions, he explained.I have Parkinson#s and my we is a recovering cancer patient.Before March , I was very active and went to the gym for a swim on the recommendation of my doctor.I also went into Derry shopping and I drove to our local chapel for daily Mass and it has been frustrating staying inside.We are lucky in that we have a garden and I am a keen gardener so being outside has helped enormously.I learned how to make better use of the internet so we watch Mass on the webcam and we have had video calls with our grandchildren.

Although we are told he is too young to be diagnosed.Jonathan said that when the letter arrived advising his family to shield, ice flashed down the spine.And when the roadmap out of lockdown only mentioned shielding twice - that it was tough on them and they should not meet up with family members in stage one - there was a hot flash of anger, he added. The information for those shielding has been nothing but overarching and general. And they are supposed to be among the most vulnerable.There has been suggestionssomeone had to go to school, they should go and stay with someone .

The well-known local politician died after a period of illness. Observing social distancing, many lined the roads leading to St Mary’s Church, Drumagarner as the cortege made its way into a church that parish priest John Cargan said should be full. Many of his party colleagues were not able to attend due to the Covid- regulations and instead posted tributes online. John was hugely admired and respected throughout the community in East Derry over the course of his -year political career. googletag.cmd.push He became the first nationalist mayor of the old Coleraine Council in  and won the respect of fellow councillors with his forthright determination. SDLP councillors on the current Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, where his daughter Helena serves, expressed their sadness at his passing. They said: “We have been privileged to have John as our mentor and role model. John worked tirelessly for everyone in our community and fought for justice for many. “He was a well-respected politician with very strong values and will be sadly missed by each and every one of us. “Our thoughts and prayers go to our colleague Helena her mum Anne and brothers Ronan and Diarmuid and the wider family circle.” googletag.cmd.push A teacher by trade, he taught at St Paul’s College in Kilrea for  years before being elected to serve in the Northern Ireland Assembly in . His commitment to the community was steadfast and he is widely credited with rejuvenating the Kilrea, Rasharkin and Dunloy Credit Union, which was in danger of closing. John was a champion for the underdog, something he said was ‘second nature’ to him while growing up. When a young African student was due to be deported after her visa had run out, he took her into the family home and supported her in extending her stay for a further two years. He was dogged in his pursuit of justice for what he described as the ‘dreadful murder’ of Inga-Maria Hauser, the German backpacker whose body was found in a remote part of Ballypatrick Forest, near Ballycastle, Co Antrim. When the family announced they would no longer be ing to mark her anniversary, John took up the mantle of remembering her every year at the forest park. John held the post of Deputy Speaker in the Northern Ireland Assembly for ten years and also served on the Public Accounts Committee with what Colum Eastwood described as ‘forensic skill’. “As a public representative, John struck fear into the heart of anyone who dared misspend a penny of public money,” said the SDLP leader. “I know I speak for everyone in the party when I say his good humour and wise advice will be sorely missed.” Following his death, tributes were paid across the political spectrum. First Minister Arlene Foster said he was ‘always to the fore in speaking up for his constituents’. Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill also expressed condolences, saying she was a ‘pleasant and witty man’, while Alliance leader Naomi Long said his death was a ‘genuine loss’. UUP MLA and Deputy Speaker Roy Beggs said he spoke for all the assembly when he said John would be ‘sorely missed’. Family was fiercely important to John and Fr Cargan told his funeral that, despite the pressures he encountered, he never allowed it to affect them. He said: “He encountered those who preferred darkness to light because their deeds were evil. “These threats put his family le under immense strain and it is to his credit that he never allowed this pressure to diminish the equality of le enjoyed by the family.” John’s family said they had been ‘overwhelmed’ by the volume of the support they had received following his death. They said: “We would like to express sincere gratitude to the many people who have provided comfort to our family at this sad time. “We wish to thank the hundreds of local people who observed social distancing and lined the route of the funeral cortege to St Mary’s, Drumagarner, Kilrea. There are no words to adequately describe how moved we were. “These are unkind circumstances to lay anyone you love to rest but so many people made it a lot easier and more dignied than it could have been. “We have been overwhelmed at the volume of calls, messages, social media posts and touching tributes to him. We thank everyone for taking the time to express condolences and for sharing memories and anecdotes. “We are indebted to the dedicated healthcare workers. We will be eternally grateful to so many incredible people for their support, in particular, Ciara our amazing NI Hospice nurse, our GP Dr McCormack, consultants Dr Stewart  Dr Mullan from the NW Cancer Centre and Dr Diamond from the Mater. “Our selfless district nurses who provided craic as well as first-class treatment, the very appropriately named “carers” and the Marie Curie nurses. All of them somehow make each family in their care feel like they are their only priority. “He put up one of the bravest and most humbling fights, in much the same courageous, tenacious way that he lived his le. We are filled with pride at the number of people he has touched.” Described by Fr Cargan as a ‘man of light’, John Dallat’s determination and passion for helping others has left a lasting imprint on the community in East Derry and on all who knew him.

James O’Donnell frequently takes photos of his beloved dog ‘Iggy’ in some of the most spectacular locations around the county. And she is now becoming a bit of a celebrity with thousands of people all over the world going online to see the Border Collie with stunning Donegal backdrops behind her. In one week recently, Iggy-related photos reached over a quarter of a million people on facebook. Falcarragh-based James has been building up a collection of photos with nine-year-old Iggy, and his work has attracted a lot of attention. googletag.cmd.push Indeed, in March, he had been scheduled to go to America for a number of exhibitions, starting in Florida. But the onset of Covid- meant the flights had to be cancelled. Nevertheless, he is hoping to go to New York later in the summer for another exhibition and possibly also to Connecticut. His talent is such that his work has attracted the attention of highly regarded veteran Magnum Photos member Elliott Erwittand Samuel Holmes , and through them steps were put in place for the planned exhibitions. The fact that they have been in contact highlights just what an impact James is making. googletag.cmd.push After World War II, a number of photographers banded together to form Magnum Photos, an organisation dedicated to chronicling world events - and named for the magnum-sized bottle of wine that they drank at each meeting! The process of becoming a full member of Magnum Photos takes a minimum of four years. Photographers are only considered once a year, during Magnums Annual General Meeting in June, where one day is set aside for considering and voting on potential new members portfolios. It is highly prestigious. “I love promoting Donegal,” James said, pointing out that he actually takes all his photos on his mobile phone! James lived in London for many years, before ing home to Donegal, and he adores the outside world and doing his bit to showcase and promote the county in any way that he can. Last year he produced a calendar called “Iggy’s Donegal” - filled with fine pictures from ramblings and hikes around Donegal - and it proved to be very popular. Recently a photo taken by James attracted the attention of BBC Northern Ireland weather forecaster Barra Best. Best tweeted the photo and commented that it was a “great example” of “an extremely rare phenomenon” known as Kelvin-Helmholtz clouds. The stunning imageof the cloud formation was taken from the Back Strand in Falcarragh, and needless to say, also featured Iggy. All the indications are that Iggy is on the way to being a great ambassador for Donegal, and while this will be a terribly dficult year for those in the tourism sector here, at least James and Iggy are publicising to the world some of the great sights to see. The story made the front page of this week’s Donegal Post newspaper and is featured in this Thursday’s Donegal Democrat .

See Around Britain has built up a large gallery of photographs from venues across Britain, Ireland and Europe and is covering County Derry with the help of local volunteers. Chloeacute Taylor, who lives in Dungiven, is one of those who has been helping the service to improve accessibility to venues locally. “It allows people, especially those with an impairment, who might be worried about going out to go and view a place or go to a beach, or a library or museum,” she told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “It gives them the descriptions and accessibility descriptions which is important in this day and age. It helps people that I know to go and get out of the house, and be more included. “I help with the social media side of things, producing content and bringing it to a wider audience. “I also help with venue descriptions for the website and take pictures of areas where I live and where I’m from. Originally from the West Midlands in England, Chloeacute has visited many places across the UK and Ireland, but things have slowed a little with the Covid- pandemic. She said: “Visiting places has become more dficult because you can’t really go too far with the requirements of the lockdown, but I am someone who takes a lot of pictures anyway. googletag.cmd.push “I have a lot saved from areas that I can use up and you can find the information quite easily, so it’s not a huge problem.” See Around Britain was formed in  by Marg McNiel, who has taken over , photos to help others with what to expect when they travel to a new venue. Marg suffers from Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, a neurological disease that affects all body systems and something he describes as feeling ‘constantly jetlagged’. The organisation is always on the lookout for more volunteers to increase their coverage of venues. “We have tried to do a comprehensive listing of Derry, not just the tourist sites,” he said. “We urgently need online volunteers that can sign up via our website. We think this will particularly help people during the current lockdown as they can use their talents or skills. “I aim to give skeleton coverage for more people to add to. It can include everyday things like pharmacies, clinics, hospitals, libraries, post offices and other shops. “Seeing is believing. It will help older people, people with impairments, or anyone really to know what to expect.” Much of the Marg’s early surveys were conducted from one of his three Morris Minor vans, which he admits are not in the best condition at the minute. “The last one had to be taken off the road in  because its chassis could no longer be patched to get it through an MOT,” he said. “There was nowhere to garage them undercover. The plan, as soon as we get them undercover, is to cut out the rust and replace it with steel  where necessary. “We want to convert them to electric motors because our present base is only rented and we plan to get a permanent base on a rural farm.” The vans will be used to ferry archives from the organisation’s current base when they source a new venue, but as with many projects, funding is proving to be an issue. He said: “We launched the website and its apps, which are free to download, in  and we’ve been building on it ever since. Each month it costs about pound,. “It’s hard getting revenue funding. You can get some through crowdfunding, but unless you’re like Captain Tom, it’s very hard. You have to have a high profile. “It’s very hard to get private sponsors, particularly because with the virus, most of the economy will be in deep recession. We’ve been trying to contact the actor Michael Sheen to help raise our profile. “Unless you provide something to help economic and social regeneration and we can play a vital role. “If people could see the worth of what we are doing, we could get a lot more volunteers and eventually, financial support.” “We’re trying to link up with an initiative in the Republic called Age Friendly Ireland. It was started by the former Chief Executive of Cavan County Council. “The Irish government has given funding for the Age Friendly Ireland offices in every county council as well as access and tourism officers. “We are trying to work with them to get a track record so we can go to the Ireland and Northern Ireland governments.” Volunteer Chloeacute also feels that the organisation could benefit so manyit received the right financial backing. “Disability also impacts on mental health and I definitely feel that government funding should be helping people to help others,” she said. “There is such a stigma surrounding disability and mental health, even now, and there shouldn’t be. Without See Around Britain, inclusivity for people would be reduced. “It helps improve the quality of their lives and help them realise that they can go to places with family and it helps them feel more included.” If you would like to become a volunteer for See Around Britain, or learn more about what they do, visit their website.

She said: “Visiting places has become more dficult because you can’t really go too far with the requirements of the lockdown, but I am someone who takes a lot of pictures anyway. googletag.cmd.push “I have a lot saved from areas that I can use up and you can find the information quite easily, so it’s not a huge problem.” See Around Britain was formed in  by Marg McNiel, who has taken over , photos to help others with what to expect when they travel to a new venue. Marg suffers from Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, a neurological disease that affects all body systems and something he describes as feeling ‘constantly jetlagged’. The organisation is always on the lookout for more volunteers to increase their coverage of venues. “We have tried to do a comprehensive listing of Derry, not just the tourist sites,” he said. “We urgently need online volunteers that can sign up via our website. We think this will particularly help people during the current lockdown as they can use their talents or skills. “I aim to give skeleton coverage for more people to add to. It can include everyday things like pharmacies, clinics, hospitals, libraries, post offices and other shops. “Seeing is believing. It will help older people, people with impairments, or anyone really to know what to expect.” Much of the Marg’s early surveys were conducted from one of his three Morris Minor vans, which he admits are not in the best condition at the minute. “The last one had to be taken off the road in  because its chassis could no longer be patched to get it through an MOT,” he said. “There was nowhere to garage them undercover. The plan, as soon as we get them undercover, is to cut out the rust and replace it with steel  where necessary. “We want to convert them to electric motors because our present base is only rented and we plan to get a permanent base on a rural farm.” The vans will be used to ferry archives from the organisation’s current base when they source a new venue, but as with many projects, funding is proving to be an issue. He said: “We launched the website and its apps, which are free to download, in  and we’ve been building on it ever since. Each month it costs about pound,. “It’s hard getting revenue funding. You can get some through crowdfunding, but unless you’re like Captain Tom, it’s very hard. You have to have a high profile. “It’s very hard to get private sponsors, particularly because with the virus, most of the economy will be in deep recession. We’ve been trying to contact the actor Michael Sheen to help raise our profile. “Unless you provide something to help economic and social regeneration and we can play a vital role. “If people could see the worth of what we are doing, we could get a lot more volunteers and eventually, financial support.” “We’re trying to link up with an initiative in the Republic called Age Friendly Ireland. It was started by the former Chief Executive of Cavan County Council. “The Irish government has given funding for the Age Friendly Ireland offices in every county council as well as access and tourism officers. “We are trying to work with them to get a track record so we can go to the Ireland and Northern Ireland governments.” Volunteer Chloeacute also feels that the organisation could benefit so manyit received the right financial backing. “Disability also impacts on mental health and I definitely feel that government funding should be helping people to help others,” she said. “There is such a stigma surrounding disability and mental health, even now, and there shouldn’t be. Without See Around Britain, inclusivity for people would be reduced. “It helps improve the quality of their lives and help them realise that they can go to places with family and it helps them feel more included.” If you would like to become a volunteer for See Around Britain, or learn more about what they do, visit their website.

When the buses started to come, it began to kick off. “They were getting transported up. They were young and they didn’t have to have their mother and father having to leave them up. googletag.cmd.push  As word spread and the disco began to grow in stature and reputation, the crowds funnelled down the narrow roads that led to the GAA club. That volume of hormonal adolescence in a confined area was sure to cause some friction, and from his perch on the stage, there wasn’t much Terry missed. “You had the odd row and then the bouncers went in,” he recalled. “Sometimes it was clean mad. There was a brave bit of fighting. You had the Dungiven boys and the Bellaghy boys, then there was Rasharkin and the Draperstown crowd. “One thing about the Slaughtneil bouncers was that they stood on the chairs right round the side of the hall and they saw everything. If anyone looked at each other at all, they were straight in.” Terry’s tenure as DJ at the famous south Derry venue spanned three decades, and with the march of time came the evolution of the music he was spinning. The rock and pop of the late s gave way as the rave of the mid-s found its way to rural County Derry. “In the s, you had the rockers, the slow sessions, so many types of music,” recalled Terry. “I remember then the rave thing started to come in instead of the standard music. Before that it was the s and general s kind of stuff. “The first real rave song was called ‘Acid’ and that was one of the first dance songs I was playing in Slaughtneil at the time.”  The hall’s growing reputation as south Derry’s romantic hotspot had an added benefit for the young DJ, as he was able to use the opportunity to create his own work. “After Slaughtneil I was flat out doing weddings for people who met there,” he said. “It was a spin-off, because when they were getting married, I was doing the disco because that’s where they’d met. “At that time, they might have been , but  years ago, people were getting married a lot younger, so it wasn’t that long that they met in Slaughtneil that they were getting married. “I started doing Walsh’s Hotel in Maghera in about  as well, and you had that Slaughtneil crowd following you then. It worked out alright for me!” Terry was privileged to accommodate a number of special guests on the stage, most notably Neighbours star Guy Pearce in , but not all visitors came by way of an invite. He said: “The Provos landed once – thankfully I wasn’t on that night! “There were a few groups fighting – I think it was the Draperstown boys fighting the Bellaghy boys – and what they did was give you a list of names that you had to read out. “They were toldthey didn’t behave themselves, the boys would be round. Maybe some chap got a bad beating or a car got badly damaged, and it had got out of hand. “That was a way of keeping them in line, but they were in and out and away again in maybe ,  minutes.” Like many who made their way up the the Halgain Road over the twenty years that the disco was running, Terry’s best memories are of the people he met. “I was there until near enough the end. I think I did nearly  years of it – a long pull, but it was enjoyable, you got to know a lot of people,” he said. “You could have been talking to somebody from Dublin that had come up to stay with friends, or Galway. I remember talking to a girl from Tipperary one night. “They might have been staying the summer with relations and that was the reason – to get to the Slaughtneil disco. “That’s my claim to fame, I was the first ever DJ at Slaughtneil disco.” Terry spun the soundtrack to much of County Derry’s adolescence. The disco may only have lasted three hours on a Friday, but its influence continues to be timeless.

Plans have been put forward to construct the new footbridge as part of a proposal to extend Derrys popular quayside walk and cycle path. Derry City and Strabane District Council has applied for planning permission to build the footbridge across an inlet close to the Fort George site. This would allow the quayside walkway to be extended into the Bay Road area. There are also plans to create a new three-metre wide cycle walking path along Bay Road to link in to the Bay Road Park. Derrys quay has been revitalised in recent years and the latest proposal looks set to continue the regeneration of the riverside area. googletag.cmd.push The plans for the new footbridge and walkway are now being considered by the local councils planning department. Meanwhile, a new cycling champion role has been created to encourage more people to get on their bikes in Derry. Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon this week announced a new walking and cycling champion with a focus on transforming communities and developing creative solutions to support a new way of living during and post COVID-. “Our champion will ensure that we deliver our commitment to increase the percentage of journeys made by walking and cycling. Inspiring our communities, restructuring our spaces, changing forever the way we live – and changing it for the better,” said the Minister. googletag.cmd.push “I want to increase the space available for people who want to walk and cycle by extending pavements, pedestrianising streetsand introducing pop up cycle lanes. I have already identied someparts ofBelfast City Centre and Derry city that can betransformed in this wayand I intend to work with councils to identy more areas across the North as a matter of urgency. Changing how we use our spaces will transform communities right across Northern Ireland – creatively change lives – enable social distancing and encourage health and mental wellbeing. “Thisenvironmental and public healthwork will be done on a collaborative basis, with an action group, formed from both within and outside government. I also want to work in collaboration with communities, including identying and creating ‘Quiet Streets’ where pedestrians, cyclists and play have priority and motor vehicles are guests,” added Ms Mallon. “As the Executive looks this week to review thelockdown – we all need to be looking ahead – out of the darkness of this pandemic and into a better world that we need to build for ourselves. Greener, cleaner, healthier and happier people and places must be our aim as we learn to live with this new normal during and after Covid-.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

At present, there are six people being treated at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry after testing positive for the disease. Geraldine McKay, the Western Trusts Director of Acute Hospitals, said that the number of COVID- patients at Altnagelvin was very reduced in comparison to what they have been. There have been  deaths from COVID- in recent months in the Western Trusts two acute hospitals at Altnagelvin and the South West hospital in Enniskillen. There have been further deaths in local care homes but a breakdown of deaths in inidual care homes has not been made public. googletag.cmd.push The Western Trust said that there had been COVID- outbreaks in  care homes in the Trust area. An outbreak is defined as two or more cases. Ms McKay said the lower than anticipated number of cases and deaths locally was due to the co-operation of the public and the magnicent work of healthcare staff. As part of the preparations for the expected rise in COVID- cases, the number of intensive care beds at Altnagelvin Hospital had been increased from  to . However, Ms McKay said the intensive care unit never had to work at full capacity over the recent period. googletag.cmd.push She said that the number of people attending Altnagelvins emergency department had decreased by almost % over recent months after people were asked to stay away from the hospital as much as possible to allow staff to cope with the COVID- situation. Ms McKay praised the public for their support for the health service and highlighted how well people locally had taken on board the message to stay at home and maintain social distancing when out in public. She said this had played a vital role in keeping the number of COVID- cases and deaths lower than had been anticipated. People have really done what we asked of them, she said. Ms McKay said the Trust was now looking at how to manage the new normal for hospital services, taking into consideration issues such as social distancing in waiting areas and the use of personal protection equipment for staff.

Robert Fullerton, who is , bought the pound ‘Treasure Bingo’ Scratchcard at his local Vivoxtra store whilst shopping for some essential grocery items on May . Little did Robert know that later the same evening he would discover he’d won an amount , times greater than the price of the scratchcard! The incredible news comes as an amazing boost for Robert and his we Susanas both had been recently furloughed from the company they work for as a result of the COVID- pandemic. googletag.cmd.push Robert works as a spray painter and Susan as a machine operator for a leading local kitchen supplier and, like many across the country, have been furloughed for the past five weeks as part of the Government’s job retention scheme. Robert explained how his le-changing win came about. “I was out doing an essential grocery shop and had a scratchcard in my pocket with a pound win on it. So while I was paying for the groceries, I exchanged it for another similar National Lottery Scratchcard, and bought an extra one for good measure. “I brought the two scratchcards home and played them that night. I didn’t win anything on the first scratchcard and gave it to Susan to check, while I was scratching the second card,” he continued. googletag.cmd.push “Half-way through, it was already showing that I’d won pound, and I started physically shaking. I was thinking to myself, ‘that’s not right’ and had to get up and go outside for some fresh air. “I showed the scratchcard to Susan and took a photo that I sent to my mum and sister – both of whom agreed that I wasn’t seeing things and that, as far as they could see, I’d won three hundred grand! “After a restless night, with little or no sleep, I called The National Lottery the following morning. They asked for some details and then, I’ll never forget, the lady on the phone said… ‘Congratulations, you have won pound,’! “My reply was ‘you what ’ My heart felt like it was going to burst out of my chest. In fact, I still can’t believe it. It’s like a dream come true, especially in these uncertain times when we’re stuck at home and don’t really know how our jobs will be affected by this coronavirus pandemic.” Despite his big win, Robert hopes to get back to work as soon as possible, saying that he loves his job and the ‘banter’ with his workmates. Robert bought the winning National Lottery Treasure Bingo Scratchcard from the Vivoxtra store on Magherafelt Road in Castledawson.

Like all of us, hersquos patiently waiting for when thingsto normal and travel is possible again.ldquoI definitely havenrsquot spent more than at couple of weeks at home since  when my father George died, explains Tim. ldquoItrsquos a real shame that I canlsquot really enjoy everything that Co Down has to offer, but at least home is a good spot. Myself and my mother enjoy going out for a walk along the Quoile river every now and then.The third of four children, Tim has an older sister, Heather, and two brothers, Michael and Pat. Their late father was a highly respected lawyer, who became a county court judge.Ash, the band Tim founded in  at the age of  with fellow Down High School students Mark Hamilton, also from Downpatrick, and Rick McMurray, from Killyleagh, exploded on to the Britpop scene in the mid-s. Known as one of the softer alternative rockpop bands, Ash put Downpatrick well and truly on the music map. Along with the success of the Papenfus brothers, Kenneth and Carl, with their band Relish, and local rockers, The Answer, it was a golden age for music for the town and district.Tim and the band have been recording and touring ever since, having recently embarked on a European tour to support their new specially compiled album, Best of Teenage Wildle ndash  years of Ash. Coming in a combination of vinyl, a special  CD with an  rare track CD, Teenage Wildle has charted well so far, coming top in both the UK and Irish Independent Albums chart and th in the UK Album chart.When President Donald Trump closed the US airports in March, it could not have come at a worst time for the band in promotional terms.Tim explained: ldquoWe were in the middle of European tour in February and everything was just gradually grinding to a standstill. At that time, I did thinkI didnrsquot leave for New York soon there was a chance that I wouldnrsquot get back for two to three months.ldquoBut our UK dates were the following week and they still hadnlsquot been cancelled. I felt that I didnrsquot have a choice so we stayed and we spent three days driving to Hamburg to a gig which got cancelled on the day. We travelled back to the UK and then the tour dates got cancelled the day before the first show was meant to have been held. It was too late for me at that point to get back to the US so I came back to Northern Ireland and stayed at my sisterrsquos place for a week before I went to Downpatrick.While he is enjoying his downtime in Downpatrick, rehoning lyrics to songs he first started several years ago, Tim is naturally concerned about when andhe will get back to New York.ldquoIrsquom technically a temporary resident so Irsquom worried about getting back to the US as Irsquom not a citizen or permanent resident. I was planning to move to London in July as we have a recording studio there with a lease ending soon and we need to move equipment out over the next few months. Thatrsquos all a big question mark now. Irsquove been in New York for  years and would like a chance to say goodbye to everyone.Although the change of pace is dferent at home compared to New York, both are close to Timrsquos heart.ldquoThe number one thing about New York that I love are the people. Itrsquos such an amazing mixof cultures. It has so much energy to the place. The pace is really fast, itrsquos endlessly interesting, he said.ldquoBut Irsquove always been comfortable about coming back to Northern Ireland. We are surrounded by woodland and the Quoile river. When the sun shines, therersquos nowhere better in the world. I like going between the two extremes, itrsquos a really good place to be writing, reading and walking around.Tim recently connected with the world of music globally when he broadcast a live performance from his Downpatrick home to raise money for struggling musicians and artists impacted by the coronavirus lockdown. Organised by the Performing Rights Society , which pays royalties to members when their work is performed in whatever , Tim was one of  big names who took part.He started off with a rendition of his hit, Girl From Mars, performed with an acoustic guitar, and played Shining Light, which he won an Ivor Novello award in  for Best Contemporary Pop Song, finishing off with Teenage Kicks by Derry band The Undertones.ldquoThat felt really good and I felt really connected it was good seeing all the comments coming up, said Tim. ldquoBut to be honest, it was nerve-wrecking doing a broadcast from home as the internet is not too good here. Normally on stage you would have fears of your equipment failing but I was just thinking I hope that this internet does not cut out. If the phone rings the home, the internet cuts out. I was praying that no one would ring my mum in the middle of it.ldquoIt just dawned on me while I was singing Shining Light that I had written it in the same room where I was broadcasting from. Irsquove written a lot of good songs in that room.He joked at how long it normally takes him to release new music and how he is still working on songs he wrote several years ago.ldquoThe guys and I have been chatting a lot still and Irsquove been sending them song ideas and discussing things but I really wish we could get into a rehearsal room and jam through the stuff. Maybe we will get to do that in a few weeksrsquo time.ldquoItrsquos going to be interesting to see what new music comes out from artists after the lockdown but Irsquom always on a bit of a lag with new stuff as by the time Irsquove written a new song and wersquore recorded it, itrsquos three years later. The good thing about this time is that itrsquos given me an opportunity to finish a lot of lyrics where I just didnrsquot have time before. Irsquom wrapping up a lot of songs that I started in , so expect our coronavirus album in .Hersquos disappointed, as are local fans, that the bandrsquos planned Belfast gig has had to be postponed until at least the autumn.Best of Teenage Wildle is available now for streaming on ious s and to purchase from Ashrsquos official website store https:store.ash-official .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Ballycran.jpg","title":"Ballycran members sewing scrubs for frontline workers  ","story":"SCRUBS made by a group of women from St Josephrsquos GAA Club in Ballycran are now being worn in the Belfast Nightingale Hospital and several local nursing homes and medical centres.The colourful easy wash garments are brightening up NHS nurses and care workers as they look after patients and residents during the coronavirus lockdown.Some lucky frontline staff are wearing Manchester United scrubs or Paws Patrol made from themed duvets.Mrs Marguerite Fowler, sister of club chairperson Shane Gilmore, is co-ordinating the cross-community effort.The core group of sewers are Pamela McGourty, Brenda Coyle, Madeline Bell, Ann Moan, Anne OrsquoBrien, Madeline Branf, Caitlin Savage, Fiona Gilmore and Geraldine McGrattan. However, more sewers are coming on to help out as word spreads about the initiative.The club put out a call for people to help with the sewing and donations of material and were overwhelmed with the response.Mrs Fowler explained that the group came about after she was approached privately by some peopleshe knew anyone who could provide scrubs.ldquoWe started at the beginning of the month and so far we have made scrubs for four nursing homes, including Barrhall Residential Home in Portaferry, and supplied scrubs to Loughview Medical Centre in Kircubbin and Ballywalter Health Centre.ldquoWe have also supplied scrubs to nurses at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast and the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald as well to nurses in the Nightingale Hospital in Belfast City Tower Block through my sister-in-lawrsquos niece who is a nurse. We are now filling orders from Positive Futures, a group who visit people with learning disabilities who vulnerable, in their own homes and had absolutely no protective gear. They find scrubs are so much easier to wash and dry than their own clothes.She said that while the GAA club put the initial call out for help and donations of material, it was very much a community effort.GAA clubs in Portaferry and Ballygalget have also donated duvets sheets and other items, already washed and ready to sew.ldquoWe are also very excited about a delivery of brand new fabric, funded by a grant negotiated by Iain Bell from Kircubbin and District Community Association and we thank him for his generous help.Scrubs provided are free of charge, but the group do like to see photographs of staff wearing them afterwards.Mrs Fowler said the group are able to take requests for specic sizes which might otherwise be dficult to get and they can be contacted via the Ballycran Facebook page..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Community.jpg","title":"Community allotment group looking for new volunteers  ","story":"TUCKED away in a corner of the New Model Farm housing estate in Downpatrick is an oasis of calm amidst the turmoil of the coronavirus pandemic.Downpatrick Community Allotments has gone from strength to strength since its launch a number of years ago and there is also a healthy and particularly thriving apiary.With so many people confined to home as part of the the governmentrsquos lockdown directive, the group behind the allotments is keen to recruit new volunteers to help with their upkeep.Those responsible for the allotments are hoping that people will come forward to get involved in and enjoy the many benefits of working on the plots, especially at a time when the focus is very much on looking after your mental health.That the allotments can continue to operate is due to the fact the strict regulations in relation to social distancing are rigorously enforced, with the focus not just on the health of the plants and vegetables being grown, but also of all those tilling the land.Indeed, the community allotments initiative is a success story which continues to blossom and has transformed what was once an area of wasteland into a thriving hub which is also making a positive contribution to the environment and the lives of those who use it.Developed by the Downpatrick Community Collective mdash an umbrella group for a number of community groups across the town mdash the allotments have become a blooming success in more ways than one thanks to the horticulture skills of the volunteers who have learnt new skills and gained confidence as a result.A vibrant and growing community initiative has firmly embedded itself in this part of Downpatrick and continues to flourish, thanks to the hard work and dedication of the volunteers. Only last month, all the hanging baskets produced at the New Model Farm site sold out.Locate at the site are two poly tunnels, flower beds and vegetable patches cocooned into a corner of the housing estate, with the apiary also a big hit with beekeepers who have honed their skills with the help of the Killinchy Beekeepers.Allotment holders and groups using the site regularly produce an array of fresh vegetables, flowers and bedding plants, while the beekeepers are producing their own delicious honey which is in its natural state with no additives.Sean Clarke, who is the chairman of Downpatrick Community Allotments, says there is nothing like working in the great outdoors, filling your lungs with fresh air and clearing your mind.ldquoAll our plots are currently taken but we are looking for new volunteers, he explained.ldquoWhen one of our plots does become available, it is snapped up immediately. Some of the townrsquos residentsrsquo groups have taken plots and we are delighted to have a mix of all abilities working at the site.ldquoThere is great camaraderie and we have our very own gardening guru mdash Stephen Harris.ldquoHe is brilliant to have around the place and has an encyclopaedic knowledge of gardening which is being passed on to the volunteers. Stephen once had his own landscaping business and is more than happy to share is extensive knowledge with us.Downpatrick Community Allotments now has its own Facebook page packed with photos and information about what is happening at the New Model Farm site with the social media page helping generate wide interest in what is going on there.ldquoMany people have come along to learn gardening skills including seed planting, propagation and how to fill hanging baskets and it is clear to see their enthusiasm. It is great to be outdoors and enjoying the benefits of physical exercise and fresh air, Sean continued, revealing that within three days of all the hanging baskets produced going on sale they sold out.Given the focus on greater public health awareness as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, all the equipment at the allotments is sanitised before and after use and social distancing regulations are enforced across the site, both at the allotments, in the poly tunnels and apiary.ldquoEveryone is always two metres apart and due to the size of the allotments, three people can work comfortably at the same time, while adhering to the social distancing guidelines.Sean is a great believer in how working at the Model Farm site is good for mental health and said there are many studies which back up his assertion.ldquoPeople really get a lot out of seeing the flowers and vegetables they plant growing and there is always a great buzz about the place. The allotments can certainly help people destress, especially in the current climate.It was planned to bring along a chef to the allotments so the volunteers can learn ious ways they can cook their fresh vegetables and while this has had to be put on hold, it is something Sean is keen to see happening when the pandemic is brought under control and the current lockdown regulations are relaxed.He added: ldquoWe are hoping that we may be able get a chef in around September, but that will depend on the current restrictions being eased.For further information on Downpatrick Community Allotments pay a visit to the grouprsquos Facebook page..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Council.jpg","title":"Council has no plans to lay off current staff  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has this week insisted that it has no current plans to lay off staff.The confirmation comes after Antrim and Newtownabbey Council confirmed last week that it was planning to make a number of employees redundant, with  jobs affected.However, officials subsequently deferred a decision on  positions, but  agency staff are to be let go due to funding pressures during the coronavirus pandemic.Defending its decision to cut jobs, the council said it had faced an ldquounprecedented financial challenge due to signicantly reduced revenues following the closure of public facilities.It also confirmed there has been ldquono confirmation of any additional funding being provided to councils from government and the UK-wide furlough scheme is not expected to be used by local authorities.While the planned job losses are subject to negotiations with trade unions, Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey made it clear that she will not support actions of councilsthey do not respect and protect workersrsquo rights.The minister said that each of Northern Irelandrsquos  councils mdash including Newry, Mourne and Down.ldquoI call on councils and other employers to do all in their power to safeguard jobs so that when the current restrictions are lted, those very workers can contribute to the economic recovery that we will so badly need, she remarked.The Northern Ireland Local Government Associationmdash the umbrella body for the provincersquos  councils mdash said councils were facing ldquoshort and long-term financial pressures like never before.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that no decision has been taken in relation to reducing staff number ldquoat this time.Former NILGA president and Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos announcement.ldquoThese are unprecedented times and the local authority has lost a signicant amount of income given the closure of leisure and community facilities across the district, he said.ldquoVarious staff have been redeployed across the organisation and at these terribly dficult times, they are working to maintain services with others playing key roles in helping to deliver food packages to residents across the district.Cllr Curran said he would not want to see anyone losing their job and hopes the local council will continue to work hard to make sure this does happen anywhere within the organisation.ldquoNo one could have predicted the situation we now find ourselves in, he continued. ldquoItrsquos important that the public plays its part, stays at homeit all possible and when out, exercise social distancing to help protect the HNS and save lives.ldquoMany people have lost their jobs through no fault of their own and I hope that in the not too distant future, lockdown measures will start to be eased to help rebuild the local economy and people can get back to work.He added: ldquoThis will not happen overnight, but the more we obey public health advice now, the sooner the lockdown can be eased..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Evan.jpg","title":"Evan and mum raising dough for charity during virus lockdown  ","story":"A NEWCASTLE woman and her little son have been busy baking tasty treats on social media to help raise money for a local mental health charity since the lockdown began.When Pauline Smyth was forced to close the doors of the Blue Bay Cafe in Dundrum due to the outbreak of the Coronavirus, she and two year-old Evan took to baking some of their favourite recipes.For almost four weeks, the pair have stirred, sted and simmered their way through a mountain of ingredients, making everything from pizza pin wheels to Portuguese custard tarts and posting snap shots of their combined efforts on the Blue Bay Cafe  Bakery Facebook page, along with the recipes.Pauline says Evan loves to help out, especially when it comes to making doughnuts.

the town.Superintendent Brendan McGuigan has appealed to local people not to react to rumour or innuendo and to ensure common-sense prevails at all times.The police chiefrsquos comments come after a second week of serious assaults which left one local man requiring hospital treatment for sustained severe head injuries, inflicted during a vicious attack at the Bishopsbrae area.Mr McGuigan has also highlighted an incident when a family were forced to flee their Leaside Gardens home in the Flying Horse estate after a malicious blaze.In addition, two other young men were bundled into a car and taken to the Steamboat Quay area at the Quoile River where they were assaulted.Two weeks ago, an ongoing feud between two Downpatrick families was blamed for a shooting incident at the Vianstown Park area in the town and an assault on a woman in Church Street.Mr McGuigan says he is concerned at the number of recent events, which include a local family having to be rehoused in emergency accommodation, and claims they paint a very wrong picture of the county town.The police chief said the sequence of recent events does nothing to enhance Downpatrickrsquos reputation and said people who live in a civilised community must accept the rule oflaw.DUNDRUM ndash A Dundrum man confronted a skinhead burglar in his home during the early hours of Monday morning and forced him to flee the Church Avenue house.The owner was asleep at am when he was disturbed by the intruder whom he chased out of his home.But the burglar, who is described as five foot  inches tall and believed to have been wearing a grey sweatshirt and jeans at the time, made off with the keys of the manrsquos Peugeot car which he stole.The car has still not been traced and detectives investigating the incident

by writing to Syril Francey, CCNC secretariat at Hill Street in Belfast.The CCNC is an advisory body which advises the Department on matters affecting the natural beauty of Northern Ireland.Mrs

natural interest.BALLYHORNAN ndash A recent lucky escape for two stranded jet skiers off Ballyhornan coast has once again drawn attention to the need for safety precautions on local beaches.The pair, who spent more than half an hour in the water without wet suits or lejackets, were only saved by a quick thinking passer-by who raised the alarm and contacted the Coastguard.With incidents like this

Proceeds of this yearrsquos event will be donated to the Northern Ireland Hospice and Marie Curie Cancer Care.Jenny Adams, the showrsquos joint secretary, says the commemorative booklet is a good account of how the show has evolved over the years.ldquoIt is certainly interesting to see the role it originally played in improving the standard of farming in the Killyleagh, Killinchy, Kilmood and Tullynahill areas..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Collins.jpg","title":"Goalkeeper Collins selects his all time greatest Down team  ","story":"THE early s saw ato the glory days for Down.

He managed the county U- team for three years, was goalkeeping coach of the senior team for six years and also a selector for three years when the team was managed by his All-Ireland-winning colleague, the late and much missed Eamonn Burns.Neil hasnrsquot included himself in his  greatest Down players, but for the others donrsquot look much further than his team-mates from the early Nineties.ldquoThese were the players I grew up with, so I have to stick with them. Irsquom too young to remember the Sixties, he says.ldquoI had a great time with Down. Obviously the highlights were winning the two All-Irelandrsquos, but I have wonderful memories of the people I played with and all the friendships.ldquoThanks to WhatsApp I am in contact with them every day. We had the th reunion of the  team in Dublin last year and we also got together to remember the th anniversary of the Loughinisland tragedy.ldquoThey are a great bunch of lads, but you canrsquot put a foot wrong, otherwise you would be pulled up very quickly. Pat DonnanPat was goalkeeper for the Down minors which won the All-Ireland title in  and was goalkeeper for the senior team for many years. He was a great keeper and became a mentor to me. He took me under his wing and made me a better player. He was also generous with time and advice. A great goalkeeper and an even greater man. Miceal MagillThis is the most dficult pick. It was between Miceal and Brendan McKernan, but I have gone for Miceal, largely because of his performance in the  final which won him the Ulster Bank Man of the Match award. He had a fantastic game and never let Charlie Redmond get away from him. He was always comfortable with the ball and could read a game well. Conor DeeganConor was a tremendous athlete and he could take on the oppositionrsquos biggest players. He always seemed to get on top of his opponents and I never once saw him roasted. He had terric hands and he could read a game as well as anyone. He always encouraged those around him. He was a true team player. Paul HigginsPaul was as hard as nails and he was also the quickest player in the squad, even faster than Mickey Linden. He dominated and bullied his opponents and he had great strength of character. John KellyMy Carryduff clubmate and a ruthless, nasty player in the best possible way. He was the sort of player nobody wanted to mark, whether in a match or in training. He would put his head where others feared to put their feet. Barry BreenAnother double All-Ireland winner. I first played with him at the Red High. Barry always seemed to have time on the ball. He played at a dferent level to everyone . What set him apart though was that he could play with his head up and see what was going on. He was always looking for someone off the ball. DJ KaneOur captain in  and an inspirational leader. DJ was one of the most competitive players I have seen in my le. He would not lie down and did not know what it meant to be beaten. It was win at all costs and he was someone you needed when things got bad. Gregory McCartanA massive character both on and off the pitch. Gregory kept the craic going in the changing room and in the bar afterwards. But he was also a tremendous footballer. He could take a free with either foot. He put money on himself to get the first score in the  final, which he did. Eamonn BurnsAn absolute gentleman, but a warrior on the pitch. He was quiet and unassuming, but had everything you wanted in a player. He scored two sublime points in the , which we won by two points, so he played a huge part in getting us over the line. His death came as a great shock. He is a much missed colleague. Ross CarrA Rolls Royce footballer. He had a wonderful left foot and was one of our two main free takers. Ross had a massive amount of inward drive and challenged us all to perform to the same high standards which he set for himself. Greg Blaney . Quite simply the best player I ever played with. He had it all. He was a brilliant ball player who made the forward line tick. He was always looking to play in James McCartan or Mickey Linden and wasnrsquot worried about scoring himself. An absolute team player. Gary MasonA superb free taker, particularly when under pressure. He never failed us. In June  he played for Down against Monaghan. It was the day after the Loughinisland tragedy. He must have been under enormous mental pressure and anguish, but he put on a massive exhibition and was man of the match. Mickey LindenWhat can you say about Mickey  He was an absolute flying machine and totally dedicated to Down football. He was still playing county football at the age of . A player of exceptional ability and one of the nicest men you could meet off the pitch. Peter WithnellA big, strong one-man wrecking ball. He would hit opponents very hard and early on. Peter brought something dferent to the team and his game fitted in well with the players Down manager Peter McGrath put around him. Many of their scores came about because of him. James McCartanConfident and aggressive with the ability to find space where he had no right to. Every time James got the ball, there was a buzz in the crowd. He was man of the match in the  All-Ireland final. He went on to manage Down and took them to the  final.Substitutes: Brendan McKernan , Aidan Farrell , Liam Austin , Ambrose Rogers Sr , Ciaran McCabe ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Heather.jpg","title":"Heather coaching the kids  ","story":"A COMBER soccer coach is keeping local children on the ball mdash despite the coronavirus shutdown.Heather Kerr normally coaches primary school children, but now she is passing on her skills online and on social media.Heather, a player and coach with Comber Ladies and an Irish FA staff member, admits it can be a challenge keeping children active and entertained in the current lockdown, but she believes she has the answers.Heather is also a key member of the IFArsquos Electric Ireland Shooting Stars programme aimed at young girls and she says keeping it fun is the key to keeping kids engaged with their extra-curricular activities.ldquoItrsquos all about making sure that they are having fun while learning something new, she says.ldquoEven though your little ones arenrsquot getting out on the pitch they can still be trying out new skills at home.Heather has been involved in football since an early age and was inspired by her dad, who was a coach.ldquoI started volunteering with the youth section of my local club, Comber Rec when I was , and Irsquove been involved in some sort of coaching ever since, she explained.ldquoI completed a weekrsquos work experience with the Irish FA around this time too and I really got a taste of all the dferent aspects of what is involved in football development.ldquoOver the years I worked through my coaching badges and recently completed my A Licence.ldquoI have been coaching in primary schools for the Irish FA since . I usually deliver approximately  school sessions per week to roughly  pupils in Newry, Mourne and Down.ldquoI play and coach for Comber Rec Ladies. I am proud to have played a key part in bringing womenrsquos football to my home town team and for helping to create opportunities for almost  seniors and  juniors to enjoy the game.Heather says parents can help teach their children with the help of weekly videos which are being released by the IFA and Electric Ireland.ldquoThese videos are fantastic tools for keeping your budding football stars interested in sport and passionate about football, as well as encouraging them to stay active while their usual activity sessions are on hold, she said.The Shooting Stars programme provides opportunities for girls aged - to have fun, make friends and learn the fundamentals of football. Sessions are normally held at  centres across Northern Ireland.Heather says the programme is a starting point for young girls who are encouraged to take the next step and join a local club.ldquoObviously with the current situation the sessions have not been taking place but the coaches have been working hard to ensure that the girls are staying connected, keeping up their skills at home by putting out a iety of social media videos with challenges and tips.The weekly videos can be viewed on IFA social media channels on Tuesday and Fridays..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Lockdown.jpg","title":"Lockdown no hindrance to local runners of all abilities  ","story":"A LOT is being said and reported about the absence of sporting activities on foot of the cancellation or postponement of many major events, including Sundayrsquos River Rock Belfast City Marathon, because of the need for social distancing to combat the spread of the Coronavirus.The postponement of the Tokyo Olympics will impact seriously on all the athletes who had been training for the races of their lives this summer, some as the culmination of their careers.But it is not only the elite runners, throwers and jumpers who have had their plans and lives disrupted by the world wide pandemic.It affects everybody who takes exercise in any shape or form, including the runners of all abilities who may not be a member of any athletics club but have been running for years and for whom running has become a way of le.I know that runners often go out on their own to train and in fact many have been resourceful over the past week in finding places which are virtually people free to enable them to complete their training sessions in safe surroundings. I havenrsquot been running for a few years now but I was persuaded to get up off my rear end and try to mark the th anniversary of the postponed London marathon due to be held on the very appropriate th April by running or walking or generally moving over a distance of  or . miles or kilometres.And having sorted out a route around my garden, estimated to be  metres long, I worked out that  laps per mile would be achievable over the five days specied mdash i.e. I could walk  laps to count as . miles. And I also asked my friends for some sponsorship towards the Cure Parkinsonrsquos Trust . I am hugely indebted to everyone who contributed towards this charity, and raised pound. plus pound. Gt Aid. Which reminds me I must go and finish the last eight laps.At the top end of the sport, international marathon runner and Rio Olympian Paul Pollock, while naturally disappointed that the Olympics have been postponed until , feels that it could well prove to be a blessing in disguise in his case at least.He reasons that it will give him an opportunity to concentrate on clocking up stress-free miles in training, enabling him to recover from old injuries and come to the competition, for the first time ever, in the best shape of his le.Portaferry star Ciara Mageean, Irelandrsquos greatest hope of an Olympic track medal since the halcyon days of Sonia OrsquoSullivan, is also disappointed, having been, as she says, in the form of her le, but, like Paul, will continue with her planned training regime and sees it as an opportunity to build up her strength and thus make up the ground on her nearest rivals.Eoghanrsquos viewNewcastlersquos Eoghan Totten, who aspires to taking part in a future Olympic Games as a marathon runner, in a recent interview published in the Athletics NI webpages said: ldquoWhen I recorded a : personal best over the half marathon in Barcelona in mid-February, the virus was relatively undocumented in Europe.ldquoBy mid-March, I understood that I would not be racing for a long time. My biggestfear was that there would be a blanket ban on exercise. Nonetheless, the sanctions under which we are all living have forced me to reconsider the spirit in which I run. I decided that I would follow lockdown protocol as strictly as possible to do my part.Double runshave always been a staple part of my training, allowing me to hit the high mileage required to prepare for the marathon. Completing the same mileage across the week off one daily training session was initially challenging. However, I eventually adapted after two weeks of attrition. In the process, I learned that I benefit from the extra recovery time between runs. This pleasant surprise helped me come to terms with what seems like a more or less empty race calendar in .I can understand that many of you will be disappointed not to be running the Belfast Marathon this weekend, but your chance to do so will come around again in the future. Anyone who is brave enough to step on the start line of a marathon is a special type of person, irrespective of fitness. More so those who run to raise money for a cause. It takes courage to do this. Bank that courage and build on it over the coming months.Athletes are creatures of habit. We are conditioned to race on a monthly or two-monthly basis. Having the options restricted has enabled me to focus on the process of training without looking too far ahead. It has reminded me that, despite thriving off pushing to my limits in races, I love the journey, equally as much.ldquoYes, it is all about achieving in races, but also, to get there a long time is spent training . So we have to love the training too.Right now, I have to wait. We all have to wait. Runners are resilient. Focus on whatever training you can do right now and enjoy the journey.ldquoTo those friends and family in the health service, who have been tackling the virus over the past six weeks, I am amazed beyond words. Thank you for what you are doing.Club updateThese words echo the sentiment of all of us and we commend all key workers who have been put in the front line in the course of their work. We have many EDAC members who are in that position and we send them our best wishes.So what of the last six weeks  The clubrooms were closed with immediate effect and the committee advised all members of the governmental advice to stay home and stay safe. The only good news was that there was no ban on exercising so long as training was done solo or in household groups.It may seem crass to be concerned about the ability to train when there are much bigger issues at stake, but it is well known that sticking to some routine is beneficial in keeping mental health in good order and anything which allows us to be positive will help us to cope with the situation that has evolved.Most have been taking daily exercise as prescribed by the government as it is already a part of our daily routine. However, because of the restrictions on movements and associations and the change of routine for many, whether through being laid off work, working from home, working for NHS at the coal face so to speak, or any of above combined with the added dficulties of home schooling kids of whatever age, it means that many runners are no longer free to go for a run whenever they chose or indeed will have to make signicant changes to their daily routine to fit it in.Some have turned their daily run into a practical outing where they canessential items to those who are shielding. Others have managed to combine their exercise with fund raising for charities involved in the frontline or for organisations who will see their funding hit by the economic fallout of the pandemic.Our juniors could be forgiven for thinking this is an unexpected long summer break, but they report back from time to time to log that fact that they are knuckling down to home schooling while using exercise to take a break.Jarlath and Anna Kearney have committed to a daily .k run, Mackenzie and Ky Murray have been out with their dad, Dee, making sure he doesnrsquot slack. Mackenzie even recorded an unofficial K PB this week.Ollie and Alex Robinson have the good fortune to be able to train as a family and they push each other as well as mum Marguerite. It is no surprise that dedicated athlete Lauren Madine is training away in between exercising the horses. Others such as Emily Burns have opted to cross train.If baking was an Olympic event, there would be a few EDAC records set there too by the sound of things. Tik Tok also seems to be a favourite occupation with some slick dance routines doing the rounds. The one thing that is clear is that our juniors miss their club mates but that physical exercise in any form is a big help. We are proud of our juniors for this mature approach and urge them to continue their efforts.Virtual challengesSome of the races that have been cancelled have then gone ahead in a virtual form, the Titanic K being one. Runners were invited to run a solo K on any course near their home and record the time.Three EDAC runners claimed the reward mdash a T-shirt and medal in the post. Gareth Reilly was the quickest of the trio, posting a -minute time. Hallie Jennings stole a march on Donal Smith by a couple of minutes mdash  minutes to his  mdash but with all runners doing dferent courses it was mainly for fun.Also for fun and the motivation to keep going was the Galbally Runners April Challenge. A simple concept where each runner chose a target of ,, or  miles etc and then had a month to complete. Evidence was submitted by Strava or fitness watch records.Kelly Smith and Donal Smith blew their goals out of the water with totals over  miles each. Marguerite Robinson, Hallie Jennings and Suzy Smith broke  miles in their inidual sessions and Alison Carroll completed a conservative  miles to start a new regime. They all agreed that it was a good way to keep base fitness. Buffs are apparently in the post and thanks are due to Galbally Runners for sorting this.Some runners were racking up the miles and others were thinking of improving speed. Jimmy Sloan has been following a programme which is hard without club members to egg him on, but he has been very successful nonetheless with a new K PB of .. All times are, of course, unofficial as they are not on measured courses but they are a good indicator of form.Jimmy was taking part in the NHS Run , Donate , Nominate . Many of our members will have taken part and the fun can be in nominating friends who would hate to run five km, let alone five miles mdash they canrsquot really refuse when it is for such a good cause!Every club has its mile munchers and in normal times Phillip Vint would see a weekend without a marathon as a waste of a free day. Like others, he has had to get used to a new normal, but when the weekend of the postponed London Marathon came round, he couldnrsquot resist setting off on a . mile course close to home to mark the day.No crowds to cheer him on and no sights of London to entertain him en route, but he was glad that he had the health to complete it. Predictably with the Belfast Marathon also called off, he repeated his endeavours seven days later and clocked another marathon with ease.The best bit is that the finish line is his own back door so no painful walk back to get the car or the train. He was straight to the sofa in seconds and recovery could begin.Donal Smith was to have completed his inaugural marathon at Belfast , as was his daughter, Kelly. Again their hard training seemed lost without a cause, but they had followed the programme to the letter and felt that they needed to test the waters.They set off to give it a rattle and coped well with the dry run of the full marathon distance. They were delighted to get the odd toot and cheer as a substitute for race day atmosphere and they received hearty congratulations when they posted their achievement on social media.While it would have been nice to have friends and family there to greet them at the finish line, it just means that they will have the incentive to do it all again when an official Belfast Marathon can eventually take place. At least they know that they can cope with the mileage and surely with the crowd support it can only be easier Last, but not least, EDAC ultra man himself Keith Reilly has been thinking up ways to raise money and satisfy his need for a challenge at the same time. He decided that his lockdown event would be a treadmill ultra and that he would appeal for funds for NHS Charities Together.He managed . miles running in hourly shts which is no mean feat on a treadmill and logged his th ultra marathon. He was delighted to announce a total of pound, for the frontline workers dealing with Covid- patients. A good dayrsquos work all round.So there you have it from both ends of the scale mdash what the top runners think and do and what the rest of us do. Not a lot of dference really is there  Letrsquos all continue to play by the rules and hope for better times. Stay safe and see you all when the lockdown is lted..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Loughinisland.jpg","title":"Loughinisland woman ‘was friend to all’  ","story":"THE artist son of a Loughinisland woman who has died has said his mother was his ldquobiggest fan.Sixty-four year-old Mrs Kate Sloan was buried in St Macartanrsquos New Cemetery in Loughinisland on Saturday.

on the latest phase of a mains gas pipe-laying scheme.The Recorder revealed last week that Phoenix Natural Gas has seized the opportunity to make the most of the coronavirus lockdown by bringing forward work on the scheme in the resort as part of its poundm investment programme across East Down.Work started last week at the Dundrum Road and Railway Street junctions with Main Street, with contractors switching attention to a stretch of road between the Railway Street junction and Castle Bridge, adjacent to Newcastle library, from this week.Next Monday, it is planned to lay a section of mains pipe between Castle Bridge and the Bryansford Road junction, while seven days later, contractors will be laying pipework along the Bryansford Road, between the Central Promenade and Shimna road junctions.This particular part of the scheme concludes with a pipe being laid between the Bryansford Road and Bryansford Avenue junctions at Shimna Road.Work in the town centre was scheduled to start towards the end of the year, but Phoenix officials have been working with the Department for Infrastructure to identy areas where pipe-laying could be brought forward in order to avoid further disruption to traders, visitors and residents.Phoenix says it understands that Covid- has had a signicant impact socially and economically across the region and hopes that by expediting its works in Newcastle, it can utilise the lockdown period to not only avoid further disruption later in the year, but enable more people to have access to fuel choice before the winter period.The works will involve one lane closure mdash rather than a full road closure mdash with traffic management plans also in place and Phoenix aiming to utilise underground drilling equipment where possible.In addition, the company insists that its work will not impact on Newcastlersquos granite paving which was part of the resortrsquos multi-million pound public realm scheme completed a number of years

she says there are days when she does not want to run and she also misses her family and friends back at home.ldquoWersquore all struggling mdash therersquos days I donrsquot even want to go out and run now, and that the thing I have to do and the thingI always look forward to, she said.ldquoTherersquos days Irsquove cried and been like, lsquoWhat the hell is this rsquo Irsquove chatted to my team-mates about that and you justhave to find little methods ad mechanisms to try and help yourself.Last Thursday, Ciara was one of a number of leading sportsmen and women at the virtual launch of Sport NIrsquos Wellbeing Hub in response to the COVID- challengeThe hub provides instant access to helpful information, guidance and screening that is tailored specically to help care for wellbeing needs.It offers a range of innovative tools and resources, including guided self-assessment via lsquoChatbotrsquo, self-help programmes and digital intervention tools, a searchable five ways to wellbeingrsquo map and a wellbeing information library.Ciara said: ldquoOur mental health is so vital and right now is a challenging time for all of us.A full-time athlete and a member of Team New Balance, Ciara lives in Manchester in the same house with fellow athletes Jip Vastenburg and Adam Craig. Right now shersquos spending a lot more time inside the house than outside.ldquoThankfully my training hasnrsquot changed hugely, but wersquore in the house an awful lot more. The whole season has disappeared, which is very strange because wersquore training without any real focus.ldquoWersquore all watching the news and seeing whatrsquos happening the world over, and wersquore all far away from our families.ldquoLast week Jip lost her grandmother and she couldnrsquot get home for the funeral mdash she had to watch it over Skype.Ciara is worried about members of her own family. Her elder sister, Myra, is a registrar at a hospital in Belfast, her younger sister, Nuala, is a nursing student, younger brother Brendan has volunteered to work in the Nightingale hospital in London and her mother, Catherine, also works in the NHS, while an aunt is a pharmacist. She also misses her boyfriend, who she hasnrsquot seen in a month.Ciara, who won the m bronze medal at the  European Championships and bronze again at the European Indoor Championships last year, happens to be in the form of her le.She improved on her own Irish indoor m record in January and smashed her personal indoor best at m a month later.Training and events were geared towards the Tokyo Games this summer but the Olympics have been pushed back to  because of the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoIrsquom feeling in fantastic shape so itrsquos a little frustrating - we had the whole season planned out, she said.ldquoEven down to the training camps you were going to go on, down to the very day that I was going tointo the Olympic village and then the day that I would possibly leave the Olympic village.ldquoIt is quite tough because all of those plans are all scuppered, itrsquos all up in the air and we donrsquot know when wersquore going to be able to start racing.ldquoThe circuit doesnrsquot have a clue when theyrsquore going to be able to race - it depends on when countries allow more movement and, ultimately, does anybody know ldquoIrsquom not going to feel too sorry for myself because I know therersquos an awful lot of people out there that are in a much harder place than me.In a recent interview with RTE Ciara revealed something about how she is coping with the coronavirus restrictionsQ Whatrsquos the first thing you do in the morning A At the minute when I wake up Irsquove been giving my boyfriend a wee call to say good morning. Irsquom not quite sure when Irsquoll get to see him next as Irsquom in Manchester and he is in Dublin so itrsquos a nice way to start my day and always puts a smile on my face.Q Whatrsquos your favourite exercise A Oh I feel like I should say running, as I am an athlete, butI was to think of my favourite it would probably be a few things. I do miss playing a team sport so probably camogie, I absolutely loved dodge ball in school sothat was an option Irsquod pick that, and I do enjoy my gym workouts getting to lt weights.Q Is there one particular skill you practice every day A Running, every day! Running is a gross motor sport so fine skills arenrsquot really a part of my daily training, but I do work on dferent areas of my fitness every day. I have to work on things such as flexibility and fine muscle control every day to keep myself injury free. In the athlete house though we have been honing dferent skills while on lockdown, trying out dferent Tik Tok dances, press ups, and trying to get our eye in with the sling shot in the back garden!Q Netflix and chill or a nice evening jog A Both, usually we have an evening run, easy four miles... then we chill and watch a movie after dinner. We have had to mix training up a bit with the changes but in an ideal world we get both in.Q Name one book you want to read.A Irsquom making my way through a few Malcolm Gladwell books. I love coming away with new information and enjoy a book that challenges my thought process. Then when I need to flake out Irsquod pick something like A Man Called Ove. Soanyone could recommend books like this to me theyrsquod be on my ldquowant to read list.Q On a scale of  to , how good are your DIY skills A Ohhhh, Irsquom going to give myself an . -  here. My daddy is a joiner so I spent my le watching him make and fix things, and soon learned the names of tools and how to use them. I do know my limits though so I stay away from the plumbing... luckily in Portaferry my dad has a lot of friends who are alsotradesmen so they all help each other out.Q Have you a favourite pre-training meal to help you through a tough session A We usually train in the morning so I tend to eat an OTE DuoBar, the vanilla flavour in my favourite, and a cup of tea. When it come to racing in the evening, something easy to digest is usually what I go for... rice is always a winner.Q Name one movie you want to watch.A , I was planning on watching it in the cinema before the lockdown.Q Whatrsquos the best way to stave off boredom A Oh as a full-time athlete I feel Irsquove been preparing for lockdown for years. My le is basically train, eat, sleep. For me therersquos a few things I enjoy. I love chatting with my family, Irsquom usually on WhatsApp most of the day chatting or messaging and keeping in touch. I also love arts and crafts, Irsquoll be making postcards to post to my boyfriend and siblings to make them laugh, and currently my little cousin is teaching me the guitar via WhatsApp. She is a tough taskmaster, I have a lesson every Thursday and Monday and homework in between so that keeps me busy Q Have you any tips for training at home A Set yourself some goals that you can realistically achieve from home. We are allowed out for our daily exercise so you can get some cardio in outside, find a route that works for you and follow the guidelines. When it comes to working out inside, have fun. Find new alternatives, there are so many exercises we can do with body weight, or with stuff we have about the house so be creative and have a bit of craic. If you need any ideas check out social media, so many people are sharing home workouts. Give yourself a plan or schedule and try to stick to it. Being home means we can fall into the habit of sitting about and it can be hard to feel motivated. At the beginning of each week set out your plan for the week, what day, what time, and what exercise. Write it down and stick it somewhere you can see. Creating a routineduring these strange times means we can take back a little control.Q Name one documentary you want to see.A Anything with David Attenborough, I absolutely love animals and nature, and could listen to his voice all day.Q Have you discovered any new music or podcasts A My music taste is so ied but my wee sis and cousin Tara introduced me to Beoga and I absolutely love it. A lad from my hometown, Ryan McMullan also features in some of their songs, always a nice surprise hearing a weePortaferry accent as Irsquom listening.Q Is there one piece of housework you can no longer avoid A My own room! I actually enjoy housework, everywhere but my own bedroom. Irsquoll clean all day but canrsquot be bothered with my own mess!Q Favourite room of the house to spend time in A We are lucky that the Team NB Manchester athlete house is lovely and has lots of space so my favourite room ies depending in the time of day. In the morning my bedroom gets lovely light, it makes me smile sitting there chilling. Then when I want a bit of company the front room or kitchen is where we chill as a team and have the craic... andthe sun shines, which it does on the odd occasion over here, we have a lovely garden.Both Jip and Adam are enjoying learning how to puck about with my hurl..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Recycling.jpg","title":"Recycling facilities to reopen  ","story":"THE districtrsquos household recycling centres could reopen next week.Located in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch, the centres closed at the end of March in line with the government directive to help reduce the spread of coronavirus.The Recorder understands that the sites will reopen, provided Newry, Mourne and Down Council can satisfy itself that the move can be managed safely and there is no risk to the public or frontline staff.Mid and East Antrim Council has already opened its recycling centres and Stormont environment minister Edwin Poots recently published guidelines aimed at paving the way for waste centres across the province to reopen.The reopening is expected to be discussed at todayrsquos virtual meeting between senior council officials and the leaders of the main political parties.Members of the local authorityrsquos senior management team are currently evaluating theenvironment ministerrsquos guidelines and developing a staff plan to allow the reopening to proceed in a safe way.In addition, officers are liaising with their recycling contractors, a number of whom have furloughed staff. The contractors are responsible for removing waste from all  council amenity sites, with early suggestions that it could take at least one week to ready themselves for reopening.With strict guidelines in relation to social distancing remaining in place, council officers are looking at the potential risks of reopening the sites and the required measures to mitigate them, with suggestions that ratepayers may have to book a slot to visit.Police and other statutory bodies, including the Department for Infrastructure, along with neighbouring councils, are also being consulted about reopening the sites.Council officers have suggested the recycling sites will open in a ldquophased manner and that certain restrictions will apply. Discussions with trade union officials are also planned.This Friday, the Northern Ireland Executive will review the current coronavirus regulations which could pave the way for the reopening of recycling centres not just in the local council area, but across Northern Ireland.Local councillors Willie Clarke and Billy Walker say Newry, Mourne and Down Council is right to carefully assess the guidelines published by Mr Poots and proceed with caution.They say the key importance is the safety of staff and residents, with the councillors suggesting that a visit to a civic amenity site would need to be classed as an ldquoessential journey under the current coronavirus legislation.Cllr Clarke says it is vital that the council approaches the reopening issue with caution, given that ldquocoronavirus is still rampant and people are dying.He continued: ldquoAny decision needs to be based on medical advice and direction from the Assembly.ldquoRecycling centres have not been classed as an essential service and people on their way to such a facility could end up getting stopped by police and issued with an enforcement ticket and sent home.ldquoThe council must ensure that all the Trsquos are crossed and the Irsquos dotted before the centres reopen. I understand there is a need across the community for this to happen, but my appeal to people is be patient for just a little longer.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoA phased approach to reopening the centres has been discussed by the party leaders. There is no point opening the centresthe contractors who remove the waste are not able to do so. A decision also has to be taken on what waste will be accepted at the sites in the short term.ldquoThe last thing we want is everyone landing at the sites, people getting out of their cars talking to one another and maybe not social distancing. People are still dying s a result of the virus and we must keep that in mind.Cllr Walker said that while many people have been cleaning their homes, garages and outhouses during the lockdown, the council needed to ensure that its civic amenity sites can reopen in what he described as a ldquosafe and proper manner.He added: ldquoWe need to manage the reopening process carefully and ensure there are not long queues of people waiting to use the centres, particularly in Downpatrick, Ballynahinch and Castlewellan, with tailbacks of cars spilling on to busy main roads.ldquoThe council does not want to put ratepayers at any risk and, in my view, is rightly proceeding with caution. It is not a simple case of opening the entrance gates and letting everyone in.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that the decision to close the recycling centres is continually being reviewed in-line with government essential travel restrictions.ldquoThe council is currently reviewing this guidance and the implications it will present when it reopens the centres within the district, the spokesman continued.ldquoIf a decision is made to reopen the centres, residents will be informed via updates on the council website, social media channels and through local media outlets..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Ryan.jpg","title":"Ryan bakes tasty treats for heroic postmen  ","story":"SOME superheroes really donrsquot wear capes ndash they deliver the post.To honour the work of the often unseen heroes of the local postal service Ryan Bogues has delivered a hamper of his famous baked treats to the Royal Mailrsquos Downpatrick sorting office.The  year-old, who has Downrsquos Syndrome and lives in Teconnaught, has has to suspend his popular Ryanrsquos Cookie Box initiative, which he started over four years ago, because of the coronavirus lockdown.Ryan was praised by Prime Minister Boris Johnston last year for fundraising for several charities through his Cookie Box scheme where people donate money for his baked goods.Hersquos helped by his mother, Hazel, who explained a line in a recent speech from Taoiseach Leo Varadkar inspired them to think of local postal workers.ldquoMr Varadkar used the line lsquonot all superheroes wear capesrsquo and that struck a chord with us, she said.ldquoWe have had to close the Cookie box, but Ryan wanted to still help. We have an excellent postwoman and thought that the postal workers were among the very many key workers who were all working really hard to ensure that their service goes on as normal so we felt that they deserved a Ryanrsquos Cookie Box hamper.She added that Ryan bakes enough goods to donate two hampers per week since the lockdown and they have gone to nursing homes, pharmacists and hospitals as well.The hamper, which contained a range of buns, traybakes and lemon drizzle cake was well received by the  men and women who work at the sorting office at the Ballydugan Road Industrial Estate.Manager Donal Carabine received the hamper last week and said it helped lt everyonersquos spirits.ldquoEveryone at the delivery office has been working hard to both work in new ways to ensure everyonersquos safety at work while continuing with our service, said Mr Carabine.ldquoWe are delighted to have been recognised as being amongst key workers by Ryan and his mother and the baked goods are appreciated by all. We thank them for their generosity and I can assure them that the treats didnrsquot last too long.Mr Carabine said that the staff were coping with delivering items, mainly packages, and were as busy as they would be at Christmas mdash the busiest time of the year.ldquoI think the staff are coping admirably with the demand, as well as abiding by the two-metre social distancing rule in work. We have had to reorganise the office and stagger the earlier start times of some staff but they have all risen to the challenge.The Downpatrick office delivers throughout the wider Downpatrick area as far as Seaforde, Ardglass, Crossgar and Saintfield.Mr Carabine said: ldquoThe workers are more than holding their own in terms of maintaining deliveries and keeping themselves safe, although in some areas, due to the need to protect workers, the service is a bit later than usual..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Support.jpg","title":"Saintfield’s Leah battling to raise cash for charity  ","story":"A SAINTFIELD mum is throwing her weight behind a gruelling event to raise money for charity.Leah McCourt, a champion mixed martial arts fighter, is undergoing a test of strength and endurance challenge for Christian Aid, which is responding to the coronavirus crisis in some of the poorest countries in the world.Over five days, -year-old Leah will be attempt to complete , exercises carrying a weighted bag used by combat athletes to build strength.Starting on Monday, Leah will complete the daunting daily task of , squats and lunges while carrying on her shoulders the crescent-shaped lsquoBulgarian bagrsquo filled with  kilos of sand and wool.

Please try again later.Submitting...This latter is an increasingly serious point since there is a growing tendency to see unlocking in terms of an economy versus health choice. The two are irretrievably entwined.First, lost jobs and businesses do cost lives, not dramatically in a sudden endemic. It kills just as surely over a period of time and also eats up expensive health, social and welfare services that we may need to help fend off the next pandemic. Second, the economy is what pays for our health, social and welfare services. Poor economy means fewer resources both in terms of increased demand for those services whilst concurrently implying a lower tax yield and hence lower income stream for those services we are now so appreciative of. Of course it must be gratying for those concerned to see all the public appreciation, on a Thursday evening, for their services. However, I cannot help wondering just how long this will last after the emergency is over. How many will vote for higher taxes to pay for better services, especially social welfare which takes such a burden off the NHS  How many tax dodgers in off-shore funds will volunteer to repatriate their billions to pay tax on it to maintain the NHS  What effort by our politicians and civil servants to clean up their act and ensure no more RHI scandals so that the money saved can go into better care and health facilities. Fewer £,pa Spads and more nurses or bio-medical scientists might be a good start, then we would also need fewer multi-million pound inquiries. Quiz our politicians, now that they are back, on that one.Meanwhile, we still have to deal with the current pandemic, and here I wish to raise a, not unrelated, serious question: just how serious is the current pandemic  I am not trying to trivialise, but deaths happen all the time, it’s normal.Thus the question arises of: how big an increase in deaths over the normal rate is currently occurring  Here one has to turn to the statistics, which are always dficult to analyse adequately, hence imperfect, but all that the decision takers have to go on.Working from the Office of National Statistics for England and Wales, week ending th March,  : .%deaths in the over  bracket involved Covid-: in - bracket it was .% : meanwhile no Covid- deaths were recorded in the under one and - age groups. Meanwhile, the total number of Covid- deaths was , out of a total of , deaths , thus  Covid- deathswere in the age group +. Meanwhile, .% of all deaths mentioned ‘influenza or pneumonia’ , Covid- or both. By comparison, the previous five year average for deaths involving influenza and pneumonia was .%.The foregoing is just an example of the kind of figures decision makers will have to grapple with. First this seems to be a virus that particularly affects the elderly and those with underlying respiratory conditions. When placing Covid- related deaths in perspective, the majority appear to affect those who have already reached, or nearly, the modern average le expectancy . More recent data since that cited above confirms that the median age of people who die is over .Is it just that a new disease is carrying us off rather than an old one If that is the case, then what is the justication for closing down an entire economy, which will also involve many premature deaths, perhaps of much younger and potentially more productive people.This is not an easy or comfortable question, and I am not proposing any answer, but it is one that needs asking and should be the basis for proper public debate, both in the media and politically.As the News Letter editorial ‘The world’s oldest daily newspaper is reporting this pandemic as it has reported other global health crises over the centuries,’ April  reminds us, in  , died from plague in Constantinople – that would cause panic, but we should not. Covid- is serious, but just how much in the great scheme of things has yet to be fully appraised and we need to keep calm and, especially, think rationally of how and where we limit the worst effects.• Dr James Dingley is chairman of Francis Hutcheson Institute"},{"url":null,"title":"captain tom launch charity he publishes two books including autobiography ","story":"Tragedy for PSNI widow Kate Carroll after son Shane found dead at same age stepfather Stephen was murderedBallycastle tragedy: Father who lost his we and three year-old daughter is at the bedside of surviving daughter wee HannahNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensCoronavirusFarmingNewsPeopleCaptain Tom to launch charity as he publishes two books, including autobiographySecond World War veteran and NHS fundraiser Captain Tom Moore will publish two books later this year as he launches a new charitable foundation.By The NewsroomThursday, th May , : am\"\"Captain Tom Moore . : PA Wire PA ImagesThe -year-old’s autobiography, called Tomorrow Will Be A Good Day, and a children’s picture book will support the Captain Tom Foundation.Captain Tom and his family want the Captain Tom Foundation to help combat loneliness, support hospices and help those facing bereavement.The veteran became a national hero when he raised almost £ million for the NHS by walking  laps of his garden in Bedfordshire before his th birthday on April .His autobiography, to be published on September , will tell of his time on the battlefields of Burma in the Second World War.

Its important to us that we support it as much as possible.ldquoIts uplting being able to do that. It was so emotional being able to see the nurses on the Covid ward.ldquoFor me and Charlotte it was very humbling because those guys are putting their lives at risk and theyrsquore asking for stuff for patients, not for themselves.ldquoWe were quite tearful because we didnrsquot want to leave them there ndash but theyrsquore doing it day in-day out without batting an eyelid. Amazing people.Alongside their charitable work, Matthew and Charlotte have adapted to the challenging economic climate by introducing a delivery service for their customers.The pair have been working without the support of their staff who they had to furlough after the government closed all non-essential shops.ldquoWersquove started doing take-out because we canrsquot afford to do nothing for three months. Wersquoll lose the shop, said Matthew.ldquoWersquoll continue to do these drop offs for the hospital as long as people fund it, and wersquoll continue to do our take-out service.ldquoBecause for shops and restaurants I think its going to be long term.ldquoWe might be in this for six months before we can open to the public.ldquoAs long as we get the support and people keep shopping locally, then yes we can get through it.ldquoRunning a business is a constant challenge and you donrsquot ever stop having to adapt. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
