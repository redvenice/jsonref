And what about Mummy? Well, that\u0027s a bit more complicated.They have a \u0027tummy mummy\u0027, a Canadian surrogate called Meg Stone — a 32-year-old single mother of two sons aged 12 and six — who carried the IVF twins for the British same-sex married couple. Then there\u0027s the twins\u0027 biological mother, an anonymous American egg donor about whom the family knows almost nothing, apart from a detailed medical history.For sure, this will make for a very interesting bedtime story when the twins are old enough to understand. For Alexandra and Calder Berney-Edwards are among the very few fraternal twins — that we know of, at least — with two different fathers.Usually born to super-fertile mothers who have been intimate with more than one man while ovulating, these cases normally come to light only when paternity is questioned.But Simon and Graeme\u0027s one-of-each twins were very much planned — and at considerable cost — although they insist vanity played no part, nor a desire to pioneer a fashionable trend in the brave new world of assisted fertility.For while there is greater acceptance of families with same-sex parents these days, Simon and Graeme are painfully aware there are still some people who do not approve. Even a few gay acquaintances were, they say, \u0027dismissive\u0027.\u0027Sometimes people stare, and we can see them having little private conversations about us, but on the whole most people are very accepting,\u0027 says Simon. \u0027We\u0027ve always said we will be very upfront with the twins as they grow up, explaining their heritage in an appropriate way. There is so much ersity these days that having two dads is not quite as shocking any more.\u0027Certainly, the parental landscape has changed dramatically within a short space of time. When the couple first approached a clinic in Las Vegas three years ago, they imagined having only one child to begin with, possibly followed by a second a few years later — not unlike Sir Elton John and husband David Furnish\u0027s two young sons.But when the question arose of who would father their first child — cue much discussion and indecision — the clinic suggested a twin pregnancy: implanting two embryos fertilised separately by each of their sperm, a practice not permitted in the UK.The couple jumped at what sounded a logical and fair solution to their situation, and now, the two little ones are creating merry havoc in the kitchen-diner of their South-East London home, with toys and books spilling across the floor.\u0027We always said we didn\u0027t want to know whose child was whose because it really didn\u0027t matter to us,\u0027 says Simon, 43.  \u0027But almost as soon as they were born it was pretty evident just by looking at them!\u0027With IVF fees standing at £25,000 — and that\u0027s without international flights, accommodation, surrogate expenses and lawyers\u0027 fees — the couple also realised two separate pregnancies would be financially crippling. So they went for the double whammy.Even then, they had to remortgage their home, but they achieved their dream: the twins were born naturally in Canada on June 25, 2017, with both fathers — bursting with excitement — in attendance.Alexandra was born first, at 6 lb 10 oz, and the couple had no idea which of them was the biological father. But when Calder followed seven minutes later, weighing 7 lb 3 oz, there was no question of \u0027Who\u0027s the daddy?\u0027 He was the spit of Graeme as a baby.Red Ken Livingstone blames the US for the crisis in...Screen limits for children: Government lays out its first...Share this article\u0027Holding them for the first time was just unbelievable, and I still feel emotional thinking about it,\u0027 says misty-eyed business development manager Simon, as he cuddles daughter Alexandra, who showers him with kisses.\u0027Picking up these two little beings and looking into their eyes was just so overwhelming.\u0027Former landscape gardener Graeme, 48, who writes a blog about being a gay stay-at-home dad, adds: \u0027There was just this huge wave of love. It was absolutely amazing. Every day, I feel blessed to have these two.\u0027But do they ever find themselves favouring their own biological child over the other? Simon shakes his head, insisting: \u0027I love them both equally and in different ways.\u0027Actually, at times I almost have a better relationship with Calder and Graeme has a better relationship with Alexandra, because it mirrors our relationship. \u0027Alexandra can sometimes really push my buttons because we\u0027re so alike, and Calder can push Graeme\u0027s.\u0027Certainly, the twins don\u0027t appear to have a favourite daddy. They are equally cuddly with both, swapping places in their arms without so much as a squabble.And, despite their obvious genetic heritage, they have their own unique personalities.Mischievous Calder goes by the nickname Cheeky Bear on account of the glint in his blue eyes and his determination to \u0027get into everything\u0027. He is also \u0027court jester\u0027 to Alexandra, or rather Little Princess Bear, whose steely, regal glare \u0027would stop a herd of stampeding elephants in its tracks\u0027.\u0027She will make people work hard for that smile, but it\u0027s worth it,\u0027 says Graeme. \u0027Her daddies can usually be found wrapped around her little finger.\u0027Simon and Graeme, who met online eight years ago, agree the twins\u0027 arrival has turned their life on its head, not that they have a single regret.Their smart terrace home, once a neat, orderly space, is now overrun with books, educational toys, clothes and two lively toddlers. The days when Simon and Graeme could afford two or three holidays a year, plus 30 or 40 trips to the theatre, are a distant memory, and a large whiteboard on the wall lists meals, naps and kiddy activities.\u0027I love our new life, but there are moments when it\u0027s pure pandemonium and you think: \u0027Please just stop!\u0027 But there\u0027s something very lovely about having two children chattering away in the back of the car,\u0027 says Simon.Graeme, who credits ten years working as airline cabin crew for his cool, calm head when dealing with small, demanding customers, adds: \u0027Our lives are unrecognisable, but I\u0027d do it all again in a heartbeat. \u0027I cannot believe my luck, either in meeting Simon or having these two. When I take the kids to Twins Club I actually feel quite broody and want more.\u0027With nine viable fertilised embryos still in storage, that\u0027s a possibility, but Simon protests: \u0027No! We\u0027ve got our hands full. Ask me again in a few years\u0027 time!\u0027When Simon and Graeme first came out as gay in their early 20s, attitudes were such that they never imagined they\u0027d have children.          Canadian surrogate Meg Stone — a 32-year-old single mother of two sons aged 12 and six —  carried the IVF twins for the British same-sex married coupleGraeme, who grew up in the Scottish town of Hamilton, always longed for his own family, especially after his mother died in 1995 aged 50, followed by his younger sister who — unable to cope with the loss — took her own life five years later, aged just 27. With no other children, his father, Eddie, 77, had resigned himself to never experiencing the joy of grandchildren.Likewise, Simon, who grew up in Sussex the eldest of four children, longed to be a parent but, over the years, had to content himself with being \u0027fun uncle\u0027 to his six nephews and nieces.\u0027We\u0027re just like any other couple who finds they\u0027re incredibly happy and then thinks, wouldn\u0027t it be nice to have children?\u0027 says Graeme.Initially, they wanted to adopt, but their application ended in disappointment when they were told they didn\u0027t meet the agency\u0027s criteria. So they started to research surrogacy and, finding UK laws too restrictive, sought help from an international agency — founded by a gay father to three IVF children — which directed them to the fertility clinic in Las Vegas.\u0027There are some clinics where you can choose eggs from Ivy League geniuses, but that wasn\u0027t important to us,\u0027 says Simon. The pair chose their donor from a book of anonymous women.\u0027The way our donor wrote about her motivation just spoke to us. She said she wasn\u0027t ready to have children, but wanted to help others and use the money to put herself through college.\u0027Twenty eggs were harvested from the donor — half of which were fertilised with Simon\u0027s sperm and half with Graeme\u0027s, after they went through health and genetic tests — and then frozen.Shortly afterwards, they made contact with Meg Stone, a retail night manager from Ontario. \u0027I saw Simon and Graeme\u0027s profile and I thought they had lovely smiles,\u0027 she says. \u0027I love being pregnant and always wanted a big family, so when my marriage ended I decided to use that \u0027baby fever\u0027 to help someone else.\u0027Simon says: \u0027Meg is a special lady and we were drawn to her because she has this warmth. She said to us: I have one stipulation, that I want to have an ongoing relationship with the children. I\u0027d like to be the crazy aunt in Canada.\u0027That\u0027s what we wanted as well. When we met for the first time, it was as if we\u0027d known her all our lives.\u0027In October 2016, Simon and Graeme watched via Skype the \u0027mind-blowing\u0027 moment their two embryos were implanted into Meg\u0027s womb. They didn\u0027t choose the sex of the twins and didn\u0027t know if they would get two boys, two girls, one of each, just one, or none at all. There was even a risk the implanted eggs could split to produce triplets, or two sets of identical twins.Ten days on, they were ecstatic when Meg sent them a picture of a positive pregnancy test, later confirmed by a blood test. The first scan, at seven weeks, was nerve-racking, and Simon and Graeme watched via an internet link.\u0027The moment the person said: \u0027OK, there\u0027s one embryo and there\u0027s the other,\u0027 we were so excited and shocked,\u0027 says Simon.\u0027For an hour-and-a-half, we were pretty much incapable of moving. We were crying, ecstatically happy and also thinking: Oh my word, what have we done?\u0027Simon and Graeme waited until after the 12-week scan to break the news to their families — all of whom were thrilled. They refused tests to check the twins for Down\u0027s syndrome and other disabilities.\u0027We didn\u0027t want to know because they were our children, and we\u0027d accept and love them no matter what,\u0027 says Simon. Both flew out to Canada for the 19-week scan.Compared with carrying her own children, Meg found the pregnancy much more draining physically, suffering sickness, heartburn and swelling. Simon admits that, at times, the couple felt quite guilty at what she was going through to help them become parents.When Meg had a scare at 31 weeks, fearing she was going to deliver prematurely, Simon and Graeme jumped on a plane and went straight to the hospital — not knowing if they\u0027d be daddies by the time they arrived.Doctors managed to halt the labour, but Simon and Graeme decided to stay in Canada and were on tenterhooks for six weeks. There were several more false alarms before the twins were induced at 37 weeks.\u0027We thought labour would take hours, but it happened so quickly,\u0027 says Simon. \u0027One minute I nipped off to the loo and the next they were delivering the first of our children.\u0027It was pure coincidence Simon was at the \u0027business\u0027 end when Alexandra was born, so he was the first to hold his biological child and cut the cord, while Graeme did the honours with Calder.\u0027Right up until the moment of birth, I was thinking: \u0027Am I ready to be a father?\u0027 But the moment I held the twins in my arms, I knew that I was,\u0027 says Graeme. \u0027It was everything I\u0027d ever dreamed of.\u0027Simon adds: \u0027It was so lovely in the recovery room, on our own with our children. I called my mum and when I held the camera out I could hear her screaming: Babies, you\u0027ve got Babies! Then calling to Dad: Dan! Dan! They\u0027ve got babies.They named Alexandra after Simon\u0027s grandmother and Calder after the maiden name of Graeme\u0027s grandmother. The family stayed in Canada for another seven weeks while legal paperwork was sorted.DNA tests, required before the fathers could apply for a parental order in the UK, confirmed what they already knew.Since then, life has been a happy, if exhausting, whirlwind of sleepless nights, nappy-changing, play-dates, and weekly trips to the local Twins Club. On the twins\u0027 first birthday, surrogate Meg travelled from Canada to celebrate with them. They keep her up-to-date via Facebook and regular phone calls.Meg, now pregnant with surrogate twins for another couple, says: \u0027I would carry another baby for them in a heartbeat to give the twins siblings. I hope to be in their lives as long as they want me.\u0027One thing is for certain about this very modern family: it may not be conventional, but the love is unconditional. Says Simon: \u0027What the twins will certainly know is that they were both 100 per cent wanted and are 100 per cent loved.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Look difference make","story":"The Mail helped transform this river - and it\u0027s still looking sparkling...

Residents complained that it smelled fetid, presenting a threat to wildlife.The Mail tasked me to clean it up as part of its ten-year campaign to Turn The Tide On Plastic. But when I began investigating the best way to get it sorted, I was met with a wall of red tape. Clearing hard-to-access waterways costs a lot — I was quoted £60,000 by one outfit — and no one was keen to take responsibility for the bill.But the river was eventually cleared, in vivid proof of what’s possible when people care. Yet this is no time for complacency.          Sadly there is so much more to do...

You only need to walk for five minutes to see evidence of the escalating litter problem big towns and cities  are struggling to containJust feet from the bank, there’s a 30-metre stretch of bushes strangled by old plastic rubbish. It would only take high water levels to wash it all back into the river.There’s a form on the Doncaster Council website to report litter spots, with the authority saying they will clear them within five days. But the residents I meet are dismissive about the council.One said she had phoned the council many times and tweeted photos of discarded rubbish. ‘Doncaster is disgusting,’ she says. Then she adds the phrase I was to hear many times during my visit: ‘Donny Council does NOTHING!’She directs me to the narrow Victorian streets of the Hyde Park area, with its back-to-back terrace houses. Here, pavements and gutters are swirling with rubbish — paper, plastic gloves, cigarette packets, cans and bottles.The owner of the Krakow corner shop tells me: ‘It’s appalling! These streets ARE the local litter bin.’While locals are keen to blame the council, Doncaster MP Rosie Winterton says those who leave the litter are most at fault. ‘Fly-tipping is a health hazard, bad for the environment and people who do it are behaving appallingly.’          Just feet from the bank, there’s a 30-metre stretch of bushes strangled by old plastic rubbish. It would only take high water levels to wash it all back into the riverFormer Labour leader Ed Miliband’s constituency encompasses the more rural areas of Doncaster North where the main rubbish problem is fly-tipping and plastic thrown out of cars and lorries.He said: ‘The council has made progress but there is a lot more to do. I regularly take up my constituents’ cases around fly-tipping and litter with the council.’The council spends £500,000 a year on litter clearing, employing 200 ‘enforcement officers’ and 70 litter pickers. But the litter problem only seems to get worse.Thanks to initiatives such as Keep Britain Tidy’s Great British Spring Clean, communities are taking litter picking into their own hands. A key local figure is mum-of-three Bex Shaw, who formed the Doncaster Green Team last year and has 250 Facebook followers who join her on litter picks.Most days Bex, 40, who works as a support teacher for special needs children, will be out on her own, clearing litter. ‘I’m so sick of seeing it everywhere. Instead of moaning, I decided to do something,’ she explains. She takes me to the industrial estates around the Keepmoat Stadium, home to football team Doncaster Rovers.Club Doncaster, which runs the Keepmoat, spends £150,000 a year on cleaning and waste management. Yet there are stretches of roadside here so badly littered it looks like a Third World country.‘The litter is clearly coming from visitors to the stadium and workers in the factories and distribution centres here, so it would be great if the businesses took some responsibility for keeping it clear,’ she says. Worst is a 50-metre stretch of verge behind a bus stop outside the massive Tesco distribution centre. There is no litter bin and people getting on and off buses drop their food and drink wrappers into the bushes.I spot hundreds of bright blue plastic hairnets (the sort worn by workers handling food) and countless light brown plastic coffee cups from office vending machines.          I contact the King Asia Foods plant over the road, which produces oriental foods, and Tesco HQ to ask if they’d noticed the problem and might like to join the spirit of the GB Spring Clean. King Asia don’t reply, but Tesco get back immediately to say: ‘Although this rubbish is not on Tesco land we have arranged to clean up the site and will monitor the area closely going forward.’Bex is thrilled. ‘Wouldn’t it be great if every business around here put some of its profit towards keeping Doncaster clear of litter, rather than trying to shift responsibility to the council?’She then takes us around the back of the Keepmoat to a car park area rented out to weekend car boot sales. There are huge signs advertising that this section of the stadium is sponsored by waste management company, Ellgia. Ironically, beneath these signs the grassy banks are strewn with plastic and fast-food residue discarded by the car-booters.Despite the disgruntlement among Doncaster’s residents, it is clear the council is trying to get on top of the litter problem, businesses are increasingly beginning to shoulder their share of the burden and there are plenty of volunteers willing to help.Mark Benton, the council’s environmental crime officer, says: ‘We need to think of littering as anti-social behaviour. It isn’t a council problem, it’s everyone’s problem and we all have to do our bit.’"},{"url":null,"title":"PLATELLS PEOPLE Tears beastly job interview Welcome real world","story":"    The latest young person to get her 15 minutes of fame on social media is Olivia Bland, 22But did he really deserve to be likened by her to her abusive ex-partner, from whom she fled after a ghastly 18-month relationship?Olivia — who was offered the job but turned it down — says by going public she hopes others will refuse to put up with bullying interviews.Yet Web Applications UK said after an investigation that it was ‘satisfied that no bullying or intimidation occurred during the robust and challenging interview’. And my fear is that, by portraying herself as a victim, in this age of snowflakery she does herself and her many Twitter followers few favours.I refuse to use the word ‘snowflake’ about Olivia. She has been brave and honest about what she perceived to be a horrendous interview.But interviews, surely, should be robust and challenging. How else can companies assess whether they are getting the brightest and the best?So-called ‘stress interviews’ are a means of working out how people will cope in a crisis. Two female employees were also in the room for the interview, I imagine to ensure the boss was not too harsh — but Olivia complained about that, too.She’s been offered several jobs in light of her raw and honest social media response. Good for her.But for many it will have reinforced their view that the default position for privileged middle-class millennials is to paint themselves as victims who would rather turn to social media than wake up to a real world that’s often stressful and unfair.PLATELL\u0027S PEOPLE: Silence of speedboat killer\u0027s family is...PLATELL\u0027S PEOPLE: A mother\u0027s grief and Facebook\u0027s abject...Share this article  Gisele\u0027s big secret desire to cover up Having first signed with the risqué lingerie brand Victoria’s Secret when she was 19 and earned vast sums from wearing next to nothing, Gisele Bundchen, 38, now says she stopped modelling for the firm because she was unhappy exposing so much of her body.‘I was always the person who asked: “Can I please cover my butt?” ’Too little, too late, Gisele.

In December, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (above) labelled Erdogan an \u0027anti-Semitic dictator\u0027While Turkey under Erdogan has never completely severed ties with Israel, the Turkish strongman has also never shied away from the strongest criticism.He famously walked out of a January 2009 debate in Davos with then Israeli president Shimon Peres, complaining he was not given enough time to respond and repeatedly saying \u0027one minute\u0027.And in December, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu labelled Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan an \u0027anti-Semitic dictator\u0027.Speaking at the time, Netanyahu said the Turkish leader is \u0027obsessed with Israel\u0027 and his military \u0027slaughters women and children in Kurdish villages.\u0027In turn, Erdogan called Netanyahu an oppressor who commits \u0027state terror.\u0027 It wasn\u0027t immediately clear what sparked the spat between the leaders.Israel and Turkey were once close allies. But relations have steadily cooled since Erdogan, whose party has roots in Turkey\u0027s Islamist movement, became prime minister in 2003.The exchange came just days after the U.S. announced its withdrawal from Syria, where both Israel and Turkey are involved in the seven-year civil war.In 2017, Erdogan also lashed out at Israel, after Donald Trump decided to recognise Jerusalem as the Jewish state\u0027s capital.Israel captured east Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed it in a move not recognised internationally.The Palestinians want east Jerusalem as the capital of their future state, and viewed the relocation of the embassy as a one-sided move that invalidates the US as a peace broker in the region.Erdogan described Israel at the time as a \u0027terrorist state\u0027 and a \u0027killer of children\u0027 as fresh clashes erupted in the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem.

He should resign.\u0027 Another contender for the Democratic nomination, Julian Castro, joined the call, calling the image of Northam \u0027racist and unconscionable\u0027. Northam\u0027s mentor and key ally, former Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, called for him to resign as well.\u0027The situation that he has put himself and the Commonwealth of Virginia in is untenable.

Governor Justin Fairfax, who is African-American, would assume the governor\u0027s office.

And the portrait is believed – at least by the gallery’s experts – to have been created in the workshop of the Netherlandish painter Rogier van der Weyden.But to one leading art historian, it is nothing of the sort. Instead, it is a 20th-century fake, of an unknown man sporting a Beatles-style haircut and reading a paper containing nothing more than nonsense.And, claims Christopher Wright, an old-masters scholar, its likely creator is Eric Hebborn, the greatest forger of modern times. Wright is challenging the attribution of A Man Reading, possibly Saint Ivo, which the gallery label dates to “about 1450”. He told the Observer that the picture “screams” the 1960s, and that Hebborn had repeatedly claimed authorship – before denying it.The painting is thought to represent the patron saint of lawyers and advocate of the poor. The figure appears to be holding what the gallery describes as “a legal document, which would be appropriate for Saint Ivo”.Wright ridicules the haircut of the figure who is reading a text that is “gobbledegook” – “an impossibility for a long inscription in that period when artists only wrote inscriptions to be read”.Teasing the art world was part of Hebborn’s trade, both before and after he was unmasked in 1978 as a brilliant forger. He fooled the world’s foremost galleries and auction houses with forgeries in the style of Rubens and Van Dyck, among others.“Only a handful have been exposed,” Wright said. “There are still Hebborns floating around the art market and in museums.”For Hebborn, “the greater the expert, the greater the satisfaction of deceiving them”.The art world was too humiliated to press charges. He died mysteriously in 1996, found lying on a street in Rome with a broken skull. Wright first briefly challenged the authenticity of the Saint Ivo 35 years ago in his book, The Art of the Forger, without suggesting Hebborn’s name. But it prompted the then National Gallery director to cancel Wright’s lunchtime lectures and order the bookshop to remove all copies – although staff held copies under the counter for visitors requesting one.Wright said that subsequent dendrochronological dating of the picture’s oak panel found that it dates from about half a century after the artist’s death, “which is why it’s attributed to his workshop”.Just as Hebborn used old paper for drawings, he could use wood from old furniture, “which is not difficult”, he added.He pointed to other stylistic problems, such as the figure’s hood, which defies the laws of gravity, and a modern-looking facial scar: “The accumulation of small pieces of evidence build up to the thing being wrong.”He said: “If I was the gallery director, I would simply say that some have thought it to be more modern.” He understands the gallery’s reluctance: “To come out and say ‘Well, actually, we bought a 20th-century fake’ is not really a thing that they would do.”The painting, which measures 45cm by 35cm, was acquired in 1971. Wright believes that it had been planted in a peer’s outhouse for a dealer, David Carritt, to find in 1968.A footnote in the National Gallery’s 1997 technical bulletin refers to “baseless claims that it is a modern forgery” in Wright’s 1984 book and a 1991 Hebborn interview. The text notes that it has been called a “20th-century forgery in spite of the fact that it belonged to a collector who died in 1806”.But Wright argues that there is no evidence that this is the same painting. He believes that an 1850s drawing by Sir George Scharf of a similar composition relates to a lost painting as it corrects mistakes in the National Gallery painting: “In the drawing, the saint is directly looking at the paper, which he’s not in the painting. The perspective of the writing is also wrong in the painting. Hebborn made mistakes as he wasn’t steeped in this period.”His doubts about the Saint Ivo have resurfaced because he is now finishing his memoirs. Remembering that Hebborn had also made the authorship claim to a documentary-maker off camera, he found clues while re-reading Hebborn’s books, his 1991 autobiography, Drawn to Trouble, and The Art Forger’s Handbook, published posthumously.“There is quite a lot about forging early paintings in the book,” he said. “Hebborn says things that imply he did it. In one passage, he writes that he is painting an early Netherlandish picture for a dealer. So is that a hoax?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18a80e1355cb7688ef7280cfcc5d0932ddb7d42f/0_329_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=077898bcc94c9ae73188ea1a93f81ff4","title":"original observer photography","story":"Stage, screen, song and Sambuca - the best photography commissioned by the Observer in January 2019"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/554b1050d6d3a2e4e7ebe14fece85a005e7fbfe8/0_475_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06dab90fabee93a19cc700ca47704977","title":"screen dreams cinemas of the world in pictures","story":"For 16 years, Paris-based photographer Stephan Zaubitzer has been photographing cinemas around the world.

What did he produce after ceasing to publish his writing in 1965, and will it ever be read? It seemed possible that more work would come to light after Salinger’s death in 2010. In 2013 a documentary and accompanying book claimed, among other things, to describe the contents of five new Salinger books that would be forthcoming by 2020 at the latest, yet here we are at his centenary and there has been no sign.I ask Salinger’s son Matt about the rumours of new material when we meet for breakfast near his home in Connecticut, and he doesn’t mince words. “They’re total trash,” he says. “The specific bullet-point dramatic quote-unquote reveals that have been made are utter bullshit. They have little to no bearing on reality.” He has been reluctant, until now, to talk about his father at all. “I’ve gotten away with not having this kind of conversation for 58 years,” he says. Still, he is ready, now, to confirm that other writing does exist. His father “teemed with ideas and thoughts, and he’d be driving the car and he’d pull over to write something and laugh to himself – sometimes he’d read it to me, sometimes he wouldn’t – and next to every chair he had a notebook.” He assures me that “most all of what he wrote will at some point be shared with the people that love reading his stuff”. When I ask why that moment hasn’t yet arrived, he is disarmingly direct. “It’s not ready. He wanted me to pull it together, and because of the scope of the job, he knew it would take a long time. This was somebody who was writing for 50 years without publishing, so that’s a lot of material. So there’s not a reluctance or a protectiveness: when it’s ready, we’re going to share it.”Tall and striking, with an air of warmth and amusement that belies his evident doubts about talking to me at all, Matt Salinger is an actor – probably best known for playing Captain America in the 1990 film – and a producer of movies and theatre, most notably Pamela Gien’s The Syringa Tree, which he “put my whole self into for a decade”, producing an international hit. What becomes clear is that he has been immersed in his father’s material for years – pages typed on Underwood and Royal typewriters, as well as what Salinger called “his squibs, or his fragments” on ordinary paper cut into eighths: “a lot of handwritten, very small notes”. When he began work in 2011, Matt never expected it would take eight years. He feels “fortunate”, he says. “Reading this stuff for the first time” has been “an emotional thing”, like having an ongoing dialogue with his father. “A lot of my friends at this age, their parents are dying or have died and they’re just gone, you know. And my father’s not gone. He hasn’t died for me.” Often he will “just have to stop what I am doing”, struck by something “that I recognise that for the right reader, whether it’s millions or hundreds of thousands or tens of thousands or three or one, it could just be the one right reader that needs to read that. I feel the pressure to get this done, more than he did.”When I ask how much longer it will take, Matt replies: “We’re definitely talking years,” though, he hopes, fewer than 10. “When his widow and I were first gauging what needed to be done after he died, I knew that I wouldn’t be producing any films or theatre for a while and I knew that I would only be doing enough acting to keep my family’s health insurance.” Often people will approach Matt in public, at a ski resort or bike repair shop – “it’s always my credit card that does me in!” – with “a cri de coeur”, pleading to know if or when more work will appear. One older woman said she didn’t want to die without having read what more there is. “If that’s not pressure …” he says. “I don’t take any of this lightly.” He adds, “I don’t owe an apology, I don’t think, but your readers should know that we’re going as fast as we freaking can.”Of the rumours that have spread, Matt laughs that “anyone that understood my father at all would find the idea hysterically funny that he would write a book about his first brief marriage. It’s so far beyond the realm of plausibility.” He’s unwilling, at this point, to reveal anything specific, though it’s clear that there will be more about the Glass family, who inhabit many of his best published stories. He says there’s “no linear evolution” in the later work: “It becomes clear that he was after different game.” Matt believes the new work “will definitely disappoint people that he wouldn’t care about, but for real readers … I think it will be tremendously well received by those people and they will be affected in the way every reader hopes to be affected when they open a book. Not changed, necessarily, but something rubs off that can lead to change.”Matt was born in 1960 and immortalised a year later in the dedication to Franny and Zooey (Salinger writes that he offered the book up to the New Yorker’s editor, William Shawn, “as nearly as possible in the spirit of Matthew Salinger, age one, urging a luncheon companion to accept a cool lima bean”). By the time Matt came along, the second child of his father’s second marriage, in 1955, to Claire Douglas, Salinger had already published most of the work on which his monumental reputation rests. After the perennial bestseller The Catcher in the Rye (1951) came For Esmé – with Love and Squalor, Franny and Zooey, Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters (the last three mostly consist of stories that appeared in the New Yorker from the late 1940s to 1950s), and then that final New Yorker story, “Hapworth 16, 1924,” in June 1965.As a child, Matt didn’t hear much about his father’s work. “We were more likely to talk about the Dartmouth football team, or what are we going to do when I pick you up on Wednesday.” He speaks of the respect his father had for children: “He did see the world as something that will just work on fucking you up, if allowed to. He had a real belief and even reverence for the innate intelligence and beauty of kids before they’re homogenised.” Matt’s sister, Margaret, who is four years older than him, offered in her 2000 memoir Dream Catcher a much darker portrait of their parents and childhood, which Matt refuted in print as “gothic tales”. (These days he keeps her informed about plans for the centenary and says: “I only wish her happiness.”) JD Salinger’s first marriage, to a German woman just after the second world war, lasted less than a year. After his orce from Matt and Margaret’s mother in the 1960s, he eventually married Colleen O’Neill, who now has joint charge of his literary trust with Matt.That means being on the first line of defence, “fighting lawsuits and tilting at windmills”, fending off what Salinger called “wanters” (I can’t quite tell if the “relentless” Harvey Weinstein, who was “after me forever” to get a film of Catcher off the ground, counts as one of these), and hindering, for instance, the republication of several early stories that Salinger did not want collected. (His father’s feeling about those stories, which were “youthful exercises, part of his process, his development as an artist,” seemed to Matt to be akin to “when you’re having a bad night and you’re trying to go to sleep and you think of things and you just have that wince, ‘Did I really say that?’ or ‘Did I really do that?’ …. There was also more ego in those, he called himself a showoff when he was young.”) Matt has been “keeping up that vigilance. And it’s not a sporting exercise, I don’t do it lightly, it’s no fun. I do it because my father would have done it and out of love for him, and out of love and protectiveness for his work and his books.” He has made himself an expert in international copyright law, and speaks with energy about “European countries where their law came more from Hegel than from Locke.” In the cottage industry of Salinger quasi-biography, he identifies a “weird sort of inverse relationship,” in which “the better somebody knew my father, the less likely they were going to be to talk to anybody. And there was really no middle ground, you either knew him really well and intimately or you just knew him completely casually.” He himself is painstakingly precise in what he says about his father or the work, often second-guessing a word or phrase, reiterating that his father would probably hate what he’s saying and how he’s saying it, or deciding, mid-way through a seemingly harmless sentence, not to finish it. All Salinger’s files, which in his lifetime were kept in a pair of safes in his house – “and thank God they were”, Matt remembers, because otherwise everything would have been lost when Salinger’s house burned down during the 1990s – are now in a high-security storage facility.Salinger’s desire for privacy, of course, only increased the feverish interest of the press, and his son kept track of the shift in words habitually used to describe him as the decades passed, “seeing when the word recluse started being used. And then that morphed in the common vernacular among journalists to ‘famous recluse’, and then it became ‘infamous recluse’. In the last 10 years, it became ‘notorious recluse’, and if you really think about that word, it’s damning, it has all kinds of psychological overtones, and it’s dishonest, and like so much that’s written, it says more about the person who’s writing it than it does about the subject.” There was nothing sinister or mysterious, Matt insists, in his father’s wish to live and write in private. “He just decided that the best thing for his writing was not to have a lot of interactions with people, literary types in particular. He didn’t want to be playing in those poker games, he wanted to, as he would encourage every would-be writer to do, you know, stew in your own juices.” Salinger gives a vivid, impromptu impression of his father, on the phone, clearing his throat: “Sorry Matt, God, I haven’t used my voice in three days.” Time alone was simply “what he needed for his work, and his work was everything to him”. The rest, Matt says, “is just noise and mythologising and pathologising and people’s own neurosis”.At one point he shows me a copy of one of the small, handwritten notes that he came across recently, as “an offering or a gesture” to Salinger’s readers. “Anyone that loved his writing and thinks they cared for him in a certain way might have been alarmed or concerned at so much of what’s been written,” he thinks, and he wants them to get “a glimpse” at how Salinger was feeling late in life. The piece, “like a haiku in a way”, describes a moment of unexpected and “still, not disquieting” happiness while resting, having been up working at the typewriter since six that morning: “and, through the window by the bed he saw that snow was falling without rush but copiously into the grayness, the December unsunniness of the late afternoon, and it was suddenly, bliss, sheer bliss, to be alive and watching and about to fall asleep, nearing sleep. Bliss. Thank you, God!”He is currently deciding what should be included in an exhibition at the New York Public Library in October – “talk about things that go against my nature!” – that will have some manuscripts, photographs, objects, letters. But, he promises: “We’re never going to be merchandising anything. There’s never going to be a Salinger vodka.” Going through some of the hundred or so letters his father wrote him, “often funny as hell”, dating from the early 1970s to 2009, he offers to read some to me. A letter from 1976 links an interpretation of Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar with the TV journalist Dan Rather’s soppy coverage of Nixon’s resignation and with a tennis match between Chris Evert and Evonne Goolagong, whom he sees as “like some Star Trek girl from outer space ... Too peace-loving, too placid to be effective against any of the hustlers from Earth.” He writes:“There’s probably no limit to the extremes of infantile and Zoo-like behavior adults will take to, or revert to, if they’re in a group (which means any number of people in excess of two – and on some occasions two’s a mob, especially if there’s booze around), and if the organised shit-throwing is given the permissive, O.K. general heading of Fun \u0026amp Games, or if it’s vaguely categorized as Letting Off a Little Steam Once in a While Never Hurt Anybody, Mac. Oh, groups at large give me the willies, Da. Group enthusiasm, of any kind, either for cheering or lynching, makes me very uneasy …”Elsewhere he expresses delight in catching one of Matt’s appearances on TV (he praised his honesty and brilliance, “right in the middle of all that SHIT!!”). Other letters are very emotionally direct. Going through “all those old papers and letters yesterday made me all the more aware how happy and relieved I am to be living in the present, not the past. I can’t say I cared much for the War or military school or my childhood. These Cornish years with you and Peggy and this house and you and the fields and my notebooks and work and you and Lili and Schotland and Nice Doggie and Rosie and you and Sri. R. and the Nuremberg Egg and our trips to London and Lake Placid and Dublin and Montreal and Andover – these years have been what I would call my real life.”The preparation of his father’s writing is, Matt feels, the most meaningful work he could be doing. “You’re only given one life. Most of the movies that I produced were crap.” He also assures readers that “when my father said that everything he has to say is in his fiction, believe it – it’s there. I think when more of his writing is made accessible, he covers everything that the discerning reader would care about. My job is to help that happen as soon as it can, and stay out of the way.” He adds: “Whatever I have to offer up on his behalf, I’ll certainly do with more belief and faith and love than I offered that lima bean to whoever it was. And hope.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad04dc5c19ec858c5f3df9bd6ae58cd64f49e5d2/34_221_1891_1133/master/1891.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea52d13a690329ad2ccf27fca9447b98","title":"book clinic novels impress an english literature university admissions tutor","story":"Q: What books should my daughter read to impress English literature admissions tutors at interviews for university?Anonymous policy officer, 48, SurreyA: Philip Hensher, novelist, critic and professor of creative writing at Bath Spa University, writes:Academics are literary professionals.

With Jonathan Nossiter, he co-wrote the films Sunday (1997) – which won the grand jury prize and the Waldo Salt screenwriting award at Sundance – and Signs \u0026amp Wonders (2000), starring Charlotte Rampling and Stellan Skarsgård. He was born in the UK – the son of architect Sir Denys Lasdun – but now lives and works in the US. He spoke to me from his home in the hills of upstate New York. His latest book, Victory, comprises two novellas – Feathered Glory and Afternoon of a Faun, both darkly humorous and compelling portraits of men wrestling with guilt and desire.Afternoon of a Faun is about a historical act coming to light years later. It feels very much a novel of our times. Was this intentional?I didn’t write it as a #MeToo novel. I started it at the very beginning of 2017. Trump had been elected, then I was nearly finishing it as the Harvey Weinstein story broke and #MeToo started. I was totally caught off my guard. I didn’t really see that coming and it was a little complicated for me. I could see in an opportunistic way that it connected very strongly… but it was sort of an accident.It called to mind another great short novel – JM Coetzee’s Disgrace.I’ve read Disgrace it’s an amazing novel. The story of sexual misconduct, of allegations – it’s become a trope. So I’m sure it had an effect on me, but so did many other novels, real-life stories, plays. Writers are really drawn to that subject for obvious reasons. It’s of great interest to me and this isn’t the first time I’ve written about it. I wrote about it in my first novel, The Horned Man.The first story, Feathered Glory, is, among other things, about an injured bird.We took in a swan at one point. My wife was working with a wildlife rehabilitator. I can’t remember exactly how it came about, but I had a swan in a cage in the room that I was writing in. It was with us not a very long time, but it was a very powerful presence and I knew that one way or another I wanted to write about it.These are stories about toxic masculinity, but they’re also about male friendship.I think male friendships are quite fascinating. I have very longstanding friendships with other men. Especially after you get married, you tend to conduct most of your close relationships outside of marriage with guys. I didn’t want to write a satire of bad behaviours – I wanted it to get a lot of the different aspects of male behaviour down, not just the toxic elements. But that’s a part of it, it’s what drives the story. Different things seem toxic at different times, too they’re both stories that go over long-ish time periods in which social values shift and I wanted to capture a little bit of that.In the 2013 memoir, Give Me Everything You Have, you wrote – in a manner that stirred some controversy – about your experience of being stalked by a former student. I wondered how much that experience fed into these stories?I’d been writing versions of that kind of narrative, of devastating interruption of a relatively stable life, before my whole stalker thing. In a strange way that episode fell into a pattern of things that was already part of my imaging. There were all these sorts of very bizarre resemblances between what happened with my stalker and what I’d written in The Horned Man several years before. So it wasn’t like this introduced me to a whole new emotional spectrum, but it did give me a horrific amount of psychic material to work with. It certainly made writing this kind of a story possible, perhaps inevitable.You write poems, prose, short stories, screenplays. In which medium do you feel most comfortable?I just think of myself as a writer. At various different times different forms have appealed more or less. I haven’t been reading or writing poetry for a while, I’m not sure why. I used to be able to do both at once and around about the time we had kids, something had to give. I don’t feel terribly engaged with poetry at the moment. I hope that changes.Did the novella as a form particularly appeal to you? There seems to be something of a vogue at the moment for these shorter books.I do like short novels or novellas – I don’t really know what the difference is. Some of my favourite pieces of writing are classic novellas by Tolstoy or Melville or Henry James. They’re very satisfying. They have the richness and depth of novels but the tightness of short stories. I’m quite an impatient reader. I don’t read very many long books.What book is currently on your bedside table?A book about ancient Egypt called The Mind of Egypt by Jan Assmann.What was the last great book you read?I was knocked out by Sally Rooney’s Conversations With Friends. I haven’t read the new one but I’m looking forward to it. It hasn’t come out here yet.What book would you give to a young person?My son just loved Tintin. But also The Count of Monte Cristo.Which classic book have you recently read for the first time?I’m doing a lot of rereading at the moment, much of it listening on audiobooks. I drive a lot and love listening to big books on tape. I’d never got through The Devils by Dostoevsky, which I’d tried to read maybe half a dozen times but never got there. I had to do a lot of driving – I was driving my son to Ohio where he goes to college – and I listened to it and it blew my mind.Which book do you always come back to?Anna Karenina.

His comments were met with derisive laughter.Fabio Franceschi, owner of Grafica Veneta, Italy’s largest printing house, is among the many businesspeople in despair. “The country is in the hands of a couple of kids,” he told the Observer, referring to Di Maio and his co-deputy, Matteo Salvini.Franceschi said the decline was partly due to the uncertainty being created by a government whose 2019 budget contains little in the way of spurring investment, and which has made blocking migrants at Italian ports, spats with France and campaigning ahead of the European elections in May its priorities.“With all of this … we are becoming an uncivil country. There is no focus on business and job creation. As for the rowing with France – we should never compare ourselves to other countries. France has a credibility that we don’t have at this moment.”It’s a view shared by most economists, many of whom cite Italy as the most likely spark for the next eurozone crisis.Poverty levels are up and there is little extra money in the kitty to invest for the future without increasing the country’s enormous debts.A budget forged by the coalition of Salvini’s League party and Di Maio’s Five Star Movement (M5S) was agreed in December after months of battling with the European commission.Lorenzo Codogno, a former chief economist at the Italian finance ministry, believes the budget has set Rome on course for another crisis.“All the leading indicators suggest the first quarter of the year will be as bad as the last, and the second quarter will be flat. It’s likely things will pick up from there, but even then, it will mean the economy finishes the year in a weak position,” he says.Salvini and Di Maio have put increases in pension entitlements and plans to introduce a basic income high on their agenda, along with taxes on banks and cuts to business tax reliefs.Codogno, who is a visiting professor at the London School of Economics and runs his own London-based consultancy, said cuts to public investment and a mix of extra taxes and benefit giveaways fail to address long-standing barriers to growth, storing up problems that could prove ruinous in a year’s time.“The coalition is clearly anti-bank and anti-business. It doesn’t help businesses increase investment if they must pay more in tax. Extra taxes on banks could lead to a liquidity crisis – maybe not now but next year, possibly.“And the extra money given to pensioners and through the basic income increases the structural deficit, and that will be difficult to reverse if the government gets into financial difficulties,” he added.While he recognises the awkward situation Italy finds itself in, the finance minister, Giovanni Tria, put an optimistic gloss on the country’s prospects in a speech to Columbia University students on Thursday.He also said that Italian household finances were in a stronger position than most other European countries, with private wealth estimated at more than twice the national debt. That national debt, despite being among the largest in the world, is held mostly by domestic investors. In essence, just like the Japanese, Italians would rather lend their government money than pay enough taxes for it to function.Tria did not address the issue of tax in his speech. He preferred to blame the Germans. He said Berlin’s emphasis on trade with China and the far east had denied the rest of the eurozone the support it needs from German business.“The model pursued by the German export-led growth appears to be at the root of the lack of convergence and the loss of dynamism across the European regions,” he said.In essence, Tria was saying that only when the Germans buy Italian, Spanish and French industrial products can the eurozone’s heavy industries and tech companies generate enough profits to reinvest in their businesses and become more productive.Tria is not the only one playing the blame game. Conte has pointed to global trade tensions and their negative trickle-down effects on Italy’s exports as causing the country’s first recession since 2013. He said even “the most naive analysts” were aware of the dampening effects on exports of the tariff dispute between Washington and Beijing.Salvini went as far as to blame the bridge collapse in Genoa on the EU’s tough line on the budget, saying: “Spending that saves lives, jobs and the right to health must not be part of rigid calculations and of rules imposed by Europe.”Codogno said there were probably enough funds in the public investment budget to improve infrastructure without a further boost.“Italy has other issues than just the budget. A public procurement code brought in by the previous government – one that is designed to tackle corruption – has actually made public officials more cautious. It means that funds already allocated are not being spent.”There was a time when the Italian coalition partners heaped most opprobrium on the euro, echoing comments by Tria that Italy had battled vainly against a high exchange rate. But Italian wealth is held in euros, and that complaint appears to have evaporated under pressure from Europe’s most rapidly ageing voting population.What remains is the idea that Europe should be doing more for the Italian economy through its various investment programmes and a greater sharing of eurozone debts. There is sympathy in some European capitals for Rome’s agenda, but not in Paris or Berlin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89e8f6e39cc63b4aa7718477a583a42747f921b2/0_13_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83dabaeed0885b10e4f835a75f58252d","title":"nissan x trail uk brexit","story":"Carmaker taciturn on reports about Sunderland plant, as fears grow over Brexit impactNissan has refused to comment on reports that it is abandoning plans to build a new model of one of its flagship vehicles at its Sunderland plant.The Japanese car manufacturer said in 2016 it would be building the new version of the X-Trail SUV at the factory along with its next-generation Qashqai, prompting claims that Nissan and the government had struck a “sweetheart deal” to protect the company from any post-Brexit EU tariff wall.A Nissan spokeswoman said: “We do not comment on rumour and speculation.” However, she would not be drawn on the accuracy of reports on Sky News that the Japanese firm will announce plans to move production elsewhere. The X-Trail is currently produced solely in Japan.Bridget Phillipson, the Labour MP for Houghton and Sunderland South, said: “If confirmed, this would represent deeply troubling news for the north-east economy. So many jobs and livelihoods depend on Nissan’s success.”The company’s reported decision is likely to raise new concerns about the economic impact of Brexit, particularly for deprived parts of the country – less than eight weeks before the UK is due to leave the European Union – with some global companies appearing reluctant to make further investment.Nissan employs about 6,700 staff at the Sunderland plant, the company’s biggest European plant, producing some 2,000 cars a day. It has been active since 1986 and is Britain’s largest car factory, making it one of the region’s key employers. However, since the plans were reportedly linked to greater investment, the move is not expected to significantly impact jobs.Carlos Ghosn, the company’s former chairman, previously said Nissan would not make further investments when it did not know what Britain’s future trading arrangements would be, and that if leaving the EU significantly raised costs and trade barriers, Nissan would consider reducing its British operations.Sunderland voted overwhelmingly to leave the European Union in 2016. In October, the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage said Nissan was “not going anywhere”, after the car manufacturer said a hard Brexit could have serious implications for the site.Nissan is part-owned by French manufacturer Renault, which had led to concerns that production could be moved to France to avoid tariffs that might be introduced on exports to the EU if the UK leaves the single market without a deal.Steve Turner, Unite’s assistant general secretary for manufacturing, said: “It is beyond disappointing that our members are hearing about their futures and the holding-back of planned investments in Sunderland through media reports and not directly from the company.“These rumours are disturbing and will cause the workforce to have a very anxious weekend, even though production of the X-Trail would have necessitated additional jobs on site.“We are working hard to establish the truth behind current speculation and will be meeting with the company on Monday morning to establish both the facts and how such news has been released without a discussion with the union.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/077480a68170b50a6c38ad905e0bdc4d470265aa/0_33_4335_2602/master/4335.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bb8da0f071f7722a0388ea8320dccb1","title":"ruth langsford eamonn holmes happy marriage separate tvs","story":"Unlike This Morning’s husband-and-wife presenters, I love watching TV with my partnerAt a party last week, I was told that my viewing habits are not in keeping with those of my peer group. I was talking about watching programmes when they are on, according to the TV guide, using an actual television, which sits in the corner of my living room, and my friends seemed confused by this.I started to wonder if I was doing it wrong. I had a sudden realisation that perhaps, with this cold snap and self-imposed January puritanism and all the rest of it, I might have been watching more than normal, a fact confirmed when I started to reel off the afternoon’s quiz shows, in scheduled order, Tipping Point first.Almost everyone I know uses their laptop instead and they watch what they want, when they want to. Sadly for them, this means they lack a good working knowledge of Tipping Point’s intricate lingo.Our viewing habits are increasingly fractured, but they still say something about who we are, unless, of course, you’re the kind of person who thinks television is a waste of time and that is perfectly fine, if incorrect.Ruth Langsford, who is one of the hosts of ITV’s This Morning with her husband, Eamonn Holmes, told the Radio Times last week that the couple rarely, if ever, watch television together. They have separate rooms for viewing. He likes documentaries and she likes soaps –and he likes to talk when shows are on: “He wants to discuss everything and will keep pausing the programme,” she said.Holmes fired back an explanation of his own. “The thing is, if I don’t do that and we’re watching something like Killing Eve, at the end Ruth will just say, ‘Well, I didn’t understand that.’” They have been married for more than 20 years and, reading that, I felt as if I had known them for the duration of it.It’s so easy these days to devise your own schedule that it’s no wonder people do so. But I love watching television in company. My girlfriend is a chatterer, like Holmes, and yes, sometimes, that does call for a pointed pause while she asks: “Why is he doing that?”, when the answer is always: “I think they’re going to tell us”, but, still, it’s much nicer to talk about something you’ve seen together than to finish a series by yourself.Alone, we are all watching Tipping Point in the middle of the afternoon together, the possibilities are endless.Until last week, it was difficult to choose what the best thing about Richard E Grant’s first Oscar nomination was, at the age of 61, because so much about it was lovely. He is clearly thrilled, for a start, which makes a refreshing change from the usual I’m-just-happy-to-be-here faux humility. He’s up for best supporting actor for the excellent Can You Ever Forgive Me? and, along with Melissa McCarthy, is drawing more attention to a film that genuinely deserves it. In it, Grant once again shows off his uncanny ability to act drunk, despite being famously allergic to alcohol and teetotal, which, given that Withnail and I made his name, is a bit like finding out that John Wayne couldn’t ride.But then the best thing about it made itself plain. Grant posted a picture of himself outside the gates of Barbra Streisand’s house in California, alongside a letter he had written to her when he was 14. “I read in the paper that you were feeling very tired and pressurised by your fame and failed romance with Mr Ryan O’Neal,” he wrote, wonderfully. “I would like to offer you a two-week holiday, or longer, at our house...” After 47 years, Streisand replied, congratulating him on the Oscar nod. “Look at u now,” she said, though whether she takes him up on the holiday may well remain behind closed channelsof communication.I loved this story, for its fairytale charm (surely it can be beefed up into a screenplay or a BBC2 special: When Barbra Met Richard) and because Grant is so proud to be a fan, even now. He cried when his daughter told him Streisand had replied. It’s all so delightfully uncynical and truly heartwarming.Astudy by the charity Youth Music has suggested that music has a considerable role to play in children’s wellbeing. The survey of seven- to 17-year-olds shows music tops the list of hobbies, equal to gaming and ahead of sport, drama and dance. For those saddened by the public-school-ification of pop, there were intriguing findings on students from lower income backgrounds, who are less likely to see live music but significantly more likely to describe themselves as musical, and take part in musical activities. (Though the Musicians’ Union says they are much less likely to have access to formal training.)The Youth Music study also listed the three most popular acts: Little Mix, Stormzy and Ed Sheeran. Last September, Sheeran wrote about cuts to music teaching. “I benefited hugely from state school music, as I’m sure many other musicians have,” he posted on Instagram.“If you keep cutting the funding for arts you’re going to be damaging one of Britain’s best and most lucrative exports.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dee9739f043aa79ddac7d9a1c506b0ff6ac516eb/0_57_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a40854873315e1ca626499dddbcfdcf0","title":"using the big freeze to deny climate change stupidity or cynicism","story":"The reaction to the polar vortex reminds us it is important to have a citizenry who can distinguish between scientific fact and fictionThe winters of the early 1970s were very cold and snowy in the northeastern United States where I grew up – as elsewhere around the US and Europe. I remember snowfalls that came up to my chin (though, of course, I was only a few feet tall back then). We now call those “old-fashioned winters”, precisely because they have grown so rare as a consequence of – yes – global warming.If you’re younger than I am (I became a demi-centenarian three years ago), those winters are likely to be outside the range of your experience. And so it may seem plausible to you that cold snaps, that in reality simply reflect the sort of weather that was commonplace just decades ago, might constitute “record” or “unprecedented” cold.Neglect, for the moment, that “global waming” isn’t a thing and that, as we have come to expect, almost none of the claims in Trump’s tweet are true – the coldest wind-chill temperatures recorded for the midwest are close to minus 70F (minus 57C), and for the US overall below minus 100F (minus 73C). Might he have a point?For example, if we were seeing more frequent cold extremes, would this contradict the theory of human-caused global warming? No. Scientists increasingly think that climate change may cause a more frequent breakdown of the “polar vortex” of the northern hemisphere (the tight band of winds in the upper atmosphere that, typically, confine the cold North Pole air masses to the Arctic, loosely associated with the jet stream). The amplified warming of the Arctic caused by the melting of sea ice reduces the temperature contrast between the equator and pole. It is that contrast that maintains the polar vortex and jet stream. As the vortex breaks down, the jet stream slows and exhibits broader north-south wiggles, just as a river crossing almost level territory exhibits broad meanders as it snakes its way to the coastline.That makes it easier for pieces of the cold Arctic air masses to break off and wobble down into middle-latitude continental regions such as North America and Europe, precisely what happened with the recent cold air outbreak in the US. But let’s return to the other first question: are we seeing an increase in record cold? So far, in the first month of 2019, two all-time cold records were set – in towns in Illinois. Meanwhile, there have been 35 all-time records for heat (many of them set in the extreme summer heatwave that is baking Australia and scorching cities such as Adelaide). That’s a ratio of 18 hot records to each cold record.In the absence of planetary warming, that ratio should be one to one. Maybe, you say, it’s a fluke. After all, it’s only one month of data. But the ratio of warm to cold records is roughly two to one for the past decade. We can now go a step further, “attributing” record warm spells to global warming by employing climate models to quantify the incidence of extreme events, both with and without the effect of human-caused greenhouse warming. The extreme European heatwave last summer was, according to one such estimate, made twice as likely by human-caused climate change. (In reality, this is probably an underestimate because the models do not capture some of the effects of a slowing jet stream analysed in some of my own recent research). So we’re seeing a trend toward more record heat, not record cold. And, even if we were seeing an increase in cold winter outbreaks in certain parts of the US and Europe, it wouldn’t necessarily contradict the case for climate change – it might even be symptomatic of it, associated with the breakdown in the polar vortex.Let us return to Trump’s tweet, for it does not stand in isolation. It is part of a several-years-old pattern of denying the basic scientific evidence for human-caused climate change. Trump is plainly not the “genius” he has claimed to be, but he knows that climate change is real. We know this because he cited it as a reason to be granted a special dispensation to build a wall – a wall to protect his golf course in Ireland from the damaging effects of a rise in sea level.So, if it’s not due to ignorance, what is responsible for Trump’s continued climate-change denial? Could it be the same thing responsible for him outsourcing his energy and environmental policy to fossil fuel interests? Could it have something to do with Russian influence that some have suggested helped get him elected?We may have some answers to these questions when special counsel Robert Mueller completes his investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election.In any case, Trump’s repeated dismissive comments about human-caused climate change are an example of what I have referred to as “the weaponisation of ignorance”. The ignorance in this case isn’t Trump’s. He appears to know better. It’s the electorate’s.Only with an ill-informed citizenry could you plausibly dismiss the consensus of the world’s scientists based upon a single cold spell. Trump and, more to the point, the fossil fuel interests whose bidding he is doing have weaponised the public’s poor understanding of science.The great Carl Sagan presaged this very scenario in his classic work The Demon-Haunted World. Sagan feared a descent into ignorance and expressed his apprehension of a future in which “no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues”.He worried about the emergence of a citizenry that is unable to differentiate between “what feels good and what’s true” and is therefore vulnerable to pseudo science and anti-science.With the election of Donald Trump, have we finally arrived in the future that Sagan so feared? And if so, is there any escape from it? That remains to be seen.• Michael E Mann is distinguished professor of atmospheric science and director of the Earth System Science Center at Penn State University.

But the extremes are consistent with theories about how increasing human emissions change major weather systems.As carbon builds in the atmosphere, the planet warms and the ice caps melt, so the temperature gradient between the equator and the poles flattens out. Although the science is not yet conclusive, many scientists believe this is weakening the jet streams, which are important drivers of weather systems.During the summer, this means high-pressure fronts linger for longer causing heatwaves such as those in parts of the northern hemisphere last May, June and July, and in the southern hemisphere over the past two months. During the northern winter, it loosens the polar vortex, which lets the warmer southern air in, causing the freakishly high Arctic temperatures recorded last winter, and allows the frozen air out, which is being seen in the US. This also manifested itself last year in Europe as “the Beast from the East”.Despite seasonal ups and downs, the overwhelming global trend is towards higher temperatures. Last month, the Copernicus Climate Change Service, the European institute that gathers satellite data, was the latest institution to confirm the past four years have been the warmest recorded. “Dramatic climatic events like the warm and dry summer in large parts of Europe or the increasing temperature around the Arctic regions are alarming signs to all of us,” said Jean-Noël Thépaut, the head of Copernicus Climate Change Service. “Only by combining our efforts, can we make a difference and preserve our planet for future generations.”In October, the United Nation’s top climate science body – the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – warned that North America and Australia were among the areas likely to feel the impact of significant rises in extreme heat.Bob Ward of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, said: “It is very important to note that, despite the cold weather, there is a very clear trend in the United States and Canada of winters becoming warmer, as they are around the world. It is a reminder that part of the challenge of climate change is that many of the impacts may be unexpected and unprecedented.“Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are now higher than they have been on Earth for millions of years. Modern humans have only been around for about 200,000 years, so we have no historical or even evolutionary experience of the climate that we are creating.”“That is why nobody can claim with confidence that we will be able to cope with all the impacts that everyone can see are developing around the world, including more extreme droughts, heavy rainfall, and heatwaves, disappearing glaciers and ice caps, rising sea levels and acidifying oceans.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31e68f03515086516f89a6359993166a74840522/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=525b892c59ca667ba6d8fd6e5efb7579","title":"christian dior designer of dreams victoria albert museum review","story":"V\u0026ampA, LondonA celebration of the Paris fashion house has plenty of gorgeous frocks on display but fails to pin down its founder’s legacyWhen Diana Vreeland arrived in Paris from the US in 1946, she could scarcely believe her eyes. Oh, my dears! The bread was made with potato flour, even the young looked as if they hadn’t seen daylight in years, and absolutely everyone was wearing wooden shoes. Vreeland, who would go on to edit American Vogue, is famous for her description of the bikini as “the most important thing since the atom bomb”, a typically immoderate pronouncement of the same year. By the time she came to compile her memoirs four decades later, however, she’d somewhat revised this opinion. “I suppose bikinis started during the war,” she wrote. “They probably just tore bedsheets apart and made them.”Overstatement was Vreeland’s stock-in-trade. So, too, was a certain kind of shudder. Nevertheless, it’s all but impossible to understand the impact of Christian Dior’s New Look, launched by the designer on an unsuspecting world in 1947, without considering the privations of the war. For years, women had had to make do, going without not only new clothes but nylons and lipstick as well: a miserable drabness that would continue long after the final all-clear sounded (in Britain, clothes rationing didn’t end until 1949). Nothing could be wasted, not even one’s blackout curtains. Dior, though, was having none of this, for which reason one can only imagine how women must have felt on catching sight of his luxuriant designs on some newsreel. Those huge skirts! They were gorgeous. But perhaps a greater part of the excitement they stirred came from the sense that they were also highly transgressive.The V\u0026ampA’s exhibition Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams, a reimagined version of a show staged by the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris, comes with several striking omissions. The need to maintain the support of LVMH, the conglomerate that now owns the house, is presumably behind its failure to explain, for instance, the precise nature of the “controversy” that saw John Galliano leave the label in 2011 (he was dismissed following an antisemitic outburst). But among the strangest is surely this: its failure to set the scene. The exhibition opens with a single design, Dior’s Bar Suit from 1947: an ivory shantung jacket and a black wool skirt that has come to stand as an emblem of the New Look. Gaze at that nipped-in waist, and gasp! But though the date is carefully noted, we’re told almost nothing about the times.Looking around, I found a photograph of Dior trying hard to ignore a demonstration held by women in Chicago later that year. “We abhor dresses to the floor!” announce their placards. Were they protesting against his wastefulness? Or were they anxious about what these darned impractical gowns symbolised? (Some believed the New Look was another way of pushing women back into the home following a war that had, for all its ills, proved to be something of a liberation.) No explanation is forthcoming. The show, staged in the museum’s spacious new Sainsbury Gallery, exists in a bubble: we hear of many triumphs but never of any failures or even missteps, something that strikes me as a neglect of duty on the V\u0026ampA’s part. If you’re going to say that fashion is art, then it must be as open to interpretation and criticism as any other form it cannot come only with blandishments and air kisses.Dior was born in Normandy in 1905, the son of a wealthy industrialist it was his parents who bankrolled his first venture, a Paris gallery, even if they would not allow him to put the family name above the door. In 1931, however, his mother died and his father lost all his money, at which point the feeling that Christian’s artistic leanings were not quite the thing (they’d hoped for a diplomat) ceased to matter. Having retrained as a fashion illustrator, he worked as a designer, first for Robert Piguet and then for Lucien Lelong. Finally, in 1946, he established his own house at 30 Avenue Montaigne, with three ateliers and a staff of 85. Ten years later, he had 28 ateliers and 1,000 staff, not to mention a perfume collection and a pale-faced assistant who went by the name of Yves St Laurent.The V\u0026ampA’s show is nothing if not replete: you’ve never seen so much silk satin, so many boned bodices and knife-edge pleats. Dior was a consummate professional and he could do it all (though, please, don’t come expecting trousers): the neatest suit (try the one of grey wool worn by Olivia de Havilland when she married in 1955) the most enviable black dress (oh, to own a frock as immaculate as the Nonette from 1950, with its priestly white cotton pique bib) an adorable evening gown (the Sonnet dress of 1952, in plum silk with bows at exactly the spot – the hips – where a man might place his hands and whirl you round). You want flowers? Here they are in abundance on a print used for a ready-to-wear frock from 1956, and yet they do not look vulgar even after too much Pol Roger, you’d never mistake it for a sofa. (This dress, incidentally, is in a display whose theme is gardens, where you will also find, on the ceiling, a wonderfully delicate installation of paper flowers by the design studio Wanda Barcelona.)But skill and good taste do not amount to genius, and Dior is no Balenciaga. Whisper it, but there were moments when, even as I lusted over this pocket and that buttonhole, I felt just a tiny bit bored. What marks him out? In the gallery dedicated to designers who have run the house since his death in 1957, I was struck by the smooth brilliance of Marc Bohan, who led the label with quiet aplomb from 1961 until 1989 only a suggestion of the 60s – in essence, a move away from the waist – told you that his early work was not by Dior himself. On the other hand, Galliano’s beautiful, lunatic gowns stand out like tiaras at a pyjama party. In a room devoted to “travel”, I was transfixed by a dress of turquoise python inspired by the Egyptian god Anubis, to be worn with – yes – a dog’s head, created by the milliner Stephen Jones. Dior would have loathed it, but since there are times when one longs for fashion to stop taking itself so very seriously, I was happy to find that it made me laugh out loud.•Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams is at V\u0026ampA, London, until 14 July"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37b93d4a63608339f6db4c124bbfbec89f632e62/0_34_3504_2103/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c85748e3a6afd92c44e387696ba57f2a","title":"burning review lee chang dong steven yeun","story":"Lee Chang-dong’s elegant mystery is full of pleasingly unsettling moments“I want to just vanish, like I never existed.” It’s a seemingly flippant, throwaway comment from Hae-mi (Jeon Jong-seo).

It’s never entirely clear to what extent her actions are calculated or driven by impulsive whims.But if Jong-su is already unsettled by Hae-mi, he is completely out of his depth when she introduces him to her urbane and wealthy playboy friend, Ben. Steven Yeun’s smiling snake performance in the role is one of the film’s more perturbing pleasures. Wrapped in immaculately tailored irony and privilege, Yeun makes everything that his character says, even as benign a phrase as “What fun!”, seem inherently untrustworthy. There’s something disquieting in his presence, as there is in the restrained ambiguity of the storytelling – we are encouraged to both construct our own conclusions and to dismantle them at the same time. It’s chilling and brilliant."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6eea223d517d633f3aa64d2fdbf8b20f9b594fb5/0_336_7987_4792/master/7987.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7af61f9ba12487c5c8cb8ffdc8583a8","title":"regina king if beale street could talk interview","story":"The actor broke through with films like Boyz n the Hood and Jerry Maguire, but with Oscar buzz around her new movie, she’s really hitting her strideIn all the heat and light of prediction surrounding this year’s Oscar shortlists, one category appears easier to call than most. Regina King has long been an odds-on favourite as best supporting actress for her role in the adaptation of James Baldwin’s novel If Beale Street Could Talk. At 48, King is having something of a repetitive red carpet moment. Of the dozen nominations she has received for her performance from different award ceremonies, she has so far come out on top in 11, including the Golden Globes. When I spoke to her on the phone in Los Angeles, she was inevitably in the midst of hair and makeup for another round of accolades that evening. “I have never really been a part of this thing called awards season,” she said, with a low laugh. “It’s like a new full-time job. I’m not complaining – just stating!”The proper recognition of King’s screen presence is stupidly overdue. Since her movie debut in John Singleton’s Boyz n the Hood she has made a speciality of providing the emotional scaffolding of numerous films and TV series, the superstructure on which other, flashier talents can rely. The pattern was set in Jerry Maguire, where King played the kickass wife of a self-destructive American football star, and delivered a true beating heart to set against the hyperactive bromance between Cuba Gooding Jr and Tom Cruise. She has in the past decade graduated to pivotal roles in the garlanded TV series American Crime, and as the Emmy award-winning star in last year’s Seven Seconds in which she played, with ravaged grace, a mother fighting for Black Lives Matter justice for a son killed by a white police officer in a car accident.All of that intensity is brought to bear in If Beale Street Could Talk, the film that director Barry Jenkins chose to follow the triumph of Moonlight. From the moment we are introduced to King in the movie – in the kitchen of a 1970s Harlem apartment while her young daughter prepares to break the news that she is expecting the baby of her boyfriend, who is wrongfully in prison – we know that we are in the safest of hands. King locates every quiet nuance of human drama in those pregnant pauses. Her eventual response, shaping the news within the family, is not only one of the most beautifully constructed scenes among this year’s Oscar films but also a kind of exemplar of compassionate motherhood. King’s performance is all about love.She was contacted about the role while she was directing an episode of the TV comedy This Is Us, one of several recent ventures behind the camera. “I opened the email and read James Baldwin, Barry Jenkins,” she recalls. “So it didn’t take much twisting my arm. It was a ‘you had me at hello’ moment.”As soon as she read Jenkins’s script and Baldwin’s book, she knew exactly the woman she was playing. It was her grandmother, with bits of her mother and auntie thrown in.“My grandmother was similar to this character in that she was the type of human being that whenever you were around her you felt better about the situation you were in.”In King’s other critical moment in the film she has gone to Puerto Rico to confront her son-in-law’s absconded accuser. The camera dwells on her trying to steel herself for the encounter in a hotel room, putting on and taking off a bobbed wig. In Baldwin’s book the character toys with a shawl, to see if it lends her authority, but the hairpiece felt right to King. “It was more reflective of the women of that era,” she says. “My grandmother certainly had one wig that she wore when she went to handle business and another if she was going out for dinner. And sometimes she just wore her own hair. They were different aspects of character. It’s something like what we do as actors, I guess.”King was at college studying communications when she got her first TV role in the long-running sitcom 227. She learned alongside the black American actor Marla Gibbs, now 87. Gibbs was one of the people King had in mind when she wrote, in 2010, an outraged open letter to the organisers of the Emmy awards, which detonated the debate about the ongoing “whiteness” of such ceremonies. The immediate occasion was a wrongly captioned photograph that confused her with Rutina Wesley, another actor who attended that year’s ceremony, but the statistics she discovered came as a shock even to her. Of more than 1,000 nominations in four main categories in the history of the awards, only 53 had gone to non-white actors. “I try hard in my daily life not to engage in uncomfortable situations regarding race,” she wrote. “But sometimes it’s very difficult to find other reasons that better explain why certain events play out the way they do.”Looking back on that now she suggests it was written mostly out of accumulated frustration. “Partly just that sense: look, I’m many things in addition to being black.”Does it feel that things have changed since then?“Well I guess, but slowly. It will be a significant change when we see black women in roles more often not just because they are black. I wouldn’t put a time frame on that. Here we are with a screen adaptation of a story written 45 years ago, and in important aspects not much has changed. I am trying to remain optimistic that I will witness it in my lifetime.”The story at the heart of this film reflects the continuing tragedy of young black men incarcerated through deliberative miscarriages of justice.“So often with systemic racism, you have these stereotypes,” King says. “People hear someone has been wrongfully arrested and they still think he must have been looking for it, or he wasn’t educated, or he’s from a problem family. This young man in the film comes from love, as many men in this position do.”When she made Seven Seconds, King spoke of the way she channelled fears she had felt for her own teenage son. I ask if those fears have been emphasised with the current political moment.“I never thought that someone like Donald Trump could become president,” she says. “But while the country feels very ided right now I also think there are a lot of Americans who have come together, who might not have come together otherwise. You know, you have to try to find the beauty in the room.” Opposition helps to concentrate creativity, she suggests. “But it’s one thing talking around your own kitchen table. Real change won’t happen until you get into conversations around other tables.”She hopes she can use the platform she has to amplify those conversations. In her Golden Globes acceptance speech she addressed that other inequality – of women behind the camera – and pledged to try to work only on projects with a 5050 gender split.“It is still the fact that every time a woman is behind the camera she has so much more to lose than a male director,” King says. “If she makes a mistake, you still hear ‘Oh yeah, we hired a woman before and it didn’t work out’.”She hopes she can begin to redress that balance. She is currently developing a film, a comedy with her sister, that she plans to be her feature debut as a director.Her mother must take enormous pride, I suggest.“We have some really great conversations,” she says. “The conversations between a mother and daughter become much deeper once that daughter becomes a mother, I think.” Her mother does, inevitably, also worry that she never takes any time off. But she’s not about to stop – after the awards are done, she has a starring role in a new HBO series based on Alan Moore’s Watchmen, as well as her own film project. She is in her element.“Honestly, I was never an actress because I wanted to win awards,” she says. “Or ever looking to be the first black woman to win this or that. I just love the electricity when a performance feels special. Not every performance feels like that, but I have been lucky to have a few. You will always find energy for that.”We talk a little about the difficulties of scheduling movies with longer format TV series, how to juggle being an actor and a director. She laughs. “It can be hard,” she says. “But to be honest, those are champagne problems.”If Beale Street Could Talk is in cinemas on 8 February"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000.

Witness that display in midweek when the Argentinian had barely mustered a touch as Chelsea, collectively and ignominiously, subsided at Bournemouth. Or indeed the head coach’s post-match observations on the south coast that the striker was “not in good shape”. This team needed the loanee from Juventus, hardly an ideal buy at 31, to hit the ground running, adapting instantly in alien surroundings. He had to be the answer.In that context, this was an afternoon of promise. It is dangerous to draw too many conclusions from a straightforward dismissal of Huddersfield Town, the ision’s whipping boys and a side who already seem resigned to a return to the Championship, but Sarri and Chelsea, so shocked by that humiliation at the Vitality Stadium, had needed some hope on which to cling. Higuaín, as much with his movement and linkup play with Eden Hazard as the sumptuous finish he summoned midway through the second half, duly provided plenty.The pedigree clearly remains. His experiences at Milan over the first half of the season have not drummed the quality out of him. The shot arced, right-footed and first-time, over Jonas Lössl from distance demonstrated as much, the kind of instinctive brilliance Chelsea have missed of late. Their No 9s have had a habit of underwhelming in the many years since Jimmy-Floyd Hasselbaink wore the shirt but Higuaín, a Sarri loyalist, has now swollen his goal tally to 38 in 37 league games under the Italian, in Serie A and Premier League.Just as encouraging had been the clever dart into space behind Terence Kongolo and away from Christopher Schindler to reach N’Golo Kanté’s cute pass, clipped between defenders just after the quarter-hour mark. It was the culmination of a period of patient buildup play down the right, a rat-a-tat of passes that dragged Huddersfield out of position. But without Higuaín making that run, then ripping his finish high inside Lössl’s near-post, it would have felt like another passage of possession for possession’s sake, lacking the punch to make a proper mark. It was the bite Chelsea have been missing. Here, albeit against generous opponents, they boasted incision with Higuaín as the focal point.The striker’s combinations with Hazard, in particular, will have left Sarri drooling. When Chelsea were fizzing their passes at their most progressive, in the opening quarter, the pair already appeared to have synchronised their runs and flicks.“I’m really very happy because, apart from the goals, my feeling is Gonzalo’s really suitable to play very close to Eden,” said Sarri. “On the pitch they are really very suitable to play one close to the other. For us, this is very useful for Higuaín because he will be able to score a lot of goals, but also for Eden.”It was no surprise to see Hazard back at his dazzling best. He had already scored a penalty in first-half stoppage time when, midway through the second half, he skipped on to Ross Barkley’s fine pass to round Lössl and score a 15th goal of the campaign into a gaping net. He has not scored that many at this stage of a season since moving to Chelsea in 2012.“Higuaín is a new player, but he knows what the manager wants,” said Hazard. “He is a great striker who can score a lot of goals. England is different to Italy and Spain, but he has that ability.”Chelsea face Manchester City twice, Manchester United and Tottenham before the end of this month. They may now have a combination to wound lofty opponents.Huddersfield had no answer, their own bright start amounting to Aaron Mooy’s header over the bar from Chris Löwe’s cross and fizzling out thereafter. They had cause to complain at the award of the penalty in first-half stoppage time, Elias Kachunga’s challenge on César Azpilicueta having started outside the box.“Without that penalty, it’s different,” said Kachunga. “I touched the ball first, and maybe his leg as well a little bit, but when you give a foul before he was in the box, it’s no penalty. My teammate asked the linesman and he told him: ‘No penalty.’ So I don’t know why they don’t speak on the pitch.”Yet, Adama Diakhaby’s scurries up the right flank aside, the visitors provided little clout and were undone far too easily by Chelsea’s cut and thrust. A 12th defeat in 13 games in all competitions had felt inevitable from the opening exchanges. “Chelsea were quite angry after the Bournemouth game and showed it, so it was a bad time to play them,” offered Jan Siewert. His immediate task feels far more daunting than Sarri’s very specific stated objective: to extend the bright play demonstrated by his team in the opening half hour to nearer “75 to 77 minutes”.David Luiz, stooping to reach Willian’s corner near the end, would register the fifth via a healthy deflection off Kachunga. That ensured the horror of midweek had been resolved, and fourth place reclaimed for 24 hours at least. No hour-long post-match inquests were required this time to dissect the team’s performance – but this has to become Chelsea’s norm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53f902ae0e60a4527b531db594e3a278d1cc84fe/0_266_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ff1f034071048a2ef8eb27e642d2de9","title":"emiliano sala privately funded search for plane to begin on sunday cardiff city","story":"Search will be led by marine scientist on behalf of missing Cardiff City footballer’s familyA privately funded search for the plane that was carrying the missing Cardiff City footballer Emiliano Sala will begin on Sunday.The enterprise is being led by the marine scientist David Mearns on behalf of the Sala family.Mearns said on Saturday: “Tomorrow the weather will be good. We will be able to operate tomorrow.”The plane, a Piper Malibu, registration N264DB , carrying 28-year-old Sala and pilot David Ibbotson, 59, disappeared over the Channel on 21 January after leaving Nantes, France, for Cardiff.The plane had requested to descend, then lost contact with Jersey air traffic control.Mearns, the director of Blue Water Recoveries, will lead a team of seven on the vessel FPV Morven, operating around the clock. Mearns says he has located 24 major shipwrecks during his career.The private search is being carried out in close co-ordination with the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB). Last week, British military investigators announced they would be carrying out an underwater search for the plane after the Argentinian government asked the UK to extend the hunt.Two seat cushions, which are likely to have come from the plane, were found earlier this week.There will be two vessels, including one commissioned by the AAIB, searching an area of about four square nautical miles north of Guernsey. Mearns said the AAIB had a high level of confidence that the plane could be in that zone but it could have moved once on the seabed.An official search operation was called off on 24 January as Guernsey’s harbour master, David Barker, said the chances of survival after such a long period were extremely remote. The decision sparked an outcry from Sala’s family and several Argentinian footballers including Lionel Messi.Cardiff had signed the Argentinian striker for a club record of £15m and he was due to start training last month.

Amy Romer’s book The Dark Figure* reveals the terrifying ordinariness of the sites of their captivityIn 2013, a 22-year-old Hungarian woman responded to an online ad for a babysitting job in London and, after a telephone interview, was offered the post. When she arrived in Budapest to travel to London, she was met by three men who confiscated her mobile, drove her to Slovakia and forced her on to a coach bound for Manchester.There was no babysitting job. Instead, the woman had been “bought” for £3,500 by a Pakistani man and was told to prepare for marriage. After being held captive at various Manchester addresses, she finally alerted the police from a house in Cunliffe Street, Chorley, where she was rescued and later repatriated home.There is nothing to indicate “slavery next door” about Cunliffe Street, a nondescript terrace of brick houses. And that’s exactly what Amy Romer, a 30-year-old photographer originally from Exeter, set out to show in her book The Dark Figure*, which juxtaposes images of seemingly innocuous, everyday British locations – country lane, suburban cul-de-sac, muddy farm – with descriptions of the crimes of modern-day slavery that have taken place there. The result is a quietly powerful challenge to how we identify slavery as a society – do we still only envision shackles and transatlantic ships? – and an uncomfortable reminder of how little we know about what is happening behind our neighbours’ closed doors.For the series, Romer trawled news and police reports for modern slavery crimes, and travelled around the UK to take pictures. The book includes accounts of women forced into prostitution Vietnamese men trafficked to work on cannabis farms vulnerable people rounded up and imprisoned in filthy caravans. We see the image and the words, but the brain struggles to match the ordinariness of the landscape with the horror of the account. (Romer says Chloe Dewe Mathews’s stark portraits of the locations where soldiers were executed for cowardice in the first world war were an inspiration.)Even without the captions, Romer’s photographs evoke a haunting stillness. Some of the landscapes include main thoroughfares and popular byways, but nearly all the images are void of people in every shot, it feels as if we are peering into a ghost town, waiting for the protagonists – or the action – to arrive.Though the term “slavery next door” may sound exaggerated, one of the Plymouth addresses Romer photographed happened to be just one street over from a flat she lived in and in the book’s foreword, Lancashire-born social justice educator Pete Brook writes that the Chorley house to which the Hungarian woman was trafficked was “adjacent to cafes in which I’ve sat and pubs in which I’ve drunk”.“It really homes in on the idea that slavery is happening on our doorstep,” says Romer.The Dark Figure* began as Romer’s third-year project at university but today the Home Office, local councils and British police use it as a training resource to help identify and raise awareness about modern-day slavery in its various forms. “The police actually uploaded a few of my photos on all their screen savers,” says Romer, “so whenever they log into their computers, they see my images. It’s kind of crazy but really cool.”The Dark Figure* by Amy Romer is published later this month by Another Place, £16November 2013politan police from the Human Trafficking Unit arrested 73-year-old Aravindan Balakrishnan and his wife, 67-year-old Chanda Pattni, at their residential address in Brixton. They were investigated for slavery and domestic servitude.Three women had escaped from the same property a month earlier, having been held against their will for more than 30 years. Aishah Wahab, a 69-year-old Malaysian woman, and Josephine Herivel, a 57-year-old Irishwoman, met Balakrishnan, known as Comrade Bala, in London through a shared political ideology. He was the former Maoist leader of the Workers’ Institute of Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought. Rosie Davies, a 30-year-old British woman, had spent her whole life in servitude under Balakrishnan.The women were not physically restrained, but held by subjection to brainwashing, emotional abuse and physical abuse. Police were tipped off from a charity supporting victims of forced marriage, after receiving a phone call from the women, who had been watching the ITV documentary Forced to Marry.December 2015Balakrishnan was convicted of child cruelty, false imprisonment, four counts of rape, six counts of indecent assault and two counts of assault. Chanda Pattni, had been released without charge in 2014.Balakrishnan was sentenced to 23 years in prison in January 2016.May 2008The discovery of the remains of a body in a garden shed near Bamfurlong Lane triggered a year-long investigation, including a five-month surveillance operation in 2010 of the Connors family’s traveller sites.The body was identified as that of Christopher Nicholls, who had been working for the Connors for three years and had been reported missing by his parents in 2005. He had been struck by a car in 2004.March 2011Gloucestershire Police carried out warrants at three properties in Gloucestershire, Derbyshire and Leicestershire. Nineteen vulnerable people were found living in squalid conditions at Beggers Roost caravan park in Cheltenham, subject to assault, theft of benefits and exploitation.Survivor Mark Ovenden reported that he was heading to his local soup kitchen in Bournemouth when a white van pulled over ahead of him. The driver approached him and offered him a job near Leighton Buzzard in Bedfordshire. He was taken to Beggers Roost and subjected to modern slavery for the following two years.Some of the rescued men had been kept at the Connors property for as long as 30 years and, having been institutionalised, did not recognise themselves as victims.Five members of the Connors family were charged with offences involving the serious mistreatment of people who, because of their personal circumstances, had little option but to remain with the family. All five were found guilty of conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour between April 2010 and March 2011 and are facing a maximum sentence of 14 years.November 2014Police arrested 53-year-old Jurate Grigelyte at her property in Easton, Bristol, after a school raised concerns about the welfare of a six-year-old boy, who was discovered to be the son of a victim of human trafficking and forced labour, working under Grigelyte.Grigelyte trafficked Lithuanian nationals to the UK with the promise of good employment and accommodation, but instead would lock victims inside cramped, squalid properties, only allowing them to enter and leave through a window.The victims, many of whom spoke little to no English, worked for Grigelyte’s charity bag business collecting donations and sorting through clothing. They were transported around the south-west in vans with no seats or windows. A typical working day lasted from 5am to 6pm. Grigelyte promised workers £25 per day, but would deduct money for rent, travel and various fines, often leaving workers debt-bonded, with no money for food.Debt bondage is the world’s most widespread form of slavery. A person becomes a bonded labourer when their labour is demanded as a means of repayment for a loan. The victim is then tricked or trapped into working for very little or no pay, to repay debts their employer says they owe. Often, the victim’s identification is taken and bank cards are controlled, limiting any hope of freedom.June 2015Grigelyte was sentenced to three years in prison after admitting to 10 charges of facilitating entry into the UK with a view to exploiting labour, 10 charges of human trafficking and one count of forced labour.February 2016A gang of three brothers, their uncle and two women were found guilty of 55 serious offences, some of which had lain undetected for almost 20 years. Fifteen vulnerable girls, one as young as 11, were subjected to acts of sexual violence between 1987 and 2003 including rape, forced prostitution, indecent assault and false imprisonment.Karen MacGregor was sentenced to 13 years for conspiracy to procure a child for prostitution, false imprisonment, and conspiracy to rape. MacGregor was a high-profile campaigner on behalf of abused children. In 2013, she founded KinKids, a community support group for kinship carers. MacGregor boasted that KinKids had helped families affected by the scandal. She had persuaded Rotherham council, local Labour MP John Healey and other local organisations to support KinKids in the wake of heightened investigation into cases of child abuse in Rotherham.She had been luring vulnerable girls to her home in Walker Street, which was described by one of the victims as akin to the Hansel and Gretel fairytale. There, she would groom them before pimping them out to earn their keep.One of her victims described how MacGregor was a motherly figure, who had taken her under her wing at a difficult time in her life and treated her like a daughter. Another victim recalled how within days of arriving, MacGregor had plied her with vodka to the point of unconsciousness and she had woken up to find herself being sexually assaulted.Since 2016, 33 men and one woman in this case have been imprisoned for rape, false imprisonment, sexual intercourse with a girl under 13, and indecent assault, for a total of 445 years and three months.2017The conduct of more than 60 officers from South Yorkshire police who had dealt with the victims across the 20-year period is now under investigation. It is the largest Independent Police Complaints Commission inquiry since the 1989 Hillsborough football disaster.An inspection of Rotherham council found it was “not fit for purpose” after an independent inquiry into its handling of child sexual exploitation reports since 1997. The inquiry identified a culture of “bullying, sexism ... and misplaced ‘political correctness’”, along with a history of covering up information and silencing whistleblowers. The leader of the council, Paul Lakin, resigned, and the government replaced its elected officers with a team of five commissioners, including one tasked specifically with looking at children’s services.July 2013The authorities were alerted when a 20-year-old male trafficking victim contacted a charity, revealing he had been the victim of offences committed in 2011. More victims soon came forward, and others were identified. Convictions were made against Hungarian traffickers Janos Orsos and Ferenc Illes, who had been providing workers to Kozee Sleep, a bed factory that supplied retailers including John Lewis, Dunelm and Next.Company owner Mohammed Rafiq and two of his employees were charged with conspiracy to facilitate travel within the UK for exploitation. Rafiq was the first owner of a UK company to be charged with human trafficking offences.Workers supplied to Kozee Sleep were forced to live with up to 42 men in a two-bedroom house on Batley Field Hill, and were found to be surviving on scraps of food. The men would work for up to 20 hours a day and were paid as little as £10 a week.May 2014Janos Orsos pleaded guilty to conspiracy to traffic a person into the UK for exploitation, blackmail and converting criminal property. He was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. Ferenc Illes pleaded guilty to conspiracy to traffic a person within the UK for exploitation. He was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment.January 2016Mohammed Rafiq was found guilty of conspiracy to traffic and was sentenced to two years and three months in prison. He pleaded not guilty.2013A young Hungarian woman was captured and trafficked to the UK after responding to an advert for a babysitting job. She was sold to a Pakistani man for £3,500, and held at various addresses in Gorton, Longsight and Levenshulme in Manchester, before being taken to Chorley, where she was able to alert police.2015Bartolomej Sivak, the organiser of the operation, was jailed for four years for trafficking and conspiracy to facilitate a breach of immigration law.

Expecting to find a garden shed, I open the glazed door to discover an extension that feels more California than Camden. The walls are lined in pale Douglas fir, polished floors radiate heat from the underfloor heating. There is an airy bedroom, a shower and a compact kitchen, complete with flip-up dining table. Wide, sliding doors open on to the garden, adding to the air of seclusion.McCrum, an interior designer with a background in property development, designed the cabin as a “flexible, multi-tasking extension” of her two-bedroom flat, set on the ground floor of a stucco-fronted house. It is a spacious guest bedroom for friends and family who can drift easily between the flat and cabin for drinks and meals. At other times, the Camden cabin earns a tidy keep as a short-stay rental for tourists who need a central bolthole.“I’ve reached the point when I’m thinking of ways to future-proof my life. The cabin provides a sense of security,” says McCrum, who shares the flat with her partner, Leah Dunthorne – a strength and rehabilitation coach whose clients include Olympic athletes. “Looking ahead, we could get planning permission to turn the cabin into a separate flat one day. So we have options.”McCrum moved into the garden flat in 2003. Since then she’s eked out every last inch of the 680sq ft space, sneaking storage into empty corners, tucking a workstation into the steel kitchen and turning beams into bookshelves. Meanwhile, the marshalling yards and gas towers of nearby King’s Cross have been transformed into designer shops and flats and property prices have climbed. “We love our area, but we’d reached the point where we needed more space, but couldn’t afford to move around here. So we started thinking about the best ways to extend the flat.”Then, six years ago, McCrum had a phone call. It was a developer “casually” announcing his plans to build a four-storey block of flats on the vacant plot next to her building. Months of dirt, drilling and the dawn-to-dusk rumble of lorries lay in store. But instead of accepting the usual, nominal compensation, the clear-eyed McCrum sensed an opportunity.“The first thing I did was to call every expert I know,” she says. Her clients include the painter Raqib Shaw, as well as developers. A right-of-light specialist who advised on the Gherkin, a surveyor and an urban planner helped to broker a deal which included sensible compensation. More strategically, McCrum negotiated with the developer to build a structural wall, perpendicular to the flat, as “an anchor” for the extension.“Without all the advice I garnered I could have ended up with nominal compensation and no wall. At least at the end of two years of disruption I had something to look forward to,” she says.“I spent a long time figuring out how to connect the extension in light, fluid ways so it could be a separate space, but also part of the flat,” says McCrum, who worked with George Bradley of BVDS Architects to design the 230sq ft addition. Clever devices include the Ikea screen that ided the garden in two. In summer, the opaque glazed doors can be left ajar, breezy linen curtains pulled across for privacy, skylights open for ventilation. McCrum’s “patient glazier” also made the new, bi-folding window which opens from the kitchen in the flat, on to the hallway: “We can chat to friends as they go into the cabin. It’s made the corridor another sociable space.”McCrum sees the cabin as a distillation of lessons learnt working with private clients and cost-saving developers. “You have to prioritise, spending money on what matters.” The interior was inspired by a holiday spent in a cabin in Joshua Tree National Park in California.“I wanted it to be the perfect place to unplug from the city. It can be a bright sunroom, at night you can gaze up at the stars from the bed,” she muses. For the walls and mini desk, she used Danish wood flooring. The floors are micro cement, brass taps gleam in the shower-room, and the kitchen is Ikea, souped up with bespoke doors and handles.The cabin is a shared project for McCrum and Dunthorne. “Leah and I are a top team. If I had another job, it would probably be a hotel inspector,” she laughs. They wrote the cabin guidebook, deliberated over the bedlinen, and together stock the fridge with snacks and locally-brewed beer. A guest book filled with enthusiastic scrawls has earned them “super-host” status on Airbnb. “We like being able to share the cabin with others but to close the front door and have the place to ourselves when we feel like it. It’s all about flexibility.”• Start by researching other extensions in your area by looking in the planning section of your local council’s website.• Find an architect who is experienced in dealing with your local council and understands your budget and ideas.• Consider natural light. We used skylights in the hallway and cabin, and reeded glass in the doors to give a bigger, brighter feel.• Maximise ceiling and door heights. It is another way of enhancing the space while creating a connection with the outside.• For compact spaces use the same flooring throughout to add cohesiveness.• Small details, such as brass handles and contrasting paints, add interest. We used an Ikea kitchen with bespoke doors.• Factor in a contingency budget. There will always be things that you haven’t budgeted for, or decide you can’t live without."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ea9dc1262ec2d41d9f4727749dc7911d7bc6af2/0_6_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7460bb381701204e1756faaa2c61fd83","title":"truth about anxiety without it we would not have hope","story":"In a world so full of uncertainty it’s little wonder so many of us feel stressed. But understanding it can change how you feelWhy do so many people these days seem so stressed out and anxious? It’s a common question, among mental health professionals and laypeople alike, but there’s a case to be made that it’s exactly upside down. How come there’s anyone who isn’t paralysed by anxiety, every hour of every day? After all, anxiety thrives in conditions of uncertainty – and nowadays the world is full of potential threats we don’t fully understand and can’t control.Most of us just have to take it on trust that planes won’t fall out of the sky, or that the milk in our fridge won’t give us listeria. Sudden, unpredictable movements in the global financial system threaten to ruin anyone’s livelihood at any moment plus now we have all the many unknowns around Brexit, an unstable liar in charge of America’s nuclear codes, and the omnipresent spectre of climate change. And as if all that weren’t enough, we spend our days marinating in an online environment designed to stoke panic about any remaining threats we might have been managing to ignore.Some definitions may help here. “Stress”, as psychologists tend to use it, means an immediate response to an external pressure, and a moderate amount can actually be a good thing: totally unstressed people never revise for exams, or meet work deadlines. In most everyday contexts, when the external pressure stops, so does the stress. Which means that by far the simplest way to deal with stress, whenever possible, is to deal with whatever’s bothering you head on – to tackle the difficult piece of work, to talk to the friend you’ve fallen out with – or, failing that, to distance or distract yourself from its source. (Persistent and chronic stress requires a different approach.)But anxiety is a particular kind of internal response to stress, and it’s frequently far more fraught. As the Australian author Sarah Wilson points out in her combined memoir and anxiety self-help manual, First, We Make the Beast Beautiful, the problem isn’t simply that there are a lot of reasons to be anxious. It’s also that, perversely, society actually rewards certain anxious behaviours, such as being frenetically busy and driven – while the “reward” for managing to free yourself from anxiety might be a reputation for laziness, complacency, or showing insufficient concern about the state of the world. Then there’s the fact that anxiety is self-reinforcing: once you’re feeling anxious, you’re primed to seek further things to feel anxious about – including, as if that vicious circle weren’t frustrating enough, your anxiety itself.To be clear, none of this is to suggest that those with a diagnosed anxiety disorder don’t have a real illness, or that medication isn’t often part of the solution: “The basic premise for an anxiety disorder, or when anxiety becomes a clinical problem, is when anxiety controls our life, rather than us being able to control our anxiety,” says Robert Edelmann, emeritus professor of forensic and clinical psychology at the University of Roehampton. But it’s also a reminder that anxiety, at root, isn’t a bizarre psychological anomaly, but a fundamental aspect of human functioning. The problem, explains the psychology writer James Clear, author of Atomic Habits, is that it’s a response evolution bequeathed us for a setting radically different from today’s.Prehistoric humans lived in an “immediate-return environment”, as other mammals still do: their moment-to-moment choices mattered because of the immediate difference they made. You saw a predator and felt a surge of anxiety, which motivated you to evade it. Or you felt dangerously hungry, and anxiety focused your attention on quickly finding food. Once the threat was resolved, the anxiety would evaporate. But modern humans live in a “delayed-return environment”. We get paid for our work at the end of the week or month we study for educational qualifications that take years. When we save money – or don’t – the consequences might not be felt for decades. And so the anxiety has nowhere to go. Instead, it accumulates and curdles.This helps explain why national and international news events, such as Brexit or the election of Donald Trump, are such a widespread source of personal anxiety, including of the clinical kind. Some people – undocumented immigrants in Trump’s America, for example – are affected in direct, unambiguous ways. But even if you ultimately won’t be, you’ll have no way of knowing that for some time. Moreover, it often feels like there’s nothing you can do in response – no equivalent to the prehistoric hunter-gatherer’s decision to start running away, or go looking for food. When no constructive action seems possible, we resort to worry and rumination, which feel somehow constructive, even though they aren’t. One reaction to the anxiety of being immersed in a 24-hour news cycle “is that people try to find out more information, because anxiety is about a lack of control and they believe that having more information will make them feel more in control”, says the American therapist Lori Gottlieb, author of the forthcoming book Maybe You Should Talk to Someone. “But it doesn’t – it just makes people feel more anxious.”This is why most non-pharmaceutical solutions to anxiety, whatever its cause, involve the limited and realistic exertion of control: figuring out what constructive actions you can take, and taking them, while refraining from struggling to control things you can’t, which is a recipe for additional anxiety. (This is the “dichotomy of control”, a distinction dating to the Stoics of ancient Greece and Rome.) You can’t personally guarantee a comfortable retirement, or long-term physical health, let alone the optimal relationship between Britain and the rest of Europe. But you can calculate what you can afford to save, and track your saving. You can exercise a few times a week, and eat more leafy greens. You can take local, concrete political action. Whether or not you end up achieving your desired goal, your anxiety levels will almost certainly fall.Finally, it’s worth recognising – as the Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard observed in The Concept of Anxiety back in 1844 – that all anxiety contains a kernel of good news: you wouldn’t feel anxious in the first place if you had no freedom, and if there weren’t at least the possibility of things turning out well. “One would have no anxiety if there were no possibility whatever,” wrote the psychologist Rollo May, paraphrasing Kierkegaard. If you knew with absolute certainty that life from now on would bring only failure and defeat, you might well be depressed, but you wouldn’t feel on edge. Anxiety is the experience of knowing that life might bring success, fulfilment and joy, combined with the fear that you don’t know how to ensure that’s what will happen. And while severe anxiety can certainly be a debilitating problem, demanding treatment, some sense of uncertainty about the future is surely part of what makes life worth living. If you ever actually managed to rule out the potential for any nasty surprises, you’d find that you’d ruled out the possibility of any good ones, too.The Antidote: Happiness for People Who Can’t Stand Positive Thinking by Oliver Burkeman is published by Vintage (£9.99).

When I started university in 2005, tuition fees were £1,250 and I was exempt because my father had moved out when I was 16 and my mother was supporting us on her single salary. When my brother, who is three years younger than me, started university the criteria had changed and his fees weren’t covered.I graduated in 2009 as the recession was kicking in but managed to get onto a two-year graduate scheme with Airbus with a salary of about £25,000.My earnings meant that I immediately had to start paying off the loan I’d received to cover living costs. I’d borrowed £18,000 and after nine years of paying £150 a month I still have about £10,000 left – when it’s paid off that extra money will be really useful.I met my wife in my second year at university and we moved in together in 2010. We lived in a series of rented flats and were saving hard for a deposit on a house. We accumulated £28,000 and I wasn’t sure it would be enough to buy anywhere, but three years ago we found a two-bedroom house for £240,000 in a scruffier part of town. It would have been a good £150,000 more where we’d previously been living. The house needed work but we did as much of it ourselves as possible, putting in a new bathroom and redecorating. Our mortgage payments are £900 a month which is about the same as we were paying in rent.Since becoming parents we’ve had to cut back on nightlife. We used to go out regularly to dinner or gigs – now we try to do it once a month when we can get a babysitter. Instead we buy a decent bottle or two of wine for the weekend and I spend free time on hobbies I can do at home. I’m learning the acoustic guitar and I like making furniture for the house. I did a council-run carpentry course a few years ago and have made a chest of drawers and a shelf unit. I’m a keen cyclist and have two bikes, once of which I built myself out of components. I use one to get to the pub and the council-run gym I’m a member of (£28 a month) and the other I ride out into the country with friends at weekends. We have a car which costs about £150 a month to run and we spend about £30 a month on public transport.We’ve had to cut back on holidays. Before our son was born we’d go abroad once a year and maybe have a weekend away. Last year we had a £600 week on Skye in an Airbnb.We’re not materialistic – we have no interest in a fancy car or luxuries. I prefer to buy my clothes second hand for environmental as well as economic reasons and most of our furniture was bought used off eBay. We’ve consciously cut back on meat for environmental reasons too and only eat it once or twice a week now. We try to buy food from independent shops but there aren’t many round where we live.I don’t agree with the view that things were easier for my parents’ generation. They may have benefited from free university tuition and affordable house prices but they never had the travel opportunities that we had. We’ve both been all over the world. However, I’m well aware that we are a lot more fortunate than many other people. My wife gets £32,000 as a teacher and shares the bills so we both earn above the average wage and have enough to save £300 a month for a holiday or in case the boiler or car packs up. I don’t know how people on below-average incomes can ever afford to buy a house."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af138ca0b5ff78cd87ce89e160d7966694b1aac2/320_0_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6968b0212d88a57e24aa87a016edb071","title":"cardi b colin kaepernick super bowl","story":"Cardi B turned down an offer to perform at the Super Bowl, she said, in order to “stand behind” the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who “stood up” for minorities by kneeling down during playings of the pre-game anthem.The Grammy-nominated rapper said she had “mixed feelings” after declining to take the stage at Super Bowl LIII in Atlanta. She said it was a hard decision since her husband, rapper Offset, loves to watch football.“My husband, he loves football,” said Cardi B, who is nominated for five Grammys, competing for both album and record of the year. “His kids play football. It’s really hard for him … he really wants to go to the Super Bowl but he can’t go to the Super Bowl because he’s got to stand for something.“You have to sacrifice that. I got to sacrifice a lot of money to perform. But there’s a man who sacrificed his job for us, so we got to stand behind him.”Kaepernick helped start a wave of player protests by kneeling during the anthem to raise awareness of police brutality, racial inequality and other social issues. His efforts ignited a lasting political firestorm eagerly fed – from the other side – by President Donald Trump.At the Super Bowl on Sunday, Maroon 5 will be joined by Big Boi of Outkast and rapper Travis Scott at halftime in the game between the Los Angeles Rams and New England Patriots. Gladys Knight will sing the national anthem. Artists including Rihanna and Pink reportedly turned down offers to perform. In a recent song, Jay-Z alluded to declining to perform at the Super Bowl. The comedian Amy Schumer refused to appear in a TV ad during the game. Last year, Cardi B said she would not take the Super Bowl stage until Kaepernick got a job. With Kaepernick still without a team, she will perform at a downtown concert on Saturday, host a party and appear in a Super Bowl commercial. Cardi B said she had heard the criticism toward her and other music artists for taking part in Super Bowl-related events, but said she believes she can perform outside the championship game without directly supporting the NFL.“I hear people saying like, ‘Oh, y’all are saying all this stuff about the Super Bowl, but you’re doing all these parties,”’ she said. “And it’s like, well, if the NFL could benefit off from us, then I’m going to benefit off y’all. Y’all make the most money off our people. Why am I not going to take advantage of y’all and take money from y’all too? Because of y’all, we are getting these parties. OK, thank you.” Cardi B said she hoped the protests supporting Kaepernick could create positive change, but she was not sure if that would happen anytime soon. “We got an arrogant president, and the racism right now has been reborn,” she said. “They feel mighty brave nowadays. When Obama was around, I just feel like they were praying on the day when his eight years was over. A lot of jealousy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d83084fa85c86cb90752d77c87accb78be9d7d9b/436_223_4123_2474/master/4123.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57bfabb673414b20b76b42872398d8e4","title":"cornflakes on the basquiat perils of superyacht art","story":"From champagne corks flying towards a Picasso to cornflakes splashed on a Basquiat painting, the perils facing billionaires’ floating art collections aren’t those sailors typically fear on the high seas. But the world’s ultra-rich are filling superyachts with so many masterpieces that conservationists are teaching captains and crew how to care for art as well as to pamper passengers.Pandora Mather-Lees, an Oxford-educated art historian and conservationist, started giving lessons after a billionaire asked for help to restore a Jean-Michel Basquiat painting damaged not by sea spray, but by breakfast cereal. “His kids had thrown their cornflakes at it over breakfast on his yacht because they thought it was scary,” Mather-Lees said. “And the crew had made the damage worse by wiping them off the painting.”She declined to name the owner or identify the artwork, but a  Basquiat painting depicting a crazed, skull-shaped face sold at auction for a US record $110.5m (£84.5m) in 2017.The crew “just thought it was some painting, they had no idea it was worth many millions,” Mather-Lees told the Observer at a superyacht conference in London last week. “They are expected to know how to serve the owners at sea, not to know about paintings and art. But, now that the rich are increasingly bringing their art collections on board their yachts it’s vital that captains and crew know how to care for these pieces.”Discretion is required in both the art world and on superyachts, but Mather-Lees said Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the owner of Manchester City and deputy prime minister of the United Arab Emirates, has several hundred pieces aboard his £350m superyacht Topaz.A reporter looking in the windows of Joe Lewis’s £200m superyacht Aviva, when it moored on the Thames last year, discovered Francis Bacon’s Triptych 1974–1977 was hanging in gold frames on the lower deck. The painting, whose subject is the death of Bacon’s lover George Dyer, was included in Tate Britain’s blockbuster Bacon and Freud exhibition last summer.The British-born Lewis, who has an estimated £3.9bn fortune, owns a majority stake in Tottenham football club and lives in the tax-friendly Bahamas, has what he describes as “one of the largest private art collections in the world”. It includes paintings by Degas, Freud, Klimt, Modigliani, Matisse and Picasso, and sculptures by Moore, Degas and Di Modica. It is not known which are kept on his yacht.Mather-Lees said that she saw a gap in the market for art awareness and handling lessons while walking around the Monaco yacht show, where the world’s biggest superyachts are displayed every September. “I was walking around and seeing talks about everything from flower arranging and wine connoisseur lessons, but no one was thinking about art and assisting the owners with care of their collections,” she said.Her €295-a-day course aims to give crew an understanding of “the art collector and the intrinsic value of the objects on board” as well as knowledge of “where to go for specialist help in an emergency”.Helen Robertson, a conservator at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, also advises the super-rich on caring for art at sea. “I used to work as a chief steward on superyachts so I have seen some of the problems first hand,” she said. “I’ve worked on a vessel with $450m of works of cultural value on board.“Something people always say to me is ‘why on earth would you carry art on yachts?’,” she said. “But yachts can be very controllable. Systems for temperature and humidity can surpass those you would find in galleries.”The most important thing was to make sure that all the crew were aware of the value of pieces.She told of the crew who broke a £75,000 lamp. “It was the end of a Christmas and new year charter, and everyone was a bit worse for wear,” she said. “The crew decided to rugby pass the cushions from the deck into the saloon, and one of them hit the lamp.”In another incident, a superyacht crew held an impromptu party in the owner’s quarters and a champagne cork struck the canvas of a multi-million pound work.Tilman Kriesel, founder of an art advisory firm, told the conference one client asked how to display a Rothko that was too tall for a yacht’s grand saloon. “We turned the piece by 90 degrees,” he said. “The artist would probably be turning in his grave, but we took a deep breath and said ‘it’s your painting, do what you like’.”Another of Kriesel’s clients had a piece by the Japanese modern artist Takashi Murakami that he wanted to display in the “beach club” – the rear of superyachts where owners access jet skis and other water toys – but again it was the wrong size. “In the end we cut it up to make it fit,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/166f65a62cd64034126de9ddf6182115c9cfdb13/0_104_4720_2832/master/4720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef7ff992059f6fd3e61120812f865613","title":"arron banks man who bankrolled brexit podcast today in focus","story":"Carole Cadwalladr has been covering the biggest pro-leave donor for nearly two years.

Environment Agency (EA) officials said leaking stockpiles could cause pollution.The EA is also concerned that if farmers cannot export beef and lamb, a backlog of livestock on farms could cause liquid manure stores to overflow. A senior MP said the problems could cause a public health and environmental pollution emergency. An EA source said: “It could all get very ugly, very quickly.”The emails leaked to the  were sent to EA staff, asking for 42 volunteers to staff crisis management centres that would deal with incidents. On Tuesday the chief executive of the civil service revealed plans to move up to 5,000 staff into an emergency command and control centre in the event of no deal.An EA email sent on Thursday, labelled “importance: high”, said crisis centres could go live on 18 February and run from 7am to 8pm seven days a week, with plans to operate 247 if needed. To explain the potential tasks, the email gave two examples.“If there is a no-deal scenario, the current export of waste may cease for a period. This could result in stockpiled waste which causes licence breaches,” the email said. “Odours will obviously be an issue as the stockpiled waste putrefies and there may be runoff of leachates, causing secondary pollution.”The email said the waste could become a high-profile issue. “It will quickly escalate into a political one because the operators will state that they have no means to move the waste.”The second example related to animal slurry. “Problems may arise in exporting livestock to the EU. In that situation, farmers may be overstocked and unable to export lambbeef etc. That means that they may have problems with slurry storage capacity and insufficient land spreading capability.”The EA source said: “The examples seem like real possibilities. There’s a serious amount of panic going on.” Mary Creagh, the chair of parliament’s environmental audit committee, said: “The UK’s waste and recycling system is already fragile but these shocking emails show it will grind to a halt if customs checks and WTO tariffs prevent the export of millions of tonnes of waste.”“No deal would be a green light to criminal fraudsters and create a public health and environmental pollution emergency. EA officials should not carry the can for the failings of government to get a deal through and this shows how hollow the prime minister’s promises were about protecting the environment if we leave the EU.”An EA spokesman said: “As with the whole of government and the rest of the public sector, we are preparing responsibly for all scenarios as we exit the EU.”As well as recycling waste, the UK ships about 3m tonnes of rubbish a year to the EU to be burned in incinerators that generate electricity. Most of this is household rubbish, which is sometimes shredded and has metal removed before being sent abroad. If waste has to be stockpiled after a no-deal Brexit, industry experts say the populous south-east of England would be worst affected. The UK’s lack of incinerator capacity and shrinking number of landfill sites drives the exports.The government issued a technical notice in December stating that “if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, importexport licences issued by the UK would no longer be valid for shipments of waste to the 27 remaining EU countries from the day the UK leaves.” The notice added: “There is currently no process set out in the EU waste shipment regulations on how notified shipments should be re-approved. Defra is contacting other EU countries to discuss arrangements.”Stuart Hayward-Higham, who leads Brexit planning for Suez, one of the UK’s largest waste management firms, said the EA’s planning was sensible: “It is them just putting things in place in case they need them.”In September the National Audit Office warned ministers that plans for the continued export of animal products such as beef were far behind the needed schedule. After 29 March in a no-deal scenario, such products will require export health certificates (EHCs), which need to be signed by an official veterinarian after an inspection.Potential delays in issuing EHCs could leave farmers with more livestock than expected and more manure than they can deal with. Last month a government air pollution strategy proposed in effect a ban on muck-spreading, where fields are sprayed with liquid manure."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22dfa499ea26eb05273d74b531771ed17ff340b3/0_79_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=147558bcace8894713844e9516095cc3","title":"brexiters deal uk firms uncertainty britain european union business sector","story":"Uncertainty over Britain’s terms for leaving the EU is harshly affecting firmsThe clock is ticking. In the House of Commons, MPs spend hours debating points of parliamentary procedure, but are unwilling to take real decisions about our country’s future. Negotiations between the prime minister and EU leaders seem to have reached an impasse. But in the real world, businesses are at breaking point.I know from my own business career that – above all – what business needs is certainty. Certainty about the terms on which they will be able to sell products and services to our largest export market. Certainty about their ability to import the parts and raw materials they need without costly tariffs and delays. And above all, the certainty that they need to invest in the UK, to create the high-quality, high-skilled jobs we need to meet the economic challenges of the future.I understand why some people find it easier to dismiss these concerns than engage with the complex reality of Brexit.But businesses don’t have the option to cross their fingers and hope it will be all right on the night. Every day that goes by without answers to these questions accelerates the flow of investment, jobs and economic activity out of the country – and to the EU.This is why it is vital that this issue is settled when parliament next considers it on 14 February. It is time that MPs stopped ducking their responsibility to take decisions – telling the government what they don’t want, but not what they could support. Given the importance of the question, and the isiveness of the debate, we need to reassure citizens and businesses that we have found a sustainable way forward.We can only do this by coming together around an outcome that commands a significant majority in the House. And if that is not possible, we have to grasp the nettle of an extended article 50 period, taking a no-deal Brexit off the table to allow time for discussions to continue.I understand the concerns of some MPs about being seen to delay or frustrate Brexit. And I know that, for others, they just want to “get on with it”. But however bracing the prospect of instant liberation from the EU may feel in abstract, that sentiment won’t last long when confronted with the economic, legal and practical reality. In the chaos that followed no deal, voters would turn on the Tory party, and rightly so.So it is time to focus on what in the end matters most – supporting growth and jobs in the UK. This government, through our industrial strategy, has acknowledged the challenges we face and set out a clear plan to deal with them.A no-deal Brexit would undermine all our efforts. It would entrench this country’s social and economic isions, not heal them. And it would turn a crisis into a catastrophe. That is why, on 14 February, just a week on Thursday, parliament needs to rule it out once and for all.Richard Harrington is minister for business and industry and MP for Watford"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7278925192438e411a646ea31eb76f4bd35eaac/0_145_3416_2049/master/3416.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44a62eb9393e75b9b153aef7f3235eaf","title":"corbyn calls for snap election to help put an end to austerity","story":"Labour leader wants people ‘bearing the brunt’ of nine years of austerity to have their sayJeremy Corbyn has called for a snap general election during a meeting of anti-poverty charities in Glasgow. He said people who have experienced “the brunt of nine years of austerity” must be allowed a new vote.The Labour leader met with voluntary organisations and charities working to tackle poverty in south-west Glasgow on Saturday, where he criticised “Tory cuts” while pointing to double-digit yearly increases in food bank use and falling life expectancy in Scotland’s most populated city.“People are suffering under austerity as a direct result of Tory cuts in Westminster passed down by the SNP in Holyrood,” he said. “The people who are bearing the brunt of nine years of austerity cannot wait years for a general election. They need a general election now.”Corbyn paid tribute to the volunteers and charities that have stepped in to support people who are suffering, but said people should not have to rely on the voluntary sector. “It is a disgrace that people are living on the streets and forced to rely on food banks in one of the richest countries in the world,” he added.“The SNP government has not just passed on Tory austerity, it has quadrupled it for local councils. And this week’s budget will mean another £230m in cuts that will hit local services the people of Scotland rely on.“There is a clear choice between more austerity or a Labour government that will put an end to austerity and build a country for the many, not the few.”A third of children in south-west Glasgow live in poverty, according to statistics highlighted by Labour from the End Child Poverty coalition. Life expectancy in the area is almost 74 years for men and 79 for women, markedly lower than the Scottish national averages of 77 and 81.Figures published in December showed that life expectancy had fallen in Scotland for the first time in 35 years, and across the UK life expectancy growth since 2011 has slumped faster than in a number of other leading economies.Labour was leading the Conservatives by one percentage point in the latest Survation poll, with others putting the two parties level pegging. Meanwhile, YouGov has consistently polled Labour as trailing the Tories.Recent attempts to persuade a majority of MPs to back a vote of no confidence in Theresa May have failed, but the Fixed Term Parliament Act allows for early elections if two-thirds of MPs vote in favour.A Scottish Conservative spokesman said: “At the last general election, it was the Scottish Conservatives, not Labour, that were making huge gains across the country and winning 12 extra seats. Voters know that Labour are too weak to stand up to the SNP and that the only party that can take on the nationalists and win is the Scottish Conservatives.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25406889ad25e23081a8ff17db9bb7fd17533f09/0_64_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13fd2f8a2c095d1298570700548000fc","title":"mcdonnell accuses pm of pork barrel politics with brexit bribery","story":"Shadow chancellor criticises May over reports she pledged extra cash for leave-voting areas if MPs back Brexit dealJohn McDonnell has criticised Theresa May’s rumoured approach to persuading Labour MPs to vote for her Brexit deal as “pork-barrel” politics, saying: “If there is money there to spend on our constituencies, it should be done anyway.”The shadow chancellor’s accusation follows reports that the government is preparing to plough extra funding into deprived areas that supported leave, with the Nottinghamshire MP John Mann claiming that a set of job-creation measures targeted at former industrial towns would make it “very difficult for Labour MPs in leave areas to vote against the deal unless they want a second referendum”.However, the Redcar MP Anna Turley dismissed the offer of “bribes or sweeteners … which we know will make those constituencies worse off”.“It was something like £100m a vote they spent to get the DUP supporting them, so they already introduced that pork-barrel contractual politics. I think it degrades our political system and to try and extend it in this way, I think it’s dangerous for our democracy.“So what most MPs have said is, actually if there is money there to spend on our constituencies, it should be done anyway. It shouldn’t be done in return for votes.” Questioned on whether Labour rebels would be punished following Tuesday’s key vote, McDonnell said it was a matter for the Labour chief whip. “We introduced a whip, we expect people to abide by it, but there’s an understanding that in some areas, you can understand why some people voted the way they did.”McDonnell said conversations about “contractual” arrangements pledging investment in the constituencies of MPs who back the prime minister’s deal, first reported in the Times, was “dangerous for our democracy” and would amount to MPs selling their votes. “I don’t think any MP will sell their votes in that way – that sort of bribery and corruption,” he said.A spokesman for the prime minister this week confirmed ministers were looking at a programme of “national renewal” following Brexit to tackle inequality and rebuild communities, but said he “absolutely wouldn’t characterise” the reported investment offer as “cash for votes”.“We are determined to lead a programme of national renewal post-Brexit by rebuilding and reconnecting communities, driving prosperity and unleashing the potential and creativity of hard-working people in every part of our country,” the spokesman said.In an article on Saturday in the Daily Mail, the Labour MP John Mann said he would not apologise for trying to get a better deal for his constituency, admitting that some MPs were seeking to leverage the government’s need for support on Brexit to their advantage.“Will that make it easier for more Labour MPs to vote for her Brexit deal? Yes. But that is not bribery, it’s politics.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adb97cd2c9c09ac097e3a9539d92940218b604a7/0_0_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b6cca74de0b46d7c3d5ab01492ce5b7","title":"apples jade irish champions hurdle cheltenham festival horse racing","story":"• Elliott’s mare likely to run in Mares’ Hurdle at Cheltenham• Buveur D’Air wins Contenders Hurdle at SandownA record-breaking 16-lengths success in the Irish Champion Hurdle here on Saturday was still not enough to secure Apple’s Jade a place in its British equivalent on the first day of the Cheltenham Festival next month. Gordon Elliott’s mare will be at the track on 12 March but she seems likely to run in the Mares’ Hurdle rather than the Champion, despite showing form here that would make her a plausible favourite to beat Buveur D’Air, the champion for the last two years.Buveur D’Air was also in action on Saturday, winning the Contenders Hurdle at Sandown by two lengths at odds of 1-5, and Nicky Henderson, his trainer, seemed as surprised as anyone to hear that Apple’s Jade is not expected to line up against the dual champion at Cheltenham, where she would get a 7lb mares’ allowance.There is still time for Michael O’Leary, Apple’s Jade’s owner, to have a sudden change of heart and Elliott also suggested here that the Mares’ Hurdle option is not set in stone. However, Eddie O’Leary, Michael’s brother and racing manager, insisted repeatedly that he sees no reason to switch her away from the Mares’ Hurdle.“Of course you’re tempted and it will be Michael who will decide, but I’d go to the Mares’ Hurdle because you’re qualified,” O’Leary said. “And she’s won the Irish Champion Hurdle, and by the way, she failed in the Mares’ Hurdle last year, so it’s not as if we’re going there as a certainty. So all going well, I’d say that’s where we’re going.Apple’s Jade is generally the clear second-favourite at 9-4 for the Champion Hurdle with bookmakers offering a “non-runner, no bet” concession, but a 6-1 chance with Hills, who are “all-in”, meaning that stakes are lost if she does not run. In the Mares’ Hurdle betting, she is odds-on at 4-7, while Buveur D’Air’s price for the Champion Hurdle ranges from 11-10 to 13-8.Racegoers and punters may well feel a little short-changed if Apple’s Jade lines up for the Mares’ Hurdle rather than the Champion, a move that would simultaneously reduce the competitiveness of both events. The option exists, though, following the extension of the Festival from three days to four, and some dilution of the depth and quality of the championship events was inevitable as a result.Min, who took the Grade One Dublin Chase at odds-on, also has options at the Festival and his connections will take their time before deciding whether to take on Altior in the Champion Chase or move up in trip in the Ryanair Chase the following day. There was a miserable postscript to Saturday’s race, however, when it was confirmed that Henry de Bromhead’s bold-jumping front-runner Special Tiara, the 2017 Champion Chase winner, had been put down after suffering a serious leg injury in the early stages.Le Richebourg, the 11-10 favourite, stayed on strongly to take the Grade One Arkle Novice Chase for Joseph O’Brien and will now head to the race of a similar name at Cheltenham as the likely favourite, though his task was eased when Voix Du Reve fell at the last fence when close behind the winner.The only Grade One event of the afternoon in Britain was the Scilly Isles Novice Chase at Sandown, where Kim Bailey’s Vinndication set off as favourite to maintain an unbeaten record over jumps but could finish only third behind Defi Du Seuil, the 2017 Triumph Hurdle winner, and Lostintranslation, who had beaten him in the Dipper Novice Chase at Cheltenham in January.The two horses are expected to renew rivalry in the JLT Novice Chase at Cheltenham and are closely matched at the top of the betting, with Defi Du Seuil a narrow 6-1 favourite ahead of Lostintranslation on 7-1."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26056410b95e07deabccfbf1a5a95edc1cfffcbb/0_90_2250_1350/master/2250.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2eeaf5ad2bba77b827bf60be20ba5519","title":"birmingham gets ready for 2022 commonwealth games","story":"Locals in host city have concerns any benefits will be short term, while others are optimistic the event will unite everyoneIn the summer of 2022, thousands of athletes, officials and fans from more than 70 nations and territories will descend on Birmingham for the Commonwealth Games.Outside the Arthur Robertson pub in Perry Barr (the pub is named after an Olympic runner who was a member of the local athletics club, Birchfield Harriers), the regulars do not – at least for the moment – sound thrilled at the prospect.“The council has got very excited about it,” said Dave Rollins, who admits he prefers watching darts rather than track and field, hockey or netball. “But most of us round here aren’t sure they’re capable of delivering. They’re in a mess as it is, having to make cuts all over the place. I think they should spend the money on the basics – getting the bins emptied, keeping the place moving.”Perry Barr, in suburban north Birmingham, will be one of the epicentres of the games. The plan is to extend and improve Alexander Stadium, home of Birchfield Harriers. The bulldozers are clearing a former university campus to make way for the athletes’ village.Vegetable growers at the Walsall Road allotments next to the stadium are worried that their land may be grabbed. “The council has said we’re safe but they always say that, don’t they?” said committee member Tony Cotterell. “I’m not bothered about sport. I think the money can be spent in better ways.”Rick Sharma, who owns a convenience store and post office close to the stadium, is looking forward to a boost in footfall. “In the short term I think it will be good,” he said. “There will be construction people here beforehand, and during the games we’ll have lots of visitors. But long term I’m not sure. The council is hellbent on getting money from the government and finding ways of spending it. That’s what they do.”There is even a campaign in Perry Barr to save a flyover that could be demolished as part of the development of bus routes and the village. More than 2,000 people have signed, claiming its removal would cause congestion and the loss of a “prime example of modernist concrete architecture”.Of course, not all are suspicious: Mimi-Isabella Cesar, a rhythmic gymnast from up the road in Sutton Coldfield who competed in the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow in 2014 and the Gold Coast in 2018, believes the events will be huge for her home city.Ellie Simmonds, the Paralympian swimmer who swam for Boldmere swimming club in Sutton Coldfield as a girl, said she believed the event would be “special, wholly inclusive and utterly memorable”.Last week Simmonds was appointed to the Birmingham 2022 board as a non-executive director, along with a much more isive figure, Nick Timothy, Theresa May’s ex-joint chief of staff. Critics called the appointment of Timothy, who was born in Birmingham, a blatant example of “jobs for the boys”.But this comes at a time when the authority needs to make cuts of £86m during the next four years. Its suggestions for savings, for which it has opened a consultation, include dimming the streetlights, removing lollipop men and women, withdrawing funding for the tourist information centre and reducing subsidies on sports pitch hire. The final budget will be voted upon next month.One unpopular proposal is to slash grant support to Birmingham’s major arts and cultural organisations, including the beloved City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, the Rep theatre, Midlands Art Centre and Ikon Gallery.Thousands have signed a petition that argues Birmingham will be a less vibrant city in 2022 if these cuts are made. Gary Topp, CEO of Culture Central, a collective voice for arts in the city, said it was worrying that arts funding was being lost shortly before the eyes of the world turned towards Birmingham. “A successful, global city needs a thriving, complex and rich cultural sector,” he said.The city council says the games have the potential to generate significant economic benefits for Birmingham and the UK. For starters, it says a workforce of up to 45,000 people will be employed.But the council has yet to explain how it will foot the bill for the games, which were awarded to Birmingham after Durban ran into financial problems.There has been talk of introducing airport and hotel taxes and using money from business rates to cover the costs, but the council emphasises that nothing has been set in stone.Opposition parties in Labour-controlled Birmingham back the concept of the games, but want more detail about how they will be funded.Tory councillor Meirion Jenkins, the local shadow cabinet member for finance and resources, said: “If Birmingham is to be regarded as a leading international city, then we must be able to stage major international events of this type. That said, I have a number of concerns about the way in which the Labour administration is failing to be straightforward with council tax payers. Having decided to host the games, we have to recognise that there will be substantial costs, part of which will need to be funded by the city.”Jon Hunt, the leader of the Liberal Democrat group on the city council and a Perry Barr councillor, added: “It could be good but we have to make sure it’s good. We have challenges to make sure the games don’t do harm. I think people are cautiously optimistic.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c30ccc6bf893cecfe1975d795b9559a1c3c3f38b/0_160_4434_2661/master/4434.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7224b26c4092df43a5580a3cf819779f","title":"ireland england six nations match report","story":"England may have won a grand slam and a Six Nations title under Eddie Jones as well as a series in Australia, but this was their first performance under him when they looked like a team capable of toppling New Zealand at the top of the world rankings. Ireland, the champions who in the past 18 months had defeated every other tier-one nation and were on a 12-match winning run at home, were skittles unable to get out of the way of the heavy artillery bowled at them.There was a point in the third quarter when the game looked to be tilting towards Ireland. England were ahead 17-10, the score they had taken into the interval. They had spent most of the match on the front foot, apart from a period in the first half when they were reduced to 14 men when Tom Curry was sent to the sin-bin for a late challenge on Keith Earls. There was an assertiveness and an assurance to their play, starting in the opening seconds when they caught Ireland out with a quickly taken lineout that resulted in a try for Jonny May, in a reversal from the game here two years ago.England were then seeking the grand slam to go with the title, but became stuck in a morass of slow possession. This time it was Ireland who were forced to kick hurriedly away rather than play from well behind the gainline and England who were dominant in the air and on the floor: the home side did not force one turnover at a ruck and saw little return from their box-kicks. England, in contrast, had time, moving the ball quickly after a tackle and prepared to kick into space and exploit Robbie Henshaw’s inexperience at full-back on an evening when the sky was clear and the wind barely flickered. The storm came from England.Ireland were hustled into mistakes. While May’s try was reward for the pace England started with, so spooking Earls that he shot out of the line to try to intercept Owen Farrell’s long pass to Elliot Daly and left the England full-back with an overlap to exploit, their second was down to Ireland cracking under pressure. When Jacob Stockdale fielded Daly’s chip close to Ireland’s line, he was rushed into acting by the onrushing Jack Nowell, spilled the ball and left Daly with the task of getting his hand on it.England, who conceded a try to Cian Healy after a driving lineout moments after Curry had returned to the field, could have had more. Nowell was tackled into touch and the visitors ended the opening half camped on Ireland’s line without finding a way over it, settling for a Farrell penalty. There was no response from Ireland after the break and 51 minutes in, England were deep in their opponents’ territory when Garry Ringrose sized up Farrell and thundered into the fly-half, whose pass fell loose. Johnny Sexton kicked the ball on and when Henry Slade knocked on in his 22, the match looked in the balance.England had replaced one second-row, George Kruis, with Courtney Lawes, so when Maro Itoje left after 54 minutes with a knee ligament injury, he had to be replaced by a No 8, Nathan Hughes. Kyle Sinckler’s high tackle on Ringrose presented Sexton with his second penalty – the prop had supplied the first in the opening half when he was slow to roll away from a ruck. England’s lead was reduced to four points, the balance of their side had changed and the crowd, hushed for long periods, sensed it may after all be their night.It is in such moments that reputations are made. At the point when the world’s form team reached out to grasp victory, it was wrenched away from them by a team that seemed to be guided by fate. Jones had talked in the buildup about using Nowell as a ninth forward but England’s head coach already has one. Mako Vunipola does the work of two, a prop who is an extra flanker. He made 25 tackles, embodying his side’s defiance.Jones had started with five Saracens in his pack and England bore the hallmark of their club champions: focused and uncomplicated. With another Saracen, Farrell, in control behind, England used their physical presence as a means to an end rather than an end itself. For once, to see England play was to see them train and Ireland, whose half-backs Conor Murray and Sexton lacked match sharpness on an evening when they were unable to influence the pace of the game, struggled to adapt.Ireland are a team that trade in certainties. The last time they won after trailing at half-time was in Argentina in the summer of 2014. A well-drilled, programmed side are at their most vulnerable playing catch-up, when scripts have to be hastily rewritten. The game may have looked there for them after Sexton’s second penalty but it faded like a mirage. After Farrell had missed a long-range penalty, England attacked from deep, May kicking to the line for Slade to outpace the defence. The try was reviewed – not, as Ireland wanted, for a suspected forward pass in the buildup, which Jérôme Garcès ruined as too historic to bother him, but for offside. Slade was level and the try stood.Farrell’s third penalty 10 minutes from time ensured victory and Slade garnished it with a bonus point when he intercepted Sexton’s forced pass as an Ireland team so used to constricting opponents into mistakes was itself suffocated. John Cooney’s late try was little consolation for the champions, who are in Scotland on Saturday, the day before England face France. But after an opening round when a few images were shattered, nothing will be assumed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/604cda46b5ea85128e47763c87ecf9e4a26a3383/311_127_1660_996/master/1660.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50b2f0f1867d82063638811a9fc70bba","title":"ireland england six nations player ratings","story":"15. ROBBIE HENSHAW 510 A first appearance at fullback for six years and it may be just as long until his next. England continued to apply the pressure on a difficult afternoon for Henshaw.14. KEITH EARLS 510 Off at half-time after he was whacked twice in the first 40 minutes, firstly by Curry, then Itoje. Was it a deliberate ploy from England? It certainly limited his impact.13. GARRY RINGROSE 610 Huge hit on Farrell stopped England just as they were building up a head of steam. Has an unmissable classy manner about him in everything he does.12. BUNDEE AKI 510 Heavily involved from the word go but had a tendency to go sideways a bit too often. Was lined up by Tuilagi from about 20 metres and came off second best to his opposite number.11. JACOB STOCKDALE 510 Busy early on, looking for the ball up the middle but went off the boil after he was badly at fault for Daly’s try.10. JONATHAN SEXTON 610 Kept looking for ways around, over or through England’s defence but with limited success. Could not escape England’s suffocating linespeed.9. CONOR MURRAY 510 Kicking not at his ordinarily superb standard and his passing was disjointed too. All in all this was far from Murray’s best. Surprising he stayed on so long.1. CIAN HEALY 710 Was on hand to score a close-range try when Ireland really needed some points but could not break the shackles for one of his trademark gallops.2. RORY BEST 510 (capt) Not a day to remember for the skipper. He got away with a poor lineout near his own line in the first half but did not impose himself.3. TADHG FURLONG 710 Not enough of Ireland’s world class players lived up to their star billing. Furlong perhaps got closest but England’s aggressive defence restricted his influence.4. DEVIN TONER 510 His run of consecutive wins comes to an end at 17. Is an obvious weapon at the lineout and was committed as ever but made way midway through the second half.5. JAMES RYAN 610 His titanic tussle with Itoje lived up to its billing but he normally makes more headway with the ball in hand than this.6. PETER O’MAHONY 610 Ireland’s man of the match against the All Blacks rolled up his sleeves but could not influence the breakdown, nor the lineout as he tends to.7, JOSH VAN DER FLIER 510 Ireland’s joint top tackler never gave up but Joe Schmidt may rue his decision to name Sean O’Brien “more suited to this kind of contest” on the bench.8. CJ STANDER 510 Did well to create enough doubt as to ensure Mako Vunipola’s try was disallowed. Some bruising carries but could not make the same impact as at Twickenham last year.Jordan Larmour (for Earls h-t) No sign of his electric footwork 5.15. ELLIOT DALY 710 Still not convincing under the high ball and was at fault in the buildup to Ireland’s try. Clever grubber for his own score though. A mixed bag.14. JACK NOWELL 810 Always coming off his wing, always looking for work. Got his shot at openside too, joining the scrum with Tom Curry in the sin-bin.13. HENRY SLADE 910 Backed up Farrell with some shrewd kicks, excelled defensively and topped with off with a wonderful pass for his first try. Best performance for England by some distance.12. MANU TUILAGI 710 First start in the competition since 2013 and begin as if to make up for lost time with two big carries shortly before May’s try. Was used sparingly but can make inside-centre his home.11. JONNY MAY 710 Has five tries in five championship appearances now after scoring England’s first here since 2011. Was targeted by Murray’s bombs but dealt with them well on the whole.10. OWEN FARRELL 810 (capt) Called hotheaded in the buildup but stayed at room temperature for the most part. Kicking from hand was exceptional and exposed Henshaw’s positioning.9. BEN YOUNGS 610 Is not as accurate with his box-kicking as Murray but we knew that already. Kept a steady tempo though and a cool head. No surprise to see him stay on throughout.1. MAKO VUNIPOLA 910 Remarkable performance. Carried time and again with real edge and made a staggering 25 tackles. Of all the illustrious Lions forwards on the pitch, he shone brightest.2. JAMIE GEORGE 810 Part of an England front-five that yielded nothing and even produced a sidestep or two. Lineout came under fire in the autumn but no complaints here.3. KYLE SINCKLER 710 Gave away a silly penalty in the first half but relished the confrontation. Could be heard telling the referee Jérôme Garcès, “I’m just very excited tell me to shut up if you need”.4. MARO ITOJE 710 Clattered Earls and perhaps lucky to give away just a penalty.

Stuart Hogg and Chris Harris also touched down as Gregor Townsend’s team had the bonus point wrapped up with 25 minutes to play, but some chaos and confusion ensued in a final 10-minute spell which saw Italy, who previously had only a penalty to their name, claim three tries to put a gloss on the scoreline.The sin-binning of the substitute Simon Berghan was the catalyst for that late lapse, and Townsend is well aware that his team will have to tighten up in some respects before Ireland visit Murrayfield on Saturday. On balance, however, the head coach was satisfied with a performance during which his team improved significantly on the autumn Tests in areas such as the breakdown and the kick chase.Asked if his players were down at the end of the game because of its unsatisfactory conclusion, Townsend suggested it could be regarded as a salutary reminder of the work they have to do before the tougher challenges that await.“Yes, and maybe it’s not a bad thing. It’s the first game of the tournament and we’re playing the No 2 team in the world on Saturday. We’re then going to a place where we’ve not won in 20 years, then playing the No 3 team in the world, then going to a place where we haven’t won since 1983.“Feet on the ground is good for us,” Townsend continued. “We’ve started with a solid win and scoring five tries is a credit to the players. But we know next week’s challenge is going to be huge and we have to get the focus right almost immediately. The players will start to absorb the gameplan and what we need to do better to win next week.”The Italians might easily have conceded more than five tries, and though they did take an early lead through a Tommy Allan penalty, Scotland needed only two minutes to hit back through Kinghorn. Greig Laidlaw stole the ball at the breakdown following the restart, and Finn Russell angled an inch-perfect kick for Kinghorn to gather and run in from the edge of the opposition 22. Midway through the half Kinghorn again got on the end of a wide move to score.Josh Strauss, a substitute for the injured Sam Skinner, began the move with a pick-up from the base of a scrum. He fed Laidlaw, who switched direction to Russell, and the stand-off then looped around the debutant Sam Johnson before passing to Hogg. The full-back’s pass to Kinghorn went to ground, but the left winger was nonetheless able to take it in his stride and sprint over in the corner.The Azzurri did rally towards half-time, but they were repelled. Scotland increased the tempo from the restart and a third try seemed only a matter of time. They got it after 47 minutes when Hogg beat Angelo Esposito in the race to ground a kick into the in-goal area from Russell – even though a replay cast doubt on how much downward pressure the scorer had exerted.Scotland had half an hour to get the fourth try and claim the bonus point. They only needed five minutes. Laidlaw and Jamie Ritchie exchanged passes, and the captain put Kinghorn through from 15 metres out. Another conversion made it 26-3.With the game won, Townsend went to his bench, and one of the replacements, Harris, got the fifth try with his first touch after another astute break by Hogg set up good position. With Laidlaw having given way to Ali Price, Russell took over the duties and converted to make it 33-3.Italy rallied in what remained of the game, and scored three late tries. The first was from short range through Guglielmo Palazzani after Berghan had been sin-binned for collapsing the maul, with Allan’s conversion taking them into the respectability of double figures.Edoardo Padovani got the second with a simple score after Scotland had run out of numbers on the right, but the substitute Ian McKinley was off target with the conversion. Angelo Esposito got the third, again from a break up the right, with two minutes left. The winger drop-kicked his conversion attempt back off the post.That late recovery notwithstanding, the Italians’ limited contribution has to be a concern to Conor O’Shea, who has yet to enjoy a win in the tournament as their coach. “We hadn’t the ball – pretty simple,” the coach said when asked to explain the defeat.“It felt like were defending the whole time. I’m disappointed, because if we’d held on to the ball we’ve got players who can do damage. We know the challenge. We know we’ve started a process that is doing the right thing – and we have a lot to do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/761cbf265f274521df20e15c8365e0e2ec292f21/0_349_3995_2397/master/3995.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8fd2e0802c8c9554d78aa866ddaf4265","title":"ireland v england six nations live","story":"England produced a terrific performance to beat the defending champions in Dublin, with Henry Slade scoring two tries in a statement winThat’s all from me on a big day for England. I’ll leave you with our match report. Thanks for joining me, and enjoy your evenings. Bye! And here’s Eddie Jones! “We wanted Henry and Manu to try things, and they were both outstanding. Ireland are a good, well-drilled side, and we tried to play England rugby, with good attacking kicks. I thought Jonny May was outstanding, too.”“France played really well against Wales, unlucky to lose. We’re going to have a short break, and rip in on Tuesday.”Conor Murray gives his thoughts: “We started slow, and we gave up a couple of soft tries. Our start killed us, against a team of England’s quality, you can’t start that slow. The half-time chat was good, but we were a little bit flat in the second half. I can’t put my finger on why”It was strange, and it’s a little odd to focus on the start when Ireland were ahead with half an hour played.As for Ireland, that performance was neatly summed up by O’Driscoll as a “reality check”. England’s game plan was carried out ruthlessly, but it can’t have been a complete surprise. They struggled to find a Plan B, and didn’t really take advantage of the occasional penalties England conceded. Their next fixture, a trip to Murrayfield, suddenly looks a little more daunting.There were so many questions around England before this match. Was it smart to spend two weeks in Portugal? How would Slade fare in such a physical battle? Was Elliot Daly a wise choice at full-back? It’s extraordinary how everything came together for them.Here’s Henry Slade, the man of the match for me, Clive.“We put in a big shift in the training camp the last two weeks, and it paid off today. We knew exactly how we wanted to play, we executed it perfectly. I really enjoyed it today, it’s the first chance to play with Manu, and who knows, maybe we can carry on.”Stick around for reaction and our match report from Dublin. First, a word from Dan Lucas’s dad, Gary.“I just wanted to thank you and your readers for remembering Dan before kick off. We always enjoy Six Nations time.”Particularly today, I would imagine. That was the kind of England display that would have had Dan out of his seat, cheering them on.What a result that is, and what a performance by England. The Six Nations is officially wide open!Ireland chase a losing bonus point, but England defend as they have all game – with speed, intensity and fearlessness. Slade intercepts, one final kick in the midriff for Ireland, and it’s all over!The Ulster scrum-half, on for his Six Nations debut, races through after England finally switch off. Ireland add a quick conversion, but it all adds up to no more than a consolation.More changes: John Cooney is on for Conor Murray, while the exemplary Mako Vunipola and Jamie George are finally stood down. Luke Cowan-Dickie and Ellis Genge come on.I’m not sure even Eddie Jones saw this coming. Ireland are getting shown up in their own backyard, Farrell stretching the lead to 19 points.Good grief! Ireland are slow and sluggish in the face of the England defence, and Sexton’s pass is intercepted by Slade! He gathers it in and strolls over the try line. England get a bonus point!75 mins: Larmour grabs a high ball, and inevitably, is floored by an England tackle 0.5 seconds later...73 mins: England fans break into ‘Swing Low, Sweet Chariot’, but are quickly whistled down by the home support. Changes for both teams – Joey Carbery replaces Ringrose, and Chris Ashton comes on for the lively Jack Nowell. 72 mins: Ireland just can’t get any forward momentum. England have been relentless and show no sign of tiring, with Lawes making a big impact off the bench.This effort is from close to the halfway line, but Farrell pulls rank on the long-distance specialist, Elliot Daly. A ballsy move from Farrell, and he backs it up with a brilliant kick!68 mins: Rory Best is replaced by Seán Cronin, and Peter O’Mahony takes over as captain. Ireland have 12 minutes or so to find a way through, but again they’re forced onto the back foot, and England get the penalty in midfield!Jonny May raced down the left flank after a lovely pass from Slade and then kicked beyond the Irish defence. Slade, who was just about onside, gets there first and grounds the ball to leave the Aviva Stadium in a state of shock! Farrell misses the conversion, but England lead by nine...England break downfield, and Henry Slade may have just won this match!65 mins: Sean O’Brien comes on, replacing CJ Stander. Much has been made of Ireland’s depth – now is the time to make it pay. England make a change, too – Harry Williams replaces Kyle Sinckler, who has been a spiky presence throughout.64 mins: The move runs out of steam, and Ringrose knocks on, with Lawes risking a penalty as he comes in from the side.63 mins: Larmour gets involved down the left, before Sexton gets the wind taken out of him by a Courtney Lawes tackle. Ireland keep pushing forward...Farrell never quite looks comfortable, and pulls his effort wide left. Changes for Ireland: Dave Kilcoyle and Andrew Porter replace Healy and Furlong. Roux came on for Devin Toner.60 mins: Penalty! A trangression from Ireland this time, Replacement Quinn Roux leaving his hands in the ruck, and Owen Farrell will try to stretch England’s lead back to seven...59 mins: This is such a brutal contest now, both sets of players colliding again and again, the thuds echoing around the stadium. Jack Nowell is the latest to throw himself into the green wall, which doesn’t move an inch.57 mins: Ireland scrum, with Hughes and Lawes lining up in an unfamiliar lock partnership for England. The hosts retrain the ball, but Slade makes a key tackle to stop them progressing downfield.Worrying news for England – Maro Itoje has hobbled off with an ankle problem. He’s replaced by Nathan Hughes, while Jack Nowell is also walking a little gingerly. There’s also been a tactical change – Courtney Lawes is on for George Kruis.Jonny Sexton takes the three points on offer, and cuts the deficit to four.“This is a superb game of rugby, and an aggressive England are great value for their lead so far,” writes Guy Hornsby. “But it’s still our familiar Achilles heel that could be our undoing: discipline. We’re giving away too many penalties. Sooner or later it’ll come home to roost, I fear.”The penalty count is now England 7-1 Ireland.53 mins: Ireland’s big beasts – Stander, Furlong, Ryan – all involved as the hosts try to batter their way to the line. Tuilagi leads the England resistance with a couple of big hits – but Sinckler goes in high on Ringrose, and it’s another Irish penalty.51 mins: Ireland hare downfield and Slade so nearly gives the ball up, under pressure from Stockdale! Sexton collects it, but we’ll go back for an Ireland scrum. Could that be a turning point?50 mins: England move within 10 metres, Tuilagi going toe-to-toe with Aki in an effort to find a gap. Ireland have numbers back, and Ringrose absolutely levels Farrell with a tackle that pops the ball out!48 mins: More sterling work from Jonny May under the high ball, earning England a scrum. England have been dominant in 30 tackles, compared to Ireland’s seven. That’s quite the stat.46 mins: Ireland are feeling the heat, and O’Mahony loses his rag with Sinckler, grabbing him by the collar and labelling him a “stupid cee”, or similar. The referee has a word with them both, and we’ll restart with an Ireland lineout.45 mins: Ireland haven’t really made a crack in this white wall since Healy’s try. They’re inching forward here, and get an advantage - but Sexton kicks across field, and England get it back. A kick through is reeled in by Henshaw, again under intense pressure from the England backs.44 mins: A little sloppy from England – they fail to collect a lineout in midfield, before Farrell’s kick for the corner flies into touch.43 mins: Larmour for Earls is a tactical change, so I’m told.42 mins: An exchange of kicks before Youngs scoops up Murray’s pass and England press forward. Ireland have a lineout near their own line, and win it, allowing Murray to heave it clear.A half-time change for Ireland: Keith Earls, who took a couple of hammerings in the first half, is replaced by Jordan Larmour.The players are heading back out. “Forty minutes is a long time in Test rugby,” warns Brian O’Driscoll, who looks like he’s itching to throw on the old green jersey and get there.England came flying out of the traps, Jonny May scoring a try inside two minutes. Ireland kept their heads to rally and take the lead, but Eddie Jones’ men came back stronger, scoring through Elliot Daly and so nearly getting a third through Mako Vunipola.The visitors have mixed attacking elegance with defensive aggression, and are good value for their half-time lead. There’s a long way to go, though – can they keep the mistakes to a minimum in the face of an Irish fightback?Take your pick from these:No try, but a penalty for England from that previous advantage – and Farrell collects the three points. After a thrilling, ferocious first half, they lead by seven!The TMO, Glenn Newman, has the hottest collar in Dublin just now. Garces is leaning towards NO TRY, but wants confirmation from the Kiwi, frantically scrolling through replays...TRY? Advantage for England, but they keep plugging for the line – and Mako Vunipola es beneath CJ Stander to ground the ball! Garces is going to the TMO, to check for a double movement...38 mins: Mako Vunipola breaks free of the scrum and offloads to Nowell, who is somehow held up on the line by a swarm of green shirts. England retain the ball, and can sense a third try...38 mins: A pivotal moment perhaps? Rory Best can’t deliver a straight lineout 5m out, and England have a scrum with two minutes of the half to go.36 mins: Murray can’t find touch and Billy Vunipola comes barrelling down the field. England sweep forward, Jamie George leading the next phase – but eventually, Jack Nowell is forced into touch on the right flank.35 mins: Murray collects a kick, and is unceremoniously bundled into touch by May. England very much up for this, defending with controlled aggression. From the England lineout, a deft chip kick through has Henshaw in trouble, but he does well to collect under pressure from May.33 mins: Ireland travel the width of the pitch in search of a gap in the England defence. Eddie Jones’ side are holding firm as the contest gets physical. You can hear the thuds of the tackles, the forwards gasping for air.32 mins: Slade has looked very tidy indeed on his first Six Nations start. There’s a nice balance in the middle, with Slade alongside Tualagi and Farrell ahead.Stockdale is there to collect, but under ferocious pressure from Nowell, he spills the ball – and Daly, chasing down his own kick, touches down ahead of Furlong! Farrell converts, and England are back in front.29 mins: England claim the lineout, and Daly sends a diagonal kick through for Nowell to chase...28 mins: Henry Slade gets the ball down despite the efforts of Tadhg Furlong, and England stay in Irish territory. Farrell and Slade try to put pressure on Henshaw, and the latter effort works, forcing the full-back to find touch with his left boot.26 mins: Plenty of aggression from both teams, and the decision to go for the try pays off for Ireland, who edge in front, the ship very much steadied.England hold Ireland off, pinned back on their own line, and repel Conor Murray’s e for the line. It can’t last, though, and Cian Healy eventually forces his way over. Sexton with the conversion, out wide to the right – and he nails it.23 mins: A bold move from Ireland, turning down the three points to go for the line against 15 men. They win the lineout, straighten up the maul and pile towards the line..."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d55a03457549ec041dce504eb5b7ebe9d40784a4/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d311591313a270c0a5fa7935068f5589","title":"six best wild runs trail running mountains forests uk","story":"‘Going for a run’ is exhilarating when forests and mountains are the backdrop. Two trail runners pick six stunning routes for beginners from their new bookThere’s no doubt that running as a pastime is booming big city marathons report record numbers of entries – London received over 250,000 applications for its 40,000 places in 2018 – and Parkrun interest has soared, from 13 runners in 2004 to over three million globally today. But the focus has always been parks and pavements, with off-road running dominated by cross-country and fell races. Now, more of us are venturing into fields, forests, moors and mountains in search of a wilder kind of running.Trail running allows you to experience the thrill of running through spectacular landscapes without the need for tricky navigation, and you don’t need to be an expert runner. Here are six routes that are great for beginners – all you need are running shoes and you’re off.Why Great Langdale is a runner’s paradise, surrounded by awe-inspiring peaks yet with a network of lower-level trails offering routes to suit everyone.The Langdale Horseshoe fell race, held in October each year, takes on the jagged skyline that encircles the head of the valley. At its opposite end, Loughrigg Fell guards the opening to Langdale, separating it from Grasmere and Ambleside.Rising to just 335 metres, this is only a mini-mountain by Lakeland standards however, its stepped terraces and well-maintained trails make for some thoroughly enjoyable running. Fine views from the summit reach far across the central fells, and both Grasmere and Rydal Water at its foot are fantastic spots for a post-run swim.Do it Head south from the start, crossing the road and the footbridge over the river that runs between Grasmere and Rydal. Turn left, following the riverside path through woodland to reach Pelter Bridge. Turn right on the road here for a short section, then turn right on a footpath up Fox Ghyll, continuing south-west to Ivy Crag. Turn right here, passing Loughrigg Tarn on your left. At Intake Wood, turn left and follow the steep path up to the summit of Loughrigg Fell. Descend north to Loughrigg Terrace, turning right here and following the surfaced path until you can turn sharp left down to Grasmere, recrossing the footbridge to return to the start.Why In Devon’s South Hams district, the twin villages of Noss Mayo and Newton Ferrers lie either side of Newton Creek, a tidal inlet of the River Yealm.Do it From the start in Noss Mayo follow Passage Road along the southern bank of Newton Creek to Yealm Estuary. Join the South West Coast Path here, heading west around Gara Point, then east past Stoke Beach and Beacon Hill to Wadham Beach. After the ruined tea house turn left, leaving the coast path and following a track to reach a lane. Cross over and follow quiet, winding lanes down through Membland to Newton Creek. Turn left to return to Noss Mayo.Refuel at the Ship Inn, right on the waterfront at Noss Mayo. Stay at Plantation House Hotel in Ermington (from £110).Distance: 10 miles16kmStartfinish: Dale Head, BD24 9PWDifficulty: Moderate to challengingFull route detailsWhy: Rising to 694m in the heart of the Yorkshire Dales national park, Pen-y-Ghent is the third- highest top in Yorkshire, visited on the annual Three Peaks Race, a classic on the fell racing calendar that also takes in neighbouring Ingleborough and Whernside. A fantastic section of the Pennine Way runs right over Pen-y-Ghent’s long, ridgeline summit on its 268-mile journey from Edale in the Peak District to Kirk Yetholm, just across the Scottish border.The Pennine Way in its entirety is one of the world’s great running challenges, with many an epic battle having been fought along its windswept miles. The current record is 65 hours, 20 minutes and 15 seconds, set by Mike Hartley in July 1989 and last month Jasmin Paris took the overall record for the annual Montane Spine Race, which is run non-stop on the same route (but in winter and without support), completing it in 83 hours, 12 minutes and 23 seconds.Do it: Pen-y-Ghent can either be tackled as a thoroughly enjoyable out-and-back from Horton-in-Ribblesdale, following the signed footpath from Brackenbottom to the summit and back (5 miles in total), or via a more adventurous circuit that explores the beautiful surrounding dales.For our route, follow the Pennine Way from Dale Head, crossing the summit of Pen-y-Ghent and descending its northern ridge to reach, and cross, Plover Hill. Continue north to reach the Pennine Journey bridleway. Turn right here and follow it to Foxup, turning right again to reach a footpath along Pen-y-Ghent Gill.Follow this path to reach a road near Giant’s Grave cairn, crossing this and continuing to Blishmire House. Join the road here and follow it back to Dale Head.Stay and refuel Rooms and sustenance are available at the friendly Golden Lion pub in Settle (from £115 per night).Why The Great Pond and Little Pond at Frensham lie amid 900 acres of wildlife-rich heath and woodland on the western edge of the Surrey Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Now owned by the National Trust, the ponds were created in the 13th century to supply fish for the Bishop of Winchester on his visits to Farnham Castle.Crisscrossed by inviting trails, perfect for exploring at a run, and with swimming permitted in the Great Pond, this is a tranquil haven in the busy south-east and a perfect car-free escape from London (by train to Farnham, less than an hour from Waterloo). Listen out for resident woodlarks and, at dusk, the “churring” call of the rare nightjar.Do it From the car park follow the obvious bridleway north-east across Frensham Common, crossing the A287 before turning left. Continue north to the edge of the common, turning right to reach the Little Pond. Trace the footpath around the pond’s eastern shore, joining a track at the south-east corner.Follow this track until you can turn right onto a bridleway, then follow it to a footbridge. Turn left after the bridge and continue along the bridleway to Pond Lane at the south-eastern tip of the Great Pond. Follow Pond Lane to return to the start.Why Set within the ancient Caledonian pine forests of Rothiemurchus, Loch an Eilein, with its castle-topped island and mountain backdrop, is a place of utter tranquillity. Yet, positioned at the foot of the Cairngorms and with a winding network of trails that lead invitingly into the surrounding forest, there are plenty of adventures to be found here, too.Our run follows the gently undulating trail right around the loch, looking out for the resident red squirrels and pine martens as you go. However, if you’re keen to explore further, the Lairig Ghru, one of Scotland’s best-known mountain passes, runs near to Loch an Eilein on its way up onto the Cairngorm plateau, continuing for a full marathon distance to Braemar.Whichever route you choose, finish with a swim in the silver waters of the loch.Do it From the car park, pick up the path south to the left of Loch an Eilein and along the north-east shore to a path junction and footbridge. Cross and turn right, continuing south-west through the forest to another path junction and footbridge over the burn that runs between Loch Gamhna and Loch an Eilein.Turn left here and follow the path south-west initially, then bear right around the southern end of Loch Gamhna. Head back north-east up the other side of the loch and then left along the southern shore of Loch an Eilein. Follow the shore around to the right, heading through a gate and past the castle, continuing straight on to return to the start.Refuel at the Druie cafe, next door to the Rothiemurchus Centre.Stay at the wonderful Old Ferryman’s House B\u0026ampB in nearby Boat of Garten (from £43).Why In the southern reaches of Snowdonia, 9,000-acre Coed-y-Brenin forest park stretches across the wide valley between the Rhinogydd and Arenig mountain ranges. Hidden within these wooded hills, Britain’s first dedicated trail running centre, Run Coed-y-Brenin, holds a number of running events throughout the year and is a must-visit for trail runners of all levels.Many miles of well-maintained, waymarked trails wind through magical forest, tracing fast-flowing rivers and climbing steeply to reach open summits with outstanding views of the surrounding mountains.Choose from a number of waymarked routes, from the 2.7-mile Sarn Helen short trail to the surprisingly challenging Half Marathon, all offering exciting running on a mixture of narrow, winding tracks and wide forest paths.Do it This route follows the clearly waymarked Goldrush trail clockwise from the main Coed-y-Brenin visitor centre. Maps of the different trails are available, allowing endless variations on the route. From the start, head south-east on the trail then bear left, climbing steeply before turning south and heading back down to reach the road by the Afon Mawddach.Cross on a footbridge and go up the hill on the other side. Recross the river and road further south-west, then run up the western edge of the woods and back to the visitor centre to finish.Refuel at the Visitor Centre’s Forest Cafe, where you can also stock up on kit at the shop.Stay with friendly hosts at Mostyn Cottage, five minutes from the trails (B\u0026ampBself-catering from £80).

The pope, who arrives in Abu Dhabi on Sunday evening, will hold talks with the crown prince, address the interfaith meeting, celebrate mass at a sports stadium, and lay foundation stones with the Grand Imam, Ahmed Al Tayyib, for a new church and mosque.The two faith leaders will sign a global agreement of “peace, fraternity and mutual respect on behalf of their billions of followers around the world”.In a video message recorded before the trip, Francis said the UAE sought to be “a model of coexistence, brotherhood, and encounter between different civilisations and cultures”. He looked forward to writing “a new page in the history of relations between religions, confirming that we are brothers and sisters, even though we are different.”The UAE has proclaimed 2019 the “year of tolerance” to promote it as a moderate, stable and inclusive nation.The government has launched an anti-discrimination law, a ministry of tolerance and an International Institute for Tolerance to challenge extremism and promote the UAE as a role model for co-existence.Catholics from the expatriate community are expected to make up a majority of those attending the mass on Tuesday. Bishop Paul Hinder, the vicar apostolic of Southern Arabia – the head of the Catholic church in the UAE, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Yemen – said Francis’s visit to the “very heart of Islam” would “set a sign, namely that we must build bridges even if we do not believe in the same things”.He told Alle Welt, a Catholic magazine: “This without doubt is a historic visit, as a pope has never been to the Arab Peninsula before and until recently was considered unthinkable.” Christians in the Gulf had been “waiting for this visit for a very long time,” he added.“I’m afraid some of them may be disappointed as not all those who want will be able to participate for logistical reasons.” The Arab population was also “very open and enthusiastic about the visit,” he said.But Emile Nakhleh, a former CIA official, said the papal visit could not be justified when the UAE was embroiled in the war in Yemen.“It’s just not good optics for the pope to be visiting the UAE when they are still involved in all kinds of humanitarian atrocities in Yemen,” he told National Catholic Reporter.“If he does not raise this issue, the pope would lose much credibility in the Middle East.”Father Paul Lansu of the Catholic peace organisation Pax Christi International said he hoped the pope could “convince the leadership of the Emirates to find another policy concerning Yemen”.Last year, the UN said the Saudi-led coalition had killed thousands of Yemenis in airstrikes and may have committed war crimes under international law. This month UN officials said more than 10 million people in Yemen were at risk of starvation.According to Open Doors, which monitors Christian persecution around the world, in the UAE “Christian expatriates are free to worship in private, but the government does not allow them to evangelise or pray in public. Converts from Islam endure the most persecution as they face pressure from family members and the local community to recant their Christian faith.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/132e8e91c151f583679bcefc6f83af9eadddcf61/0_302_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31599afa0cb1f75bf42831a3f6ae488d","title":"tomb containing 50 mummies uncovered in egypt","story":"Pharaonic tomb dating back more than 2,000 years discovered at Tuna el-Gebel siteEgyptian archaeologists have uncovered a Pharaonic tomb containing 50 mummies dating back to the Ptolemaic era (323-30BC) , in Minya, south of Cairo, the ministry of antiquities said.The mummies, 12 of which were of children, were discovered inside four, nine-metre-deep burial chambers in the Tuna el-Gebel archaeological site.The identities of the mummies were still unknown, said Mostafa Waziri, secretary-general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities.“We have not found names written in hieroglyphics,” he said.

Well, it’s that sort of the feeling … because you know you are part of history,” she added.“Right now we have him at the edge of the cliff,” said Julio Ávila, a television operator, said of Maduro. “All we need to do is push him off.”Valentina Landaeta, a 22-year-old businesswoman, said: “This is our last opportunity – believe me. If the government doesn’t fall now, it won’t happen. It is now or never.”Around her, euphoric demonstrators began to dance and chant: “Yo quiero whiskey! Yo quiero ron! Pa celebrar cuando se vaya este cabrón!” (“I want whiskey! I want rum! To celebrate when this bastard is gone!”)Juan Guaidó, the politician whose recent decision to declare himself Venezuela’s rightful president opened what many believe could be a decisive chapter in the opposition’s battle to bring down Maduro, told supporters they were part of a historic and “unstoppable” movement.“I have absolute certainty that change is very near in Venezuela,” Guaidó said.Dissenters had descended on Caracas from across the country to turn up the heat on Maduro, who was returned to office last May in elections widely denounced as a fraud.Marikeshimä Epianyüü, an indigenous woman from Sierra de Perijá, near Venezuela’s border with Colombia, said she had travelled for more than a day to take part.“This isn’t a revolution. This is a robbery,” she complained of the Bolivarian crusade Maduro inherited from Chávez six years ago.“These people have thrown us into the worst misery we have ever suffered in history.”Américo de Grazia, an opposition politician from the south-eastern state of Bolívar, said he was convinced Venezuela’s military would soon ditch its embattled commander-in-chief. “I believe it is a matter of hours.”Many carried homemade banners or posters emblazoned with slogans such as: “No more dictatorship”, “I’m fighting for my country and the return of my children!” and “The senior citizens are tired of your lies Maduro”.The children were angry too. “I want Nicolás out,” said Joswald Castro, a five-year-old boy from a poor Caracas community called El Cementerio. Why? “So we can eat,” he replied.Maria Vallera, from Petare, a sprawling slum in the city’s east, had brought a statue of the Virgin of the Valley to the march, hoping she would boost the opposition cause.“I’m 75 years old and I’ve never experienced a nightmare like this of hunger, misery and scarcity,” Vallera complained. “It is a nightmare – a true nightmare.”Huge crowds gathered in other Venezuelan cities to demand Maduro’s exit.“Look, I think these are the final days,” said Alberto Paniz-Mondolfi, a doctor who was one of tens of thousands protesting in Barquisimeto, Venezuela’s fourth-largest city.Large demonstrations were also reported in Barinas, capital of the state where Chávez was born and raised, and Maracaibo, the country’s No 2 city.Maduro struck a defiant note at a rival pro-government march in central Caracas commemorating the 20th anniversary of Chávez’s inauguration as president, on 2 February 1999.He accused the “imperialist” US president Donald Trump of launching a “ghoulish plan” to dethrone him in order to seize Venezuelan resources.“You think you are the emperor of the world – that Venezuela will surrender and obey your orders. But know this: Venezuela will not give in. Venezuela will advance. Venezuela is rebellious. Venezuela is free, sovereign and independent.“I ask all Venezuelans: should we hand the sovereignty of our country over to the gringos?” Maduro shouted. “No!” the crowd cried back.“Should we hand our oil wealth over to Donald Trump? Should be become a gringo colony?” On the wall beside him, a rebel artist had daubed the word “tyranny” in large red letters.Back at the opposition march, Ignacio Rangel, a 28-year-old English teacher, said he was unsure how long Maduro might last or how he might leave power – through peaceful negotiations, through a coup, or perhaps even through a US military intervention.“I wouldn’t like for it to happen – but if it has to go that way, I’m all for it,” he said of the last option.Of one thing Rangel and many others marchers seemed convinced.“There is no more chavismo,” he said. “Chavismo is over.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9bb7caff362af4cb96195c6848c5ed7aaea3dd8/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=811fe9d5de7f84bb9ab8d4ff1f20cb9c","title":"tell us about the issues men face today","story":"From mental health to relationships, we’d like to hear from men of all ages about what they are really thinkingThe debate around modern-day masculinity has intensified in the wake of the #MeToo movement, and we are asking men to tell us what they are really thinking.As the role of men and women in society continue to change, so too do the dynamics from the workplace to the bedroom and everywhere in between.

Photograph: Finbarr O’RourkeThe Government may postpone the implementation of a major plan to tackle climate change in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Ministers this week discussed the prospect of pausing the initiative, which aims to make Ireland a world leader in reducing carbon emissions.Minister for Climate Action and the Environment Richard Bruton received Cabinet approval last November to proceed with a scheme that will make every Government department and State agency adopt and implement specific actions and targets in their own areas. Mr Bruton updated the Cabinet sub-committee on infrastructure on Thursday on its progress, with a final report expected by the end of March.It was discussed at the meeting that, while work would continue on drafting the plan, it could be “paused” if there is a no-deal Brexit, according to sources. Its implementation would continue as envisaged if there is an orderly Brexit.Those present included Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed, Minister for Transport Shane Ross, Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe and Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy. The vast majority of the Government’s time after March, it was argued by one source, would be taken up with dealing with the ramifications of the UK crashing out of the EU, if such a scenario arises. However, it is not known how long a pause on Mr Bruton’s plan would last.Another source said there were “concerns that a big move now on climate when the farmers are facing a potential Brexit apocalypse mightn’t be the wisest thing politically”. The Irish Farmers’ Association has said 70,000 beef farmers would be put out of business if the UK imposed €1.7 billion in tariffs on Irish food imports, as the Government has forecast in a “crash-out” Brexit.Mr Creed warned Cabinet this week that the beef industry faced an existential crisis as viability would be lost should the UK impose tariffs of up to 70 per cent on imports.The agricultural sector would face a double-whammy in the event of the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal at the end of March. This would be from massive import taxes on the 250,000 tonnes of beef to the UK, half of all Irish beef exports, and reduced prices from the beef displaced from the UK flooding EU markets. The Government estimates that UK tariffs would cost the Irish food industry €1.7 billion, of which the beef industry – the agricultural sector most affected by a hard Brexit – would account for €700 million.Mr Creed told EU agricultural commissioner Phil Hogan this week that the industry would require both emergency EU aid and European Commission approval to loosen state aid rules for a domestic bailout to “ride out” the impact of tariffs.A spokesperson for Mr Bruton said: “The cabinet committee agreed to establish 11 high-level interdepartmental teams which will develop actions across Government to step up Ireland’s response to climate change in a range of key areas which require action across government. “Very tight timelines were agreed for this work to be completed, so that Minister Bruton is still in a position to bring a plan to Cabinet for approval by the end of March this year.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3779363.1549056341!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"extreme cold in the us and extreme heat in australia all due to climate change","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t A man walks along an ice-covered break-wall along Lake Michigan, Chicago,  while temperatures were hovering around -20 degrees on January 31st. Photograph: Scott OlsonGetty ImagesThe freezing temperatures in the United States and intense heat in Australia that were witnessed this week both have their origins in climate change, according to two Irish scientists. Emeritus professor of geography at Maynooth University John Sweeney and director of the Icarus climate change unit at the college, professor Peter Thorne said it was becoming more evident that extreme weather events were linked to climate change. Prof Sweeney, who contributed to the Nobel Prize Winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, says we are likely to see the evidence of climate change in every extreme weather event, across the globe. He said the amount of energy being trapped in the atmosphere was the equivalent “of one or two Hiroshima bombs per second”. All that energy was bound to have an effect on climate, he said. According to Prof Sweeney events in the upper atmosphere were causing the jet stream, which is an air flow going from west to east, to “lurch north and south”. When it lurches south it brings cold polar air further south and when it lurches north it brings warmer, tropical air further north. He said this was why extremes of cold that are now being experienced in the US can be seen to be related to extremes of hot weather like Europe experienced last summer. Prof Peter Thorne director of the Irish Climate Analysis and Research UnitS group (Icarus) at Maynooth University said the link between the heat in Australia and climate change and was easier to prove than the link between the polar vortex over the US midwest and climate change. He said the links in the evidence supporting US extreme weather event to climate change were long and complex, but he had no doubt they were valid.Parts of the US faced colder temperatures than Antarctic this week as a polar vortex saw cold air of minus 40 degrees moving in from the Midwest to New York and the east coast. In Chicago, people were warned of the dangers of getting frostbite on exposed skin as social media carried images of wet hair instantly freezing and hot water thrown in the air turning immediately to snow. Meanwhile in Australia record breaking heat saw wildfires rage and temperatures of 47 degrees were recorded Adelaide for the first time. US president Donald Trump tweeted on Monday: “In the beautiful Midwest, windchill temperatures are reaching minus 60 degrees, the coldest ever recorded. In coming days, expected to get even colder. People can’t last outside even for minutes. What the hell is going on with Global Warming ? Please come back fast, we need you!” Shortly after the official US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration responded with a tweet of its own: “Winter storms don’t prove that global warming isn’t happening.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3780394.1549131225!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nurses extend strike action with two more stoppages this month","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tINMO general secretary Phil Ní Sheaghdha with Catherine Sheridan, (left), Eilish Fitzgerald and Dr Edward Mathews, INMO industrial relations director prior to the INMO meeting on Saturday Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation has announced a major escalation in its dispute with the Government over pay.The INMO will hold two extra days of strike action on February 19th and 21st to go along with the already-announced strikes on February 5th, 7th, 12th, 13th and 14th.It will also escalate the number of nursing services on strike which will increase from 82 to 240. This will mean that respite services for people with intellectual disabilities and also the elderly will be taken into the dispute.The announcement followed a meeting of the INMO executive in Dublin on Saturday.INMO general secretary Phil Ní Sheaghdha criticised the “threats and intransigence” in response to the pay demand by nurses from the Government.“Nurses and midwives proudly stood up in defence of our patients and professions last Wednesday,” she said.“Everybody – except the government – recognise that there is a serious understaffing problem in our health services. The public support for the strike on Wednesday showed that the Irish people stand with nurses and midwives.“Our message is clear. We will not be going away. Resolving this dispute requires direct engagement from the government, recognising the real recruitment and retention problems in Irish nursing and midwifery.“We simply want to be able to do our jobs, but our health service cannot hire enough nurses and midwives on these uncompetitive wages. As ever, we remain available for talks with the government for any realistic proposals.”Minister for Health Simon Harris said he regrets the union\u0027s decision and said there “is an onus on both sides to engage in talks”.\u0026nbspMore than 30,000 nurses from the INMO manned picket lines outside hospitals on Wednesday after talks aimed at resolving the issue failed.Prior to the meeting on Saturday where the INMO decided to extend the strike, Ms Ní Sheaghdha said there had been little activity from the Government to resolve the dispute.Nurses are seeking a pay rise of around €7,000 per annum, or the equivalent of 12 per cent, saying such an increase would bring nursing salaries into line with equivalent health professions, such as physiotherapists, and would also deal with recruitment and retention issues.The Government has said any such pay rise would cost approximately €300 million every year and would lead to knock-on-claims from other public service employees.It warned the State would have to borrow to fund pay increases of this level.Ms Ní Sheaghdha criticised comments by Tánaiste Simon Coveney, that the Government was looking at sanctions to be used against striking nurses. She described them as an attempt to “deviate from the real problem, which is recruitment and retention”.She added: “The health service is in a crisis. We have a seen a massive overrun on the children’s hospital. I haven’t seen any penalties for those that are responsible for that.“There seems to be a big emphasis on penalties for nurses and midwives who have been forced to take a stand to improve a health services that will be available for citizens of this country into the future.On Thursday Mr Coveney said the Government was taking legal advice about their available options in response to the strikes. “We are taking legal advice about the options that are available to us consistent with the (public sector) pay agreement.“There is a responsibility on the Government to deliver on that. “There is also responsibility on the unions and their leadership to fulfil on those obligations and that is what protects Ireland in terms of industrial peace.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3780336.1549114009!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"prepare for a united ireland sinn f%C3%A9in tells unionists","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLeader of Sinn Féin Mary Lou McDonald. Photograph: Tom HonanThe Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald has said that the unionist community needs to be a part of planning for a united Ireland. Party activists from across Ireland gathered in Dublin on Saturday to discuss the campaign for Irish unity and what they say is a “growing demand for a unity poll”.Ms McDonald reiterated her challenge to the government to convene an Irish unity forum and said unionists have to start planning for “all eventualities”.She said: “Obviously, our unionist brothers and sisters need to be part of planning a new Ireland, their first option, of course, is to maintain the union with Britain and we respect that, but as one ex-leader of the DUP put it, they need to start now planning for all eventualities and unionism needs a Plan B.”Ms McDonald claimed that the growing likelihood of a no-deal Brexit has pushed the idea of Irish reunification to the forefront of politics, but she believes mindset is the biggest stumbling block.She added: “The Good Friday Agreement provides a route to remove the border once and for all. Regardless of Brexit, there will be a unity referendum.“In our time we now have an opportunity denied to generations — a peaceful and democratic route to Irish unity to build a new and united Ireland.“There are those who believe Irish unity is a pipe dream.“Some old wives’ tale about the four green fields, some don’t yet appreciate the huge opportunity that Irish unity can present for all of us socially and economically, and those that are hostile to the idea.“There are those who are not unionists but part of the establishment here in the south who might be hostile to the idea, or anything that upsets the apple cart, and those people are in the minority, the vast majority of people know that Ireland is changing and needs to change more.”Former Northern Ireland first minister and DUP leader Peter Robinson said in July he believed the North should prepare for the possibility of a united Ireland.Speaking at the MacGill Summer School in Glenties, Co Donegal, Mr Robinson said he did not think Northern Ireland will want to leave the UK but that there is no reason they should not prepare for it.“I don’t expect my own house to burn down but I still insure it because it could happen,” he said. – PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

The  has dubbed it a “secret weapon”.It is the key to a newly hatched Plan B, supported by both hardliners like Rees-Mogg and some moderates in prime minister Theresa May’s Conservative party.If the prime minister fails to return from her negotiations in Brussels with what Boris Johnson has called a “freedom clause” to get out of the Irish backstop, expect Brexiteers to push what they call an Article 24 arrangement.Most of us aren’t well-versed in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the 1948 agreement to reduce trade barriers that is now part of the World Trade Organization.But Article 24 is well-known to experts as the rule that allows groups of countries to discriminate in favour of each other without having to treat all trading partners equally, as the World Trade Organisation’s (WTO) most-favoured nation rules require.Brexiteers argue that the UK and the EU can use Article 24 – and especially paragraph five’s provision for an “interim” arrangement that can last up to 10 years while a permanent deal is being negotiated – to agree a zero-tariff deal with the EU until a long-term free-trade agreement is developed.Presto: Brexit happens on March 29th with no food and medicine shortages, no Irish backstop, no border controls and no panic. If only.The problem here isn’t in drafting a deal quickly. It can be done over lunch, if you know what you are doing. Lorand Bartels of the University of Cambridge’s law faculty, does and did, recently devise a full, ready-made Article 24-compliant agreement, which he tweeted. It contains three brief articles as well as an annex and fits neatly onto three-quarters of a page.Brexiteers seized on the paper as proof an Article 24 Brexit is possible – but they missed the simple point of Bartels’s exercise.Striking a bare-bones trade agreement isn’t hard but it would never come close to replicating the frictionless system that allows the crankshaft used in a Mini to cross the Channel three times before the finished car rolls off the assembly line.It wouldn’t cover service industries, which account for 80 per cent of the UK economy and 45 per cent of total UK exports. A bare-bones Article 24 deal would say nothing about regulations, standards or access to each other’s customs databases.Nor, crucially, would it remove border friction. Brexiteers suggest Article 24 can be used to get rid of the hated backstop that would keep the Irish border open under May’s deal.But Article 24’s reference to measures to “facilitate frontier traffic” in adjacent countries was intended for grazing cattle – provided they return home after crossing the border. It doesn’t begin to address the unique circumstances in Northern Ireland.Of course, the UK can’t sign an Article 24 deal unilaterally it would require agreement from the EU. And why would the bloc consent to anything that imperils the €44.5 billion orce settlement that the UK has already signed up to, or put its cherished Irish backstop in jeopardy?Should Brexiteers insist on going the “interim” deal route – perhaps an easier sell politically – it still wouldn’t be a cinch. Such an agreement must include a timetable and a schedule of items that will be covered in the final agreement.Article 24 is vague about how long this has to be, but Peter Ungphakorn, who worked in the WTO secretariat for nearly two decades, reckons it’s a lot longer than a page.“It has to say what is being implemented in the interim, and give some indication of what the final deal will cover, and how the talks will get there,” he says.And then other WTO members could demand the interim agreement be changed, especially if they felt their own interests were hurt.They could even object if they think it sets a bad precedent. That could lead to disputes – just as the WTO’s dispute settlement mechanism is jammed because the Trump administration has blocked the appointment of new judges for it.Repeat something often enough and it acquires a veneer of respectability. Pretty soon, it just becomes accepted.That has been the case with a no-deal Brexit: It was unthinkable even for Leavers during the 2016 campaign then it was on the fringes of the debate now it is at its very heart, and accepted by four in 10 voters.So clarity on the facts something that never happened during the 2016 campaign, when a distinctly dubious claim about how Brexit would free up £350 million a week for the National Health Service was plastered across a red bus and believed by many is important.Getting a zero-tariff deal with the EU for goods is a reasonable long-term aim, even if it wouldn’t remove all the frictions, especially in services, and non-tariff barriers that will come into play after Brexit.Article 24 exists and is in use. But it isn’t a mechanism by which the extreme economic harm of a no-deal departure can be avoided.It is time to put the idea to rest, before someone puts it on the side of a bus. – BloombergDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination.

Most, though, were already self-harming and went online “to make sense of their behaviours”.What they experienced online, however, largely normalised their harming so that it became “a routine, everyday activity”, said the researchers. The children were also able to discover and share new practices and techniques.“They became motivated to engage in further harm … the exposure to other iniduals’ severe acts made them want to become better self-harmers,” the study reports.One woman, aged 19, told researchers she was left feeling one small cut was “not nearly good enough”.The researchers discovered a “sense of competition”. One woman, aged 23, said she chided herself when she saw images: “Why can’t I do it like that?”Tumblr was cited as the favoured site because it was easy to search and find images, enabled image sharing and was “not encumbered by the monitoring and intervention by other social media and microblogging sites”, said the study. Instagram also featured.What to do if you find out your child is self-harmingDr Nina Jacob, who led the research, said: “The lack of scrutiny and moderation, where you can purportedly ‘do what the hell you like’, together with perceived anonymity, meant the site was considered more authentic than alternative platforms.”One 19-year-old woman told researchers: “Kids as young as 12 can use it … and there’s a big self-harm community on there. I got sucked into it and it did sort of increase the intensity of my self-harm again.”In the study approved by the university’s ethics committee, the researchers displayed ads on 42,000 Facebook accounts, before 21 self-harmers – 18 girls and 3 boys – aged 16 to 24 volunteered for in-depth interviews.Three quarters were attracted to sites that provided self-harming images. One described them as “triggering a rush like an addictive high”.Dr Jon Goldin, vice-chairman of the child and adolescent faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: “When people look up the words ‘self-harm’ they should be directed to helpful sites which offer guidance and support, not to images of people hurting themselves,” he said.How to get help | Do you need someone to talk to?Tumblr refused to say how many moderators it employed but said it had teams to quickly take down any material that violated its rules by glorifying self-harm, and worked with charities and mental health experts to provide advice that automatically popped up when people put in self-harm searches.Victoria McCullough, Tumblr director of social impact and policy, said: “Research has shown that deletion of content posted by iniduals struggling with mental health issues can have the unintended consequence of ostracising them and preventing them from seeking out the support they need. Together with government and advocacy leaders, we’re working to develop innovative approaches that help those in need.”Duty of Care CampaignComment: Nicky Morgan: I\u0026#39ve lost Remainer friends because I backed Brexit compromiseMental health crises account for one in ten military evacuations, figures released under FOI showNicolas Maduro floats early elections for opposition-controlled national assembly in desperate bid to calm protestsOpera singer launches legal action over \u0026#39botched\u0026#39 hip replacement he alleges ended his careerTheresa May\u0026#39s deputy warns proposed HS2 reduction will \u0026#39seriously undermine\u0026#39 the case for continuing with the projectSir Oliver Letwin tells stunned local Tory party members: \u0026#39I didn\u0026#39t believe in manifesto\u0026#39Comment: I will battle for Britain in Brussels Theresa May invokes Jeremy Corbyn\u0026#39s support as she pledges to \u0026#39battle for Britain\u0026#39 in BrusselsUniversities are allowing free speech to be curtailed in favour of \u0026#39rule of the mob\u0026#39, former equalities chief warnsFamily of speedboat killer Jack Shepherd targeted with threatening letter, lawyer claimsChocolate wars break out over the colour purpleComment: Twelve reasons why the Irish backstop makes no sense at allCraft beer bubble bursts with glut of new brandsCould a reusable revolution inspired by the milkman cure our addiction to plastic?  Virginia\u0026#39s governor resists pressure to resign over KKK and blackface yearbook photosCarmaker hits trouble with advert that takes pot shot at huntingComment: The EU is taking the hardest possible line in the hope of derailing BrexitJerwood Gallery faces repossession of 300 works of art after row between director and foundationSearch teams hopeful of finding Emiliano Sala plane wreckage as investigation area narrowsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/02/TELEMMGLPICT000187261959_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqM8WtX5VHUoVSDguFOrhRUXUTqu2dxJOGwxIGsQvnbbg.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"virginias governor pressure resign kkk blackface yearbook photos","story":"Ralph Northam has admitted he is one of the two in the photo from his yearbookVirginia\u0027s governor is facing mounting calls for him to resign after pictures emerged from his yearbook of two men dressed in a Ku Klux Klan hood and with blackface.Ralph Northam, a Democrat and former paediatrician, was elected in 2017. But his future now hangs in the balance after conservative website Big League Politics dug out his 1984 medical school yearbook, and found the photo.Mr Northam, 59, insisted at a press conference on Saturday that the picture was not him - despite having apologised on Friday for the page.There is no way I have ever been in a KKK uniform. I have never been in a KKK uniform, and I am not the person on the right, he said.He said he knew it was a hard story to believe, but wanted to set the record straight about the horrific image.“Yesterday I took responsibility for content that appeared on my page. I am not and will not excuse the content. It was racist, offensive and despicable, he told the press conference.He said he saw the page “for the first time” when his staff showed it to him on Friday, adding: “I did not purchase the yearbook at the time.”He said: I believe then, and now, that I was not the person in that photo.It is disgusting. It is racist. It was my responsibility to recognise it and prevent it being published.I know people will find this hard to believe. It appears on my page, with others I submitted.In the hours since I made the statement I reflected with my family and classmates, and concluded that I am not the person in that photo.Friends and classmates had confirmed that it wasn\u0027t him, he said.Where this other picture came from, I don\u0027t know.He said he had once blackened his face, in the same year, at a dance competition in San Antonio when he performed as Michael Jackson. He said it was etched clearly in his mind, as he realised it was wrong.But leading Democrats, including Joe Biden and presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Julian Castro, have joined calls for him to resign, and he has lost the support of most of the Virginia state Democrat leaders.The Virginia Legislative Black Caucus, the state House Democratic Caucus and the state Senate Democratic Caucus all called on Mr Northam to resign late on Friday, along with several key progressive groups that have been some of the governor\u0027s closest political allies.Ralph Northam, the governor of Virginia, was expected to stand downMr Northam apologised profusely on Friday, but many still called for him to step aside and allow the current lieutenant governor of Virginia,  Justin Fairfax, a Democrat who is only the second African American to win statewide office in the state, to take his place. Mr Northam\u0027s term is set to end in 2022.In his first apology, issued in a written statement, Mr Northam called the costume he wore clearly racist and offensive, but he didn\u0027t say which one he had worn.He later issued a video statement saying he was deeply sorry but still committed to serving the remainder of my term.I accept responsibility for my past actions and I am ready to do the hard work of regaining your trust, he said.The apology did not reduce calls for him to resign.Louise Lucas, a state senator and close ally of Mr Northam, described a hastily called conference call with black leaders around the state as intense, her voice breaking.Mr Northam spent years actively courting the black community in the lead up to his 2017 gubernatorial run, building relationships that helped him win both the primary and the general election.He is also a member of a predominantly black church on Virginia\u0027s Eastern Shore, where he grew up.It\u0027s a matter of relationships and trust. That\u0027s not something that you build overnight, he told the AP during a 2017 campaign stop while describing his relationship with the black community.Last week, Florida\u0027s secretary of state resigned after photos from a 2005 Halloween party showed him in blackface while dressed as a Hurricane Katrina victim.Comment: Nicky Morgan: I\u0026#39ve lost Remainer friends because I backed Brexit compromiseMental health crises account for one in ten military evacuations, figures released under FOI showNicolas Maduro floats early elections for opposition-controlled national assembly in desperate bid to calm protestsOpera singer launches legal action over \u0026#39botched\u0026#39 hip replacement he alleges ended his careerTheresa May\u0026#39s deputy warns proposed HS2 reduction will \u0026#39seriously undermine\u0026#39 the case for continuing with the projectSir Oliver Letwin tells stunned local Tory party members: \u0026#39I didn\u0026#39t believe in manifesto\u0026#39Comment: I will battle for Britain in Brussels Theresa May invokes Jeremy Corbyn\u0026#39s support as she pledges to \u0026#39battle for Britain\u0026#39 in BrusselsChildren as young as 12 \u0026#39competing to become better self-harmers\u0026#39Universities are allowing free speech to be curtailed in favour of \u0026#39rule of the mob\u0026#39, former equalities chief warnsFamily of speedboat killer Jack Shepherd targeted with threatening letter, lawyer claimsChocolate wars break out over the colour purpleComment: Twelve reasons why the Irish backstop makes no sense at allCraft beer bubble bursts with glut of new brandsCould a reusable revolution inspired by the milkman cure our addiction to plastic?  Carmaker hits trouble with advert that takes pot shot at huntingComment: The EU is taking the hardest possible line in the hope of derailing BrexitJerwood Gallery faces repossession of 300 works of art after row between director and foundationSearch teams hopeful of finding Emiliano Sala plane wreckage as investigation area narrowsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/11/01/09/amazon-factory-8.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-6643726  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt=   srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/11/01/09/amazon-factory-8.jpg","title":"amazon value drops record christmas sales india","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightNow, the events have been updated to match this greater sense of inclusivity. Ahrendts said, “I always say that the stores are Apple’s biggest product. I think that the architecture of the stores, that’s our hardware and what we do inside is the software. This is an updated software release of the in-store experience. We have over 50 new sessions. Altogether there are 18,000 sessions a week worldwide.”She went on to say that when the Apple Stores were created by Steve Jobs, that the staff were not there to sell. “You know, Steve built Apple Retail. And he told the teams when he hired them that they\u0027re not allowed to sell. He said they have no commission, no quotas. He told them, ‘Your job is to enrich their lives and you have to do it through the lens of education.’ He also said that Apple is the crossroads between liberal arts and technology. Well, we were brilliant in the stores at technology. But how do we unlock that liberal arts piece?”“Being a creative all my life, it\u0027s kind of a dream job for me to help communities be more creative,” Karl Heiselman, a former CEO of brand consultants Wolff Olins, explained. Apple employs staffers in its stores called Creative Pros, who are as heavily trained as the people in the Genius Bars. “We have 3,400 Creative Pros organised by passion or theme –\u0026nbspso photography, music, art and design, coding and app development. They go deep on each one of those, and these people are amazing. Some of them are Emmy winners, celebrated artists and musicians.”Ahrendts added:\u0026nbsp“If you’re a photographer and that’s your passion, we’ll help make you a better photographer, we’ll demo a lens for you. That whole experience of what you do with your iPhone, we want to give you a rich physical experience as well.” The Creative Pros were key to developing the new sessions.Heiselman also made clear that these people are not there just to talk at you. “The thing that defines Today at Apple is it’s not just sharing your story, everyone gets a hands-on. That participatory piece is very important. Because we always say you don\u0027t want to create a session which is like something you can do on the Internet. So maybe an illustrator might share their story and their work and then we hand out iPads and say it’s your turn. We try to, as much as we can, have the audience give it a go.”So, give it a go I did, at previews of the new schedule.New Apple handset to feature three cameras for 3D imagesThe world’s tech giants are about the feel the pinchApple blocks Facebook from installing its internal apps on iPhonesThere are three kinds of sessions in Today at Apple: Skills, Walks and Labs – though the basic sessions introducing customers to Apple products and the ones aimed at explaining accessibility features will continue as before.Skills are the sessions which focus on a particular feature, such as the one I attended on GarageBand, Apple’s deceptively complex music creation app: it looks simple from the outside but is extensive and feature-rich.\u0026nbspI’ve used it but hadn’t been aware of the seemingly endless range of drums available in it. As with all Today at Apple events, you don’t need to bring your own Apple product, or even own one. They’re supplied when you get there, including – to the relief of the other customers in the Apple Store – Beats headphones to keep my attempts at music private. The purpose of the session was pretty specific, to create a beat using the beat sequencer.There are three sections to each event, inspiration, participation and celebration. This means introducing the topic in enough detail to get people wanting to try it and then let them loose on doing it. The final section involved participants sharing their newly created beats. Of course, sharing what you’ve done is voluntary.The Walks events begin inside an Apple Store and then move outdoors. Photography walks have been a staple of Today at Apple for a while, often showing locals parts of their towns they’ve never really seen before. I went to an Art Walk using the amazingly detailed digital illustration app, Procreate. Armed with an iPad Pro, we strolled the area around the store taking photos of colours that took our eye, from a pale green leaf to an eye-searingly bright yellow fire hydrant. These colours were incorporated into the app’s palette and from there we were encouraged to create our own art. My effort, which a psychiatrist might call a cry for help, is below.Walks are the most popular type of session, Heiselman said.And then there are the Labs. These are the most indepth of the events, lasting up to 90 minutes. I tried out \u0027Video Lab: Small Screen Magic, co-created with Zach King\u0027,\u0026nbspwhich concentrated on how to use a jump-cut technique in Apple’s short video app, Clips. The huge video wall was the focus here, where a specially recorded video introduction\u0026nbspfrom King, a YouTube star known for his “digital sleight of hand” was screened.This screen, by the way, has become so central to these stores that the staff jokingly refer to them as being powered by “Wall OS”. And it’s a magnet: once the session started, scores of people who happened to be in the store stopped to hover and watch.The participation section here was particularly fun and the Apple Store was momentarily taken over by the simulation of vanishing and reappearing chairs while attendees performed precipitous prat falls. When edited together, the final cut movies were shown on the wall.All these sessions are free, with materials provided and no selling involved, though the Creative Pros are knowledgeable about the company’s products as well, so can advise you if you’re interested.\u0026nbspAnd those Pros are pretty remarkable. Ahrendts said they’d been training for months, and it shows. They are professional, unflappable and relaxed performers, eager to share their knowledge and their passion.When Apple’s iPhone sales have dipped, as revealed in the latest figures, it’s interesting to see a company make a considerable investment in staffing sessions like this.\u0026nbspBut it’s a cool way to tempt people through its doors.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

How much is Germany’s slowdown actually due to Brexit? And how damaging would a no-deal scenario be for Europe’s largest economy?Click to followThe IndependentGermany’s Economy Minister, Peter Altmaier, this week unveiled a rather brutal downgrade in his country’s official growth forecast for 2019, from 1.8 per cent to just 1 per cent. This came on the back of the worst year of GDP growth for Germany (1.5\u0026nbspper cent in 2018) in five years.And one of the reasons Mr Altmaier cited for the downgrade was the negative impact of Brexit.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIf German politicians like Mr Altmaier appreciate that their own country’s economic self-interest is tightly related to avoiding a no-deal Brexit that could change the terms of trade of the EU-UK Brexit negotiations, goes the thinking.But does the logic here stand up? How much is Germany’s slowdown actually due to Brexit? And how damaging would a no-deal scenario even be for Europe’s largest economy?Germany slumps to worst growth in five years in 2018Germany exported around $95bn of goods and services to the UK in 2017, making us the country’s fourth largest export market, after the US, France and China.But Andrew Kenningham, a Europe specialist at Capital Economics, is sceptical that a weakening UK economy ahead of Brexit was the primary reason for slowing German growth last year, noting that industrial disruption due to new automotive emissions regulations was influential in the third quarter contraction.“I don’t think most people would see Brexit see as the main reason for it,” he said.“It’s true that exports from Germany to the UK have been declining. They’ve probably been the weakest of its major export destinations. But they’ve also slowed a lot in China, they’ve slowed to other emerging economies, including Turkey and Russia. It’s not just exports to the UK have collapsed while everyone else is doing fine.”Oliver Rakau, a Frankfurt-based economist for Oxford Economics, says Mr Altmaier was simply listing the long menu of reasons for the slowdown, rather than singling out Brexit.He suspects, based on data released previously in Beijing, that the big drag in terms of German exports in the final quarter of 2018 will turn out to be due to waning demand in China rather than the UK.But Mr Kenningham suggests that Mr Altmaier might have mentioned Brexit for political reasons, rather than economic ones.The economy minister has been vocal for some time about the importance of avoiding a no-deal Brexit and has suggested that the UK should be allowed to extend the Article 50 process to avoid the 29 March cliff edge.But what about the hugely important German car industry? Here the bigger hit to business has been Donald Trump’s trade wars, rather than Brexit, according to analysts.Nevertheless, concerns about Brexit could be dampening corporate business investment in Germany, which has been relatively weak.Exports falling – but not just to the UKBut what about a no-deal Brexit in March? How damaging would that be for Germany? Could that rising threat galvanise politicians in Berlin?In the long-term the IMF estimates that the UK being forced to trade on bare World Trade Organisation terms would cost the UK almost 4 per cent of GDP, versus less than 0.5 per cent for Germany.But what about the immediate impact, the disruption in 2019?Mr Kenningham notes that Germany’s exports of goods and services to the UK account for around 3 per cent of its GDP.“Even if they were hit hard – say a 10 per cent fall for a few months – it wouldn’t have a huge impact if you look at it arithmetically,” he says.But he concedes that’s a narrow way of looking at it.And Mr Rakau thinks that a no-deal would certainly increase the chances of Germany tipping into recession.More pain for UK than Germany from no-deal BrexitSo could car companies, and German industry more broadly, come to the rescue of the UK government and put pressure on Ms Merkel to accommodate the British, perhaps at the expense of Ireland, which wants the backstop to be entirely untouched?Analysts are not expecting that.“I know it’s often cited in the UK that Germany industry will put on pressure – but I don’t foresee that,” says Mr Rakau.“Even the German industrial associations have put out press releases saying this is for the British side to sort out.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Two thirds of the earnings came from the cloud computing arm Amazon Web Services, which boasts fatter margins than Santa after a sackful of mince pies. It\u0026nbsphas a habit of defying analysts expectations on the upside which it did this time around. \u0026nbspDespite all this, Wall Street managed to get itself into a tizzy. Its scribblers and analysts drew their breath in through their teeth and pushed out a cloud of critical comment. The reason: the firm\u0027s guidance for revenues in the three month current quarter came in at\u0026nbspbetween $56bn (£43bn) and $60bn. That was\u0026nbspa shade below the $60.7bn they had pencilled it.\u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialAmazon rolls out new delivery robot called ScoutAmazon builds vest for workers to protect them from robotsThe small miss was big enough for the shares to take a tumble in after market trading, when they lost more than\u0026nbsp5 per cent of their value.\u0026nbspWhen you consider that Amazon is capitalised at $840bn in total, that\u0027s a lot of value to shed. Some $45bn in fact.In sterling terms that amounts to £34bn, which a third more than you buy all the shares in Tesco for. The latter is capitalised at just under £22bn.\u0026nbspThe number crunchers were particularly concerned about the giant’s international business, which is still losing money.\u0026nbspAlthough losses have been falling, the Indian government has thrown a fly into the ointment with new rules designed to protect local businesses from giant foreign e commerce operators.\u0026nbspIt has done the sort of thing Britain’s bombed out bricks and mortar retailers have been calling upon our Government to have a go at, without (to date) much success.\u0026nbspWhile this has resulted in the removal of some of products from Amazon’s website, the company has responded by hunkering down and promising to keep at it. Which is what it always does.\u0026nbspOh and finance chief Brian Olsavsky says it’s going to spend more money this year. There is no greater exponent of that old proverb “you’ve got to spend money to make money” than Amazon.There are many, many reasons for criticising the monster this business has become, and feeling ambivalent about the impact it has had on the world.\u0026nbspIts workers are sometimes treated very poorly. It has had a devastating effect on other businesses. It pays about enough tax to buy a couple of Echo Dots (that’s the company’s crazily high selling crazily cheap mini speaker) and a month’s subscription to Amazon Music to go with them.Then there’s the corporate welfare it’s been sucking in back home in America. \u0026nbspYet you still have to admire the way its founder and CEO Jeff Bezos seems sublimely unconcerned about the huffing and puffing of analysts and commentators in response to the latest quarterly results.\u0026nbspI even saw one saying they thought the best may be over for the business.

The half-time show easily generates as many, if not more, headlines as the game itself.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, the focus for businesses, and a large number of viewers too, is on the adverts. Companies are willing to shell out huge sums of money for a portion of the airtime during the Super Bowl, with prices climbing every year and reaching more than $5m (£3.8m) for a 30 second slot in 2018.

Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers  – 2008No frills, just good old-fashioned rock and roll. Tom Petty’s performance is often omitted from rankings of the best Super Bowl halftime shows, but we’re including it here because he absolutely crushed it. Kicking things off with “American Girl”, he followed it up with “Won’t Back Down”, “Full Moon Fever” and the emotional “Free Fallin’”, rounding off with a stirring rendition of “Runnin’ Down a Dream”.U2 had the unenviable task of trying to raise everyone’s spirits just six months after the 911 attacks, but they did an admirable job, with performances of uplifting tracks like “Beautiful Day”.McCartney preceded the pop stars trying to outdo one another with extravagant stage designs and lavish costumes. Instead, he offered four beautifully played songs, of which the final one, “Hey Jude”, prompted an epic singalong with the crowd at Jacksonville’s EverBank Field Stadium.One of the few to outdo Katy Perry’s 2015 entrance was Madonna, three years earlier, who appeared on a giant golden chariot led by about a hundred buff men dressed as Roman soldiers. She brought out Nicki Minaj and MIA for “Give Me All Your Luvin’” and also performed hits “Like a Prayer”, “Music” and “Express Yourself”.There are few entrances as grand as standing on top of a giant golden lion with glowing eyes. Katy Perry went all out for her halftime show in 2015 with performances of “Roar”, “Dark Horse”, “California Gurls”, “Firework” and “Teenage Dream”. And who can forget the notorious Left Shark and his poor coordination?“Put the chicken fingers down and turn your television all the way up,” the Boss ordered. Springsteen’s 12-minute set started out with “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out” and also included “Born to Run”, “Glory Days” and “Working on a Dream”.710 Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake – 2004Janet Jackson delivered a blistering, brilliantly choreographed show that ended with “Rock Your Body”. But the moment Justin Timberlake ripped away her costume, and exposed her breast for approximately half a second, overshadowed all of that. The incident, dubbed “nipplegate”, even inspired the creation of YouTube. Jackson was turned into a scapegoat for the ensuing controversy, while Timberlake didn’t receive anywhere near as much scrutiny.One of the most outlandish halftime shows in recent memory, Lady Gaga began her performance by hurtling herself from the top of the stadium (attached to a harness, of course) – sparking a thousand memes. Once safely on the ground, she thrilled audiences with her biggest hits: “Poker Face”, “Born This Way”, “Telephone”, “Just Dance”, “Million Reasons” and “Bad Romance”.Beyonce basically ties with Prince for the greatest all-time Super Bowl performance. It was bold, it was fierce, it was virtually flawless. Bursting onto the stage with “Crazy in Love” after an a capella “Love on Top”, she threw down some of her best dance moves, before moving on to other hits including “End of Time” and “Baby Boy”. Lastly, there was a hysteria-inducing Destiny’s Child reunion with Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland – a performance so powerful, the lights at the stadium cut out when it ended.The greatest. Of course, the Purple One wasn’t responsible for the rain that began to pour during his hair-raising 12-minute performance, which included covers of “We Will Rock You” and “All Along the Watchtower”. But the timing was so perfect, you wanted to believe he was. Following renditions of “1999Baby I’m a Star”, Prince closed on “Purple Rain” in what has to be ranked among one of his greatest live performances of that song.110 Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers  – 2008No frills, just good old-fashioned rock and roll. Tom Petty’s performance is often omitted from rankings of the best Super Bowl halftime shows, but we’re including it here because he absolutely crushed it. Kicking things off with “American Girl”, he followed it up with “Won’t Back Down”, “Full Moon Fever” and the emotional “Free Fallin’”, rounding off with a stirring rendition of “Runnin’ Down a Dream”.U2 had the unenviable task of trying to raise everyone’s spirits just six months after the 911 attacks, but they did an admirable job, with performances of uplifting tracks like “Beautiful Day”.McCartney preceded the pop stars trying to outdo one another with extravagant stage designs and lavish costumes. Instead, he offered four beautifully played songs, of which the final one, “Hey Jude”, prompted an epic singalong with the crowd at Jacksonville’s EverBank Field Stadium.One of the few to outdo Katy Perry’s 2015 entrance was Madonna, three years earlier, who appeared on a giant golden chariot led by about a hundred buff men dressed as Roman soldiers. She brought out Nicki Minaj and MIA for “Give Me All Your Luvin’” and also performed hits “Like a Prayer”, “Music” and “Express Yourself”.There are few entrances as grand as standing on top of a giant golden lion with glowing eyes. Katy Perry went all out for her halftime show in 2015 with performances of “Roar”, “Dark Horse”, “California Gurls”, “Firework” and “Teenage Dream”. And who can forget the notorious Left Shark and his poor coordination?“Put the chicken fingers down and turn your television all the way up,” the Boss ordered. Springsteen’s 12-minute set started out with “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out” and also included “Born to Run”, “Glory Days” and “Working on a Dream”.710 Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake – 2004Janet Jackson delivered a blistering, brilliantly choreographed show that ended with “Rock Your Body”. But the moment Justin Timberlake ripped away her costume, and exposed her breast for approximately half a second, overshadowed all of that. The incident, dubbed “nipplegate”, even inspired the creation of YouTube. Jackson was turned into a scapegoat for the ensuing controversy, while Timberlake didn’t receive anywhere near as much scrutiny.One of the most outlandish halftime shows in recent memory, Lady Gaga began her performance by hurtling herself from the top of the stadium (attached to a harness, of course) – sparking a thousand memes. Once safely on the ground, she thrilled audiences with her biggest hits: “Poker Face”, “Born This Way”, “Telephone”, “Just Dance”, “Million Reasons” and “Bad Romance”.Beyonce basically ties with Prince for the greatest all-time Super Bowl performance. It was bold, it was fierce, it was virtually flawless. Bursting onto the stage with “Crazy in Love” after an a capella “Love on Top”, she threw down some of her best dance moves, before moving on to other hits including “End of Time” and “Baby Boy”. Lastly, there was a hysteria-inducing Destiny’s Child reunion with Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland – a performance so powerful, the lights at the stadium cut out when it ended.The greatest.

Following renditions of “1999Baby I’m a Star”, Prince closed on “Purple Rain” in what has to be ranked among one of his greatest live performances of that song.In terms of exposure, the numbers are undoubtedly strong. The Super Bowl attracts huge audiences - last year, more than 100 million viewers tuned in to watch the game in the US and similar numbers are expected this year. For new brands, a Super Bowl ad can bring its products to the attention of millions of people instantly, which many would argue justifies the high fee. According to advertising consultancy, in 2018 some new brands raised brand awareness by 36.5 per cent after their Super Bowl ad aired. However, these days exposure can be achieved a lot more cheaply, and most of the brands snapping up space in the Super Bowl ad breaks are already well-known names, like Amazon, Pepsi and Budweiser.For companies like these, Super Bowl ads act as a signal to the world that their brand is doing well, and tells consumers that they can trust in their products.Super Bowl 2019: Odds, Vegas betting lines, moneyline and prop bets 10 Super Bowl commercials that have gone down in TV historyEverything you need to know about the 2019 Super BowlHow to watch Super Bowl 2019 It is virtually impossible to calculate the return on investment for a Super Bowl ad, but each year a handful of brands will win out in the battle to become a talking point long after the final whistle blows. And even if an ad goes viral for all the wrong reasons, it might not be a complete failure for the company behind it. “Even though a Super Bowl advertising campaign might not pay immediately in hard dollars and cents, if a business can afford to produce one of these stellar spots, they stand to earn new customers and build awareness on a scale unmatched by other outlets,” according to Peter Koeppel, founder and president of marketing agency Koeppel Direct.“Good or bad, though, impactful Super Bowl ads are the ones that are getting talked about. What a marketer can’t afford is an ad that completely fails to deliver. Because the Super Bowl is also sort of a Super Bowl of marketing, the competition is fierce – the commercials have to be memorable for them to pay off in the long run. “An ad that doesn’t give viewers something, for better or worse, won’t be a profitable one.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease.

We should do the same here.\u0026nbspIt’s far too distracting for children having mobile phones. Texting, sexting, all this takes place.

By Megan TownsendClick to followThe IndependentRapper and member of hip hop collective Saleb Wahad spits some bars during Boiler Room’s debut broadcast from the West Bank“There aren’t many visitors to Palestine, it’s not that easy for them to come,” says Sama, a pioneering DJ from the West Bank, talking over feverish industrial techno and contrasting footage of quiet cosmopolitan streets. “Everybody feels like it’s a war zone, so there’s no eagerness... It’s not like Berlin, you know.” \u0026nbspPlagued with demolition threats, violent clashes with Israeli authorities and political upheaval, the occupied territories\u0026nbspare scarcely out of the headlines. But all that seems far away in this sunny courtyard in Ramallah. It was a June afternoon and the crowds didn’t seem concerned with the news this is the first time Boiler Room, the most-watched underground music channel in the world, has broadcast from Palestinian territory.\u0026nbspThe first set of the day, from the Haifa-based Jazar Crew, sees a brightly dressed and fashionable bunch surrounding the decks. Dancing directly behind the DJs is a woman staring straight at the camera wearing a mesh see-through top and a fake niqab.

It acknowledges the depth of talent that comes from the region, and helps fight the stereotype that the West Bank is a conservative, non-secular and terrorism-riddled no-go area. The West Bank broadcast was one\u0026nbspof Boiler Room’s most popular transmissions in 2018,\u0026nbspwith Sama’s set\u0026nbsprecieving 1.3 million views on Youtube.\u0026nbspBut more\u0026nbspimportantly, it brings together underground musicians from disconnected Palestinian factions: there are those who live in the West Bank, who grow up speaking Arabic and cannot freely travel into Israel, and there are\u0026nbspPalestinians from Israel, who grow up speaking Hebrew and struggle to connect with the West Bank scene beyond watching clips on YouTube. The stories behind a painful year in the Israel-Palestine conflictThrowing a party featuring the best and brightest artists from both regions isn’t just an appreciation of talent, it’s\u0026nbspactively building a bridge and reuniting communities that have been separated both geographically and culturally for decades.\u0026nbsp“There was a huge cut between Palestinian cities for a long, long time,” says Sama, “but we’re all the same people in the end, we are all Palestinians and we all have the same culture.” Swigging from beer bottles and taking long, thoughtful draws on cigarettes, the congregation (equal parts male and female) bob along to a range of underground sounds: there’s a little drum’n’bass, a hint of traditional Arabian rababa and some Berlin-esque kick drums, brought together with atmospheric synths that feel alien, yet eerily familiar.“Many in the west assume that Palestinian culture is very conservative, that men and women don’t mix, they don’t drink or take drugs, they can’t be openly gay, they’re not massive party animals,” says British director Jessica Kelly, who worked with Boiler Room to create Palestine Underground, the documentary follow-up to its\u0026nbspdebut party in Ramallah. “Of course, conservative values are pretty dominant in the West Bank, but our film shows another reality that’s very different from these stereotypes.”In fact, during the party’s first transmission on Facebook, viewers left a number of comments asking where the set had taken place, insisting that it couldn’t possibly be Ramallah, the most populous city and epicentre of resistance in the West Bank. Arguably the Palestinian cultural capital, Ramallah serves as a hub for fine dining, the arts and nightlife the city of just 24,000 people has held a wide-ranging influence over Palestinians since long before the Israeli occupation.Palestine Underground highlights this side of Ramallah. We see busy streets and families rushing across the road in the sunshine rather than tyre fires or mass protests. Ramallah looks like any other pleasant southeast\u0026nbspMediterranean city. The buildings aren’t crumbling, people are going about their everyday lives, there are\u0026nbsppalm trees and football flags hanging from balconies. Ramallah appears not as a city in turmoil, but as a breeding ground of creativity. Our culture is slowly being erased… stolen, we’re losing our food, our dress, our music. For me, to reuse sounds from our culture, in a way it’s keeping it alive and fighting backThe scene in Ramallah is restricted by its limited capabilities. Israeli authorities allow parties so long as they adhere to the midnight\u0026nbspcurfew on music. This curfew has generally\u0026nbsplimited events\u0026nbspto house parties and small venues. In the documentary we see archive footage from Lawain, a tiny Italian restaurant that repurposes itself as a nightclub in the evening. The movement is made up of a small number of passionate iniduals and their dedicated followers, who are expressing their long-held fascination with underground culture, as well as using it as an avenue of expression and protest. Since the mid-Noughties, hip hop has reined in the city as the popular underground sound. The most prominent figure is Muqata’a (Arabic for “disrupt”), a rapper and DJ who has carved out a distinctive sound inspired by the bustling streets. Muqata’a heads into the city centre, takes out his phone and begins to record the soundscape of the area. Building works, the busy marketplaces with vendors shouting the day’s deals, chatter in barbershops\u0026nbspand screaming children on playgrounds. “This is the sound of Ramallah,” he grins, leading us through a winding bazaar. “Our culture is slowly being erased… stolen, we’re losing our food, our dress, our music. For me, to reuse sounds from our culture, in a way it’s keeping it alive and fighting back.” Muqata’a later fuses the sounds with electronic beats and then raps over the top a signature “sound of Ramallah” that has become iconic in Palestinian music. Later in the film we see Jazar Crew, a collective from Israel who list Muqata’a as one of their inspirations, excitedly listening from their car. “It’s the drill from Bansa Bansa!” they announce. Muqata’a – known as the godfather of Palestinian hip hop – began rapping in 2007 with collective Ramallah Underground, but he felt the music they were making was too far removed from the West Bank, instead more closely linked to the US, and other Arabic hip hop movements. In 2009 he began working with the collective Saleb Wahad including rappers Dakn, Julmud, Haykal, Al Nather and the West Bank’s first prominent female MC, Makimakkuk. We follow Muqata’a to a dark underground studio, and the group begin to freestyle over a backing track of up-tempo bassline and old Arab vinyl samples. The sound is infused as much with cultural identity as with the lyrics, similar to breakaway movements like UK grime. The artists nod their heads and giggle as they mess up lines, patting one another on the back as they mutter bars. The lyrics aren’t particularly political or defiant, instead they are humorous and self-referential, and full of Ramallah slang. Dakn raps about a girl he met at the market, whilst the whole group jump up and down excitedly as they sing “Ramadan doesn’t come for free!”Muqata’a, though, insists that the hip hop movement in Ramallah is heavily influenced by politics and the need for change. “We live in a very stagnant political situation so we need this kind of disruption.” The attack on the establishment isn’t performed in a straightforward way, explains Makimakkuk. “It’s subtle,” she nods. “We are resisting by keeping our culture alive, and continuing to create things that are fresh, new and interesting.” \u0026nbsp“We’ve had artists from here make techno with Arabic commercial music,” she laughs, “things seem bleak politically but it’s a really exciting time in Ramallah.” This subtle resistance has gained popularity not only within the West Bank, but with Palestinian communities elsewhere, and – even – with Israelis. Israel’s most popular newspaper – the English language Haaretz\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbsppublished a piece on the rising popularity of Palestinian hip hop in Tel Aviv, highlighting the rising stars from Ramallah, Nazareth and Haifa. Israel’s assault on Palestine universities is a threat to human rightsUS student held in Israel over ‘pro-Palestinian boycott’ releasedIsrael’s plan to demolish West Bank village ‘could be war crime’Australia could move Israel embassy to Jerusalem from Tel AvivDuring the Boiler Room party in Ramallah, Deborah Ipekel, programmer and assistant producer of Palestine Underground, details the amount of positive comments from Israelis. “It must have been really surprising for many people to see a different side of Palestine,” she goes on to say.\u0026nbsp“One comment said: ‘Much love from Israel! May we all be able to live in peace and harmony with each other. The set is absolutely fantastic, I wish I could one day come to visit Ramallah and even get one rave or two going.’ For the artists from Ramallah, the Boiler Room show is pushing the scene forward. It gives them the motivation to continue what they are doing. They told me the show was one of the most powerful celebrations of their scene to date.”Though centred on Ramallah, the documentary explores the Palestinian underground music scene across Israel, looking at the clubs on the coast in Jaffa and Haifa too. The contrast between the areas is apparent in the freedom of the artists. Whilst Palestinians with Israeli passports can travel into the West Bank with relative ease, and throw parties without much difficulty, travel restrictions on Ramallah residents have affected\u0026nbsptheir ability to spread their music beyond the city, and to communicate with Palestinians outside of the territory.Some 1.8 million Palestinians live in Israel, with Haifa, a city on the north coast, home to one of the largest Palestinian communities. The city is fun and vibrant, a mix of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Significantly more peaceful than its neighbours, it’s known for being a relative haven for the coexistence of Jewish people\u0026nbspand Muslims. This doesn’t stop Palestinians feeling isolated from club culture, which is why Jazar Crew started to throw their own parties, to provide safe spaces for Palestinian youth away from the prying eyes of conservative Palestinians and Israeli authorities. Made up of friends Ayed, Reojeh, Riyad and Hilal, Jazar Crew began due to the lack of nightlife on offer for Palestinians. “There is nothing for us, as Palestinians living in Israel,” says Ayed, rolling a joint on the table in his home. “Whenever we used to go out to the clubs we felt like outsiders. After a few years we realised that OK, let’s stop being consumers, let’s be producers.The moment you see a DJ from Ramallah here in Jafar, it rings a bell for people. It makes them feel like the borders don’t matterWhat follows is footage of the friends taken from their own personal party archive. We see he group hauling around sound systems and decks into remote parts of the desert, playing beats similar to trap, and drum’n’bass. The party looks chaotic\u0026nbspshirtless dancers move amid\u0026nbspstrobe lighting in the middle of a sandy clearing.Riyad recalls that during their first party in 2011, news of the Arab Spring interrupted proceedings. “In the middle of the party people began getting notifications and messages from Egypt that the revolution was happening. It was f***ing euphoric, ‘Woo! The world is saved. Everything is going to be fine’,” he laughs, blowing out smoke. “At the end it was just a hangover the next day, not really a revolution.” For Jazar Crew, providing a safe space for Palestinians doesn’t just mean providing a different offering from Israelis. “In the Palestinian Arab community, seven or eight years ago you would rarely have seen a girl smoking a cigarette at a party,” says Ayed. “Jazar’s dance floor gives this opportunity to everyone, you can be yourself, you can dance like crazy, you can get naked, you can smoke, and you can roll a joint.” Hilal laughs.\u0026nbsp“Not get naked, I wasn’t there Ayed.”It’s clear that Jazar Crew’s motivations aren’t about exclusion, but about changing the perception of Arabs. Jazar Crew recently opened their own venue, Karabeet in Haifa. The club is quintessentially “underground”, benefitting from a large smoking area and a dark and intimate dance floor. But at the same time, the space feels Arab with its long medieval passageway lit with fairy lights and covered in frescos. The door policy is open and without discrimination, Jazar Crew don’t ID on entry and they welcome people from all backgrounds. “I mean, you never solve racism with racism,” they declare.Fleshback: 30 years of queer raving in Manchester“We as a people, we’ve had our confidence taken away. Now, it’s like we are finally full of confidence, we’re practising our own identity. It’s therapy for the identity crisis that we are experiencing here.”In\u0026nbspPalestine Underground, Karabeet looks welcoming and warm, as the throngs sway under purple-tinged light. A heavy techno beat drops and the crowd throw their hands up and scream, embracing each other and smiling. It’s hard not to be reminded of those moments we’ve all had on dance floors, the togetherness and the shared euphoria in music. Maybe Jazar Crew are right, maybe we can bring peace through raving. For Jazar Crew, however, there is a missing link in their success. Despite being huge fans of Muqata’a and the Ramallah hip hop they were playing at their parties, the group has failed to connect with them. In the documentary, as they head to Boiler Room, the boys look curiously out the car window at the city streets. “It’s a familiar place but not familiar at all,” comments Riyad, “I feel like a stranger even though I feel at home.” In the film the group, who were the MCs for much of the Boiler Room party, approach Ramallah with an almost alien trepidation, highlighting the magnitude of the event, and its role in bringing the communities together. Jazar Crew’s primary role has, since the beginning, been to bridge the gap between Ramallah and Haifa, along with techno DJ and Ramallah local Oddz. “Since 2010, there has been a bridge between Haifa and Ramallah that Jazar Crew and I built, we’ve been working on it for a long time,” says Oddz, a friendly looking DJ whose intense techno has gained him fans from not just the Middle East, but from all over Europe. Oddz’s story in Palestine Underground follows him smuggling himself from Ramallah to Jafar, a Palestinian community in Tel Aviv, to play a set at Anna Loulou, a nightclub on the beach. In one scene, with a camera strapped to his head to give us a first-person view, Oddz scales an 8m high wall in Jerusalem, jumping through a gap in barbed wire and falling straight onto the concrete below. “I hurt my leg,” he reveals with a cheeky grin, “but it was worth it.”Director Jessica Kelly shares her worries ahead of the film’s release, and the reaction from Israeli authorities on that particular moment. “I don’t think they are going to be massive fans of that,” she grimaces, “we also took the controversial decision to use the terms ‘Israel’, ‘occupied Palestine’ and ‘48’\u0026nbspinterchangeably to reflect how the different contributors to the film refer to Israel. There are many Israelis who will see this is as a denial of Israel’s existence and take offence, but for us it was a device for the audience to understand what the contributors were saying.” Our scene is newer, fresher, cosier than in Europe and I guess the oppression makes the party blast a bit harderThe scene with the fence highlights the separation between the two communities in the film. Oddz mumbles defiantly over the top of the opening sequence:\u0026nbsp“You can’t just build a wall and say, ‘you can’t do this’, it’s music, it’s for everyone.” Oddz is introduced to us while\u0026nbspwatering his plants and flicking through vinyls in his home in Ramallah. The scene is cut-through with footage of frantic dancing and techno during his night in Anna Loulou. The venue is currently the only Palestinian venue in Jafar, and in an interview with the owner Marwan Hawash, he shares the importance of keeping Ramallah’s artists involved despite the danger of having to smuggle them into Israel.\u0026nbsp“The moment you see a DJ from Ramallah here in Jafar, it rings a bell for people. It makes them feel like the borders don’t matter, that we can break them.”The warmth the DJs and producers in the scene seem to feel for Oddz is clear during his Boiler Room set. At least 20\u0026nbsppeople take turns embracing him as he steps up to the decks. The sound he plays is a fast-paced mix of hard European beats and bouncing African rhythms. It’s almost impossible for the crowd to keep up with him. But Oddz’s style of techno isn’t the only one coming from Ramallah. The first female Palestinian DJ to hold a solo Boiler Room set, Sama\u0026nbsphas been making waves since June for her use of synths inspired by the sounds of Detroit and Berlin.I catch up with her after a show in Paris, where she has been living since the beginning of 2018. She insists that the parties in Europe are no better than those at home: “The dancing and the energy that people have at a party in Palestine has the same warmth as a party in Berlin.\u0026nbspThe only difference is that the number of people is much less and the place is much smaller. I usually find, in techno, that the vibe and energy from people all over the world is similar.” For Sama\u0026nbspthe decision to move to Paris was less about engaging with the techno she discovered at 19 in Ramallah, but instead to avoid the curfews that make parties difficult.“Our scene is newer, fresher, cosier than in Europe and I guess the oppression makes the party blast a bit harder,” she laughs.Since the Boiler Room set, Sama\u0026nbsphas seen a huge rise in the popularity of the Palestinian scene and interest in her\u0026nbspas an artist.\u0026nbspI ask her about the importance of the set and what it will mean for artists from her hometown in the future. “Having a city that has this level of music appreciation made us feel freer, and gave us a lot of motivation.“For Palestinians interested in electronic music, we’re not the strangers they shaped us to be. We resist with our music, together, we are the revolution.”Palestine Underground\u0026nbspcan be viewed on\u0026nbspBoiler Room 4:3\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

According to the latest survey by\u0026nbspWhich?Travel, the Irish budget airline faces an uncertain future. To sustain its flying programme across Europe for 2019, the airline must sell 280 seats per minute. Yet according to the magazine: “Ryanair’s reputation has declined so much that thousands of respondents told the consumer champion that they would never again fly Ryanair, even if it was cheaper than its rivals.”The editor, Rory Boland, said of the airline: “It has spent the past two years cancelling thousands of flights, ruining hundreds of thousands of holidays and flouting the rules on compensation as well. The results of our survey show passengers are fed up. They should switch to one of their rivals, which prove that budget prices don’t have to mean budget service.”Ryanair’s share price has lost one-third in the past year, and is 40 per cent down on where it was in the summer of 2017. That was the summer when Ryanair started to upset passengers who choose not to pay for assigned seating. From May 2017, couples and groups who accepted “random seating” typically found themselves sitting in middle seats at the opposite ends of the aircraft. In September that year, thousands of passengers found their flights abruptly cancelled due to a shortage of pilots – which ultimately led to the grounding of 20,000 flights through the winter.\u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe airline then misrepresented its obligations to travellers whose flights it had cancelled, saying it was not responsible for finding departures on other airlines – even though the European air passengers’ rights rules (known as EC261) state carriers cancelling flights must pay for alternatives. Ryanair had its knuckles rapped by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).The number of seats per minute Ryanair needs to sellSoon afterwards the airline gave in to demands by crew for union recognition, the first time it had happened in 32 years.The result: a string of strikes by pilots, cabin crew and airport staff. Many of them were coordinated by the International Transport Workers’ Federation, which said: “Demands of Ryanair workers – such as pay for all hours worked and an end to long-term agency employment – continue to go unaddressed.”\u0026nbspDuring 2018 many hundreds of flights were cancelled because of strikes by pilots and cabin crew. Some of the passengers affected sought compensation under EC261 regulations. Payouts are set at €250 (£223) for flights of up to 1,500km, and €400 (£357) for longer flights in Europe and North Africa. Their applications were rejected by Ryanair – which claimed the industrial action was caused by “extraordinary circumstances” and was “totally beyond the airline’s control”.But in another unprecedented intervention, the CAA urged grounded holidaymakers to claim their entitlement. Ryanair still refused, and in December 2018 the authority launched enforcement action, insisting “consumers should be compensated in accordance with Regulation EC261”. For an airline to change its cabin-baggage policy more than once a decade is unusual – but Ryanair passengers had to adhere to three different sets of rules in 2018.Now Martin Lewis, the MoneySavingExpert, has written to the chief executive, Michael O’Leary, about what he claims is a “systemic error” in the Ryanair booking process that changed travellers’ surnames in the same booking to be the same as the lead passenger’s. His organisation has sent a dossier of more than 160 cases to the CAA.Ryanair’s present travails are at odds with its image as the cheeky underdog. In the 1990s, as a tiny Irish airline, it seized on the European Union’s “open skies” policy to create its leading hub at Stansted airport, flying British travellers across Europe and providing Continental travellers with cheap access to London and beyond. But as Brexit approaches, some say the Irish carrier is in disarray, losing passengers in droves and seemingly destined for oblivion.How can a carrier that is apparently widely despised be selling seats at a rate of nearly five per second – and paying prodigious returns to shareholders?\u0026nbspYet Ryanair is set for another year as the most successful airline in Europe, flying close to 150 million people. How can a carrier that is apparently widely despised simultaneously be selling seats at a rate of nearly five per second – and, relative to its rivals, paying prodigious returns to shareholders? The answer lies in Ryanair’s business model, which takes the “keep it simple” principle to extremes.\u0026nbspThe airline has long operated only one type of aircraft, the Boeing 737-800. Pilots, cabin crew and engineers can work on any plane in the fleet. The 189 seats are another constant, avoiding the problems that other airlines – such as easyJet and British Airways – encounter when they “downsize” an aircraft.Ryanair has not always been faithful to Boeing – in the early days it used Romanian-built BAC 1-11 planes, and after it bought the KLM offshoot, Buzz, for a short while it had BAe146 jets in the fleet. But the path to success became apparent as the world assimilated the tragedy of 911. The attack on America changed much in aviation, with airlines cancelling flights and aircraft orders wholesale. And Ryanair was transformed by behaving in the opposite way .In the summer of 2001, Michael O’Leary was known in the airline business as a maverick, who had rescued an ailing regional airline by cutting fares to stimulate business. But by the end of September that year, he had become the fiercely controversial figure he remains – telling Radio 4’s\u0026nbspToday\u0026nbspprogramme that British Airways and other airlines were “screwing” the government for financial support.On 14 September 2001, the day that flights were allowed to resume across the US, with 50 new security directives in place, Boeing announced 25,000 lay-offs. In the next few days, Virgin Atlantic cut 1,200 jobs, together with its routes to Toronto and Chicago, while Aer Lingus shed 1,600 people – more than the total number employed by Ryanair. Two months after the tragedy, Ryanair predicted profits for the full financial year of close to £100m – about £10 for every passenger flown. Other airlines were haemorrhaging cash, or simply going bust (Ansett Australia, Swissair, Sabena of Belgium...).The order books of Airbus and Boeing were full of cancellations. With some almost-new jets being flown to the desert for storage, no one was buying new aircraft. Which, from the point of view of a fast-expanding, opportunistic airline is the ideal time to order some new planes. In bulk. On 24 January 2002, Ryanair ordered 100 Boeing 737s with options on 50 more – the largest ever deal for the world’s most popular plane. The cost per aircraft remains a closely guarded secret but was probably around half the list price.Created with Sketch.Travel Photographer of the Year 2018 Show all 16Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Low-cost aviation relies on keeping costs down. That is obvious to say, but much harder to do. Many elements of flying, such as fuel and air-traffic charges, are priced the same whether you are British Airways or Ryanair. But aircraft ownership costs are negotiable, and at a stroke Ryanair had achieved a deal way better than its rivals.With the fleet set to treble in size, the airline set about expanding its network in a very low-cost way: setting up operations at “secondary” airports. Budget travellers soon became accustomed to finding their way to and from Frankfurt Hahn (closer to Luxembourg than to the German financial hub), Girona (“Barcelona” in Ryanair’s view) and Charleroi (“Brussels south”). Regional authorities poured millions of euros in “marketing support” into Ryanair’s operations, with accusations that the airline was benefitting from state aid.The jury is still out on Ryanair’s play to be an airline for business travellers between Frankfurt and Manchester, for example, the Irish carrier has a single mid-afternoon round tripDuring an expansion that has proved, so far, recession-proof, the airline has long moved into the main airports for those cities, to the dismay of incumbents such as Lufthansa, Iberia and Brussels Airlines.The jury is still out on Ryanair’s play to be an airline for business travellers between Frankfurt and Manchester, for example, the Irish carrier has a single mid-afternoon round trip, while Lufthansa of Germany has five flights each way from dawn to late evening. Passengers on business want frequent flights and a near-certainty that they can get a seat on the next departure – yet Ryanair’s model is to fill its planes as close to capacity as it can.In December, which for the first half is as low-season as the travel year gets, Ryanair flights were 95 per cent full – meaning just nine or 10 seats on the average aircraft remained empty. That achievement is all the more remarkable given the intensifying competition in short-haul aviation.\u0026nbspRyanair and easyJet have a long history of not competing head-to-head. Over the years there have been some spectacular fares wars: easyJet retired hurt after launching flights to Ireland, and for a while it was difficult to pay more than £10 from Luton to Copenhagen. While the two giant carriers have historically competed on only a handful of airport-to-airport routes, expansion makes it increasingly difficult to avoid. And even though Primera Air of Iceland and Cobalt of Cyprus have recently gone bust, other budget carriers are expanding.\u0026nbspWizz Air, the eastern European specialist, is now flying from Luton to a range of western European destinations. Norwegian Air and BA’s sister airline, Vueling, are also chasing the same market. And the “legacy carriers” from Air France to SAS are cutting costs to stay in the game. Ryanair begins 2019 as combative as ever. Cabin crew employed in Spain were planning strikes on 8, 10 and 13 January after failing to reach an agreement over employment conditions, but the airline faced them down.Ahead of Brexit, Ryanair has obtained a UK air operator’s certificate that will allow it to operate British domestic routes and flights to destinations outside the European Union after 29 March. All the available evidence shows that the lowest-cost provider wins in aviation – even with consumer voices raised against it.Ryanair may feel picked on by the authorities. At this time in 2018, Air France workers were gearing up for 15 days of strikes that disrupted many thousands of British travellers. Some BA passengers faced problems during the cabin-crew strikes that dragged on for months during 2017. Yet when the European Court of Justice ruled in April 2018 that wildcat strikes did not consititute “extraordinary circumstances”, the Civil Aviation Authority failed to urge BA and Air France travellers to claim compensation.Created with Sketch.Ryanair: strikes and cancellations cause travel chaos Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Ryanair airline workers shout slogans during a small protest during the first of two days of a cabin crew strike at Adolfo Suarez-Barajas international airport in Madrid in JulyEmpty Ryanair check-in counter at El Prat airport in BarcelonaRyanair employees hold up signs in English and Spanish on the first day of a cabin crew strike in Palma de MallorcaRyanair airplanes stand idle on the tarmacIrish Ryanair pilots outside the company headquarters at Swords in Dublin, as they stage their fourth one-day strike with their union, ForsaA woman sits at a Ryanair airline check-in desk after her flight to Pisa, Italy, was cancelledRyanair employees protest at the entrance of the airport in MalagaStranded Ryanair passengers line up for information at the airport in ValenciaEmployees of Ryanair\u0027s customer service department wear T-shirts with a slogan \u0027Ryanair Must Change\u0027 during the first day of strike of the company\u0027s cabin crew members at Brussels South airport in Charleroi, Belgium, in 25Cabin crew workers for low-cost airline Ryanair went on strike in four European countries over working conditions in July, forcing thousands of passengers to make last-minute travel adjustments at the peak of the summer holiday seasonRyanair Chief Executive Michael O\u0027Leary addresses a news conference in Schwechat, AustriaRyanair employees hold up signs at the airport in Palma de MallorcaPeople queue at the Ryanair airline customer service desk during the first of two days cabin crew strikeRyanair personnel stand at Brussels Airport in Zaventem, during a strike of cabin personnel Ryanair\u0027s customer service department gather behind a banner reading: \u0027Ryanair On Strike - Respect Us!

Travel readers seem to have it in for Ryanair. The Boeing 737s it flies are identical to the bulk of Jet2’s fleet. They hold the same number of people in the same configuration. The only significant difference is that Ryanair’s fleet of 737-800s are younger. Jet2’s score for seating and cabin environment was four stars, while Ryanair received only one star.The most fundamental requirement for any airline is safety, but when an organisation called Airlineratings released its top 10 for “the world’s safest low-cost airlines”, Ryanair was nowhere to be seen.\u0026nbspThe UK’s struggling Flybe and the Anglo-German Thomas Cook Airlines made it, but there was no place for the Irish airline. Which is perplexing, because if you measure safety in terms of flying the highest number of passengers without any of them dying in an accident, Ryanair has the best safety record in the world by a country mile. Since its first flight in 1985, the airline has safely flown 1.25 billion people. Second place goes to easyJet, at 900 million passengers.People\u0026nbsphave flown safely with Ryanair since 1985British travellers have begun another year as the beneficiaries of the best-value air travel in the world, provided by the safest airlines. When easyJet was founded by Stelios Haji-Ioannou in 1995, his main message was that travellers could fly from London to Scotland for £29 – the price of a pair of jeans. Checking flights two days ahead, Ryanair will take you from Stansted to Edinburgh for under £26. And if that’s still too much, the airline will take you from Essex to Italy for under £15.At a time when Europe is fragmenting and slightly more than half the UK apparently wants to be alone, Ryanair is arguably doing more to keep the continent together than a planeload of politicians: connecting families, enabling employment, allowing travellers to discover that Europe is a fascinating mosaic of cultures rather than an amorphous whole.Back to that\u0026nbspWhich? Travel\u0026nbspsurvey: “Of those who said there was one airline with which they’d never travel, 70 per cent named Ryanair – no other airline came close.”Every passenger in Europe benefits from the existence of Ryanair. So while I find it surprising that the airline inflames so much adverse reaction, I believe that even the “bad-boy” image is a consumer benefit. By annoying sufficiently many people who have vowed never to fly on Ryanair, the Irish airline helps its rivals stay in business and keeps competition flourishing.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That meant the scientists could take all of those different pieces of data – related to 700 different places in all – and combine them to understand the gravity on the surface.As the rover started to climb up a hill on the surface, the amount of gravity went up. But it did not go up as much as expected.The lower levels of Mount Sharp are surprisingly porous, says lead author Kevin Lewis of Johns Hopkins University. We know the bottom layers of the mountain were buried over time. That compacts them, making them denser. But this finding suggests they weren\u0027t buried by as much material as we thought.Scientists could use the findings to help understand where places like Mount Sharp came from, and how the Martian surface developed.There are still many questions about how Mount Sharp developed, but this paper adds an important piece to the puzzle, said Ashwin Vasavada, Curiosity\u0027s project scientist at NASA\u0027s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, which manages the mission. I\u0027m thrilled that creative scientists and engineers are still finding innovative ways to make new scientific discoveries with the rover.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He’ll have the entire high street soonHe has bought heavily into the high street as it faces some of its toughest ever trading conditions. Close to four in 10 listed retailers issued profit warnings last year, with some doing so on multiple occasions.Emma Shipp, partner at Hewitsons, said Mr Ashley’s history with House of Fraser and Evans Cycles suggests he will continue to cut staff and close stores across all of his recent purchases.Ms Shipp added: “Landlords should expect to come under increasing pressure to reduce rent or offer rent-free periods.\u0026nbsp“Cross pollination between his businesses is another likely outcome – witness the introduction of Agent Provocateur lingerie at House of Fraser stores last year\u0026nbspwhich are both Ashley owned.“For the moment, an overriding strategy in these acquisitions is hard to discern and some have likened it to a ‘Monopoly board’ power grab.”ScS, which stands for “Sofa Carpet Specialist”, has concessions in House of Fraser stores but announced in October that it would pull out because the partnership was no longer beneficial after Mr Ashley’s takeover of the department store chain.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.220 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.220 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show.

They had hoped to use those stars to measure the age of the cluster.But as they did so they spotted the small set of stars on the edge of the area they were observing. After analysis, they found the stars did not belong to the cluster they were looking at – a part of the Milky Way – but were in fact millions of light-years away from it.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

It measures only 3000 light-years across even at its longest point, making it just a fraction of the size of our own Milky Way.Repeated radio signals coming from galaxy 1.5 billion lightyears awayIt is dark as it is feint. Together, those porperties led astronomers to classify it as what is called a\u0026nbspdwarf spheroidal galaxy.Such galaxies are defined by their small size and dim light, as well as their lack of dust and old stellar populations. Reserchers have found 36 galaxies of this kind in our nearby area, 22 of which are satellite galaxies around our own Milky Way.Dwarf spheroidal galaxies are not uncommon, but the newly discovered one is strange in a number of ways. It is extremely isolated, about 30 million light-years from the Milky Way and two million light-years from its nearest possible host – making it the most isolated of any small dwarf galaxy ever found.From studying its stars, scientists found that the galaxy is around 13 billion years old, making it nearly as old as the entire universe. Because it is so distant from any other galaxies – and so has been left largely undisturbed – as well as its old age, the astronomers refer to Bedin 1 as a fossil from the beginning of th ecosmos.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The half-time show easily generates as many, if not more, headlines as the game itself.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, the focus for businesses, and a large number of viewers too, is on the adverts. Companies are willing to shell out huge sums of money for a portion of the airtime during the Super Bowl, with prices climbing every year and reaching more than $5m (£3.8m) for a 30 second slot in 2018.

Tom Petty’s performance is often omitted from rankings of the best Super Bowl halftime shows, but we’re including it here because he absolutely crushed it. Kicking things off with “American Girl”, he followed it up with “Won’t Back Down”, “Full Moon Fever” and the emotional “Free Fallin’”, rounding off with a stirring rendition of “Runnin’ Down a Dream”.U2 had the unenviable task of trying to raise everyone’s spirits just six months after the 911 attacks, but they did an admirable job, with performances of uplifting tracks like “Beautiful Day”.McCartney preceded the pop stars trying to outdo one another with extravagant stage designs and lavish costumes. Instead, he offered four beautifully played songs, of which the final one, “Hey Jude”, prompted an epic singalong with the crowd at Jacksonville’s EverBank Field Stadium.One of the few to outdo Katy Perry’s 2015 entrance was Madonna, three years earlier, who appeared on a giant golden chariot led by about a hundred buff men dressed as Roman soldiers. She brought out Nicki Minaj and MIA for “Give Me All Your Luvin’” and also performed hits “Like a Prayer”, “Music” and “Express Yourself”.There are few entrances as grand as standing on top of a giant golden lion with glowing eyes. Katy Perry went all out for her halftime show in 2015 with performances of “Roar”, “Dark Horse”, “California Gurls”, “Firework” and “Teenage Dream”. And who can forget the notorious Left Shark and his poor coordination?“Put the chicken fingers down and turn your television all the way up,” the Boss ordered. Springsteen’s 12-minute set started out with “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out” and also included “Born to Run”, “Glory Days” and “Working on a Dream”.710 Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake – 2004Janet Jackson delivered a blistering, brilliantly choreographed show that ended with “Rock Your Body”. But the moment Justin Timberlake ripped away her costume, and exposed her breast for approximately half a second, overshadowed all of that. The incident, dubbed “nipplegate”, even inspired the creation of YouTube. Jackson was turned into a scapegoat for the ensuing controversy, while Timberlake didn’t receive anywhere near as much scrutiny.One of the most outlandish halftime shows in recent memory, Lady Gaga began her performance by hurtling herself from the top of the stadium (attached to a harness, of course) – sparking a thousand memes. Once safely on the ground, she thrilled audiences with her biggest hits: “Poker Face”, “Born This Way”, “Telephone”, “Just Dance”, “Million Reasons” and “Bad Romance”.Beyonce basically ties with Prince for the greatest all-time Super Bowl performance. It was bold, it was fierce, it was virtually flawless. Bursting onto the stage with “Crazy in Love” after an a capella “Love on Top”, she threw down some of her best dance moves, before moving on to other hits including “End of Time” and “Baby Boy”. Lastly, there was a hysteria-inducing Destiny’s Child reunion with Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland – a performance so powerful, the lights at the stadium cut out when it ended.The greatest. Of course, the Purple One wasn’t responsible for the rain that began to pour during his hair-raising 12-minute performance, which included covers of “We Will Rock You” and “All Along the Watchtower”. But the timing was so perfect, you wanted to believe he was. Following renditions of “1999Baby I’m a Star”, Prince closed on “Purple Rain” in what has to be ranked among one of his greatest live performances of that song.110 Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers  – 2008No frills, just good old-fashioned rock and roll.

She brought out Nicki Minaj and MIA for “Give Me All Your Luvin’” and also performed hits “Like a Prayer”, “Music” and “Express Yourself”.There are few entrances as grand as standing on top of a giant golden lion with glowing eyes. Katy Perry went all out for her halftime show in 2015 with performances of “Roar”, “Dark Horse”, “California Gurls”, “Firework” and “Teenage Dream”. And who can forget the notorious Left Shark and his poor coordination?“Put the chicken fingers down and turn your television all the way up,” the Boss ordered. Springsteen’s 12-minute set started out with “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out” and also included “Born to Run”, “Glory Days” and “Working on a Dream”.710 Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake – 2004Janet Jackson delivered a blistering, brilliantly choreographed show that ended with “Rock Your Body”. But the moment Justin Timberlake ripped away her costume, and exposed her breast for approximately half a second, overshadowed all of that. The incident, dubbed “nipplegate”, even inspired the creation of YouTube. Jackson was turned into a scapegoat for the ensuing controversy, while Timberlake didn’t receive anywhere near as much scrutiny.One of the most outlandish halftime shows in recent memory, Lady Gaga began her performance by hurtling herself from the top of the stadium (attached to a harness, of course) – sparking a thousand memes. Once safely on the ground, she thrilled audiences with her biggest hits: “Poker Face”, “Born This Way”, “Telephone”, “Just Dance”, “Million Reasons” and “Bad Romance”.Beyonce basically ties with Prince for the greatest all-time Super Bowl performance. It was bold, it was fierce, it was virtually flawless. Bursting onto the stage with “Crazy in Love” after an a capella “Love on Top”, she threw down some of her best dance moves, before moving on to other hits including “End of Time” and “Baby Boy”. Lastly, there was a hysteria-inducing Destiny’s Child reunion with Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland – a performance so powerful, the lights at the stadium cut out when it ended.The greatest. Of course, the Purple One wasn’t responsible for the rain that began to pour during his hair-raising 12-minute performance, which included covers of “We Will Rock You” and “All Along the Watchtower”. But the timing was so perfect, you wanted to believe he was. Following renditions of “1999Baby I’m a Star”, Prince closed on “Purple Rain” in what has to be ranked among one of his greatest live performances of that song.In terms of exposure, the numbers are undoubtedly strong. The Super Bowl attracts huge audiences - last year, more than 100 million viewers tuned in to watch the game in the US and similar numbers are expected this year. For new brands, a Super Bowl ad can bring its products to the attention of millions of people instantly, which many would argue justifies the high fee. According to advertising consultancy, in 2018 some new brands raised brand awareness by 36.5 per cent after their Super Bowl ad aired. However, these days exposure can be achieved a lot more cheaply, and most of the brands snapping up space in the Super Bowl ad breaks are already well-known names, like Amazon, Pepsi and Budweiser.For companies like these, Super Bowl ads act as a signal to the world that their brand is doing well, and tells consumers that they can trust in their products.Super Bowl 2019: Odds, Vegas betting lines, moneyline and prop bets 10 Super Bowl commercials that have gone down in TV historyEverything you need to know about the 2019 Super BowlHow to watch Super Bowl 2019 It is virtually impossible to calculate the return on investment for a Super Bowl ad, but each year a handful of brands will win out in the battle to become a talking point long after the final whistle blows. And even if an ad goes viral for all the wrong reasons, it might not be a complete failure for the company behind it. “Even though a Super Bowl advertising campaign might not pay immediately in hard dollars and cents, if a business can afford to produce one of these stellar spots, they stand to earn new customers and build awareness on a scale unmatched by other outlets,” according to Peter Koeppel, founder and president of marketing agency Koeppel Direct.“Good or bad, though, impactful Super Bowl ads are the ones that are getting talked about. What a marketer can’t afford is an ad that completely fails to deliver. Because the Super Bowl is also sort of a Super Bowl of marketing, the competition is fierce – the commercials have to be memorable for them to pay off in the long run. “An ad that doesn’t give viewers something, for better or worse, won’t be a profitable one.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Tom Petty’s performance is often omitted from rankings of the best Super Bowl halftime shows, but we’re including it here because he absolutely crushed it.

But when she took it back to Westminster,\u0026nbspMPs rejected it by the biggest margin of defeat for a government in the history of parliament.Subsequently, MPs narrowly backed a motion to call on the government to ditch the controversial “Irish backstop”\u0026nbsppart of the deal and replace it with “alternative arrangements” for avoiding a hard border in Ireland.Many MPs, especially Brexiteers and the DUP, think the backstop, which keeps the UK inside the EU customs area, is a breach of sovereignty because it treats Northern Ireland differently from Great Britain in some respects.

In theory, mobile phone firms can impose whatever fees they think the market will bear.What does the EU think about this?The EU has publicly, and repeatedly, come out very strongly against renegotiation.European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said this week: “The withdrawal agreement is the best and only deal possible. The European Union said so in November, we said so in December, we said so after the first meaningful vote in the Commons in January. The debate and vote in the House of Commons do not change that.”In fact, less than 10 minutes after MPs voted to reject the backstop, a spokesperson for Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, said: “The backstop is part of the withdrawal agreement, and the withdrawal agreement is not open for renegotiation.”But could the UK bypass the Commission by appealing to member states?Could Germany’s domestic pain compel Berlin to soften its Brexit line?This seems unlikely at present.The UK strategy throughout the whole of the talks has been to try to peel off member states and disrupt EU unity. Even before the referendum, former Brexit secretary David Davis said his first stop would be to negotiate inidual deals with Berlin, or Paris.But it hasn’t worked out like that and there’s no obvious reason to think things will\u0026nbspchange – unless pressure somehow gets to the EU at the last minute.What’s more, the Commission’s positions are taken after talking to member states, and set by member states at European Council meetings. Donald Tusk, the first senior EU chief to intervene after the latest Westminster vote, is supposed to reflect the settled views of EU\u0026nbspmembers\u0026nbspwhen he makes public statements.Are there any signs of cracks in EU unity at all?At the start of the year, the Polish foreign minister suggested adding a time limit to the backstop. He was quickly shot down by Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar, who said this was not the EU’s position, and nothing more was heard of it.This is not the first time Poland has raised the issue – they’ve talked about it behind the scenes before – though it was the first time they’d\u0026nbspgone public.The truth is,\u0026nbspthe vast majority of countries are happy to follow Ireland’s lead on this question as a matter of principle. Ireland is adamant it will not accept a limited backstop.There are a few\u0026nbsprumours in Brussels that some states, such as Germany, are open to a pragmatic solution.

A Home Office spokesperson confirmed that a charter flight would be departing in the “coming weeks”.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialAll of those set to be removed on the flight are said to have criminal convictions, but all have served their sentences in UK jails and campaigners argue that their removal – which for many means returning alone to a country they left as young children – constitutes a “brutal double punishment”.The last charter flight to Jamaica was in March 2017. Another was scheduled to leave last April, days after the Windrush scandal broke, with a 63-year-old grandmother among the deportees, but it was cancelled for reasons the Home Office didn’t disclose.How the Windrush scandal forced Brexit off the front pagesThree Windrush victims flown back to live in UK after ‘urgent’ helpThe NAO’s Windrush report shows what our reporting points towardsOne man set to be removed next week, Owen Haisely, has lived in the UK for 41 years and has three young British children. The 45-year-old was convicted for a domestic abuse incident in 2015, for which he spent a year in jail. He\u0026nbspwas arrested and detained\u0026nbspwhile signing on with the Home Office last Friday.The Manchester resident, whose great aunt is part of the Windrush generation,\u0026nbspsaid he worried about the future of his sons – aged five and seven – without their father present.“I did wrong – I deserved to be locked up for that. And I’ve done my sentence.\u0026nbspI did all the rehabilitation classes, I did anger management,\u0026nbspI did restorative justice. I used my time positively and constructively,” he said.“I’m\u0026nbspworried for my boys. They say I can keep in contact with my children via Skype – how can you say that? Problems happen when families get split up or fathers get taken away. Children are more likely to get into trouble.“My ex-partner doesn’t want me to be deported. I go to school meetings,\u0026nbspnativity plays, I collect them from football. They are all going through a very rough time with my immigration issue hanging over them.”Mr Haisley, who spent 12 years as youth workshop leader at a music project in Manchester, said he was “terrified” to go back to a country he doesn’t know.UK residents threatened with deportation on charter flight to Jamaica“I let myself down in a big way, but while offenders with a British passport can go to prison, repeat offend and get given chance after chance, I’ve not even been given a second chance,” he added.Another man scheduled to be on the flight is Divonte Demetri Fyffe, 23, who has been in Britain since he was three. He committed a drug offence at the age of 18 for which he served a two-year sentence, and on his release\u0026nbspwas told he no longer had a right to remain in the UK.The Wolverhampton resident, who was detained last week, said: “I’m in shock at the moment. I’m scared. I don’t know anyone in Jamaica. Who will I stay with? How will I get income?“I made a stupid mistake when I was 18. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. I was in the wrong crowd. I did my jail time.\u0026nbspI stopped hanging around with those people.\u0026nbspI haven’t reoffended. I wanted to make a change.“But\u0026nbspI was told I couldn’t work or study, and now this is happening. I made one mistake and I’m still paying for it.”A government commissioned report published in July stated the removal of people “who were more British than foreign” was “deeply troubling” and advised that routine deportations of people who had been brought up in the UK should end.Former prisons ombudsman Stephen Shaw, the author of the report, wrote: “For low-risk offenders, it seems entirely disproportionate to tear them away from their lives, families and friends in the UK, and send them to countries where they may not speak the language or have any ties.”Government ‘failed to act’ on warning signs of Windrush failingsResponding to the news of the impending charter flight, Diane Abbott MP, shadow home secretary, said “The Tories’ hostile environment policies continue to split up families, with the use of these brutal chartered flight deportations.\u0026nbsp“We need full transparency. Ministers need to quickly confirm whether these iniduals are British citizens. We should not deport our own citizens or deny their rights.”Information on those facing removal, gathered by campaign group Movement for Justice, indicates that seven of them came to the UK as children, eight have British-born children, and 11 have relatives in the Windrush generation.One woman set to be removed is said to be a grandmother to 10 British children, while another deportee reportedly has a grandfather who served in the British Army.Karen Doyle, national organiser of Movement for Justice, said: “Trying to restart mass deportations to Jamaica while the Windrush generation have yet to receive a penny, and many are still waiting months later for decisions, is a slap in the face for the Jamaican diaspora community in the UK.“These people are being subject to a brutal double punishment, many for crimes that the British public would not consider ‘serious’, drunken fights and driving offences.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Windrush generation: threat of deportation from UK Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 arriving at Tilbury Docks from Jamaica, with 482 Jamaicans on board, emigrating to Britain.Jamaican immigrants being welcomed by RAF officials from the Colonial Office after the ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 landed them at Tilbury.

But if we are able to make progress sooner, then that might not be necessary.“We can’t know at this stage exactly which of those scenarios would happen.”There is\u0026nbspgrowing concern\u0026nbspamong ministers that there is not enough time to pass the necessary legislation before exit day,\u0026nbspamid reports that the February recess could be cancelled to give Ms May more time to win over the EU.Mr Hunt said a solution had “not been properly worked up” to replace the\u0026nbspIrish backstop – which aims to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland.\u0026nbspMPs backed a bid to\u0026nbspreplace it\u0026nbspwith “alternative arrangements” in a series of crunch votes on Tuesday.He said it was “difficult to know” if negotiations would run to the end of March, but added: “Whereas a week ago none of us really knew whether this was going to be possible, we are now in a situation where it clearly is possible.“There are lots and lots of hurdles –\u0026nbspno one is saying this isn’t going to be very challenging –\u0026nbspbut we do now have a consensus in parliament.“Providing we can do that, which I think we can, then I think there is a way through.”However his Austrian counterpart, Karin Kneissl, said it would be “very difficult” for the Brexit timeframe to be extended and warned that Britain could be heading for a no-deal exit.She said: “According to the Article 50 procedures, the deadline is 29 March,\u0026nbspso there is a time pressure because what couldn’t be reached by negotiation over the last years, it’s very difficult to imagine that there can be a tremendous breakthrough – a magic solution – in the next few days in order also to have this ratified in due time for the remaining EU members.”Created with Sketch.

But there are two possible routes for a snap election in the legislation: either the prime minister\u0026nbspdissolves parliament and calls an election after gaining the support of two-thirds of MPs in the Commons, or a motion of no confidence is\u0026nbsppassed in the government with a simple majority of MPs.Mr Corbyn failed in his no confidence attempt in the Commons last month – after Ms May’s historic Brexit defeat – but Ms Abbott remains adamant an election is still possible. “There are so many moving parts in the Brexit situation, but I think an election is possible and that’s very possible and that’s what we are campaigning for,” she said.“We can try the no confidence route again. There are rumours that you’ll have heard that one way out for her is to call a general election, hoping the public will like her deal more than parliament does.Racist and misogynistic letters sent to Diane Abbott“I think if the general election had gone on for a week longer, we might well have won. If we could make up 20 points last time, I believe we can\u0026nbspmake up 20 points this time and that means we’ll win.”Asked in her preparations for government whether she had held meetings with senior civil servants, Ms Abbott replied: “Well they are confidential meetings, it wouldn’t be appropriate to say, but we are meeting. Each shadow cabinet member is meeting with key members of their departments.BBC admits Fiona Bruce made ‘light-hearted’ comment about Diane Abbott“I think I’ve got one coming up soon actually,” she added. “Home Office officials – it’s all part of the preparing for government stuff.”But on the more immediate subject of Brexit – an issue she describes as “taking the oxygen out of the political atmosphere” – \u0026nbspMs Abbott warns MPs against accepting the prime minister’s cash in return for support for a UK-EU deal that could end up damaging MPs’ constituencies.She made the comments after it emerged that Downing Street is\u0026nbspconsidering injecting money into Leave constituencies as Ms May attempts to reach out for votes across the chamber before bringing her deal back to the Commons for a second vote later this month.“I think every MP must look at the overall consequences of Theresa May’s deal for their constituencies and the country as a whole.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 51Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Dog walkers in Aston Rowant National Nature Reserve on the Chilterns escarpment, in Oxfordshire.

Earlier this week, the Labour MP David Lammy offered: “More fool them. Socialists my arse. Cowards and facilitators. History will be brutal.” \u0026nbsp“And also it puts her in an impossible situation because\u0026nbspthe more she moves towards Labour, the more hostile some of her own MPs are going to be. She’s between a rock and a hard place.”Asked what she thought the likelihood of a second Brexit referendum, she warned: “What I think about a second referendum is this – it’s in the policies that were passed at conference, it’s part of our policy portfolio. But what I always say of a second referendum is people should be careful what they wish for.“It’s by no means certain that if we had a second a referendum tomorrow that Remain would win, and that’s the problem. Or it might win by a very small margin and then where are you?“I just think a lot of people who are calling for a second referendum believe that it will just automatically reverse the first referendum and I don’t necessarily think that’s the case. However, I think that a second referendum remains on the table and if there was a second referendum I certainly think Remain should be on the ballot, and I would vote Remain.”Ms Abbott also poured cold water on the idea of a special Brexit conference of the Labour Party – something pro-referendum activists have been advocating in recent months to refine the party’s policy.The shadow home secretary, who has now represented Hackney for over 30 years as an MP, also referred to her recent appearance on BBC Question Time – and the resulting row.After participating in the show, Ms Abbott had complained the BBC had legitimised the “mistreatment, bias and abuse” she faces as a black woman in the public eye and her treatment could dissuade young women from black and ethnic minority groups from becoming involved in politics.She also objected to a clash over polling during the programme, when Fiona Bruce, the new presenter of the programme, interrupted her when she correctly claimed that recent opinion polls suggested Labour was on a level pegging with the Tories.Ms Abbott said she has still not received an apology from the broadcaster, but she rejected recent reports that she will no longer appear on the programme.Asked whether she will contribute again, she replied: “Well, we’ll have to see about that, but\u0026nbspI’m not boycotting them.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But this government clearly doesn’t care.”Theresa May has previously been accused of shelving a batch of key policies, which include moves to prevent restaurant and bar bosses snatching workers’ tips, to stop residents being “exploited” by ripoff leases or rogue bailiffs and to ban wild animals from circuses.Created with Sketch.

The forgotten areas of Britain who voted Leave want jobs, rights and investment.”Mr McDonnell claimed that the incentives to pro-Brexit Labour backbenchers were the latest example of what he called the Conservatives’ use of “pork barrel” politics, following its post-election spending deal with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).On a visit to Stoke-on-Trent on Saturday, he said: “I don’t think any MP will sell their votes in that way – that sort of bribery and corruption.”Mr McDonnell also said talk of such “contractual” arrangements pledging investment in the constituencies of MPs who back Ms May’s deal, was “dangerous for our democracy”.He also talked up Labour’s prospects at any future general election, despite accepting current polls put the party and the Tories “neck-and-neck”.“I think we’re in the same position now, where people are saying you’re neck-and-neck and I’m saying ‘that’s right’.“But once we get into the real debate in a general election campaign you’ll see we’ll be able to pick up those additional points that will get us into government. The debate at the moment is obviously clouded by Brexit,” he said.“But when you go round and have meetings like today where we tour different towns, Brexit is an issue.

Both are powered by an inexorable sense of self-righteousness. And both have an awful lot of experience of saying sorry.The most recent example came when Sir Nick appeared on the BBC in the wake of the furore over the death of -year-old Molly Russell.It turned out, after she was found dead in her bedroom in December , that she had been viewing material online relating to depression, self-harm and suicide — material which was shockingly easy to find.As her father Ian Russell put it bluntly: “Instagram helped kill my daughter.”Sir Nick, to his credit, said all the right things about how the firm was determined to do more. But he also made the striking claim that it is sometimes better for Facebook and Instagram to keep suicide images online, because it helps other vulnerable young people get support.This after The Sun, on Saturday, found and flagged up multiple images appearing to normalise and even romanticise suicide, all within a few clicks. Many remained published for days, and a Facebook spokesman claimed they could be beneficial to users battling mental health issues.Sir Nick says the firm is following the advice from leading experts and charities. And it may well be doing the right thing. But this is the latest example of Facebook — and other social media giants in general — only acting to tackle a problem once it becomes impossible not to.Over the past decade, social media has come to dominate our lives. The latest research from Ofcom shows internet use rocketing among children and teenagers, with friendships and social lives increasingly run through screens and phones.And it is now clear that this great move online has been accompanied, for our children, by a staggering increase in mental health problems.The situation is particularly alarming when it comes to young women. The latest NHS data found that one in four of those aged  to  report having a mental health disorder — twice the rate among boys.In  alone, one in five US girls aged between  and  suffered a major depressive episode — one in five! Suicide rates for teenage girls, according to academic Jonathan Haidt, have risen by  per cent in the US and  per cent in the UK in a decade.This isn’t just about what happens on the internet. Those having problems online often tend to be experiencing problems offline too, such as bullying, harassment or broken families.More broadly, Haidt believes the “snowflake” phenomenon reflects that “helicopter parenting” leaves children less prepared to cope with shocks and dficulty. But the internet, and social media, are very clearly intensying those problems. And the big tech firms are still playing catch-up.The traditional argument from Silicon Valley is that it’s not their job to regulate human behaviour. They add that eventhey wanted to, there is simply too much out there.They are doing their best to crack down on inappropriate content, but it’s like trying to stem the tide. Behind the scenes — they insist — thousands of people are working day and night to detect and delete messages promoting terrorism, hatred, Holocaust denial and self-harm.But this argument just doesn’t wash. It’s very clear that, in the interests of their bottom lines, many of the big social media firms have long failed to put enough resources into detecting damaging content.Researchers have shown, for example, how following the recommended links from reputable YouTube content can lead to a carnival of horrors. News reports that segue into crackpot conspiracy theories and videos for toddlers that give way to horrendous scenes of a bloodied Minnie Mouse trapped in an escalator.Every day brings new horror stories, such as rival fans of royals Kate and Meghan using the Kensington Palace Instagram to send death threats to each other. Increasingly, online hate is triggering real-le violence. The slaughter of the Rohingya Muslims in Burma was, The New York Times said, “a genocide incited on Facebook”.Part of the reason that Zuckerberg has hired Clegg is to put his house in order. Clegg has talked the right talk about changing Facebook’s culture, and in particular doing more to tackle self-harm.He even says they might start paying more tax. ButZuckerberg’s answer to “how to fix the internet” is “hire Nick Clegg”, we have still got an awfully long way to go.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But every binding Remainer motion to impede or delay Brexit was defeated.And there is no point Brussels bleating about the Withdrawal Agreement being set in stone. We know it isn’t. Some EU figures have admitted it isn’t. They could tweak the text, time-limit the backstop or find another solution.They choose not to. And they will stick to that as long as they believe Parliament’s Remainers will ultimately strip the Government of its only negotiating leverage, the threat to just walk away.Remainers, some in Cabinet, may well yet do that. Nonetheless last night should sow doubt in Brussels’ minds.The victorious Brady amendment demands a vital, legally binding change to the Irish backstop before the PM’s deal can pass, just as The Sun called for.

So I’m not bothered about no deal.Appearing as a special guest at the Tory Eurosceptic Bruges Group, Mr Stringer said: Often in discussing the European Union my colleagues use kindergarten language - they say theyre our friends, how could they not have our interests at heart .I think it misunderstands that actually the bureaucrats in Brussels are a self-interested group of people - self-interested in their own survival and perpetuating their growing power and influence across the whole of the European continent.“It also misunderstands the fact that the European Union do negotiate but they usually come to agreements at the last minute – the th hour.“And that is possible which is why it’s important to send the Prime Minister back to Brussels over the next fortnight because I think that the European Union – one can’t be certain – actually want to come to a deal.”In an ominous warning for his party he predicted Labour would lose a lot of seatsit continued to frustrate Brexit.And there would be electoral peril for the partyLabour officially backed a second referendum, the MP added.Mr Corbyn is under pressure to sack a number of Labour frontbenchers who defied his order to back the bid to delay Brexit."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/tp-graphic-backstop.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"eu backstop brexit nonsense","story":"Will Eurocrats cause needless ­disruption just to make a point  Would they rather see all sides suffer than watch a post-EU Britain succeed If so, what would it say about the ­organisation we are leaving Let’s take a moment to recap.Immediately after the referendum, EU officials declared they would not talk to Britain about a long-term relationship until we first agreed withdrawal terms, including a “orce payment”, rights for EU citizens and the Irish border.Britain foolishly agreed. It was ­particularly silly to discuss Ireland before the main trade talks, since the obvious way to prevent a hard border on the island is through a deep and ­comprehensive trade agreement between the UK and the EU as a whole.That, though, would have given Ireland a strong incentive to get the best possible terms for the UK, and for itself.So instead, at the end of , the EU suddenly came up with the idea of an “Irish backstop”.It wanted Britain to promise that, unless it came up with a long-term ­trading ­relationship that satisfied ­Brussels, it would stay in the customs union and leave Northern Ireland under EU regulations.Stupidly, British negotiators accepted the backstop. Wisely, our MPs did not.The backstop would mean Brussels continued to control Britain’s trade deals with non-European countries after we left.It would mean placing part of our country under permanent EU jurisdiction.MPs threw the deal out. Then something sensible happened.Leavers and Remainers began to talk directly to each other and hammered out a deal that both sides could live with.There were lots of aspects of the ­withdrawal agreement that Eurosceptics resented.They didn’t like being non- voting members for another  months.They didn’t like Euro judges continuing to rule here even after we had left.They didn’t like forking out more than billion quid in exchange for the better part of bugger all.But they were ready to make ­compromises. If the Irish ­backstop were removed, they’d swallow the rest of the withdrawal terms.On Tuesday, the House of Commons adopted this position. The EU responded with a theatrical snort of indignation.“We stand by the agreement that we have negotiated,” said Michel Barnier, the European Commission’s negotiator.“The withdrawal agreement is not ­renegotiable,” said Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission.But hang on. Juncker is simultaneously telling us thatwe alter our red lines — by, for example, agreeing to a ­permanent customs union — then the agreement could indeed be reopened.So there is plainly no technical or legal reason why the backstop could not be removed or at least time-limited.Nor, by the way, is anyone still ­pretending that, without the backstop, there will be checkpoints in Londonderry and Crossmaglen.The Irish government has confirmed that,there is no deal, it will not place any infrastructure at the border.The British Government has been saying the same all along.Barnier says there would be ways to carry out necessary checks away from the frontier.In other words, the whole row is about a border that no one is going to build anyway.It’s ­surreal. There is plainly no way the House of Commons is going to accept the backstop.It also became clear on ­Tuesday there is no majority for a ­second ­referendum, because the last thing Jeremy Corbyn wants is to have to come down on one side or the other.That leaves only two options. Either the backstop is dropped but everything  is agreed, or the backstop is lost and so is everything .From the EU’s point of view, it must surely be preferable to agree the bulk of the Withdrawal Agreement, including reciprocal citizens’ rights and the ­£billion payment, while finding an alternative way to guarantee the Irish border stays open.From Dublin’s point of view, the logic is even stronger.Insisting on the backstop risks,not a hard border, certainly more dislocation between the Republic of Ireland and the UK — the very thing the backstop is ­supposed to prevent.The EU has calculated the cost will be worse for Britain than for ­Continental states, since cross-Channel trade is ­proportionately more important for us.But, by that measure, it is more ­important still for Ireland.In private, some Continental politicians are pushing for a pragmatic outcome — one that minimises disruption and ­preserves the long-term alliance between the UK and its neighbours.You especially hear these arguments in countries that trade heavily with Britain, such as Denmark and the Netherlands.You also hear them from governments that want to ensure the rights of their citizens in Britain are guaranteed.But for Eurocrats, in particular the anti-British Martin Selmayr who has seized control of negotiations, this isn’t about finding an outcome that works.If it were, the EU could have signed a continuity deal with Britain easily.The truth is many Euro-fanatics are happy to inflict pain on the EU  ­provided they inflict even more on us.If their view prevails over that of the pragmatists, then Britain has no option but to leave without an agreement. It is never sensible to give into blackmail.If the choice is between No Deal and surrendering part of our country, we will choose No Deal.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That this time they back a motion preventing us leaving without a deal on March , setting up the potential reversal of Brexit.They must not. The cost to the country and their party will be catastrophic.The Sun does not want No Deal but the threat of it is our greatest leverage. We must not give it up.It is equally dangerousBrexiteers overplay their hand. They have pushed Theresa May in the right direction — but they must now be realistic. If the EU does finally offer some meaningful legal commitment on the backstop they must take it.The PM’s deal will be softer than they want. But hold out for more and Brexit could be lost. A Remainer-stuffed ­Parliament may see to that, however bullish eurosceptic MPs are today.Meanwhile, two things must happen: While No Deal is still possible we must turbo-charge our preparations for it.And Brussels must be left in no doubt . . . not one penny of our exit bill will be paidit happens.IRELAND’S naive PM Leo Varadkar will deserve much of the blame for the misery and chaos No Deal would unleash on his people and across Europe.“We could find ourselves in  or  weeks’ time needing to find a lot of money to save people’s jobs,” he admits.It is time, then, for him to stop posing as a hardman and do the right thing.It is absurd hyperbole to claim Ireland would be betrayed by giving us a legally binding escape option from the backstop at some hypothetical future point.A hard border will happen onlyEU obstinacy pushes us into No Deal. It will then be needed rapidly, as Brussels says.Varadkar’s continued posturing is suicidal.

The people who can’t get beds in our hospitals, or a place for their kids in the local school. All the while that £billion is being spent on fabulously berserk ­projects in the developing world.To her total credit, Mordaunt has said that our current level of spending on overseas aid is unsustainable. It’s been rising every year. Due to a law passed by the coalition government, we have to spend . per cent of our income on aid to the Third World each year.So right now we spend just under £billion. And where does this money go  No less than  per cent of it is siphoned off to global outfits like that most useless of organisations, the United Nations.This is the body which sent out some dimbo Australian envoy to tick off our Government about economic policy. An organisation which elected Saudi Arabia on to its Women’s Rights Commission. An anti-Western and rabidly anti-Israeli convocation of leftie Third World thugs with chips on their shoulders.The world would be enormously improvedthe UN was shut down tomorrow. And the rest of it  Some of the stuff you wouldn’t believe. A total of £, went to a project investigating Tibetan verbs. Nope, not kidding.I would assume that “climb” was one of the verbs they were investigating. They use that a lot, over there. Thanks to our overseas aid, someone, ­somewhere is now able to say in Tibetan: “F*** me, is that a yeti  Run away!”Then there’s the £, spent on a scheme to stop Indian schoolchildren imbibing sugary drinks. India itself gives overseas aid and has an income rather bigger than our own. Where is the point Another six-figure sum was spent ­persuading Chinese people not to smoke too much — China! The second richest country in the world.Another one was to help Indian workers cool their work­stations down — this in a country which has its own space programme, for Chrissakes. So much of our money is swallowed up by useless leftie quangos and charities to keep themselves in jobs.Still more is pocketed by despots in the horrible countries they run. It is a source of corruption and dependency. It makes things worse. And when we tried to ert our overseas aid to some of the Caribbean countries stricken by hurricanes we were told we couldn’t — they were too rich!It’s a nonsense and a racket. If I thought our overseas aid, in its current form, really alleviated misery and suffering I’d be all for it. That’s why I agreed with the last secretary of state, Priti Patel, who wanted to give a decent chunk to the Israel Defence Forces, which saves a lot of lives in Syria.So my recommendation would be to end it all NOW. Divert the money into our beleaguered and creaking infrastructure. And when a tragedy occurs overseas — sure, splash the cash.Anyway, Penny — hope I’ve helped by starting the conversation. Over to you, babes.SCOTTISH politician Ross Greer has already been called a “ginger turd” by Piers Morgan, and I don’t think I can improve on that. But it’s his ignorance and stupidity that staggers – rather than his hatred for Great Britain, which is something we’re used to from north of the border.Greer described Winston Churchill as a white supremacist, a mass murderer and a racist, and likened him to Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. He says he is simply challenging the “myth” of Churchill. No, Ross, you’re not.You’re just pig ignorant, with a very poor grasp of history. Of course Churchill was racist. Just about everybody was of his age at that time.If you can’t see the importance of Churchill to winning the Second World War – against REAL racists, REAL mass murderers – when Britain stood alone, then you lack all sense of context and proportion.The more I think about it, the more I reckon “ginger turd” was an understatement.HERO of the week is the excellent Rachel Riley, who has been speaking out against anti-Semitism. As a consequence, she now needs greater security when she’s doing TV’s ­Countdown. The left-wing Jew-hating trolls have been after her.Rachel,  said: “The more I speak, the more abuse I get, and the more abuse I get, the more I speak. It’s got to the point where I can’t look at my Twitter feed any more. It’s just a constant stream.”She’s pretty clear who is behind it, too.  A lot of the abuse comes from people who sign off with the hashtag JCPM.SO, Labour MP Fiona Onasanya is off to prison. Found guilty in court of lying through her teeth.But the remarkable thing is she’s still going to be paid as an MP while she’s inside. She has refused to resign her seat and so her £, salary will continue to be paid by the rest of us.If you got sent to the nick, do you think your employers would continue to pay your wages  You’d be out on your ear. It’s kind of ­outrageous, no THIS cultural appropriation business is getting out of hand. Marks  Spencer has been slammed by leftie nutters with nothing better to do with their time. For selling a biryani wrap.They say it’s not authentic. Well of course it’s not bleedin’ authentic.  This is the UK, not Mumbai.

As its name suggests, the polar vortex is found around the north pole. A band of strong winds high up in the atmosphere keeps bitterly cold air locked around the Arctic region. But sometimes it undergoes changes and moves south, creating alarmingly cold conditions. It has been more than  years since a similar Arctic blast last covered large swath of the Midwest and Northeast, according to the weather service.The impact of the vortex has caused widespread closure of schools, businesses, government offices, flights and prompting the US Postal Service to take the rare step of suspending mail delivery.The term vortex in itself refers to the counterclockwise flow of air helping to keep the colder air near the Pole.But sometimes the vortex can become distorted and meander far further south than normal.Making matters worse for the United States at the moment, the vortex has broken into two swirling blobs of ultra cold air, ushering in killer temperatures as low as -C.Chicago is one of the places worst affected by the weather system.The wind chill brought temperatures down as low as -C on Thursday, nearly  degrees colder than the  record.Authorities advised that such low temperatures could cause frostbite in minutes, and kill in not much longer.Chicago residents were even advised not to take too deeper breaths while outside, or talk too much when outdoors.Some resident experiencing the painful cold dubbed their city “Chiberia” while one local newspaper ran with the headline “COLD AS ºF”.At least  have died across the country during the polar vortex-induced weather, according to Reuters.In fact it was so cold railway engineers had to set fire to train tracks to keep them from locking up.Temperatures have began to crawl back up, but as they tipped above freezing, authorities expected burst pipes to make themselves apparent."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT0004429871111.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brussels irish backstop golden ticket sun says","story":"What a moment for Brussels’ headbangers to risk a No Deal Brexit.We know why they’re still playing hardball.Michel Barnier admits they could probably find an alternative to the Irish backstop — but why would they It’s their golden ticket.

First, EU leaders are fed up with her.She signed off on a deal with them, assured them it could get through the Commons then lost by a record margin.They are now sceptical when the British indicate that this or that change could get the deal through Parliament.Despite the passing of the Brady amendment — saying the Commons would raty the withdrawal agreementthe so-called backstop was replaced by alternative arrangements to prevent a hard border — the EU remains doubtful as to whether this is really the case.No  acknowledges that things are not easy between Mrs May and EU leaders at the moment.One member of her circle tells me they are “waiting for the anger to subside” before they head to Brussels.A well-placed European source tells me there will be “nothing tangible in two weeks”.But there is another reason, beyond their irritation, why the EU are holding off from engaging with Mrs May.They want to see what happens when the Commons next votes on Brexit, on Valentine’s Day of all days.It is expected that Yvette Cooper will bring back her amendment which would force the Government to seek an extension to Article it can not agree a deal with the EU.If Cooper is passed, then the EU could be certain that Parliament would not allow the UK to leave the EU without a deal.At that point, the EU would have little reason to offer up a signicant concession.They would know there was no danger of either short-term No Deal disruption, which would be particularly badly timed for the EU given the slow-down in the eurozone economy, or of the UK ending up pursuing a radically dferent economic course after Brexit.However,the Cooper amendment failed again, the EU would have to confront the fact that this process really might result in No Deal.They could lose a withdrawal agreement that is good for them, and the backstop would have created the very thing it is meant to avoid — the need for a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.In these circumstances, and with time ticking down, the EU would become more creative in its thinking.The hunt would be on for face-saving ways to try to salvage the agreement.This would not mean the EU would suddenly drop the backstop entirely.But it would be more open to, say, a time limit on it.With this change, the deal would stand a very decent chance of passing the Commons.I understand there is a growing body of opinion in the ERG, the most powerful Brexiteer bloc in the Tory party, that a three-year time limit for the backstop — which could be extended to five in exceptional circumstances — could be acceptable.Not all members of the ERG would take this.But enough of them probably would to make up the missing numbers with Labour MPs.Senior figures in the Government were encouraged by how many Labour MPs either abstained or voted against Cooper.They believe these MPs can be persuaded to back a deal.“There is a pool of Labour votes — and it is growing,” one Government source tells me.Getting  Labour votes for a deal now seems doable.Ministers and MPs must hang tight.Now would be the worst moment to weaken the UK’s negotiating position.“I DON’T know who has got any idea,” one leading Cabinet minister tells me when I ask what Theresa May’s plan is.The precise direction of the Government’s Brexit policy is still being debated. I am told “there is no set course”.Inside the Cabinet, the arguments are far from over.There are four Cabinet ministers – David Gauke, Amber Rudd, Greg Clark and Philip Hammond – who won’t even contemplate No Deal.They are becoming increasingly outspoken in their warnings about it.This group has no intention of piping down.However, another set of Cabinet ministers are more worried about no Brexit than No Deal.One of them tells me: “The most disastrous thing for us as a party isBrexit doesn’t happen.”Another minister tells me: “The battle is only going to intensy.”But this gang of four is not as influential as they once were.The key figure from the formerly Remain wing of the Cabinet is David Lidington, effectively May’s deputy.“Liders is in the engine room. Hammond and Rudd are shouting from the sidelines,” one Tory insider tells me.Lidington is, I understand, of the view that the cross-party talks could yield something on customs.The idea would be that the UK would leave the common commercial policy, allowing it to do its own trade deals, but seek to develop a customs arrangement with the EU that would replicate other parts of the customs union.If there is a deal, the big question is how does it get through the Commons One Cabinet minister tells me that they think Mrs May should make clear before the next vote thather deal is defeated she would request a six-month extension to Article .This Secretary of State believes it would squeeze the Tory Brexit ultras, making them choose between Mrs May’s deal and a Brexit delay.THE Labour Party is about to embark on a series of ideologically driven deselections – which is all the more reason for the Tories not to do the same.Political parties must be broad churches to succeed andthe Tories set about deselecting everyone who takes a dferent view on how to achieve Brexit, they will risk turning themselves into an overly narrow faction.For this reason, local Tories should stop thinking about deselecting Nick Boles.He is wrong on ruling out No Deal, but he is right on housing and a whole host of other issues the Conservatives need to do more on.TENSIONS are mounting inside Government about the role of Olly Robbins, the PM’s chief Brexit adviser.Robbins was, I’m told, deeply irritated by reports about potential changes to the UK negotiating team.But, as one insider points out to me, there is a problem with Robbins going back to Brussels.His professional pride means he is highly sceptical about whether there’s a better deal to be done.The second problem is that this is now all about what deal will get through Parliament.But Robbins, as a civil servant, understandably doesn’t have a finger-tip feel for that.Mrs May should be relying on politicians to do this most delicate of renegotiations.In response to a request from the Health Secretary Matt Hancock, the Chief Medical Officer has drawn up the first Government guidelines on social media usage.This advice is clearly sensible.If these social media companies want to demonstrate some responsibility, they should start introducing a two-hour cut-off for all users under .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Instead, women tell themselves they should have been more attentive, or more ­attractive, or better in bed.This week the once queen of the TV jungle, Vicky Pattison, admitted she was wracked with self-doubt after her now former fiancé John Noble “cheated” on her.She even said sadly thatshe was “thinner” he might have remained faithful. This made my blood run cold.It’s typical that poor Vicky chose to shoulder the responsibility for his infidelity by not being “perfect” enough, instead of directing her anger at his betrayal. Noble was spotted with a string of young women on nights out and Vicky felt publicly humiliated and betrayed.One minute she was engaged to be married and planning her wedding. Then it all broke down and she was left in floods of tears. In order to salvage some pride, she decided to break up with Noble.Vicky really thought she had met her soulmate but, instead, it turned out he was just another man she couldn’t trust. She’s utterly devastated, but it’s infuriating her first ­reaction was not to think he’s a swine and cheat but that, somehow, she was the one to blame.Now, Vicky is a smart, feisty young woman and I’m sure she realises she was being very silly to imagine that being a few pounds lighter would have changed anything. But on some level she convinced herself she wasn’t good enough for Noble. Of course,it was the other way around it would be a dferent story.Noble proved he was a man-child, a commitment-phobe and clearly in no way ready to settle down. In these days of social media, he must surely have known thathe was chatting up other girls it would end up all over Twitter and Facebook and Vicky would discover what he was up to.Former Geordie Shore star Vicky says Noble claims he was set up in the photographs taken of him canoodling with a iety of young women, but he has expressed no remorse to her for his behaviour. He hasn’t apologised for breaking Vicky’s heart though he has been back in touch to ask for her engagement ring back.Vicky revealed that he hinted the split was actually her fault and, with her self-esteem and confidence at an all-time low, she actually believed him. His actions in those nightclubs would appear to be those of someone who wants to be found out, or perhaps he is just supremely arrogant.Anyway, I think Vicky has dodged a bullet. It’s painful and raw right now but, one day, she will realise she actually had a lucky escape. Whatthey had gone ahead with the wedding and a few years, and maybe a couple of kids down the line, he turned out to be a serial adulterer Vicky is a strong girl and will bounce back from this devastating experience. I hope her next ­relationship gives her a happy ever after ending. Butit goes awry again, she must not blame herself.And nor should any woman let down by her partner.ALL credit to Peter and Emily Andre, who have provided stability for their own children as well as Peter’s older son and daughter from his marriage to Katie Price.“The Pricey”, as Katie insists in calling herself, has been through tough times dealing with her mum’s terminal illness as well as some truly disastrous relationships.She might appear to be a cartoon character, but she should not be treated as a figure of ridicule. Despite the bold front, I reckon Katie is a mass of anxieties and insecurities and she is very vulnerable right now.I’m sure she is very grateful to her ex and especially to Emily for their support. I hope she takes time out of the public eye and gets her le back on track.I WAS heartened this week by the positive reaction to a married couple who are planning a family together, but whose circumstances mean that their only real option is surrogacy.So many wished trans couple Hannah and Jake Graf well in their quest – some even offered their services as a surrogate. They are a trailblazing man and we and role models who have helped young trans men and women in tough times.Hannah, was the highest ranking transgender soldier in the Army, and was awarded the MBE in the New Years Honours List.While actor and filmmaker Jake stars in Colette with Keira Knightley. Dominic West, who also stars in Colette, recommended that Hannah should take over from Daniel Craig as the first female James Bond.She thought this was flattering and hilarious, but reckons Jake would do a great job in the role. I am so very fond of both of them and in awe of their positivity. Their baby will be lucky to have such kind, loving parents.RIGHT everyone, you know what to do. Vote for Ernest Shackleton as the most influential person of the th century on Tuesday night’s BBC live show of Icons. My all-time hero is up against formidable opposition including Nelson Mandela, Dr Martin Luther King, Alan Turing, Pablo Picasso and David Bowie.Shackleton, the famous polar explorer also known as “The Boss”, was at his best when ­confronted by impossible odds, so I’m hopeful he can pull this off.When his ship, The Endurance, was crushed in the ice , Shackleton somehow ­managed to get all his men to ­Elephant Island in rowing boats.He then made the epic -mile voyage to South Georgia, where he climbed over uncharted mountains, to finally get his crew rescued. I was lucky enough to follow in his footsteps and re-enact that journey, then to pay my respects to The Boss at his graveside in South Georgia, right.If you don’t know his story then check out his book, South, or download the astonishingly good Channel  drama, Shackleton, starring Kenneth Branagh. And don’t forget to vote on Tuesday for this truly iconic ­British hero.BY all accounts, the Michael Jackson documentary Leaving Neverland, ­ which focuses on two men who say they were abused by the star as youngsters, is extremely disturbing and dficult to watch. If the allegations are true, then those who enabled such vile behaviour should be brought to account.Of course, Jackson is not here to defend himself, and he was found innocent of similar charges in a  court case, but the rumours have never gone away.No one wants to believe such actions could have been committed by the pop genius, whose music is still the songbook of many people’s lives. His fans remain loyal and will not entertain the thought that he might have committed any crimes.I feel sorry for his kids, especially daughter Paris, who is rumoured to have entered rehab again due to the stress and upset over the documentary.I can’t imagine how tough this is for a woman who loved her dad, but I suspect we will never really know what went on – and those on either side of the fence will never change their minds.TENNIS ace Andy Murray shared rather more than he meant to when he posted an X-ray of his hip after an operation to relieve the pain of an injury that has all but ended his career.The eagle-eyed ­– and mucky-minded – spotted there was an interestingappendage that drew the eye.Andy, above, might not be able to play tennis at the highest level any more, but he could easily take up snooker with that thing and become a world champion.IT emerged yesterday that all staff at the maternity hospital where Kate had her three babies have been told not to take any leave in April.That would suggest that after talking to her sister in law, Meghan has changed her mind about a home birth.So we will, after all, get that photo on the steps of the Lindo Wing of yet another proud royal mum looking as though she has just stepped off a catwalk.No wonder Meghan is hugging her baby bump so tightly.She knows the little one will be blinded by flashbulbs almost from the moment of emerging from the womb.   Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The beauty queen backs Health Secretary Matt Hancock’s crackdown on graphic social media content as she pours out the story of her hellish childhood today. Relentlessly bullied at school, Alisha, now , became anorexic and weighed just six stone at . But when she desperately looked for help online she was lured towards internet images “glamorising” self-harming that poisoned her mind. And it was only the shocking death of her best pal that pulled her back from the brink. Now Alisha is speaking out for the first time about her ordeal to try to help other youngsters from falling victim to the dark side of the internet. “For young girls like I was, going on social media looking for help for something like anorexia can be so destructive,” she says. “I believe Instagram now has controls sothere is a graphic image a warning sign will pop up. But you can still click on it. “These images need to be completely blocked. There’s absolutely no reason for them to be there. They don’t help anyone. They just ruin lives. “Within a week of coming across self-harming images, I started doing it too. It’s crazy what children are being exposed to on Instagram.” Alisha’s call comes in a week when Mr Hancock warned social media firms could be bannedthey fail to remove harmful content.   He spoke as it emerged -year-old Molly Russell took her own le in  after viewing content about suicide online. Her dad Ian said Instagram had “helped kill my daughter”. Alisha knows only too well how easy it would have been for a vulnerable girl like Molly with mental health issues to be influenced by what was on the screen in front of her. “Back then I didn’t know I was ill,” she says. “So when you see these sorts of things on Instagram you don’t realise they are wrong – and it can start you on this downward spiral.” Alisha’s own torment began at the tender age of five. “My dad told me I came home from nursery and refused to eat because everyone there had been calling me fat,” she says. “The first memory I have is of being about nine in Year  and being called fat all the time. Because of my last name they used to call me “cow”. “At first I didn’t let it bother me as I knew I wasn’t fat, but as you get older it gets harder to like yourself.” She started watching her diet at , and it soon became an obsession. “I was constantly counting calories and weighing food. By , I was restricting myself to  calories a day. All I’d eat was toast and an apple.   “I tried to hide what I was doing from mum. I’d either put my dinner in the bin or tell her I wasn’t hungry as I’d had lots to eat at school. If I craved food like chocolate I’d chew it then spit it out. I’d do at least  squats a night and run up the stairs until I was dizzy.” Alisha’s worried mum Amy May, , took her to a doctor. She was referred for counselling – but it didn’t help. Back at school the bullying only got worse. “I’d been bullied because I was fat, then bullied because I was thin. I was made to feel like a freak of nature,” says Alisha. “I’d walk down the street and other kids would throw things at me, stones, anything they could pick up.” But the physical damage of being hit by a stone was harmless compared to the mental damage social media would cause her. “I remember I’d been searching for healthy eating posts – nothing sinister. But then Instagram started suggesting posts about anorexia to me,” says Alisha, of Spennymoor, Co Durham. “I clicked on a before and after picture of someone who had lost a lot of weight. The person had used the hashtag #Ana so I searched for other posts with the same hashtag. “That’s when I started seeing all these graphic images. People would post pictures of themselves like skin and bones and say what they’d eaten and what exercise they had done. “It was like a competition. Everyone was trying to lose more weight than everyone . Then I started to see self-harming images too. People posted pictures after doing it, showing the cuts and all the blood.  “The posts would use really poetic language and it was all made to seem really beautul. It was like self-harming and anorexia were being glamorised. I was only , I didn’t know anything about self-harm or suicide. But then I was bombarded with all this stuff on Instagram and it made me feel like I had to do it too. “I’d cut myself on my arms and legs, mainly my legs so no one could see it.” Thoughts of taking her own le also flitted dangerously across her mind. Then just before Alisha turned , new girl Sarah Clerkson started at her school – and the pair quickly became inseparable best friends. But only eight months later Sarah – living with foster parents – was found hanged at a house party. An inquest recorded an open verdict as there was no evidence she intended to take her own le.  Alisha says: “I didn’t cope for quite a while. My mum had to sleep in my room for about three months as I was getting nightmares. I’d see Sarah hanging from my ceiling and would wake up screaming. I had to be put on sleeping tablets. “But something good did come out of her death. It caused something to snap inside me. I became determined to live le for both of us. “I haven’t self-harmed since. It was a complete reality check for me. I started eating properly. And I felt so much better in such a short time.” At , a much-changed Alisha plucked up the courage to follow the advice of her grandad to join a modelling agency. She was snapped up – and within two years she was crowned Miss Newcastle, and landed the Miss England title last year. When Alisha competed in the Miss World finals before Christmas, she paid an emotional tribute to Sarah. She says: “I was asked, ‘If you could eat dinner with anyone dead or alive who would it be ’ I said I’d like one last meal with Sarah as I never got to say goodbye. I want to tell her how thankful I am for our relationship.  “I feel like she shysacriced her le for mine. If she hadn’t died, I think it could have been me instead. It gave me the shock I needed. I had thought about taking my own le. But Sarah’s death made me realise it wasn’t an option. I’d had so much pain losing her and I couldn’t do that to my family. I’ve learned to love myself unconditionally – I’ve never been happier. “Now I get Instagram messages from some of the girls who used to bully me. They’d call me a bitch – now they want to be my gym buddy. I’m not nasty to them. I don’t want to stoop to their level. But I won’t be their gym buddy.” Alisha, now dating fellow model Joe West, , is taking a year out from a forensic crime scene investigation course at Teesside University to carry out her Miss England duties. She says: “If telling my story helps even one other teenager who is struggling like I was, then it will have been worth it.” A spokesman for Instagram said: “We do not allow content that promotes or encourages suicide or self-injury, and we will remove it as soon as we are aware. “Over the past week we have had a team of engineers working round the clock to make changes to make it harder for people to search for and find self-harm content.” He added that anybody searching for #Ana will be directed to organisations offering support.

Im a fat, useless mum, I thought. I cant play with my daughter in the park, and now I cant even keep hold of these tiny pills. Tears blurred my vision as I tried to focus on my then three-year-old daughter, Naomi, who was sleeping peacefully between pink sheets on the bed next to me. Shes better off without me, I thought as tears drenched my burning cheeks on that near fatal night of January , . But before I could cram the tablets in my mouth, Naomi turned and giggled in her sleep, and that little movement snapped me out of my darkness. How could I do that to her  How could I leave her without a mummy  I thought as I sat and cried on her bed. And that night, I knew things had to change.   I had been bullied about my weight all my le. From the time I was in primary school people said I was fat. In high school theyd kick me as I walked past and tell me my legs were too big. Theyd throw things at me and stand up in class to say how how fat I was. People didnt want to be my friend because they thought theyd be bullied toothey were seen with me. As I got older and bigger, strangers would point and laugh at me on the street. Look how fat she is! Id hear them say. Every time I left the house Id get some comment about my weight. Even when I got all dressed up and did my hair and make-up for a night out with friends, people would laugh and call me a beached whale.   So I stopped going out because I was scared of what people would say. At home I was safe and no one would laugh at me or taunt. It used to make me so sad that people couldnt accept me for who I was. I was brought up to think that everyones equal and deserves to be treated nicely. But people treated me dferently just because I was bigger than others. I found comfort in eating. I got stuck in this vicious cycle, where Id eat when I was depressed, I wouldnt exercise because I was too scared to leave the house, and I kept getting heavier. I was addicted to food. Id have at least four or five takeaways a week like pizzas, burgers, kebabs. I also ate pot noodles and pies. Every year I swore Id change. Id turn my le around, stop eating junk and Id excercise. Id prove all those people who had been horrible to me that they were wrong. That I wasnt fat.  But each year kept slipping by and on January , , after my husband kissed me and left for his job as a taxi driver, I couldnt face feeling like such a failure anymore. I was so angry at myself. Why could I not stick to my resolutions.  I felt useless. I was failing my daughter, my husband and myself. I was no good for anybody. I gathered lots of pills that night in January, , and I intended to swallow them all and that would be it. I knew Billy would be home from work soon so Naomi would not be on her own for long. Even though I was in a dark place and I wasnt thinking straight, I was still aware of her and wanted to keep her safe. But when she moved in her sleep she startled me out of that place. She was laughing in her sleep and she looked so sweet.  I suddenly thought, What am I doing  How could I leave her to wake up without a mummy anymore  I sat there for a few hours until my husband got home from work at about am. When he walked in and saw the pills he asked me, whats going on  I broke down and told him how I felt and what I almost did. He said: How could you think wed be better off without you ! We love you. And we need you. His face was just devastated. We talked for hours until we fell asleep. The next morning my whole mindset was dfferent.  I just woke up feeling dferent. I emptied the cupboards and the fridge and threw out all the processed food. It was so dferent to how I usually felt when I was trying to start a diet. I felt really positive and optimistic and I just knew I would succeed. Billy and I went to the shops and and bought healthy foods, fresh vegetables and chicken, anything I thought would be healthy I bought.I didnt know how to cook healthy food so Google became my best friend and I taught myself about healthy, clean food.I made chicken stir-fries and Mexican salads with lettuce and chicken and spicy sauces. When you start eating like that you lose weight, and I started losing  -  lbs every week. I enjoyed cooking and my husband and daughter loved eating the food. I really think the best way to lose weight is to cook everything from scratch yourself. That way you know exactly what youre eating and its much more satisfying than frozen ready-meals.  I started to walk every night after dinner. That first night I saw people walking towards me on the pavement. Usually Id cross the road to avoid hearing any nasty comments but I didnt have time. I was scared and I put my head down to avoid their gaze. But they just smiled and said, Good evening. I looked up and said Hi! nervously. I couldnt believe they didnt say anything nasty! They were nice! That was a turning point. If they had said something mean I might have just gone home and not come out again to excercise. Its so important to be kind to people. The effects nasty comments had on my le has been dficult to bear. I dont know why people are mean. Maybe they have low confidence themselves so they put other people down to make themselves feel better. But they dont know how big an effect their comments may have on another persons le. Exercising was a struggle at the start because I was so big but I stuck with it. And the more I did, the easier it got. I started doing dance fitness workouts I found on Youtube in my front room. Naomi would even join in and wiggle her little hips. I lost weight quickly - st in  months.   And although I felt much better I was left with excess skin hanging around my tummy. Its really depressing to have worked so hard to lose weight but to still not be happy when you look in the mirror. And it was painful. I had to strap the skin down with shapewear when I exercised and it would retain a lot of water which really hurt. It felt like your skin was being stretched to splitting point and it would feel very heavy. I had always thought about surgery but assumed we couldnt afford it. I didnt want to put us into debt. But my husband Billy suggested we book an appointment privately to find out about it. He said we could talk about the price later. The following month, we took out a loan for pound, and had the surgery. I explained everything to my daughter first. I said mummys going to hospital to get the extra skin off her belly. She askedit would hurt, I said no, and promised she could visit me. She used to ask me why I had the extra skin, and I told her that mummy used to be bigger but now shes smaller. When she sees old pictures of me now, she says, look! Mummy shrank!. Healing was pretty horric. I was on Tramadol and morphine to deal with the pain.  They had to cut me open from just below my chest right down to my pelvis, and from one hip across to the other like an upside down t. My stomach muscles had spread so far apart you could put your hand between them so I had to get those stitched back together too. And my belly button was in the wrong place so I had to have it pulled back through the new skin. It was a seven hour operation. I was nervous beforehand. I was scared of not waking up. But I knew I would not have a great quality of le without it. I was in a lot of pain every day with the excess skin andI ate anything with salt, it would balloon up with water, making it tight and heavy. And surgery was definitely worth it. I feel great now. Im much healthier and Im much more confident. My le has changed completely. I never thought Id have the le I have now. In the past, Id see other mums in the park, and watch them run after their children and play with them. Id get upset that I wasnt being a good enough mum to Naomi because I couldnt even walk up the stairs at home to get her dressed without a struggle. And I was really scared that as she got older, she would be teased for having the massive mum. I had been bullied viciously over my weight and I didnt want her to be bullied over it too.

After all, he had already survived having both legs blown off by a Taliban bomb when he was . The ex-sergeant received the latest crushing blow almost exactly seven years since the devastating loss of his limbs in Afghanistan. Jay, , said: “I was waiting around for a while and a doctor arrived and told me that I had lymphoma. They weren’t sure what type but confirmed that I had cancer. My reaction was, ‘OK – so what do we do now ’ “The doctor was a bit taken aback and said, ‘Did you hear me  You have cancer.’ “I said, ‘I know, but you’re talking to someone who had lost their legs. I’m ready for the fight.’”  Since being medically discharged from the Army, the dad of three has learned to walk on prosthetic limbs and has retrained as a fitness instructor. He is the UK’s only double amputee personal trainer. “I’ve had a lot of battles since I lost my legs,” he said. “I’ve had many shysetbacks but I’ve always beaten them and that’s exactly what I plan to do with this disease. “I lost my legs at , and have cancer at . This is going to be the toughest battle yet. “Don’t get me wrong, this has been a real blow. I was really nervous when I was being given the diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma and it hasn’t really sunk in yet.  “I cried my eyes out for ten minutes and I know I’ll crash. But only for five shyminutes and I won’t let a soul know. “But I’m right in the fight and I want to be right back to full health by Christmas.” Divorced Jay, from Doncaster, South Yorks, is dad to Emily , Lottie, eight, and Ollie, five.He added: “I’ve told Emily what’s wrong with me and what treatment I will need and she’s handled it really well. She’s very mature. I’ve not told the youngest two yet, I can’t seem to find the words.” Jay first noticed symptoms eight weeks ago when he was having trouble swallowing and felt lumps emerging in his neck.  His GP first thought it was a severe form of indigestion known as reflux. After the condition shyworsened, Jay went to his local hospital for a chest X-ray and blood tests. Medics eventually diagnosed shyadvanced Hodgkin shylymphoma last Monday. The cancer attacks the shyimmune system and affects only three in every , people. Each year around , people are diagnosed. According to the NHS up to  per cent live at least five years and most are cured.He said: “Being told you have cancer is one of the worse things that can happen to a person but you have to remain positive. Hodgkin lymphoma is one of the most treatable forms of it so I can take a lot of encouragement from that.”  When he was first told he had the disease he wrote in his diary that he “cried his eyes out for ten minutes” and added: “Cancer at !! no legs at !! single at !!” Jay joined the Army in January  aged  after leaving school shywithout qualications. He said: “I was one of those kids who just couldn’t get on with teachers and didn’t like being told what to do so oddly I joined the Army. “The Army was my le. I just got the bug for it. I loved my job as a sergeant, I loved the responsibility of managing other people. “Training soldiers and preparing them for battle was what I lived for. My plan was to spend my shyentire career in the Army. I loved being on shyoperations and the challenge of leading soldiers in combat.” Jay completed two operational tours of duty in Iraq and two in Afghanistan with the Princess of Wales’s Royal Regiment, But his le changed forever when he shyvolunteered for a fighting patrol and stepped on an improvised explosive device on January  .  “There was a massive explosion and I was blown on to my back,” he said. “At first I thought we had come into shycontact with the shyenemy and I tried to get up. That’s when I saw that my legs had gone. “The blast had caurterised the wounds so there wasn’t that much blood. At that very shymoment I realised my le was going to be very dferent. “Very quickly there were people around me – shymembers of my platoon. I could see by the look on their faces that it was bad. I could feel a burning sensation, almost like really bad sunburn. A female medic shyappeared and I asked her to check that my genitals were still intact.  “She put her hand down my trousers, did a quick check and said, ‘Don’t worry you’re OK.’ “That was a shymassive relief.” Jay’s platoon shycarried him on a stretcher to a safe area before he was loaded on a US Black Hawk shyhelicopter and flown to Camp Bastion hospital.   “I was later told the Taliban found one of my legs and hung it in a tree as a sign of victory,” he said. “That was very hard for me to accept.” When Jay shyarrived at hospital, shymedics cut away his shredded unorm.He added: “I was then sedated and when I woke up I was back in the UK. I spent four weeks in hospital before being moved to Headley Court for shyrehabilitation. “It was while I was there that I was told I was going to be medically discharged. “It was the worst day of my le. Far worse than losing my legs.” Jay was at the Headley Court shyrehabilitation centre for injured service people in Surrey for two years.  “I hated every minute of it. It just wasn’t me. It was important for a lot of guys but I just wanted to get back to proper soldiering again.There was shynothing dficult about it. In fact it was quite relaxed, which was the problem. I put on a lot of weight and, to be honest, was just disinterested in the whole thing.” Jay was discharged in August  and turned his energy towards physical training. “Being medically discharged was a real blow. I was convinced that there was a role for me in the Army. “But becoming a personal trainer has helped me a lot. I got really fit and was able to help people who also had shydisabilities get fit as well.” Jay, who has begun a six-month course of chemotherapy, said: “As far as I am concerned this is just another battle which I will have to fight and win.” "},{"url":null,"title":"heroic men saved teenage girl","story":"NewsHeroic men saved teenage girl from rape and held attacker until police arrivedPolice have praised the action of the men who gave chase to the suspected sex attacker in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater ManchesterShareByPat Hurst:,  FEB NewsPolice in Manchester have appealed for more information about the incident \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailDetectives have praised a group of men who stopped the attempted rape of a terried teenager and held the suspect until police arrived.

I thought I was going to die. Dad had come with me and he grabbed my hand, trying to reassure me. He told me Id be fine, but I couldnt really hear him. It was horrible, like a nightmare.  I hugged my baby tighter as tears flooded my eyes, skewing my vision as much as the news had skewed my thoughts. All I could think of were my babies, Oscar, , and Oliver who is now , and how theyd have to grow up without a mother. How Id never get to see them grow-up.  Over the next few weeks Id cry over everything. And I kept staring blankly at things just thinking, Im going to die. I remembered how a mole on my stomach had become stupidly itchy when I was six months pregnant with Oliver. My skin is very fair and I have lots of moles and freckles but they had never itched like that before.  And whenever I showered, the rest of my skin would turn pink from the heat but there would always be a white ring around the mole on my belly. But I ignored it because I thought it was just a symptom of my belly stretching and changing with pregnancy. I gravely regret that decision to ignore it now. Most dermatologists recommend a skin self-exam every month to detect unusual growths or changes early.It is important to look closely at the entire body including the scalp, buttocks and genitalia, palms and soles including the spaces between the fingers and toes.The acronym ABCDE can be extremely helpful in evaluating moles. If a mole shows any of these features, it warrants review by a dermatologist to exclude melanoma, the most serious type of skin cancer. Asymmetry: one half of the mole is dferent to the other Border: irregular, scalloped or poorly defined edge Colour: uneven colour or iable colours within a mole Diameter: the mole is bigger than mm in size Evolving: the mole is changing in its size, shape or colour Other signs to look out for include any new moles, a mole that looks signicantly dferent to the others , or any skin lesion that bleeds or fails to heal. Source: British Skin Foundation  But luckily I did not ignore it forever. Months after having Oliver, the itching had not stopped and it still had a white ring around the area whenever I showered. Then I started to worry. I knew then that it wasnt normal. I went to my GP, they looked at it through the microscope and said, well take it off. They carved and scraped it off that day but then I had to wait two weeks for the results.   When the results arrived, my GP rang and told me to come in straight away which brought me to the surgery that day. He told me I had cancer as soon as I sat down. But we caught it when it was still a superficial melanoma. My doctor told me I could have saved my own le by walking into the surgery that day. If I had ignored the warning signs, five years down the line it probably would have gone deeper into my body and spread to my bones. My dad had malignant melanoma which luckily he caught too before it had spread.   He always told me to check my moles, and get them checked by a doctorI ever noticed any changes to them. Im glad he told me because otherwise I may not have gone to the doctor when I did. Ive had six moles removed so far, and I have to go back for regular check-ups and I was told Ill probably need to get more off. But Id rather have , scars than cancer.  Now I dont ever want to go on holidays too far from home in Birkenhead again. Id rather go camping in the woods. I have very fair skin and when I was younger I used sunbeds a lot and oil when I was on holidays. I majorly regret doing that now. Ill use factor  and wear a hatI ever have to be in the sun again. Now, I really want to warn other people thatyou ever notice a change in your moles, please go and see your doctor. Early detection is vital and that trip to your doctor could save your le.  Skin cancer deaths are preventable, warns dermatologist Dr Juber Hafiji, consultant dermatologist,specialist dermatologicsurgeon andBritish Skin Foundationspokesperson, said that although skin cancer isa commoncancer in the UK, it can be cureddetected early. Dr Hafiji told the Sunday Mirror: “Skin cancer deaths are entirely preventableyetover, people dieannuallyfrommelanoma in the UK, which is one of the deadliest forms of skin cancer that I see.” “When it comes to Melanoma,millimetresof spread into the skin canmake a dferenceregarding the prognosis of an inidual. “Look out for any changes in the size, shape and colour of moles, especiallythese changes happen suddenly. “Itching, bleeding or changes in sensationcanalso bethe earlysymptomsand signsof skin cancer.” If you are concerned, or have a family history of skin cancer, thenDr Hafiji recommends getting a full-body examinationtodetect any early signs of skin cancer or precancerous growths.

Daisy Fail’s parents had been preparing to uproot the family and head to Florida so their daughter could undergo targeted lesaving radiation treatment on her bladder tumour. But specialists say she can now have treatment in Manchester, which her parents hope will allow her “to grow up like any other little girl”. More rounds of chemotherapy and vital surgery are necessary before the treatment can begin. Andrew and Lynne Fail were ready to take frail Daisy , miles to Florida for six weeks of therapy – as it was shypreviously only NHS-funded overseas. But the new poundmillion centre at The Christie Hospital in Manchester means little Daisy can start treatment next month just  miles from home. Dad Andrew, , said: “It has made the hell we are going through that bit more bearable. We’d have gone to the end of the world for Daisy to get help.  “To have it here in the UK means we don’t have to uproot her when she’s so fragile – or move our whole family shyoverseas for two months.” The specialised radiation therapy uses high-energy protons instead of X-rays to directly target cancers without damaging tissues around the tumours. It is beneficial for children at risk of lasting damage to organs that are still growing. In Daisy’s case, her kidneys are impacted by her tumour. She was diagnosed in November with rhabdomyosarcoma – a soft tissue sarcoma suffered by fewer than  UK children each year. Andrew, who works in car manufacturing, went on: “She was so tiny… it was devastating. “We were told it was aggressive – the type of tumour that is fast-growing. Her bladder was being crushed and her right kidney was failing.  “We were warned her fertility and surrounding bones and muscles might be affected by chemo. “Post-surgery, proton beam therapy will improve her long-term prospects.” The family was initially told NHS funding would cover travel to the UF Health Proton Therapy Institute in Jacksonville, Florida. It meant taking older daughter Scarlett, , out of school while Andrew and Lynne, , who works for the NHS prescription pricing authority, went on leave.Accommodation and flights would be funded but living expenses would have “crippled” the family. Learning that Daisy would be admitted to The Christie, which will treat  patients a year, was “a Godsend,” said Andrew. So far, Daisy has had five out of nine rounds of chemo and she spent five weeks in hospital before Christmas.She will have surgery this month to remove as much of the tumour as possible before having the proton treatment.  Andrew, from Consett, County Durham, added: “Watching our lively, funny little girl go through this has been heartbreaking. Her curly hair has fallen out and we’ve told Daisy her tummy is poorly and doctors are making it better. Watching her suffer is horrendous but the hospital staff have been incredible.” Proton beam therapy drew worldwide attention after the case of five-year-old Ashya King in .His parents were arrested for taking him – against NHS advice – from Southampton General Hospital to the Czech Republic for shytreatment.Last year, Brett and Naghmeh said Ashya was winning his fight and his tumour shows no sign of ing. Daisy, meanwhile, will be admitted to The Christie next month and have treatment Monday to Friday for six weeks.  The Christie is the only NHS-funded centre offering the therapy and the first patient was seen just before Christmas.Another centre is due to open at University College London Hospital next year. Proton Partners – which has three UK centres – offers privately funded therapy but is set to accept some NHS referrals.

RBS, taken under Government control in  after losing poundbillion, is  per cent owned by the Treasury.   The source said: “Nights out drinking champagne were basically sponsored by the taxpayer.

Drivers have been warned the severe cold means gritting on the roads will not be as effective as usual. The coldest parts of the UK will be in the Scottish Highlands, where forecasters have predicted a bitter -C. Meanwhile, southern England has also been warned it could dip to -C in areas around Basingstoke and Andover in Hampshire. The region was also covered in snow on Friday causing traffic chaos on motorways across south west England. But Braemar in Aberdeenshire in Scotland will be where the mercury falls the most - and will be colder than the Belgrano II research base in Antarctica which is expected to be -C tomorrow.   On Friday, temperatures dropped to -.C in the town as hotel guests wrapped up warm for walks in the snow and had log fires roaring. The base is the closest research station to the South Pole -  miles away. The AA warns grit spreading on the roads might not help in areas where it falls below -C and is virtually non-effective at temperatures lower than -C.  If temperatures reach the predicted levels, it will be the coldest recorded in Britain since February  but not as cold as the overall record which is the -.C recorded in Altnaharra in Scotland in December . The Met Office has issued a yellow warning for ice in eastern, south west and south east England and London with more white stuff predicted on Monday. It said: After dark, temperatures will fall rapidly and untreated wet surfaces, particularly those where snow has partly melted and then refreezes, will become very icy.   Further warnings have been issued for snow and ice overnight into Monday as rain turns to snow across eastern parts of Scotland and northern England.

I used to be an out-going, happy person. Now I suffer from extreme anxiety, shyterried that having shyanother attack will kill me and leave my children without their mum.” She spoke out after NHS Medical Director Professor Stephen Powis warned of the dangers of celebrity-endorsed products on social media.  He said: “Highly influential celebrities are letting down the very people who look up to them by peddling products which are at best ineffective and at worst harmful.” Melissa, of Bridgend, South Wales, ordered a detox programme including an pound. nutritional supplement – called JST Jodie Marsh JFlext Joint Care – after reading Jodie’s posts about her JST Nutrition range on Instagram. She was so impressed with -year-old model Jodie’s body transformation that she bought the pills in an attempt to replicate it. But iodine – which she is severely allergic to – was NOT listed in the ingredients section of the product’s website, despite being contained in the pills. Jodie said that while it is not listed under ingredients on the website, iodine is shymentioned on the site and in the small print on the bottle.  She said: “The product does say under ‘nutritional information’ on the website that it contains iodine – and it does say it on the bottle. If someone with a known iodine allergy takes it, there is nothing I can do about that.” But Melissa, whose kids are Keira, nine, and Lewis, eight, claimed the inconsistency of labelling could have been fatal. She called on celebrities to thoroughly check products they are selling before shyendorsing them.

As I took a sip of water to calm myself down, my bottom lip began to tingle and swell. “I looked in the mirror and was horried to see my bottom lip was massive and my tongue was also swollen.”  She was so sick she flagged down a police car to take her to the nearest doctor’s surgery. The GP was concerned enough to sent her to hospital by ambulance. She said: “You read about people dying like this. “I felt so out of control. All I could think about was that my kids could be left without their mum.” It took THREE adrenaline shots to keep her alive and anti-histamine and steroids to keep her stable. Melissa contacted customer services at JST Nutrition.

Monica Rana’s miraculous conception is even more remarkable when she spells out just how it came about. At , she feared she was over the hill, resigned herself to a child-free le and went on a two-week cruise with a pal. The women visited the landmark in the Italian capital, where Monica twice tossed two coins into the water, each time wishing for a baby. Days later she had a holiday fling with a fellow cruiser.And weeks later she discovered she had conceived not one but two babies – so BOTH of her Trevi wishes had come true. Fast-forward nine months and Monica has gorgeous four-week-old twins Athena and Luna.  And she is still coming to terms with the fact that she is a parent in her forties after years of trying. The cruise ship Romeo who fathered the twins is in contact with Monica and giving her his support as she focuses on being a full-time mum. Monica, from Medway, Kent, said: “I have always wanted children and I just can’t believe I made two wishes at the Trevi Fountain and both were granted. “I feel blessed. I was lucky enough to fall pregnant in the first place, but to find out there were two in there was a real shock. I’m four weeks into being a mum and it still doesn’t seem real. “I hadn’t been home from the cruise long when I started feeling dizzy, like I was still at sea. “When the queasiness didn’t subside, the possibility of being shypregnant crossed my mind. But with previous results I’d had from the fertility clinic, I knew I wouldn’t be. “I decided to buy a test to rule it out completely and when I saw the second pink line appear on the stick, I was gobsmacked.” Over the years, Monica had shyseparated from partners because they hadn’t wanted children. But she thought her luck had changed when she met her last boyfriend.  She explained: “I made it clear from the beginning I wanted a family and he told me he felt the same. “But as time went on he changed his mind, leaving me devastated and running out of time to meet the right man, fall in love and have a child with.” It was following the split – and after tests revealed she had a very low number of oian follicles – that Monica’s friend Anita Bristol, , suggested they go on holiday. Monica said: “Anita had been talking about going on a cruise for a while. I’ve known her for  years andanyone knows how to have a good time, it’s her. I knew I was in good hands! “On the ship, we began discussing my new le plan. We agreed to make the most of our freedom by enjoying nights out and weekends away, travelling the world and maybe even living abroad together for a while.“We also planned to look after each other when we were older and I decided I could simply spoil my nieces and nephews, rather than have a baby of my own.” But deep down, Monica couldn’t ignore her longing to be a mum and when the ship docked near Rome, she and Anita headed to the ancient city and saw the Trevi Fountain. Monica glowed as she described the moment she made her wish. She said: “I wanted to make a wish, but I didn’t have any change. Anita had some euro coins and I asked her to give me some to throw in. Thankfully she did. “I used my right hand to toss the coins in over my left shoulder, just like the other tourists. Then I silently wished for a baby. Problem was, I wasn’t sure the coins had gone in the water, so I had to ask Anita for more.“She couldn’t believe I was taking the last of her ice cream money! I made the same wish again and this time was satisfied the euros had gone into the fountain.” Days later, Anita and Monica spent the evening with two men they had met earlier on their trip. Monica went on: “I got talking to one of the men we had been spending time with and couldn’t ignore the spark of attraction between us.   “One thing led to another and we ended up having sex. When I discovered I was pregnant weeks later, I thought back to the night me and my holiday romance had got together. “We’d had one too many drinks – the reason we hadn’t used contraception. I knew it was foolish but at the same time I was thrilled to think I might be having a baby.” Then came the eight-week scan... and a second surprise for Monica. She continued: “The sonographer turned the screen around. He showed me my baby, then moved the wand slightly and said, ‘And here’s the other one’. I thought he was joking and a friend with me burst into tears, which set the nurse off crying too! I wasn’t just going to be a mum, but a mum of twins. I was so shocked. “When I told Anita, she screeched down the phone with excitement and joked she owned the babies because the four euros I’d used to wish for them were hers! I told the father of the twins and he was really good about it. “Despite us not being in a relationship, he said he would support me.” After discovering she was having two girls at her -week scan, Monica started stocking up on the essentials. At  weeks, she was classed as full-term and was induced. But when one of the placentas ruptured, she was rushed into theatre for an emergency C-section.Non-identical twins Athena and Luna both weighed in at a healthy lb oz.Thrilled Monica said: “When I met them for the first time and held them both in my arms, it was such a strange feeling. They were so beautul, I couldn’t stop gazing at them. “Two days later I turned  and my daughters were the best birthday presents I could ask for. “Becoming a mother hasn’t worked out the way I always imagined it would and I know there will be tough times ahead, especially being a single mum, but I have a lot of love to give to Athena and Luna. “I’m so grateful to Anita for giving me her money to throw in the fountain. She helped make my wish – or wishes – come true.

Talking of Alan’s last hours, Judith, , told the Sunday People: “He was in and out of shyconsciousness but we were able to have some conversations before the end.   “He told me he had always regarded the twins as ours and his last wish was for me to go to America and try to make contact with them. I don’t knowthis will be possible but I will do everything I can to honour his dying request.” Neither had seen twins Kiara and Keyara Wecker – who they had renamed Kimberly and Belinda – since they lived with the couple for just three weeks at their home in Buckley, Flintshire. The Kilshaws had given the money to the six-month-olds’ American mum Tranda in . But a custody fight caused uproar on both sides of the Atlantic. British social services stepped in tothe babies to the US, where they were adopted by a loving family. Alan was by Judith’s side as they tried to prevent the youngsters being taken into care and ed to America. At the height of the court battle for the twins, Judith was branded the most hated shywoman in Britain.   Mum-of-four Judith, who had two sons James, , and Rupert, , with Alan, and two older daughters, looked into international adoption after being told they were unable to have more children. They brought the girls to Britain on six-month tourist visas in December  planning to live in the couple’s seven-bedroom farmhouse. They shared the house with Judith’s younger daughter, their two sons, six dogs, more than a dozen cats, two ferrets, a horse, a pony and two pot-bellied pigs. In January  then-Prime Minister Tony Blair said action would be taken to stop the “deplorable” trading of babies to the shyhighest bidder, and a shake-up in the rules followed. On January , , Flintshire social services and North Wales Police removed the twins from the Beaufort Park Hotel, near Mold, where they had been staying with the Kilshaws. The girls were ed to the US in April  and placed in foster care. Another set of parents eventually raised them. Last August it emerged the girls had both started shyuniversity in the US and were studying shysocial sciences. Judith said: “He had fond shymemories of them and said they had grown into nice girls. He was pleased at their success but made the point that they would have achieved the samethey had stayed in Britain. “He never regretted that we bought the twins and neither do I. “But he did regret the way Flintshire county council social services intervened. It is possible that all that stress around the adoption might in some way have contributed to his condition, without us knowing it at the time.”  Former solicitor Alan became ill with breathing problems in February last year and was treated first in Leighton Hospital, Crewe, and then in the Countess of Chester Hospital. Judith thought he would be out quickly but he was in a coma within two days. She said: “He developed sepsis and it was frightening, I thought he was dying.” Doctors diagnosed scarring of the lungs. He had a tracheostomy in March he and seemed to be fighting back but his muscles began to atrophy. In December Alan died from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, the same chronic lung disease which also killed TV star Keith Chegwin, . Judith and Alan who married in , and split in  but remained on good terms. Alan even walked her down the aisle when she married Stephen Sillett, her third husband, three years later. She said: “Despite our shyorce I hadn’t fallen out with Alan and he was still my best friend. It is like a chunk of my le has gone. I told him he was a good man. “He was always kind, shygenerous and respectful. We met through a lonely hearts ad in the Chester Chronicle. “If I had a problem I could always go to him, we never lost that friendship. We had become like brother and sister.”   Judith visited him in hospital every day and left Stephen in February because Alan was in need. She thought it would only be for a month or so but when she realised the severity of his illness she gave up her job as a cleaner in the Co-op. His funeral was in St Helens, Merseyside and Judith plans to scatter his ashes at historic Llanthony Priory in Monmouthshire. She said it would be a “fascinating” to meet and talk to the twins again: “I’d like to know how their lives went, what they’ve done, where they’ve been. I’d want to tell them about my le. I do think about them. Do they know about me and Alan, do they think about what happened to us  “It would be a good, fascinating shyconversation. At least the girls have come out good. I’m pleased about that.” Judith is living on her own and said it has its benefits. She said: “I now want to find my own le and find myself. My le has been a roller coaster but I think it is my time now.” Judith has bought a dog, a three-year-old shyfemale French bulldog called Roxy but was shyconsidering adopting a street dog from Romania.   She said: “The dogs are shyliving in terrible shyconditions over there, they put them in death shelters. I am friends with some of the dogs on Facebook, and every night I look at them.” Judith said she and Alan had several heartfelt conversations in his final days and weeks. Alan told her he never shyregretted trying to adopt the twins, despite the shyinternational outcry it caused. Talking about the girls’ lives in America Judith said: “All we ever wanted was for them to have a good le. “I still think they should have stayed with me and Alan.” She still keeps faded photos of the girls from the brief time they spent with the couple in Britain. Judith added: “I wonderthey’ve been told about what happened to them and about us  “I’m glad they are doing so well, I only hope they do well. We always wanted the best for them.” "},{"url":null,"title":"woman who broke wrist prince","story":"NewsWoman who broke wrist in Prince Philip crash faces surgery as injury fails to healEXCLUSIVE: Mum Emma Fairweather, , now needs a titanium plate to repair her agonising fractureShareCommentsByAmy Sharpe:,  FEB NewsEmma Fairweather suffered a broken wrist in the crash \"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe mum who broke her wrist in a car crash with Prince Philip is to undergo surgery this week after attempts to set it naturally failed.

Now parents are noticing a rather unexpected consequence of their kids watching the show, and its all to do with the way their kids are speaking. Mums and dads from around the world have reported that their children have started talking like the pink pig character - with some adopting a plum British accent and others snorting at the end of sentences. On Romper , mums have described their kids hilarious mimicking. One wrote: After  hours of flight time spent binge-watching Peppa Pig episodes on the iPad, my kid had adopted Peppa Pigs plum British accent, calling me Mummy and finishing her sentences with Peppas trademark snort.   Two years later, she still oinks in conversation. Call it the Peppa effect. Another mum, from Virginia in the US, said her little one has started saying Daddy in the same way Peppa Pig does. Meanwhile, a mum based in Seattle, Washington, noticed that her three-year old watches so much Peppa Pig she pronounces Zebra and tomato with a British accent, according to a Twitter post. Another parent on Twitter revealed: I was excited when my daughter started watching Peppa Pig because I thought she might pick up an adorable British accent, but all shes learned is to snort like a pig. A third wrote on the social media : Thanks to Peppa Pig my yo, who has never been outside of Washington, Oregon and Calornia has a solid British accent. Parents in the north of the UK have also noticed their little ones picking up southern English accents from the show. A mum based in Leeds wrote on Twitter: my toddler often speaks with a southern English accent because of too much exposure to Peppa Pig. Would prefer an American accent to her using a long A in bath and castle...   While it may seem slightly oddyour child is picking up a strong BBC English accent, experts assure that this kind of mimicking is simply a matter of exposure. Roberto Rey Agudo, the language program director of the department of Spanish and Portuguese at Dartmouth College told Romper that reports of Peppa accents outside of the UK are partly down to the popularity of the show. He said its in part because Peppa Pig has been such a phenomenon with the  to -year-old crowd and its considered cute, whereas I dont know what other shows have that kind of currency right now.

Steve Warner, who is in charge of a high school in Melbourne, is now being investigated by education chiefs in Australia. But hundreds of parents have defended Mr Warner - who was suspended by Victoria state education minister James Merlino on Friday. Footage appears to show Mr Warner dragging the boy by the arm across the ground in front of the school which was reportedly captured by another student.   A petition has been signed by more than , parents with a campaign using #standbysteve also gaining support on social media. The campaign was started by parent, Mark England, who says Mr Warner has had an amazing influence on the school. Despite the support for the head teacher, Mr Merlino branded the footage appalling and concerning. It has been claimed the boy was being punished for reportedly kicking a pregnant teacher in the stomach - which have not been substantiated.But this has been denied by the boys sister, Bianca Moore, who told Daily Mail Australia her brother was autistic and throwing a tantrum and kicked a trolley during an outburst.She said: He suffers from ADHD and anxiety and obviously starting at a new school has upset him, he was having a tantrum. Ms Moore explained her brother was misbehaving but while it was not an excuse it was how he deals with his emotions.   The mother-of-one also denied he had kicked a teacher saying her brother was not an animal but agreed with the principal being called to remove him from the situation during the incident. But the fact he was dragged by his arm and now has bruising from this shows how rough the principal was, she added. The petition calls on Mr Merlino to reinstate the embattled principal after the investigation saying he does not deserve to be sacked and should continue his good work. Posting the petition, Mr England said: He has turned this school around with a renewed focus on learning. He has improved discipline and behavior across the school and his management has seen many improvements in the schools facilities for students making for a fantastic environment. We are asking that his dedicated work at the school not be in vain due to this one isolated incident. Another parent told people to look closely to realise the child was not even dragged on the floor but was sitting on a mini skateboard. A Victoria Police spokesman has also confirmed officers are investigating whether any criminal charges will be made.  It is yet to be determinedthe nine-year-old boy was injured during the incident, they added according to Channel  News . The exact circumstances are being investigated.In a statement, Mr Merlino said: Let me be very clear, I will not tolerate this kind of completely unacceptable behaviour in our schools. There will be an independent investigation into the staff members conduct, and he has been immediately stood down while this takes place.

Egyptian archaeologists found  mummies dating back to -BC, the Ptolemaic era, at the Tuna El-Gebel site in Minya. The mummies, including  children, were in four burial chambers ft deep inside the tomb south of Cairo, said Egypts antiquities ministry. Some were in stone coffins or wooden sarcophagi, while others were wrapped in linen, the government said. It is likely the people held important positions during the Ptolemaic era, when a Macedonian Greek royal family ruled Ptolemaic Kingdom in Egypt.   The familys rule lasted  years - ending with the apparent suicide of Cleopatra VII as the kingdom fell to Rome - and they were ancient Egypts last dynasty. The identities of the mummies were still unknown, said Mostafa Waziri, secretary-general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities. He said: We have not found names written in hieroglyphics.   He said it was obvious from the mummication method that the iniduals whose remains were found had to some extent held important or prestigious positions. Forty of the mummies were displayed during an announcement ceremony attended by ambassadors from several countries. The archaeological finding was the first of .

Over the last decade, experts stabilised wall paintings that decorate the boy-kings chamber, installed barriers and set up a ventilation system to reduce damage to the site. They also spent time investigating mysterious brown spots that were growing on wall paintings inside the tomb where the Pharaohs mummied body was discovered by British Egyptologist Howard Carter in  The brown spots were feared to be growing like a fungus, but conservators confirmed that the spots were microbes that were long dead.

Koku Istambulova, a survivor of Stalin’s repressions, would have turned  in June, according to accepted pension records in Russia. She was older than a woman listed in the Russian Book of Records who died last month supposedly aged , officials believed. Koku made headlines last year by saying she had never lived a single happy day in her long le. Her grandson Iliyas Abubakarov said she had supper as usual on Sunday, January  at her village home in Chechnya.   “She was joking, she was talking,” he said. “Then she suddenly felt unwell, she complained of a chest pain.“We called the doctor, we were told that her blood pressure had dropped, and injections were made.“But they failed to save her. She died in a quiet way, fully conscious, praying.” She has been buried in her home village Bratskoe, survived by five grandchildren and  great grandchildren. A Muslim who was born before the last Tsar Nicholas II was crowned, she outlived the Soviet Union by a generation, according to her internal Russian passport. Her date of birth was claimed to be  June  - when Queen Victoria was on the throne in Britain. But her passport gave only a year of her birth, not the exact day and month.   In extraordinary and moving testimony broadcast last year she spoke emotionally of the appalling day her native Chechen people were deported en masse by Stalin to the steppes of Kazakhstan  years ago. She told how people died in the cattle-truck trains - and their bodies were thrown out of the carriages to be eaten by hungry dogs. If her age was correct, Koku was  at the time, having earlier lived through the coronation of the last tsar Nicholas II two days before her th birthday - and his toppling when she was . “It was a bad day, cold and gloomy,” she said of the February morning in  when the entire entire nation was banished from their mountain homeland in the Trans-Causacus. “We were put in a train and taken … no one knew where. “Railway carriages were stuffed with people - dirt, rubbish, excrement was everywhere.” Stressing the cruelty of Stalin’s action, she told journalists determinedly in her native Chechen language: “Write that - there was excrement in the carriages.   “We were not allowed [to go] anywhere.” Young Caucasus girls died because from the rupturing of their bladders - they were ashamed to go to the toilet in crowded stinking the crowded trains. Older women tried to crowd round them to stop their embarrassment as they relieved themselves. Yet there was worse. “On the way to our exile, dead bodies were just thrown out of the train,” she said. “Nobody was allowed to bury the dead. “Corpses were eaten by dogs. My father-in-law was thrown out of the train in this way.” A paranoid Stalin had alleged the Chechens were collaborating with the Nazis. “We were told that we were bad people and thats why we had to leave,” she said. Before the war, she recalled “scary” Nazi tanks passing her family home. She suffered devastating personal bereavements in her Kazakh hell - her two sons both perished in the harsh conditions. “There were no doctors, no-one to treat them,” she said. “My younger boy came down with something and passed away really quickly.   Such things happened in every family. “When women gave birth children often died because there were no obstetricians, only neighbours and friends.” Weeping the old lady said: “I only kept my daughter Tamara.” She was exiled in Kazakhstan for  years then, after Stalin’s death, people were allowed toto their homeland. When she got back, many houses had been grabbed by incoming Russians - so she set to work building her own home, complaining her husband was too lazy for the work. She conceded that despite her earlier claim, the day she moved into her own house, built with her own hands, after ing from internal Soviet exile was “happy”. “I built it myself, the best house in the world,” she said. “I lived there for  years.” Asked about the secret of going le, she previously said: “It was God’s will. “I did nothing to make it happen. “I see people going in for sports, eating something special, keeping themselves fit, but I have no idea how I lived until now.” Her recipe for a long le was fermented milk, but she shunned meat and soup. She asked: Why did Allah give me such a long le and so little happiness .... “I would have been dead long ago,not for Allah who was holding me in his arms.” Koku said: “It is hard to live when all who remembered you died long ago. And it is very scary to die, however old you are.” The oldest documented human was Jeanne Calment, from France, who lived  years,  days, dying in . French scientists have dismissed a recent claim from Russian researchers who argued she assumed the identity of her dead daughter and was not as old as records show.

But Mr Middleton said that the sign was being ignored and there was a danger at the bend where cyclists meet traffic.Speed reducing tables have been installed at the site, but Mr Middleton said: ldquoCars are going over the raised tables at mph and then drivers are putting the foot down in between them.He has reported his concerns to the council who carried out a survey in May last year. It revealed the average speed in the mph zone at the busiest time in the morning is .mph.He is now urging the council to instal signs to alert the drivers to the oncoming cyclists or a speed indicating devicewhich will show road users their speed.The path is used by pupils from Lochardil Primary, Inverness Royal Academy Holm Primary and the Gaelic school.Mr Middleton fears young people on the path may not be seen by fast moving vehicles: ldquoWe have crossed this road many times andin the company of two or four of my grandchildren this is more dficult, the main reason for this is in estimating the speed of accelerating vehicles since the tables were installed said Mr Middleton.A Highland Council spokeswoman said: ldquoA mph zone was recently installed in the Culduthel Lochardil area at the request of the community council.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13926204.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18355078.jpg","title":"ayr united 2 inverness 3","story":"NewsAyr United  Inverness : John Roberston hails Somerset Park among best grounds in worldThe Inverness gaffer was full of praise for the old fashioned surroundings as his side clung on in the face of a stirring fightback.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsNathan Austin puts Caley - up \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJohn Robertson hailed Somerset Park as one of the best grounds in the WORLD after Caley held off a storming Ayr fightback. Inverness were three up and on easy street after a crazy opening  minutes which saw United gt-wrap the game.

Somerset Park is one of these grounds that sucks you inyou give them a snf. Its a good throwback and their fans make it intimidating and a good atmosphere for teams when you lose a goal. Its brilliant...one of the best grounds in the world to come and play your football. In the past we might have lost a game like this so Im delighted.  Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.  But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending.

Mark Kirkby, , almost killed passenger Kerrie Anne Monaghan when he finally crashed into a wall. Miss Monaghan was in Ayr Sherf Court on crutches to hear the sentence on her partner, who she is standing by. The court heard Kirkby did not even have a driving licence and Sherf John Montgomery banned him from holding one for four years. Depute fiscal Lindsay Bain told the court police spotted a silver Volvo being driven erratically from Barassie Street into Portland Street. The police car’s blue lights went on and Kirkby initially slowed down before increasing speed. He was hitting mph in Templehill before heading into Harbour Road. And Kirkby’s car was said to have taken off as he drove across a mini roundabout into Port Ranald Drive. He hit mph in North Shore Road, eventually crashing into a wall at the Beach Road Kilmarnock Road junction in Barassie. During the whole episode, which began around .am on October  last year, Kirkby drove dangerously through junctions and swerved round corners.  When the crash occurred the car’s airbags were deployed but this did not prevent Ms Monaghan’s horric injuries. She had to be cut out of the car by firefighters and suffered numerous fractures to her face, head, body and limbs. “Kerrie Anne Monaghan is very lucky to be alive,” said fiscal Ms Bain. The court also heard of offences committed by Kirkbywhose address was given as Barlinnie Prison, on June . This time he was in a grey Ford Mondeo around .am when police spotted the car stationary on the A near the Pennyburn Roundabout. Kirkby was unsteady on his feet and slurring his speech, although a breath test proved negative. A a blood test found substances identied as cocaine and benzocaine. Defence lawyer Hugh Duncan said Kirkby’s relationship with Ms Monaghan was still ongoing. “He accepts full responsibility,” said the lawyer. “He comes across as remorseful to the injuries his partner suffered and to potential harm he could have done to others.” Mr Duncan said Kirkby had been remanded in custody since October , had undergone a detox programme, and had come to a realisation of his mental health issues. Sherf John Montgomery told Kirkby: “You drove dangerously at high speed for an extended period. I see no option but a custodial sentence.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnHMP BarlinnieVolvoAyrCourtsJusticeTroon"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article11461688.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/ymr_ayp_141112Elliots_02.jpg","title":"elliots prestwick evolve rebrand vics","story":"NewsElliots in Prestwick to \"evolve\" with rebrand as Vics  The VineBosses at Buzzworks say the bar and restaurant must \"evolve\" as part of its transformation.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  FEB NewsBuzzworks managing director, Kenny Blair, is promising bold changes at Elliots \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailOne of Ayrshire’s biggest hospitality venues has closed for a “complete transformation”.

Danielle Smith, , used a metal pole to shatter windows of a home on Ness Glen Road, Dalmellington on November , . But she didn’t act alone as Smith was spotted alongside a male when the pair terried their targets inside. Ayr Sherf Court heard he appeared to be carrying a black air rle. But Smith, of Castle Croft, Dalmellington, admitted shoving the barrel of the rle into the home. And the victims inside cowered in fear as they could hear Smith shouting “Get out here, get our here.” CCTV footage captured the pair on their threatening violent spree. Almost every window in the home had been smashed and holes in the windows were consistent with shots of the rle. Blood smears were spotted on the living room window. Police were called and discovered the metal pole used by Smith the following morning. A search warrant in Smith’s home uncovered pellets for an air rle in a box within her bedroom. But she told officers that the other person had been carrying the gun and she had never seen the gun before. She also stated that she threw the metal pole away as she believed the other person would have used it. Solicitor Steven Maxwell told the court he had viewed the footage.

People have to take responsibility for their own lives and lestyle choices, and as long as you keep within the law, the state should have no place in telling you what you can eat or drink.A motion put forward by Mr Scott called for the response to be completely rejected, but it was not supported by his fellow councillors.Instead, they opted to vote to submit the consultation response in full, albeit as a council officer response not as a political response.According to NHS Health Scotland, in , % of Scotlandrsquos children were at risk of becoming overweight and % were at risk of becoming obese.

midpoint of winter, half way between the shortest day and the spring equinox.For Christians it has a particularly special meaning as it was  days after the birth of Jesus and the day when, according to Jewish custom, his grateful parents took him to the temple to give thanks to God.We believe that Jesus is the light of the world who will guide us through our own dark times.Many customs have grown around Candlemas and one of the most interesting came from Scotland.In the olden days, Candlemas was the day when children brought candles to school so that the classrooms would have light on dull days.As time went on, gas lighting took over from candlelight and the children brought money to school with which the teacher was supposed to buy sweets for the children.The child who brought in the most money was declared Candlemas King or Queen and they ruled for six weeks.They had the power to make one whole afternoon a week a playtime and to excuse anyone they wished from any form of punishment.I don#t think this will catch on in Argyll!I think it is a lovely custom to take a child to church or temple for a blessing and to give thanks to God for their birth.I have the privilege of

It was a cold day but my friend, who is skilled in bushcraft, had brought his portable fire pit with him.We searched for drtwood and sat by the fire, roasting marshmallows and warming our hands. It was a short walk but dramatic rock formations loomed above us, making it feel like a real adventure. The kids climbed them and explored the rocky beach, where once there had been an open-air bathing pool.On our , we went through a small tunnel-like arch. I stopped for a moment, suddenly taken by the view. The ruins of Dunbar Castle were beautully framed by the archway. Locals call this archway the keyhole and I reflected that the term is a perfect name.When we look through a keyhole, our vision is narrowly focussed. Such was the effect here. It cast a visual spotlight on what is left of what was once a mighty fortress.The kids trundled on before me, noticing smaller wonders: a frozen worm on the path, a sea shell and interesting-looking stones. But I stood for some moments, taking in the view beyond and thinking of what stories those old stones of the castle could tell.Many people pass this way every day, both locals and visitors. Itrsquos a section of the John Muir Way. I have often been with my family to Dunbar Leisure Pool and the harbour and town. But somehow I had missed this short but spectacular nearby walk until this day.Dunbar Castle is now but a fallen-down ruin. Indeed, itrsquos dficult to imagine what it once was. But the weathered sandstone castles on the shoreline built by nature still stand defiant, somehow reminding us of their greater permanence in the face of human transience. But as I stood looking at the ruins, the keyhole focussed my thoughts as well as my vision.History is also viewed through a keyhole, a very narrow one. The lives and events of the castle were lived in most part unrecorded by it. The spotlight of history has illuminated only brief moments, and even then the characters have been only those deemed lsquoimportantrsquo.There are moments where the view through the narrow keyhole of history has included insights to untold stories. The bravery of Black Agnes, as she defied the siege in , is one of those. With her husband away, she was in charge of this important fortress during war with England. She refused to give up the castle, even in the face of bombardment and attempts to starve her small garrison into submission. Her mocking of her besiegers by dusting down the battlements with her maids after a bombardment is an image seared in legend.But itrsquos a chink of light on a huge untold story we are led to believe by historyrsquos silence that women were insignicant players in events. For sure they were oppressed and put down by a system that centred on male power, but they are half of humanity and at least half the story.As the actions of Black Agnes reveal, even with such constraints put on them, women were there, part of events and often refusing to accept their assigned role.The le of Mary Queen of Scots has always been for me an example of this. Yes, she was privileged and powerful by birth, but because of this history took notice of her.Despite all the political and religious challenges she faced, it was her womanhood which men deemed her main failing. And so she was judged by dferent standards. Had she behaved with the morals of her father she would not have lasted five minutes in power. But no one raised an eyebrow because he was a man.But more than this, even though Mary was the monarch, her royal authority was deemed diluted and even less legitimate merely because she was a woman.So she understood she needed to find a husband to bring her royal authority to full strength in a country full of powerful and bullying misogynist men.She chose the dashing young Darnley, and the fact that he turned out to be dross was not, in my opinion, Maryrsquos fault. How easy it is to blame a woman for a manrsquos failings. She was taken in by him it was he who was the failure, not her.Thatrsquos what Irsquove always maintained, despite the protestations of my tutors at university. And her third husband Bothwell, well he was a disappointment as well.It is the stones of Dunbar,they could speak, who could tell us of the truth of his forced union with Mary. She had been taken there by him in April . The circumstances of this still remain debated. Was she abducted by him as later claimed, or did she go willingly It was also claimed she was raped and forced to marry Bothwell soon afterwards to save her honour . This idea has been disputed by some because Mary is said to have miscarried with twins while imprisoned at Lochleven Castle some months after, suggesting a relationship with Bothwell even before Darnleyrsquos murder. So a woman cannot be abused by a man she has had a relationship with  Really If they could talk, the stones of Dunbar would whisper the truths of those events in , and the despair and desperation of a strong and clever woman whose destiny was stolen mainly because of her sex.These were my thoughts as I stood looking through the keyhole towards Dunbar Castle. Suddenly, my daughter Manja broke my trance by wiggling the frozen worm in front of me. I smiled and thought to myself that thankfully times have changed since the days when the castle was a fortress.But sometimes, I fear, not as much as we think they have."},{"url":null,"title":"new-fidra-gin-hoping-for-east-lothian-base","story":"Fidra Gin is the brainchild of Emma Bouglet and Jo Brydie and is currently based at Ballencrieff and Aviemore.The duo came together to create the juniper berry-based drink and have already enjoyed immediate success, with the product already available in a number of Edinburgh restaurants.Now they are hoping to make it  per cent based in the county, with plans under way to find suitable premises.Emma said: ldquoWe pick all the botanicals in East Lothian and, at the moment, we use a still in Aviemore.ldquoA friend has lent us his still for the time being so we can get enough momentum behind us and bring the whole operation to East Lothian.ldquoWe have potentially secured a premise in East Lothian.

For although Hunter took to the needle with gusto, it was hardly in the spirit of conformity. Back in what she describes as a ldquofashion-starved s Glasgow, ldquo you couldnt sew your own clothes you looked like your mother and Hunter clearly had no intention of doing that. Instead, shed rustle up a party outfit overnight, sometimes getting her sister to stitch her into the garmentthere wasnt time to sew on fastenings.For Hunter, the needle became a weapon of empowerment rather than subjugation. In  years working as a community textile artist, she has helped marginalised women, striking miners and impoverished communities to express identity, dissent and protest through thread. And as her new book, Threads Of Le, makes clear, people have been quietly subverting this supposedly gentle art for centuries.When we meet in the Glasgow Womens Library surrounded by bold and beautul feminist banners, it becomes plain that for Hunter, pursuing a career in textiles was a rebellious act in itself. ldquoI was really keen to go to the Glasgow dough school [domestic science college], where they did a dressmaking and pattern-cutting course, she recalls. ldquoBut at school, the teachers were appalled that somebody with brains should aspire to the dough school, so they disallowed it.Her parents were, she thinks, ldquoregretful that I couldnt follow my heart but at the same time pleased that I had the brains to get on further in le, as they saw it. After being steered towards academia, Hunter studied English and drama at Glasgow University, where she became heavily involved in student theatre.Her passion for thread would not be quelled, however, and when she later became the first Scot to get onto the directing course at Bristol Old Vic theatre, she found herself making Shakespearean costumes ndash including ruffs. ldquoI was enthralled by that, really interested in finding out how garments were constructed, she says. After a series of theatre roles she graduated towards the community arts scene, which was then gathering momentum as a way of tackling deprivation through creativity.At , she was running a Salisbury arts centre, helping ex-prisoners and people with mental health problems to re-engage through pottery, printing and creative writing. ldquoIt opened my eyes to how a community could work and create together and how all sorts of people in all sorts of walks of le could share not just the same space but the same achievements.When in , the Peoples March For Jobs set off from Liverpool to highlight unemployment, Hunter ndash now working as an arts development officer in Northampton ndash made a banner to welcome the marchers when they came through the town. ldquoIt was the first banner I ever made and a very scrappy affair ndash just a bit of lining fabric with letters glued on, she recalls.Intrigued by the rich history of banners, she suggested making some with local people in Nottinghamshire after shed been invited by the Mansfield Trades Council to encourage community involvement in May Day events. It was : just as the miners strike was erupting and with the Nottinghamshire workforce bitterly ided over the dispute, Hunter found herself working with miners wives support group members. ldquoI ended up driving them at night through back lanes to picket lines so they wouldnt be stopped by police, she says. ldquoWhen I heard the striking Mansfield miners didnt have banners, I started making some for those groups and that led me to an understanding of how fabric and thread could be used, not just as something that women did quietly at home, but as something that could be much bigger and bolder.Later, as a self-employed arts consultant in London, she realised she wanted not just to work with communities, but to belong to one. Standing outside Covent Garden underground station, she had what she calls her ldquoeureka moment. ldquoI decided to count the number of passers-by who werent aged  to . I think in that  minutes I counted four.For Hunter, that statistic confirmed that central London would never provide the kind of multi-generational, community le she yearned for and she made the snap decision to close up her office andto Scotland.After bundling up her belongings, she rushed to Euston Station but it was almost Christmas, the train was jam-packed and Hunter ndash who was carrying several suitcases and a cat ndash realised she wasnt going to get on.ldquoThen suddenly from inside came the shout of ndash In here, in here! It was a crowd of oil rig workers on their way to Aberdeen, who squeezed me and my cat in. Ive never laughed so much as I did on that journey back to Glasgow.Her jubilation was short-lived. Back living with her mother at the age of , she realised shed gone from being ldquoa well-known consultant leading conferences, wearing nice suits, to basically having nothing. But after securing a pound-a-week Enterprise Allowance, she found a damp but affordable west end flat that was big enough to make banners ndash and began pursuing her dream of setting up ldquoa community enterprise that was about creating jobs for people who had real talent and flair but didnt have the educational qualications to get to art school or even dough school.She called it NeedleWorks and from , the organisation grew into a successful operation, employing eight people and engaging erse cultures, age groups and communities in producing banners, wall-hangings and a witty, Glasgow-themed fashion collection.Not everyone got it. Hunter lost count of the times shed be working with a group of women on an intricate piece of community embroidery, only for some male joker to stop at the table and quip: ldquoIve got some trousers that need taking up, or ldquoCan you sew on a button on my jacket Beyond the cynical fringe, however, textile-based arts were enjoying a renaissance. Impressed by a NeedleWorks banner project hed witnessed in Glasgows east end, the citys director of museums, Julian Spalding, asked Hunterto help create a ldquoBayeux tapestry of Glasgow le during its upcoming year as European City of Culture, .Taking up the challenge, Needleworks engaged more than  Glaswegians in a series of workshops held in Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum. The first ever workshop provoked some curious reactions: ldquoWhat time does the jumble sale begin \" asked an elderly couple after spotting a table strewn with bits of cloth. But under the design stewardship of textile artist Malcolm Lochhead, those  peoples efforts were stitched together to create a dozen, ft-high banners, each celebrating an aspect of Clydeside le. Shipyards and tenements, Hampden Park and the Barras, street buskers and pantomime dameshellip all were colourfully rendered in a witty work of collective creativity that was named after an old joke about the citys gallus humour: ldquoCome to Glasgow for a laugh, go away in stitches.Keeping Glasgow In Stitches was universally acclaimed as a triumphbut it was also, Hunter now acknowledges, ldquoa huge project to co-ordinate. In , she collapsed with exhaustion.At the time, NeedleWorks were short-staffed and Hunter was working all hours to complete commissions. During one all-nighter, she phoned her sister and said simply: ldquoI cant do this any more.ldquoMy sister said, Im coming in a taxi, well take everything youre working on back to the workshop and then you are coming home with me. So I went to hers and just slept and slept.After rest, recuperation and contemplation, she decided it was time to voluntarily liquidate NeedleWorks. Another community business agreed to take on two of the staff, some went freelance and Hunter ndash who was about to get married ndash was ready to explore ldquopastures new.Now living in Stirlingshire, she has since gone on to raise a family and spearhead several high-profile community-based textile initiatives. Just last year, for example, she co-ordinated a series of womens banner-making workshops ahead of the June  Edinburgh Processions march, which payed tribute to the Scottish women who fought for the right to vote. The suffragettes themselves, says Hunter, were famous for subverting the domestic craft of needlework to create beautul banners, partly as a rebuke towards those who derided their campaign as ldquounwomanly.Many of their banners ndash like those created in the Processions workshops a century later ndash were works of art. Are we finally beginning to appreciate this long-undervalued discipline ldquoI think we are, says Hunter. ldquoIts interesting that in the age of mass production, the appeal of the homemade has become stronger and stronger. She believes the success of websites like Etsy proves people still value products that express iniduality and identity and that the popularity of knitting and sewing circles like StitchNBitch confirms we still need face-to-face contact, even in the social media age.What about men  As Hunters book makes clear, they too were victims of the  Education Act, which made sewing lessons compulsory for girls but not boys, thus not only channelling female pupils towards domesticity, but robbing their male counterparts of the chance to learn valuable skills.Are things improving  Role models like Glasgow textile artist Malcolm Lochhead and celebrity embroiderer Jamie Chalmersare helping to change attitudes, believes Hunter, but with needlework no longer routinely taught in schools, she thinks both genders are missing out. ldquoChildren ndash and particularly boys ndash love sewing and I think its totally delicious to watch a seven-year-old boy picking up needles and threads for the first time, loving what happens when you push that needle through the cloth and the patterns it makes.Should sewing be reinstated on the curriculum  Hunter herself seems to have been traumatised by her school needlework teacher, who would ldquotut-tut sorrowfully over her failure to master theldquoghastly regulation sewing machines. But she does think ldquocreativity in all its forms should be there at a much higher level ndash be it dance, drama, music, needlework, all these things should be equal to academic subjects.Threads Of Le, which Hunter researched with the help of a Creative Scotland grant, aims to change the way we think about sewing, by demonstrating the crucial role it has played in human culture and history. Its a wonderful book and Hunter is already planning her second, about Mary Queen of Scots and her textiles. That inveterate embroiderer ndash who confounded her jailers by embellishing her clothes with symbols that declared her royal birthright ndash features prominently in Threads Of Le.But, hints the author, there is much more of this story to tell. In Hunters deft hands, it cant help but be enthralling.Threads Of Le: A History Of The World Through The Eye Of A Needle, is published by Sceptre, pound"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9366858.jpg?type=article-full","title":"brexit-shows-there-would-be-negative-impact-if-scotland-left-uk","story":"Professor John McLaren for the Scottish Trends website said: ldquoThe Brexit-related arguments that the break-up of an economic and customs union will result in a negative impact on future economic growth - due to increased tarf and non-tarf barriers - are also valid in the case of Scottish independence from the UK economic union.ldquoHowever, the degree to which this impact might be greater or lesser than for Brexit remains a matter for debate, he explained.Prof McLaren said it was ldquowidely accepted that Scotland would be deprived of a net transfer, in the region of pound billion, from the rest of the UK in the event of independence.This, he argued, was in contrast to the UK leaving the EU, where the impact was likely to be ldquosmall but positive, although this would be negative once longer term, slower growth impacts were considered.Prof McLaren, former UK Treasury economist, who lectures on public policy at Glasgow Universityrsquos Business School, also suggested that the Brexit debate showed thatScotland voted to become independent, then this was likely to lead to a ldquoplethora of options for what independence might actually mean.He explained: ldquoThis ranges from an old-style nation-state to remaining in some form of political and economic union with both the EU and the UK.ldquoA bespoke arrangement with both bodies seems likely to result in the most advantageous - or least detrimental - outcome in economic terms.This, Prof McLaren, argued this might involve an independent Scotland having membership of the European Economic Area similar to Norway or being part of a British economic union, similar in form to the current EU in terms of being an area of shared political sovereignty and economic co-operation amongst its member nation states.ldquoSuch a lsquoBritish Union might allow for the use of sterling, no trade barriers and some degree of continuing fiscal transfer, he suggested.The academic said that while, as with Brexit, the first economic impact of such changes to the political and economic landscape around a second referendum might have little influence on the electorate, the second fiscal impact was more likely to affect, negatively, voting intentions.This, he suggested, in turn might make it more likely that an ldquoalternative form of independence was proposed which helped ameliorate some of these impacts.Prof McLaren said: ldquoThe UK Parliamentrsquos Brexit discussions have provided a useful insight into how the next Scottish referendum may pan out.ldquoThe range of possible Brexit outcomes highlights how independence is not an agreed, single, end-point but will inevitably involve a prolonged process of negotiations with both the EU and the UK.ldquoThis leads to a much more complicated landscape for future arrangements than was perceived at the time of the first independence referendum.He added: ldquoThe acknowledged loss of a net transfer of public funds from the UK to Scotland may also lead to greater latitude with respect to what any future political and economic relationships may look like.\"Willie Rennie, the leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, said: ldquoThis report should make clear to the Nationalists that independence would only worsen the economic chaos of Brexit.ldquoStraight away, independence would mean almost poundbn per year less for public services.

Kaelen is very much a part of our family and she always will be.It emerged in  that the ashes of at least  babies cremated at Mortonhall Crematorium had been buried in secret.The policy had continued for more than four decades, during which time hundreds of grieving parents ndash many of whom had sought their babiesrsquo ashes for comfort or perhaps to create their own personal memorial ndash were systematically told by staff and funeral directors that none were available after cremation.The babyrsquos ashes were instead buried at secret locations in the crematorium grounds. The baby elephant is the cityrsquos second memorial to the Mortonhall babies.

And elephants never forget.The Edinburgh sculpture, dubbed Lulla-Bye and cast at the cityrsquos Powderhall Bronze, is part of a council action plan in response to  recommendations made by former Lord Advocate Dame Elish Angiolini, who led the Edinburgh inquiry into the scandal. The discovery of the Mortonhall scandal led to a string of similar practices being uncovered in other locations, including Glasgow and Aberdeen. A nationwide investigation was later carried out by the Infant Cremation Commissionndash chaired by Lord Bonomy on behalf of the Scottish Government.It led to the passing in  of The Burial and Cremation Scotland Bill, which sets out a legal definition of ashes and requires authorities to keep details of burials and cremations indefinitely.

In the coming week officials and ministers will continue the big schmooze by having more tea and talks with those nice Labour MPs and trade union chiefs on issues like workersrsquo rights.If, by some miracle, the Prime Minister persuades the EU to perform a screeching U-turn and agree a change on the backstop, then when she s home victorious, it could be she will still have to rely on some or all of those  Labour rebels, who defied Jeremy Corbyn this week, to squeeze Plan B through the Commons probably after writing out promissory cheques for several Leave constituencies.Yet as the Brexit clock ticks down, it is becoming increasingly clear it is less likely Britain will leave on March . Why so  A number of reasons.The talk of using a technological solution to the backstop riddle was itself rubbished by Mrs May only a few months ago. No one sincerely believes it will happen any time soon.At Westminster, some  of the  Statutory Instruments required for Brexit still have to be passed and there are less than eight weeks to go.No  blithely insisted it was always envisaged the parliamentary process would be accelerated as exit day approached but, in Star Trek parlance, this would need Warp Factor  to get everything through on time. Scrapping the February recess seems a desperately late move and may ultimately have little effect.The fact each day a Cabinet minister raises the prospect of putting back March  -only for a few weeks to allow legislation to be passed in the event of a new deal being agreed - appears to be a softening-up exercise for when it happens but for a much longer period.From all the noises on the continent - Juncker, Tusk, Varadkar, Merkel, Macron, etc - it seems hard to disagree with the SNP leader Ian Blackford that Mrs May has a ldquocat in hellrsquos chance of getting the backstop scrapped.All the EU chiefs have to do is sit on their hands and wait for the Valentinersquos Day vote in the Commons, knowing an amendment to extend Article  will be tabled and pushed through with the help of Cabinet ministers, who, by then, may be ex-Cabinet ministers.The soundbite that jumped out this week was when Andrea Leadsom, the Commons Leader, proudly declared: ldquoWe are under pressure but it is all very much under control and we do expect to achieve what we need to do by March .Self-deception is a long-standing Westminster affliction."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-embarks-on-five-day-tour-of-usa-and-canada","story":"The First Minister will embark on whistle-stop tour of Washington DC, New York, New Jersey, Ottawa and Toronto over five days.It comes as new figures show the US remains Scotlandrsquos top export destination, with an estimated pound. billion of exports in  ndash up by . per cent from the previous year.However, Ms Sturgeonrsquos visit also means she will avoid being quizzed on the revised Scottish Budget at First Ministerrsquos Questions on Thursday.MSPs will now not be given the chance to question her until February , after the Scottish Parliamentrsquos recess.Ms Sturgeon said: ldquoScotland has a longstanding relationship with North America across family, friendship, culture and business.ldquoThe latest figures released just this week show how important our trade relationship with North America is for our economy.ldquoThis visit will build on the existing links between our countries and provide new opportunities for us to work together and learn from each otherrsquos expertise in areas including climate change, renewables and gender equality.ldquoWith the shadow of Brexit hanging over our economy, it is more important now than ever to reassure businesses that Scotland is an open and welcoming country and an attractive place to invest in, visit and live.Her engagements include an address at Georgetown University to discuss Brexit, and the launch of the Scotland is Now campaign in Canada.But officials said there are no plans to meet President Donald Trump, who is scheduled to give the State of the Union address on Tuesday.Further potential political meetings are still being finalised.Ms Sturgeon last visited the US in , when she gave a speech at Stanford University and met Governor of Calornia Jerry Brown to discuss climate change.Her trip to Canada, which continues to be a top  export destination for Scotland, will be the first visit by a First Minister in more than ten years."},{"url":null,"title":"no-10-tells-brussels-completely-unacceptable-to-describe-gibraltar-as-a-uk-colony","story":"The language was used in a European Council document setting out plans for visa-free travel for Britons after Brexit, which noted the \"controversy between Spain and the UK\" over the sovereignty of the Rock.

But all the Unionist ones failed to engage seriously, asking the SNP for the eye-wateringly expensive, or the eye-rollingly stupid, like abandoning independence.Labour, who run or help run  of our  local authorities, got their councillors nothing. The Tories, who run seven authorities, got their councillors nothing. And the LibDems, who run six authorities, got - you guessed it - nothing.The handful of Green councillors elected two years ago got something very dferent. Irsquom not saying everyone was happy - the party seems obliged to disagree with itself - but they would at least have seen their six MSPs in the thick of it.It was not an easy process. During the final to-ing and fro-ing over numbers and commitments, many Green MSPs seemed genuinely pained, and not just by Ross Greerrsquos bon mots on Winston Churchill.Besides the fear of letting their side down by settling too cheaply, there was the weight of being the only non-government party still involved. The others had simply quit the field. The Greens felt thatthey didnrsquot strike a deal, there could be chaos. How would the government react  Would there be an election on top of Brexit  Who would that help There was a lot of resentment towards the other parties. Instead of feeling duty-bound to participate, there was tribal intransigence.As Green co-convener Patrick Harvie said on Thursday, the other parties seemed to have drawn precisely the wrong lesson from the Brexit dys at Westminster and thought, Letrsquos have some of that.ldquoI can respect anyone who busts a gut to achieve a change, is unable to, and then votes against the budget - but not even to try  he said.ldquoOthers seem to think that engineering a crisis would be the best outcomehellip chaos for the sake of chaos is not what Scotland needs. Itrsquos a very good point.Of course, the other parties were not entirely indferent. Away from Holyrood, their councillors were trying to influence Mr Mackay through the council group Cosla, which backed the Green demands for more money and more powers. It was noteworthy that in Coslarsquos response to the budget, both President Allison Evisonand resources spokesperson Gail Macgregorthanked the Greens.But at Holyrood, MSPs were cynical and complacent, preferring to posture rather than deliver. Mr Harviersquos arguments failed to move them, so how about self-interest If you want to be the government, you have to look the part. Slacking off and bitching from the back of the class do not look the part.Like Mr Harvie says, Labour and the Tories donrsquot have to vote for an SNP budget at the end of the day, but at least engage. See it as training. Work that intellectual muscle. You canrsquot go into the  election looking like lightweights and hope the SNP will conveniently lose.The Tories seem to get it. They had no alternative budget, but there was less knockabout than usual from Murdo Fraser. He was also sharp on the numbers. Like Finance Committee convener Bruce Crawford, he highlighted a scary, technical issue over income tax that could start to bite in  .Labour were an embarrassment. With the leadership doing next to nothing, it emerged frontbencher Alex Rowley had sent his personal budget plan to Mr Mackay. When the freelancing operation was discovered, Labour HQ hauled him in, shut him up, and refused to let him speak in Thursdayrsquos debate.Instead that honour went to James Kelly, whose performance, God willing, is unlikely to be surpassed for the rest of the year.It wasnrsquot just the atrocious delivery , it was the atrocious content. He railed against councils cuts, but would not say how to avoid them. He was then stumped when asked what Labour had got out of the last three budgets.He does not look like a future finance secretary, nor help Labour look like a government in waiting.ldquoWe should just send a clip of him round all the business leaders, one senior SNP source said later, half-joking that would neutralise the Labour threat at the next election.The current budget approach isnrsquot helping the SNPrsquos rivals. Itrsquos a bad habit. If they donrsquot break it,they donrsquot take more responsibility and show more intellectual heft, they shouldnrsquot expect the respect of voters. MSPs ing empty-handed to council colleagues canrsquot help party management either.There will soon be cross-party talks on replacing council tax and reforming local government finance. The people who pay their salaries deserve more from MSPs than lazy partisanship in that exercise.Holyroodrsquos new powers are also creating new risks to the budget, like that income tax worry I mentioned. A thoughtful, collective approach to them is needed. MSPs should step up.

described as \"shameful\" by the leader of the countrys largest teaching union, come only a fortnight after the Scottish Parliaments education committee declared that instrument tuition should remain free.Ms Benedetti, a passionate advocate of music education, said funding for music tuition at councils should be ring-fenced.Larry Flanagan, the general secretary of the EIS, attacked the planned cuts, which come as other councils are planning to raise fees and cut tutors.He said: \"Midlothian Councilrsquos decision to axe instrumental music tuition in its schools is a ridiculously short-sighted decision.\"This penny-pinching move will rob young people in Midlothian of an invaluable opportunity to develop their musical abilities, and deny them the many added benefits that instrumental instruction can offer.\"Learning music benefits young people in terms of their self-confidence, and in their ability to work both independently or as part of a larger group.\"It is a

Alsoa Scottish government were to tax oil companies at the Norwegian level or the UK  level it would produce pound billion a year in revenues.GERS is a testament to Westminsters lack of investment outside the London bubble and there is no reason why Scotland cant emulate the success of Denmark and other small northern European countries, many of whom have far fewer natural resources.What is undeniable is that as part of the UK, Scotland is currently under-performing, and there is little reason to doubt that this will continue to be the case unless change is made. No less an authority than former Treasury Minister Lord Jim OrsquoNeill described Britainrsquos woeful performance on income per head, productivity and regional inequality as ldquobog standard stats that should surprise no one.Fraser Grant,Warrender Park Road, Edinburgh.ALEX Gallagher contends that the Sustainable Growth Commissionldquoconfirms, the [pound billion] gap [identied by GERS] exists. It doesnrsquot. Rather it suggests thatother than UK Government accounting conventions are used, for instance UN or Eurostat national accounts conventions, the GERS outcome would be dferent. Moreover, the ldquolack of discrete data on Scotland ndash for instance  of the  revenue headings are estimates ndash leads to the conclusion that the ldquoGERS analysis can only be an estimate of Scotlandrsquos position that reflects the current constitutional situation. Those three words again, but vital to understanding how GERS can be used.However, given his reference to this report, I am astonished he goes on to assert it ldquoconfirms the pound billion gap ... ldquowill continue to existwe break up the UK, when its  pages concern how an independent Scotland might ldquomove away from the unsustainable levels of deficit and debt created by UK management toward a sustainable position.Moreover, it does not argue it would take  years to replace the ldquoUnion idend, but that it would take between five and  years to put our finances on a ldquosustainable footing, as ldquocontinuing on the current UK model is unlikely to produce better outcomes than those seen at present.The key, as the report sets out, is expanding the Scottish economy so that spending in the public sector becomes, relative to a larger productive sector, a smaller proportion. However, Westminster policy has been inappropriate, as Scotland, as Margaret Cuthbert has argued, has been ldquodenied the specic, local policies it needs.With independence this need no longer be true. Scotland could develop and implement more appropriate economic policies, applying the high level of skills of a well-educated population, using our other assets such as world-class universities, an outstanding reputation for premium food and drink products, tourism based on the natural beauty of our country. Scotland is also a world leader in computer games technology, photonics and le sciences. Then there is energy, and not just oil but also the potential of renewables. Beyond economics, per cent of welfare decisions were no longer taken at Westminster, we could systematically address the scourge of poverty and disadvantage, which have grown under the last two Westminster governments.Lastly, Councillor Gallagher challenged me to set out a positive case for independence. Perhaps he would like to consider doing likewise for Scotland remaining in the UK post-Brexit, a policy he himself described as ldquostupidity on stilts, managed by a ldquomalevolent Tory government, opposed by a Labour Party which ldquohas failed to deliver clear leadership on the way forward for the UK.Alasdair Galloway, Silverton Avenue, Dumbarton.I AM not often driven to write about economics and politics as I find that facts do not often change peoples opinions, eventheir opinions are based on hoods, but the letter from Councillor Alex Gallagherdeserves some response, especially when he refers to others \"mistakes and misunderstandings\".I will not go into the fact that GERS is only a crude estimate of Scotlands economic performance as an economic region of the UK, under UK tax and spend policies and therefore is irrelevant to how its performance would beindependent. Nor will I go into comparing the last two released figures, whereyou work out what Westminster is charging for the retained matters, one cannot help but smell a giant rat.

even though the band appearedconflicted about whether to follow them down that Britpop route.There is no doubting the popularity of the hits, especially the crowd-pleasing Into The Blue, amongst the faithfuland the front man clearly revels in the reaction.But the band always stood out when indulging their more reflective side and the shimmering Natures Whore and the dreamy Further from their debut album only serve to make you further wonder what might have been.Guitarist Steven Dora is, perhaps, the unsung hero of the band, amore understated Bernard Butleryou will, and while he may have had some trouble with his effects pedals at one point, he otherwise glides his way through their complex mosaic of a set.While they only have two albums of material to call on for their twelve songs there is one notable omission, theperversely uplting downer, Worry Beads.Therein lies the story of one of Scotlands most underrated bands who, perhaps, never really themselves fully appreciated just what made them so special.East Kilbride-raised Montgomery says it was through social media, and the love shown through that medium that convinced the band that they would reunite.\"I kept in touch with some of the guys on and off, and there was the possibility of doing something and you just end up going,why not  After years and years, you go I cant do that because it would be getting on a bandwagon, or something like that.\"But it is the power of social media.

In addition, D photogrammetry is taking place so that digital D models of the wreck can be produced. By using these techniques, in essence, the team is able to digitally bring HMS Royal Oak to the surface.Survey organiser and licence-holder Emily Turton said: “The wreck of HMS Royal Oak is the final resting place of  men and boys. As the most intact underwater dreadnought-era battleship, she has an architectural grandeur befitting of any national memorial. However, at the smaller end of the scale, artefacts pertaining to everyday le on board are scattered around the site, bringing home the human story of those lost. The site is peaceful, yet vibrant, and supports a thriving marine eco-system. It is both an honour and a privilege to get to know the site.”Full details and further pictures in The Orcadian this week.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The Labour position is still unclear to many and Labour MPs have decided to do what the Fleetwood Mac song says: “You can go your own way.”Although the Labour leadership eventually supported the key Yvette Cooper amendment to delay Brexit, it was very late in the day and that sent a signal that it was a soft whip.

It’s all still a shambles, they say, which is an absolutely fair point. The Labour plan seems to be don’t block Brexit, let the Tories own the chaos, chillax until the General Election then romp home to victory. Simples!Well, not quite. Many Labour strategists seem to have forgotten that Labour cannot win a majority without winning seats in Scotland. The obsession with Labour votes in the North of England has meant that the rather large, cold place north of that has been somewhat forgotten.A large majority of people in Scotland voted to remain. Many hate austerity and want more radical, socialist economic policies but also think staying in the EU is the best option – angry Corbynistas take note, it is possible to hold those two positions and not be a traitor.Many Labour activists in Scotland have their head in their hands. They are desperately worried that Labour may end up doing a deal with Mrs May, be seen to be colluding with the Tories and being on the wrong side of the Scottish people. And Brexit is coming up the doorstep.: Brexit: Barclays given green light to transfer £bn to IrelandOne activist told me that it’s not the first thing people mention but when they get onto it, they cannot believe what is playing out in London and are following it closely. There is anger on all sides. It has confirmed the belief that the Tories don’t care about Scotland, but there is resentment and confusion about Labour’s position, especially on why it won’t support another referendum.There is, of course, one political winner in Scotland as a result of the mess in Westminster. One Labour voter summed it up: “There’s no leadership in Westminster – but at least Nicola Sturgeon is showing some.” Now this person was notan SNP or independence supporter but they were a strong remainer.Brexit could transcend party allegiances in Scotland. A two-horse race in England may well benefit Labour but in Scotland, they could find themselves once again painfully squeezed between a remain-supporting SNP and a leave-supporting Tory party.

Publicly, the government has stated that it is focused on getting its spending plans passed and is confident of reaching a compromise.In , when an SNP minority government had its budget defeated by the Scottish Parliament, then-First Minister Alex Salmond threatened a snap election before the deadlock was broken.The current SNP minority has struck a more conciliatory tone and sought to calm speculation about an election, with Finance Secretary Derek Mackay last night appealing for MSPs to “act responsibly”.Last ditch talks are set to continue today in the final hours before a vote, with the Green Party holding out for concessions on local government spending and council tax reform.Mr Mackay must secure the support of the six Green MSPs to pass his budget, with all other opposition parties committed to voting against it.Green Party co-convener Patrick Harvie has dismissed suggestions his party could bring down the government by rejecting the SNP’s budget as a “myth”.But senior Nationalist figures were openly speculating about the possibility of an election earlier in the week, with SNP committee convener Gillian Martin warning Green MSP Andy Wightman on social media that voting down the budget could force an election and put a second Scottish independence referendum at risk.“You’ve seen the way the other parties coalesce against us to try and bring down the government,” Ms Martin posted on Twitter. “Since  everything for them is about defeating the pro-Indy Parliament.”She added: “We are at risk of an election that might see pro Indy parties lose seats and put us in a weaker position.”Polls show the SNP remains in the lead in Scottish Parliament voting intention, but that the nationalists have lost ground compared with their performance in the  Holyrood election where they narrowly lost their majority.Scottish Conservative shadow finance secretary Murdo Fraser claimed uncertainty around the budget showed the SNP were “unfit” for government.“The SNP has neglected the day job so badly that it’s now struggling to get the single-biggest responsibility taken care of. Nicola Sturgeon is so resigned to the weakness of her own administration, she’s been forced to rally the troops for another election.“Hers would be the first government in the history of the Scottish Parliament to call an election because it couldn’t pass a budget.“That would be a shameful legacy, and shows just how unfit the Nationalists are for government of any kind.”Scottish Liberal Democrat campaign chair Alex Cole-Hamilton MSP said: “We’ve made clear to the SNP that we want a budget that focuses on education, mental health and local government funding.“If their inability to get a budget through necessitates a new Scottish Parliament election then I have every hope that people in Scotland will want to use that to eject the Nationalists.”A Labour spokesman said “no credible anti-austerity party would propose” the draft budget put forward by the SNP.With no deal last night, Mr Mackay said: “Our spending plans for the coming year contain additional money for schools and hospitals, protecting vital public services and investing in our economy, while also providing stability amid the ongoing uncertainty caused by Brexit. “With that backdrop in mind, there has never been more need for MSPs, of all parties, to act responsibly and not add to that uncertainty.”Mr Mackay added: “We are open to compromise in order to ensure we deliver the Budget that the country expects.” ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4865477.1549052636!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon to visit north america on trade visit","story":"Nicola Sturgeon will visit North America next week in a bid to strengthen trade and cultural links between Scotland and the US and Canada.The visit by the First Minister was announced today as new figures revealed the US remains Scotland’s top export destination country, with an estimated £. billion of exports in  – up by . per cent from the previous year.Canada continues to be a top  export destination worth £ million in .

If anything, it should be amplied.It turned into a trilogy. There was a Great Book of Skye Two in , and now we have the #Great Book of Skye Three#.That was perhaps predictable. In the first volume, Cailean Maclean commented that he had two problems in persuading Norman Macdonald to prepare the book. The first problem was to get him to start the second was to get him to stop.Three books and , pages later, the prof has stopped — or so he says.The three volumes comprise a Dictionary of Skye Biography. The lives of almost , people are profiled and illustrated inside their pages. They have all #been Skye born or bred or are people who have had an intimate connection with the island. They have all been noteworthy in one way or another… #There has never been more than , people living in Skye at any one time, and for much of history — particularly recent, recorded history — its population has been much smaller than that.Nobody, however, will be too surprised that Norman and Cailean uncovered and portrayed over a thousand eminent Sgiathanaich. Without wishing to kickstart Norman once again, the miracle is that they enumerated so few. The island, like almost all Hebridean islands, has been a breeding ground of talent and character.The only other qualication for entry in the Great Books of Skye is that you must be dead. You, dear reader, however, accomplished you might be, will not be able to read your entry unless metaphysics permits you access from your celestial cloud. These are obituaries, not panegyrics.That lends a sombre tone to certain pages of the Great Book of Skye Three. There are people featured here who, we are sharply reminded, were alive when volume one was in preparation.Here, for instance, is the smiling face of Dr Vicky Ann Galbraith, who was born in Portree in  and who died at home in Aird Bernisdale of brain cancer in .Vicky Ann was achievement personied. A leading scientist for Roche Pharmaceuticals, she also played for Scotland#s national women#s rugby union team on  occasions. Following her fatal diagnosis, she raised thousands of pounds for cancer research by leading sponsored walks from Portree to Glasgow, up the West Highland Way and where.Here is Thomas William Mackenzie. You may have known him as Tommy. He was born in  and he died last March. He was, in the GBS abbreviated subheading, a #printmaker, etcher and gallery owner, Chieftain of Skye Highland Games, boat race devotee, tug-of-war revivalist, shinty enthusiast, and half-marathon runner.#That just about covers it, as a dictionary of biography is forbidden to indulge itself and cannot add that for very many people, Tommy Mackenzie was the face and personality of modern Portree.These volumes, these hefty Great Books of Skye, are a leisurely parade along Wentworth Street and then out to the peninsulas, pausing to wave at or pass the time of day with Victorian land reformers, clan chiefs, bards, teachers, surgeons, fishermen, and climbers. It#s a verbal Skye equivalent of the cover of #Sergeant Pepper#s Lonely Hearts Club Band#.Sir Harold Boulton was not a Sgiathanach. He came from Hertfordshire and was educated at Harrow and Oxford.In  he married into the Highland quality via a Dingwall military family. Boulton already had an interest in Gaelic song and music.He enters the Great Book of Skye because, in the late th century, Boulton seems to have heard a Gaelic rowing song and put his own, English, words to the tune.Those lyrics and that tune have become internationally known as #The Skye Boat Song#. Norman Macdonald digresses wonderfully on Boulton#s creation of a supposed Jacobite anthem.We are still left with the dilemma of the bonnie boat#s journey. The original Gaelic version may have celebrated a voyage from Torrin to Loch Coruisk. For most of the th century, it was assumed to refer to Charles Edward Stuart#s post-Culloden flight by sea from the mainland to Skye.As Charles never made such a journey directly by sea, pedants have more recently suggested that Boulton must have been referring to the Pretender#s actual sea voyage It really, really, does not matter. We are in the realms of mythology. Charles may as well have been sailing from Papua New Guinea. Harold Boulton invented the whole damn thing — the misty isle#s most famous song is a Victorian concoction — and in recognition of that, he deserves his entry in the Great Book of Skye Three.And finally, here we are back in Portree. William Cowie was born in Kiltarlity in  and became an agricultural advisor in Skye in the s. The brother of a professional footballer, Cowie devoted himself to shinty and became one of the greatest players of his era.Fittingly, he married in  a grand-daughter of the captain of the Skye shinty team which had won the inaugural MacTavish Cup in .William and Margaret Cowie had two sons, Ross and William. He died too young, at the age of  years, while playing badminton in Portree Drill Hall.William Cowie would, therefore, have been shy of his th birthday had he led his natural course to June  and a day in Fort William which would have caused him, more even than the rest of Skye, unimaginable pride.It is tempting to say of all three Great Books of Skye that they are for dipping in and out rather than reading as a single narrative. The trouble with that suggestion is that once you#ve dipped in, it is very hard to dip out again.As a trilogy, they are a phenomenal publishing achievement. They should take their place, alongside the inevitable Tommy Mackenzie print, in every home in Skye."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/INDOOR-SHINTY-19-P4-7-FINAL-2.jpg","title":"skye schools indoor shinty competition all the action in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineYoung shinty players fromthroughout Skye gathered to take part in two indoor tournaments for primary school teams last weekend.Portree High’s Fingal Centre hosted competitions for P-P and for P-and-under teams.On a fast and furious day of excellent shinty action teams fromBun-sgoil Ghàidhlig Phort Rìgh won both competitions.Broadford were runners up in the P- competition, with North West taking second spot in the P-under tournament following an epic final."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/visitor-web.jpg","title":"skye charities work to be showcased at skeabost","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA multi-charity event will be held in Skeabost on Saturdayto highlight the work of several good causes across Skye.The event will be held at Skeabost Memorial Hall from  am until  pm and will provide information on the work carried out by a iety of charities in the area, as well as insight into the costs and challenges they face.to raise awareness of the event, which will support Skye and Lochalsh Young Carers the Skye and Lochalsh Foodbank Crossroads Care # Skye and Lochalsh Macmillan Cancer Support Skye Dance Bloodwise, and Rotjanas Hands, which Mr Williams set up with his we nearly  years ago.He said: “I have been an independent fundraiser for many years – I am a trustee of Rotjanas Hands – formally known as Hands Across the Water – which I set up alongside my we following the Indonesian Tsunami .”He added: “For me, it has always been important to share particularly when we are so fortunate and others not so.

Thursday March  will see the Rovers will be performing at The Braid and they will be guests of honour at a reception where the Mid  East Antrim will welcome them home.AIR AMBULANCEAll proceeds from tickets will be donated by The Irish Rovers to the Mayors Charity Northern Ireland Air Ambulance.Another great honour for the band this year was being recognized as one of these islands greatest eacutemigreacutes by Ireland’s newest and most state of the art museum in Dublin, EPIC Ireland. Museum Director Mervyn Greene says: “The Irish Rovers are iconic, world class and with very a long career. “That’s important to us in Ireland. “They’ve truly taken Ireland with them and shown the world.As it happens, The Unicorn album is part of EPIC’s Irish Rovers installation. As young immigrants, the Rovers emigrated to Canada and became so much a part of the Canadian culture that Canada’s Prime Minister Trudeau personally asked them to become full citizens so they could officially represent Canada around the world.In , The Irish Rovers had a breakout hit with their second album, The Unicorn.That album and the ‘lucky little ditty’ of a title track written by Shel Silverstein, took them from folk clubs of America to concert halls and television sets worldwide.LAST MINUTE“The Unicorn, which was in fact a last minute add to the original album, left us all with a tear or two, plus the unanswered question, ‘Whatever happened to the Unicorns when the ark left them stranded on the shore ” says George. Since that first big hit, the band ed to the charts  more times with other songs, nevertheless, the magic of ‘The Unicorn’ remains.To pay appropriate tribute on its Gold Anniversary, the Rovers are releasing ‘The Unicorn, The Continuing Story’.It includes all new recordings, plus the sequel to the original song, which answers the question of the last fty years.A new music video also tells the story.The World Wildle Fund, and wildle cinematographer Adam Ravetch assisted in the production. Since the s, the Celtic super-group have travelled the world as musical ambassadors - with performances from as far apart as the Arctic Circle, Japan, and Germany, with regular tours to Australia, New Zealand, and the US.The Rovers first became known in the US in the s on shows like The Tonight Show, The Smothers Brothers, Mike Douglas Show, The Dating Game , and even starring in The Virginian.In the s they hosted their first of three international television series, ‘The Irish Rovers Show’ and throughout the next  years their weekly television shows brought Ireland into living rooms of America and the rest of the world.More recently, their  Drunken Sailor album went viral on YouTube, made news headlines back home in Belfast and put them back on radio across North America with a new younger generation audience.A Canadian CBC producer saw the Belfast news articles about the Rovers new song and video and asked George Millar to sing his new song ‘The Titanic’ to help their telling of the th Anniversary of Titanic. The   Years triple CD broke tour sales records, while the lads ed to the small screen with three North American television specials, ‘The Irish Rovers Home In Ireland’, ‘The Irish Rovers Christmas’, ‘The Irish Rovers LIVE on St. Patrick’s Day  th Anniversary Special’, all produced in the last few years.The days of the long tours are finally coming to an end for these Irish lads as they are now completing one last world tour.

Before his Patriots took the field to play the Chargers in the AFC Quarter finals two weeks ago, hetold his players this would be his last home game.His team came out fired up, and played a perfect first half of football and the game was never in doubt.Last week, he was non-committal on his future again, and heading to Kansas City to play the favoured Chiefs, his teammates came out fired up.His buddy and favourite target Julian Edelman printed up t-shirts that said #Bet Against Us# and no doubt, which had his team feeling like they were true underdogs, and they were finished # the dynasty over.If you bet against Tom Brady # you lose. You usually lose. However, Brady was asked yesterday what was the chance that Sundays final would be his last game. #Zero.#He should have led us and everyone to believe that he would retire after the Superbowl, Surely at  years old, he can#t go on anymore. Chiefs, Steelers, Ravens and basically fans of the other  teams would be happy to see him retire, and stop hogging all the rings.Why retire, when you can basically take the regular season off, play the terrible teams in your own ision twice a year, make sure the referees don#t let anyone knock you down, and play two playoff games before taking the stage in another Super Bowl  He says he wants to play  more years. His playoff stats are ridiculous. Nine Super Bowl appearances.  AFC Championship games.  straight ision titles.I suppose I should mention the other team playing in the Superbowl # the LA Rams. Yes they spent big money to get here, yes they have Aaron Donald, and wonder-coach Sean McVay. And even though I was born in Los Angeles, I have a hard time taking this team serious. They looked finished in the beginning of the Saints game, only to find their composure, and with the help of the referees, they won in New Orleans.

Squinter’s been running his eye over the top-performing personalities as we hurtle towards the ration book, conscription, petrol riots and raffling oranges. Jacob Rees Mogg’s rocky road to DublinArch remainer Lord Snooty has made a fortune from providing financial services through his company, Somerset Capital Management . Thoughhe will be luxuriously insulated from the worst effects of a no-deal Brexit evenhe never worked another day in his le, he is a leading light in the fanatically anti-EU European Research Group , which makes UKIP look like the Alliance Party and which sees a Brexit crash-out as pretty much an ideal scenario. But as the Brexit negotiations descended into chaos and then high comedy, SMG decided that it was time to open two new funds in, ah, Ireland. Although Jacob is a co-founder of the company and is paid £, a month for doing eight hours work a week for the company , he said the decision to set up business in Irelandwas nothing to do with him. Asthat’s not bad enough, the company’s prospectus for the coming financial identies among the key ‘risks’ facing the business in the coming financial year is ‘Brexit’. Simply spfing, old bean.Boris and his zig-zag BrexitBack in  when Boris Johnson was still considering what outcome in the Brexit referendum would be best for him – sorry, for the country – his close pal Sir Nicholas Soamestweeted this: “Whatever my great friend Boris decides to do I know that he is NOT an outer.” But regardless of where his heart and or his head is, Boris is certainly shoulder-to-shoulder with Jacob in the vanguard of the hard Brexit storm troops. ’Twas not always thus, truth to tell. Pre-referendum Boris famously came out for Brexit in his Dailycolumn. But what people didn’t know until some time later was that Boris had written two columns that week for the : one pro-Brexit and one pro-Remain. In the pro-Remain column, which was never published in the paper, he wrote: “Shut your eyes. Hold your breath. Think of Britain. Think of the rest of the EU. Think of the future. Think of the desire of your children and your grandchildren to live and work in other European countries to sell things there, to make friends and perhaps to find partners there.” Cue soaring violins. Boris’s most recent comment on the single market was that it is “useless” In  he said in Paris: “Personally, I would like to stay in the single market. We need to stay in the council of ministers of the internal market. In my view, the British have done good things for Europe.” Google Boris’s stunned reaction when the referendum vote was announced and then remember what Nick Soames tweeted.Nigel glad to be rid of the EU Former UKIP leader and Brexit poster boy Nigel Farage has two children by his German we, Kirsten Mehr. He has told journalists that both of them support England at the football, so that’s alright then. Except they both have German passports and so, thrillingly, unlike their English neighbours, will continue to enjoy free movement throughout the EU post-Brexit. And, of course, Nigel will continue to draw his £, per year EU pension – no-one hates the EU that much, not even our Nige. Squinter was particularly moved by Nigel’s claim in the weeks leading up to the referendum that staying in Europe would “spell the end of the steel industry in this country”. But Nige and his UKIP colleagues were in  among a tiny number of MEPs to vote against a move to tighten up rules on the import of cheap non-EU steel. Business, as they say, is business. The Man from the Daily MailFormer Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre was the man responsible for all those headlines that frightened the horses during the referendum campaign and, subsequently, the attacks on Parliament and the judiciary as the political and legal implications were fought out. So he’s the Brexiter’s Brexiter. But it’s estimated that as a landowner Dacre benefited to the tune of around £, a year in EU subsidies. The veteran journalist was on over £m a year towards the end of his time with the Mail, so he’ll not be begging outside the Red Lion in his local villagethe UK leaves the EU. Brexit-voting and Mail-reading Farmer Browns, however, may be left sucking thoughtfully on a wheat stalk as they contemplate their own looming subsidy deficit, which may not be so lightly borne.Bordering on the ridiculousThe DUP’s singular focus as we hurtle towards Brexit D-Day is to block any deal that involves regulatory ergence with the mother ship – in other words: we must be treated exactly the same as Britain by the EU. Whether that’s a gentle wave goodbye with best wishes, or a massive, eye-watering boot in the ging-gangs matters not. We’re all in this together . The DUP’s insistence on alignment with the ‘mainland’ may be extremely touching, but it is an entirely new concept, for this little corner of empire long ago gave up any pretence of a claim to be as British as Finchley. Presumably, the party will continue to lobby for a dferent VAT and Passenger Duty regime post-Brexit, for they were white-hot on those ideas before the EU balloon went up. They’ll continue to block defamation law reform, keeping loyal Ulster as a magnet for libel tourists . Most famously, the DUP remains the bulwark against the equal marriage and abortion rights that are accorded to every other part of these two islands. Luckily, the party stood firm and insisted that Are Wee Country has to have exactly the same RHI regime as across the water, avoiding the possibility of widespread and catastrophically expensive abuse of the boiler scheme*Sub-editors: please check this last line for accuracy. Thanks, SquintPapers, pleaseAndrew Bridgen, Tory MP for West Leicestershireis another European Research Group charmer, without the profile of Jacob Rees Mogg but with the same level of warmth and likeability. Andy’s most notable brush with fame before Brexit thrust him into the public eye alongside Boris and Jacob was his posting of a raunchy video on a WhatsApp group composed of Tory MPs, some of them ministers. Suffice to say that the video included a scantily clad woman, a man and a sports car. A suitably repentant Andy explained to colleagues that it had been a terrible error caused by “fat fingers”. In October past he said in a radio interview that all English people are entitled to an Irish passport, a claim that nearly caused Twitter to explode and was the impetus for more jokes than Ian Paisley’s summer holidays.In response to a question on free movement between Britain and Ireland post-Brexit, Andy said: “As an English person, I do have the right to go over to Ireland and I believe that I can ask for a passport. Can’t I ” No, Andy, mate, you can’t. We’ve enough West Brits on this island, ta very much.Doctor Jekyll and Mr SnideThat Michael Gove’s a reasonable bloke, ain’t he  There he’s been for the past few months, urging cool heads and common sense, quietly and assiduously working to help Prime Minister Theresa may with a withdrawal agreement that’s harder to sell than a Northern Ireland shirt in O’Neills. While those nasty Brexit nutjobs in the ERG snarl and threaten, Michael’s been a model of loyalty and stf upper-lipped British discretion. But wait. Wasn’t it a bloke who looked exactly like him who said during the campaign that Turkey was about to join the EU, opening the gates to allow five million-plus Turks to come cascading into the UK.Yes, indeed: it was Michael Gove who made that claim. He has subsequently admitted that it was baloney and should not have been made. So them Turks stay in the mess they’re in. And so do we."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"attwood considers his future with sdlp","story":"THE SDLP’s Tim Attwood is considering his future within the party following the announcement of a newpartnership with Fianna Fáil.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood and Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin announced plans for an “historic” partnership between their parties in Belfast last Thursday. An SDLP conference is scheduled to take place on February  in Newry where the party membership is set to vote on the plans.Speaking exclusively to the Andersonstown News. West Belfast Councillor Tim Attwood said he was “not an advocate of the SDLP and Fianna Fáil partnership”. It’s known that South Belfast MLA Claire Hanna is also at odds with the party leadership over its move to link up with Fianna Fáil.“I recognise that the political landscape of this island has been changed utterly given the failure of the DUP and Sinn Féin to bring back the power-sharing Executive, the catastrophic consequences of Brexit and the emerging debate about Irish unity,” said Cllr Attwood.Cllr Attwood continued: “I have the greatest respect for the leadership of the SDLP and recognise that in a post-conflict situation there is a natural and wider debate about political realignment on this island,” he said. “The reality is my politics is steadfastly rooted in the social democratic and labour traditions embodied by the SDLP and parties of the Party of European Socialists.”Mr Attwood, who has served as a West Belfast councillor these past  years, said that over the coming days he would be speaking to his family and SDLP members in his constituency area about the proposal for a new partnership between the SDLP and Fianna Fáil. “I will make a further statement after these discussions,” he added.Meanwhile, SDLP Lagan Valley MLA Pat Catney is supporting the party leadership in entering into a partnership with Fianna Fáil.Mr Catney said: “Northern Ireland is crying out for a response to the fast changing and signicant challenges across these islands as a result of Brexit. “Twenty years after the Good Friday Agreement, people here must be offered something new, credible and forward-looking in its approach.”The Lagan Valley MLA added: “Brexit has shted the political sands dramatically. It poses many challenges that sit outside the boundaries of local devolution. Our politics in the past two years, a politics of ision, of deadlock and of repetition is frighteningly at odds with the vast challenges that now face us. Old solutions to new challenges can no longer cut it.“It has always been the SDLP’s vision to unite our people. To seek an Ireland, befitting of the st century, where opportunity and prosperity are more than slogans on a placard but a way of le whether you are Catholic, Protestant or Dissenter. That will never change.“I am all too aware of the uneasiness some of my unionist neighbours may feel about this new partnership. Neighbours who have put their trust in me in countless elections. But let me be crystal clear a new Ireland, one without the full inclusivity of unionism is not one I want to be part of let alone build. You are part of the fabric of this island, woven into history every bit as much as any nationalist and you are a critical part of its future.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"fundraiser in memory of limestone mother","story":"A FUNDRAISING night will be held this Saturdayin memory of a North Belfast woman who died suddenly just two weeks after she became a grandmother for the first time.Marie Branfdied suddenly at her Limestone Road home on St Patrick’s Day  after suffering a heart attack and going into cardiac arrest. Despite efforts by her family to perform CPR, they were unable to resuscitate her.This Saturday, the mother of four’s family are holding a charity night in St Malachy’s Old Boys’ Club to raise money for British Heart Foundation Northern Ireland in her memory. The charity funds research into heart and circulatory diseases including the prevention and treatment of heart attacks.Marie’s daughter Zara said her mum had been delighted to have become a granny for the first time just two weeks before she died.“Mummy’s death came as such a shock to us all. We knew that heart disease ran in our family and my grandparents had had heart attacks at a young age but we didn’t expect this to happen,” she said. “Just two weeks before she died my wee nephew was born and she became a granny for the first time. She couldn’t wait for the baby to be born and had everything all in for him coming. She just doted on him but she only got two weeks with him before she died.”The charity night in St Malachy’s Old Boy’s Club will raise funds to power research into heart and circulatory diseases.“We don’t want another family to suffer like we have,” added Zara.“My wee brother found mummy in the house and between us we tried to resuscitate her but it was too late. We want to raise money to help fund research and stop this happening to other people. So many people loved and miss her. Her husband David, her children and her four brothers and all her friends. The night will be a lovely tribute to her.“Saturday will be a really good night and so many businesses and local people have been really generous with ballot prizes. It would be greatpeople could come along and enjoy a great night.”Órla Clarke, fundraising manager for BHF NI said: “Thanks to Zara and the Branf family for organising the charity night which will raise much needed funds for research. Our research has saved thousands of lives. Before the mid-s, nobody fully understood the cause of heart attacks and  per cent of people here who suffered a heart attack didn’t survive.“Our research has meant that today  per cent of people do survive a heart attack. But stories like Marie’s story show there is still so much to do.“ No family should lose their mummy at just . We need to keep funding research so that more lives can be saved.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"mates pull pensioner from blaze","story":"A RIVERDALE man has recounted the dramatic moments when he and a friend saved two of his neighbours from a blaze that gutted their home.Antoin Carlisle and Terence Young saved an elderly woman in her s and a man in his s from the house fire in Riverdale Park South around .am on Saturday morning. After noticing smoke billowing from the property, the brave pair sprang into action, racing towards the fire to bring the people inside to safety.Recounting the dramatic ordeal, Antoin told us: “I couldn’t see the fire, so I thought it was the end house on my street. As soon as we got to the end of the street we could see the flames through the back windows – the whole lot was on fire.“Nobody lives in the house next door so I kicked in that door thinking somebody had broken in and set it on fire. Then I came round and hit the other door a boot and the fire nearly blew me off my feet.“I started smashing windows to let the smoke out. I smashed the front window and then climbed up and smashed one of the top windows and shouted at the top of my lungs, ‘Is anybody there ’“We found out there were people at the back of the house. We couldn’t get in the front because the flames were too big, so we went to the old couple next door, got them settled, and then my mate Terence started breaking down the fence with his shovel to get into the house. He got in the back way and lted the two people out of the house and out through the broken fence.“The smoke was all over the place so I thought all the houses were going to go up. I went to the houses on the other side and got them up. My neighbour had one of the kids and I had to bring the other one up the street to get them away from the smoke – I was trying to keep my hand over the child’s face to stop them breathing in the smoke. The black smoke was following us the whole way up.”Antoin added: “I think most people would have done it. I just did it because it was my own neighbours. I knew there were old people in those houses so I had to do something. When it’s your own street you can’t just walk past it. I have to thank my friend Terence too becausehe wasn’t here then God knows what would have happened.”A spokesperson for the Fire Servicesaid: “Firefighters were called to a house fire on the ground floor of a two storey, mid-terraced property. A man in his s and a woman in her s were out of the property before the arrival of fire crews. Firefighters wearing breathing apparatus extinguished the fire.“Both casualties were treated at the scene for smoke inhalation and shock and taken to hospital. An elderly neighbour was also treated at the scene and taken to hospital. The cause of the fire is believed to be accidental.”"},{"url":null,"title":"gardai carry out woodland search after dissident arms cache found","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The were both in a wood, about km off the Omeath to Flagstaff road.The finds followed a search operation by gardaí, with the aid of a digger, as a result of intelligence-gathering by officers.Garda personnel from the Louth ision were backed up by anti-terrorist officers from the Special Branch and the Emergency Response Unit.A senior officer told the Irish Independent last night that the ammunition and tube had been stored there for at least a year, but described the find as signicant.Officers are satisfied that the material belonged to a dissident group, rather than dating back to the Provisional IRA before their ceasefire, and is in good condition.Gardaí called in an army bomb disposal team as a precautionary measure, but after a detailed examination the team decided there was no need for a controlled explosion and ed to barracks.The tube and ammunition will be handed over to Garda ballistic officers for forensic examination.The area was sealed off yesterday evening and preserved overnight for a resumption of searches this morning.Officers declined to say which dissident IRA faction might have used the dumps and the area has been used in the past by a number of groups.However, the Garda security and intelligence section at headquarters in the Phoenix Park and the Special Branch have ramped up their activity in the Louth-Meath and Cavan-Monaghan isions in the past couple of months.This action has been focused primarily on the New IRA, which is thought to pose the main threat to security.The group is believed to be responsible for the car bomb explosion outside the courthouse in Bishop Street, Londonderry two weeks ago.The Garda Special Branch has been sending extra patrols to the border to combat a feared increase in activity by dissident republicans.Intelligence indicates that a terror campaign is likely to be re-ignited by the dissidents in the first quarter of the year.The Garda authorities have responded by deploying additional personnel to border isions where the Special Branch presence had been scaled down since the peace process settled in.The patrols are being sent out regularly from the units headquarters in Harcourt Square, Dublin."},{"url":null,"title":"eu needs a dose of reality if we are to get a sensible deal says dups foster","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

That needs to be fixed.\"But I am firmly of the view that no problem is insurmountable, and I believe that the EU wants to agree a workable deal.\"Mr Nicholson said he had detected a change in tone from European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker.\"Although time is running out, nothing is insurmountable and common sense must prevail,\" the veteran politician said.Meanwhile, a Cabinet minister warned MPs that they may not be re-elected to Parliamentthey block Theresa Mays Brexit agreement and force the UK to crash out of the EU without a deal. Liam Fox said politicians would have \"little cover when they next face the voters\"their actions led to a no-deal exit.Mr Fox became the latest frontbencher to suggest Britains withdrawal may have to be delayed. The International Trade Secretary said Downing Streets insistence that the UK will leave the EU on March , and suggestions by Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom that the exit date could be pushed back, were not \"incompatible\" stances. \"There would be a huge dference between an extension to Article  because we hadnt reached an agreement, or a short delay because we had reached an agreement and needed the legislation to implement it,\" he said after a speech in London.

I have had one pupil who said to me Mummy orders tutors all the time, like ordering a takeaway,\" she said.Theres a lot of hard work involved, but for Valerie, its certainly rewarding. \"Teaching is the best job in the world as far as I am concerned,\" she said. \"Andyou do what you love you will never work a day in your le.\""},{"url":null,"title":"long queues as northern ireland petrol station slashes prices to 99p","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

None of it is conducive to encouraging business investment in this country,” she added.While Labour MP for Houghton and Sunderland South, Bridget Phillipson, saidthe move is confirmed it would “represent deeply troubling news for the North East economy”.Tory Remainer Anna Soubry tweeted that it was “dficult not to be angry” at the reports, adding: “This is Brexit reality.”Nissan had voiced concerns about Brexit before finally committing to build the new Qashqai and X-Trail models in its North East factory in October , four months after the EU referendum.What we are hearing is that #Nissan is no longer planning on building its new X-Trail model in #Sunderland, despite whatever secret assurances it was given by the government.

A spokesman said: “Nissan does not comment on rumour or speculation.”Mr Turner said it is “beyond disappointing” that Unite members heard about their futures and the holding back of planned Sunderland investments through the media and not directly from the company.“These rumours are disturbing and will cause the workforce to have a very anxious weekend even though production of the X-Trail would have necessitated additional jobs on site,” he said.“We have a dedicated, world-class workforce in Sunderland, good jobs that support families and communities who deserve far better than this.”He said Unite is “working hard to establish the truth behind current speculation”, adding that they will be meeting the company on Monday to establish the facts.At the time, the decision to build its next-generation Qashqai and add production of the new X-Trail model at the site had eased concerns about the future of the North East factory after Brexit.It secured thousands of jobs in the Brexit-backing city, but prompted a volley of questions over whether a so-called “sweetheart deal” between the car-maker and the Government had been struck to protect the manufacturer from any post-Brexit EU tarf wall.Ministers strongly denied any financial incentives were offered and Chancellor Philip Hammond said any costs arising from the assurances would be small enough to be covered within the Department for Business’s existing spending limits.The Sunderland plant, which has been active since , employs almost , people, producing around , cars a day.Other Nissan models built at the site include the Qashqai, Juke, Q, Note and the zero-emission electric Leaf.Nissan is part-owned by French manufacturer Renault, which had led to concerns that production could be moved to France to avoid any tarfs which might be introduced on exports to the EUthe UK leaves the single market in a hard Brexit.According to Sky News, the firm’s decision is not expected to have a major impact on jobs.This isn’t just about Brexit, although it’s very clear that Brexit uncertainty is a major issue for the automotive sector across our country, and has already caused serious harm  — Bridget PhillipsonFebruary , The U-turn comes as figures show car production slumped by almost a tenth last year, leaving the industry on “red alert” amid continued Brexit uncertainty.A report by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traderssaid investment had effectively “stalled” amid fears over the UK’s future trading prospects with the EU.Just over . million cars left UK factories in , a .% decline on the previous year, and the lowest for six years.Production of diesel cars was down by % to , last year.SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said the fall in investment was “deeply depressing” and should send a strong signal to politicians to secure a Brexit trade deal.The reported decision by Nissan also comes just weeks after a triple jobs blow in the UK car industry.Earlier this month American car manufacturer Ford confirmed nearly  jobs would be lost at its engine manufacturing plant in Bridgend.It followed a similar move by Jaguar Land Rover to reduce its , workforce by , under plans to make £. billion of cost savings – with most of the cuts in the UK.Japanese firm Honda also announced six non-production days in April under contingency plans to mitigate the risk of disruption to production at its Swindon factory after the UK leaves the EU."},{"url":null,"title":"uk could see coldest night in almost a decade as big freeze continues","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

a potential of minus C in eastern Scotland.“If that happens it would make it the coldest night since ,” he said. “But there is cloud coming from the West overnight over Scotland, soit gets in fast

untreated road, pavements and cycle paths”, and said there is an increased likelihood of accidents and injuries.The cloud moving in from the West over Scotland during Saturday night into Sunday will usher in rain and some hill snow, Mr Partridge said.“With it, it brings in some milder air so we get a real big temperature contrast tomorrow,” he said.Mr Partridge said C is expected in North East Scotland during Sunday, with C likely in the South West of England.“That is the beginning of milder air pushing its way in across the UK next week,” he said, stating temperatures will be “nearer

However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive.Despite a number of protracted attempts to secure the site and hopes that a deal could be agreed, it was bought by supermarket giant Lidl.While widely regarded as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor leisure facility and while there are some politicians who would like a swimming pool as part of any new development in the resort, this seems unlikely given there are local authority pools in Downpatrick, Kilkeel and Newry.It was previously suggested that the sale of the Annesley Buildings would free up the site for a new hotel and, signicantly, generate funds to help provide new leisure provision in the resort. But that now looks unlikely.As part of the drive to signicantly enhance leisure provision in the resort, council officials are continuing to work alongside education officials to develop a major new sports hub.Shimna Integrated College is planning to redevelop its King Street site which would include the creation of additional sports facilities at nearby Donard Park.It has been suggested that the proposed sports facilities could potentially be developed by the Department of Education in partnership with Newry, Mourne and Down Council with pitches and a sports pavilion forming the new sports hub which could also used by the community.While discussions are ongoing, the local authority still has to address the issue of no meaningful indoor sports facility in the resort to cater for both residents and visitors and is turning its attention to the Annesley Buildings site.Senior council officials have admitted that their initial thoughts about using the location for a town centre hotel have changed, confirming they are working to make a final decision on the way forward. It is also being suggested that the most likely outcome is developing a new leisure-cum-community facility at the Central Promenade site.A feasibility study on the redevelopment of the town centre site for a new hotel was completed several years ago which suggested a two or three-storey extension extension would be acceptable.The new hotel was viewed as a key ingredient in the plan to deliver highly ambitious proposals outlined in the Mournes Gateway proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in Newcastle.Other proposals include a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes and a visitor centre at the site of the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain.It has emerged that work on the high profile tourism project is progressing with moves to establish a board to deliver its ious elements, with membership including representatives from the local council, Tourism NI, Forest Service, Mourne Heritage Trust and National Trust.Over the next month, work is scheduled to start on tendering for consultancy and architectural services, alongside the recruitment of environmental and traffic management services.

Scrum half Conor Gibson was on hand to move the ball quickly to Hutley, who put Luka Walsh in space for the first score of the game.Omagh bounced back well, again using the wind effectively, and their pressure gave way to a penalty which they successfully struck to close the gap.As they continued to apply pressure, the home side had a chance to take the lead on the  minute mark, but their kick drted to the right hand side of the posts.With  minutes left in the half, Down High extended their lead. Having forced Omagh deep into their own half, Luka Walsh capitalised on Omaghrsquos decision to play out from their own quarters when he intercepted the ball to score his second of the day. Hutley slotted over the conversion. Down carried a - lead into half-time.With the strong wind now on their tails and a reasonable points buffer, Down High controlled the game well. Omagh continued to apply plenty of pressure, but the Down defence was hungry and with the exception of a few indiscretions they soaked up the Omagh onslaughts.With  minutes left the game took a critical turn when Hutley slotted agoal to take the Down lead to -.As would be expected from the men from the west, they didnrsquot lie down, but they were forced to chase the game.

However, the book kept me from thinking dark thoughts. Soon, all I wanted was to hold a copy of the book in my hand.Maureenrsquos dream came true in the autumn of  when her haunting story was finally published.Maureen, who is the mother of five grown-up children, explained some of the background as to why she put pen to paper.She added: ldquoI was initially setting out to piece together my family tree and the computer screen flashed up information on my great aunt Brigid. I was so fascinated with what I read that I could see the story unfold in a book and in turn I felt the plot would work well on screen too.Research took Maureen to the Presentation Convent in Co Kildare, which Brigid entered at the age of .Maureen said: ldquoI met with such a warm and friendly welcome from the community of sisters, that it gave me the desire to pursue Brigidrsquos story further. I travelled to Australia shortly after and I received the same, warm and friendly welcome from the sisters of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Wagga Wagga.On herMaureen set about sting through a mountain of information and carefully crafted the remarkable story of her great aunt. The book was published in July  and was officially launched a few months later to a rapturous reception in Murphyrsquos Bar in Downpatrick.A chance meeting which her web designer, Michael McLaughlin, had had a year later led to a further development.She said: ldquoMichael was working on a display in Eclipse Cinema in Downpatrick for another movie when he struck up a random conversation with Colin McIvor.ldquoAs they chatted Michael mentioned that he had recently read a book written by a Downpatrick woman which he thought might make a great movie.ldquoWithin days Colin, with the backing of Northern Ireland Screen, was in my house and we were signing contracts on a movie deal. That was in July last year and since then the whole thing has snowballed.ldquoIt has been a pleasure putting the whole thing together. I wrote it like a novel which makes it easy for the reader to follow the story. My story is entirely based on fact.As Maureen describes the plot her face lights up. She believes her great aunt would be delighted at her revealing the long-lost tale to a new generation.ldquoBrigid had trained as a teacher and in  there was a great demand for priests and nuns with skilled trades in Australia and so she was shipped off to the mother house in Wagga Wagga.ldquoBrigid proved herself capable and popular with the children she taught for six years. But a bad day in front of a teaching inspector led the convent demoting her to refectory duties.ldquoTwo weeks turned into two years of hard labour that took their toll physically and mentally on poor Brigid. Requests toto her former duties were denied and feeling she had no real means of complaint, it left Brigid desperate.ldquoOne day she wandered outside the convent walls. Tears welled up in her eyes as she called at a strangerrsquos home. Her afternoon of tea and warm company by the fire ended all too soon and Brigid was sent back to the convent, seen by a doctor and put to bed, Maureen added.The story really begins in earnest at this crossroads in Brigidrsquos le. Drawing on every ounce of courage she had, Brigid leapt from her bed that night and made a hasty escape barefoot in her nightgown on a foggy winterrsquos night in .This night set the scene for a religious storm unprecedented in Australiarsquos history. Brigid found refuge in the home of Protestants who refuse to disclose her whereabouts to the Catholic authorities.A bishop swore before a magistrate that Brigid was insane and a warrant was issued for her arrest. She was hunted down like an outlaw and the local media attention created a level of sectarian tension rarely unseen in that part of the world.Later, when there was no apology from the bishop for the arrest and slur on her character, Brigid turned to the courts for redress. But taking on the bishop meant taking on the Catholic Church.Maureen had a challenging time presenting Brigidrsquos story.She said: ldquoIt was a scandal at the time but I had to be careful to write it from both sides and let people judge for themselves. Itrsquos all I can do.Maureen says she is looking forward to the filmrsquos premiere.She added: ldquoIt will be the culmination of not just my five years of writing and telling the story, but all the hard work and effort that my family have put into supporting and helping me and, of course, the efforts of the film company, the director and the actors.Colin spoke of his enthusiasm over Maureenrsquos forthcoming film.ldquoI am thoroughly delighted to have optioned such an amazingly powerful book and to have met the inspirational Maureen and her family through the process, he said.He is currently adapting the book into a screenplay. ldquoI believe the film will offer a fantastic role for a strong female lead and supporting cast, he said. ldquoTo be able to bring this beautully written, dramatic and deserved piece to the silver screen some day would be just fantastic.Log on to Maureenrsquos website toon the forthcoming movie premiere at www.theextraordinarycaseofsisterliguori..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 30%2C 1979  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash A Strangford man had a narrow escape from death when he turned up for work on Monday morning at the new Abbey Lodge Hotel, outside Downpatrick.A muffled explosion during the night had ripped apart a section of the hotel mdash which was due to open in three weeksrsquo time mdash but no alarm was raised and workmen were unaware of the danger when they reported for work.One of the men, Mr Francis Black, from Strangford, passed through the lounge and noticed a black bag and two yellow tins. He thought it was some material left for him to carry on with a job and picked it up.Mr Black failed to notice several wires leading from the bag, but an examination of the contents told him something was wrong. He put it down and it was discovered later that the contents were competence for a lethal fire-type bomb.By then Mr Blackrsquos colleagues had discovered the damage caused by another bomb and a warning was raised. Police and firemen rushed to the scene and the main Downpatrick-Crossgar Road, beside the hotel, was sealed off as army bomb disposal experts raced from Lisburn.An army officer successfully defused the second bomb and workmen moved in to assess the damage, which was confined that bedroom section of the hotel.The hotel owner, Mr William Polly, said: ldquoDoors, windows, the gable and the roof have all been damaged and this includes a total of eight bedrooms. It will mean that an entire section of the building containing the bedrooms will have to come out. It was fortunate that the bomb in the lounge did not explode.A police spokesman confirmed that no warnings of the bombs were made. He said that the entire building would likely have been destroyedthe second bomb had gone off.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Two Down councillors have expressed annoyance over the Department of Educationrsquos rejection of proposals for a swimming pool in Ballynahinch.At this weekrsquos meeting of the South Eastern Education and Library Board Mrs Ethel Smyth and Mr Jarlath Carey said nothing less than a meeting with the minister, Lord Melchett, would achieve any satisfaction.Mrs Smyth said that the Departmentrsquos withdrawal of permission for the pool was an immense setback at a time when everyone assumed that the way ahead was clear for the construction of a multi-purpose community complex to be provided by Down Council and a learner pool to be provided by the board.Mr Carey said there was immense concern over the disappearance of what would have been a very happy exercise in joint provision. He was most annoyed that the decision had been made by the Department without consulting either the council or the board.KILLYLEAGH mdash Killyleagh and Shrigley Town Committee was given a massive confidence boost at its annual general meeting last Wednesday evening.An enthusiastic and lively audience of more than  people turned up in response to a publicity drive aimed at finding out what grassroots support the committee had in the area.The response promoted outgoing committee chairman Col Denys Rowan-Hamilton to say later: ldquoSuch a well-attended meeting makes it all worthwhile.In his opening address to the meeting Col Rowan-Hamilton traced the work of the committee in the last  months.He outlined the reasons why the decision was taken to close the community hall, which had been opened by the committee with tremendous enthusiasm by the committee only four years ago.He also reported on Killyleaghrsquos water supply problems and said the shortages of the last three years had caused more worry to some townspeople than any other single item.A new -strong committee was elected and they will meet soon to elect their own office-bearers.CROSSGAR mdash An upstairs bedroom in a Crossgar house was completely gutted when a fire broke out on Friday morning. Severe fire, heat, smoke and water damage was caused to the house at Lislea Drive.Firemen from Downpatrick and Ballynahinch were sent to the scene, but encountered dficulty finding water hydrants due to the snow-covered roads and footpaths.

One Thomas McKee remarked that “many feel the same way that this guy is articulating” and that Brexit has “underlined the anti-Britishness that everyone always knew existed in Ireland”.A Scott McMonies took this view: “Any unionist supporting a united Ireland sports team need their head examined.”A user called Neal Thornton said “playing both national anthemsand flying both flags, Tricolour and Union Jack , would go a long way towards inclusiveness”.Others simply lamented any attempt to link sport and politics – like Andy Simpson who said: “Brexit or any kind of politics has nothing to do with rugby. If you don’t want to support them don’t you certainly won’t be missed.”Fty nine-year-old Mr Ringland, who was capped  times for Ireland from -, said: “There’s a way to promote and inclusive concept of Irishness – and Irish rugby shows that.“Rugby brings people together. It shows a way forward for better relations on the island and some who should know better should try and learn from what it achieves.”As to whether he and others have fallen out of love with the team to some degree due to political friction, the former co-chair of the NI Conservatives said: “No, Brexit has not affected my support for the team one bit.”Signicant dissident weapons haul recovered by Gardai Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"He said it offers an “inclusive concept of Irishness” and suggested politicians should look to the sport to learn “the way to do proper relations across the island”.As well as praising the atmosphere pervading Irish rugby, he also praised the strides made to make Northern Irish football more inclusive, too.try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES:  things you should never EVER say or do to someone from Northern IrelandSnow, ice and fallen debris could make your morning drive dficult - as Roads Service confirm salting of roads network underwayHas PSNI officer Bobby Singleton become an unwitting sex symbol Ian Ogle daughter: UVF gang that murdered Dad are still planning to kill my brotherP.S.N.I. shutdown N.I. road after car crash - N.I.

There will be two weekend closures in the Lurgan area between February - and March - before a four week line closure between  July and  August.Bus substitutions will be in place. This is preparation work for the Lurgan Area Track Renewal Project. This is a substantial scheme to enhance and improve the railway line.Translink will implement a four-week closure this summer of the railway line at Lurgan to fully relay over .km of track, running from the William St level crossing to beyond Bell’s Row level crossing. This closure will be in place between Friday  July and Friday  August inclusive.Some preliminary drainage and level crossing work will be undertaken during engineering line closures on the weekends of - February and - March, with further preparatory work being carried out in the area, outside of normal working hours and overnight, between April and July. This will be a major project, increasing the railway operational line speed in the area and improving safety and efficiency for rail users. The project will also include relaying the three level crossings in the area and renewing the  metres of existing  structures at the station.John Glass, Translink’s Director of Infrastructure and Projects, said: ‘‘Numbers of passengers choosing the train have grown strongly in recent years.Lurgan is now a key station for commuters, with over . million passengers using the Portadown Line every year, and nearly  million passengers using the cross-border, Belfast – Dublin Enterprise service annually. “This work will see us remove current speed restrictions, providing more efficient journeys while maintaining overall performance and high safety standards.The investment also secures the long-term sustainability of this line and maintains vital cross-border connectivity on this important corridor, in line with our Enterprise Strategic Development Plan.Longer-term, the work will also reduce the level of maintenance on the line. “Representing a signicant capital investment, the works will also help contribute to the continued economic growth of the town and the surrounding area.The work represents the first phase of a number of planned strategic improvements within the area over the coming years, including signalling redesign works and an enhanced station, subject to appropriate funding and permissions.“As plans progress, we are prioritising engagement with local elected representatives and other stakeholders, including sports and community organisations, so that local people are made fully aware of the planned upgrade. This engagement will continue between now and the main upgrade works this summer. “We will be working closely with our contractors to complete the works as quickly as possible and keep disruption to a minimum.Young Whitehead ‘Wombles’ awarded sum for sea creature creation Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“Translink is committed to investing in our infrastructure and improving services, ensuring that we progress our journey to being ‘your first choice for travel in Northern Ireland.”try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES:  things you should never EVER say or do to someone from Northern IrelandHas PSNI officer Bobby Singleton become an unwitting sex symbol Snow, ice and fallen debris could make your morning drive dficult - as Roads Service confirm salting of roads network underwayIan Ogle daughter: UVF gang that murdered Dad are still planning to kill my brotherP.S.N.I. shutdown N.I. road after car crash - N.I.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief.

There will be two weekend closures in the Lurgan area between February - and March - before a four week line closure between  July and  August.Bus substitutions will be in place. This is preparation work for the Lurgan Area Track Renewal Project. This is a substantial scheme to enhance and improve the railway line.Translink will implement a four-week closure this summer of the railway line at Lurgan to fully relay over .km of track, running from the William St level crossing to beyond Bell’s Row level crossing. This closure will be in place between Friday  July and Friday  August inclusive.Some preliminary drainage and level crossing work will be undertaken during engineering line closures on the weekends of - February and - March, with further preparatory work being carried out in the area, outside of normal working hours and overnight, between April and July. This will be a major project, increasing the railway operational line speed in the area and improving safety and efficiency for rail users. The project will also include relaying the three level crossings in the area and renewing the  metres of existing  structures at the station.John Glass, Translink’s Director of Infrastructure and Projects, said: ‘‘Numbers of passengers choosing the train have grown strongly in recent years.Lurgan is now a key station for commuters, with over . million passengers using the Portadown Line every year, and nearly  million passengers using the cross-border, Belfast – Dublin Enterprise service annually. “This work will see us remove current speed restrictions, providing more efficient journeys while maintaining overall performance and high safety standards.The investment also secures the long-term sustainability of this line and maintains vital cross-border connectivity on this important corridor, in line with our Enterprise Strategic Development Plan.Longer-term, the work will also reduce the level of maintenance on the line. “Representing a signicant capital investment, the works will also help contribute to the continued economic growth of the town and the surrounding area.The work represents the first phase of a number of planned strategic improvements within the area over the coming years, including signalling redesign works and an enhanced station, subject to appropriate funding and permissions.“As plans progress, we are prioritising engagement with local elected representatives and other stakeholders, including sports and community organisations, so that local people are made fully aware of the planned upgrade.

He’s just taken over at the helm of the internationally renowned next generation science park which is home to  innovative knowledge based companies, who are employing more than , engineers, researchers, entrepreneurs and executives, across four locations – and has his sights firmly set on making Northern Ireland a leader in two key innovative areas of tech business.Taking on the role as chief executive of Catalyst from stalwart Professor Norman Apsley OBE, just two months ago, plans are under way to build on the foundations of an organisation which has an estate of , sq ft of agile workspace filled with innovative companies. Catalyst leads the way in innovation and entrepreneurship by supporting the creation and growth of innovation companies in Northern Ireland.“We have a rightful place in leading the world. We aren’t going to follow anybody. Let’s get back to leading the world,” Steve tells Ulster Business.“I am going to take the foundation that Norman left and look at how we leverage that by a signicant factor – in terms of economic activity and dynamism for Northern Ireland.“We need deeper, more strategic partnerships with key institutions. It is through collaboration we can do something to scale and put Northern Ireland on a world map.”Catalyst is the thriving, beating heart of Northern Ireland’s booming technology sector and leading the way in educating and preparing companies and young people for the changing world of work through the impact of the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is seeing the impact of new technologies impacting on le, work and society.Formerly known as the Northern Ireland Science Park, Catalyst is an independent not-for-profit organisation operating across the region. It provides agile workspace across four locations – the main site in Belfast’s Titanic Quarter, the Innovation centres in Londonderry, and Ballymena and most recently opened Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, a co-working space dedicated to the fintech sector in Belfast city centre, which is a partnership with Danske Bank.“The business model we have had for the first  years was the perfect model for that period. We need a new model for the next. We are identying a simple, but ambitious strategy – building on the existing foundation.”Part of the strength of Catalyst is in attracting big international firms, such as Citi, in close proximity to businesses at the very birth of existence. Steve says as a result, “accidental encounters” lead to relationships and outcomes which otherwise, would not have happened.It also plays host to Queen’s University’s leading research body, ECITwhich itself is home to CSIT .Some of the leading thinkers based at the site include ECIT’s Professor Maire O’Neill – one of the youngest ever engineering professors at Queen’s, one-time UK Female Inventor of the Year and a leading researcher. “You have US companies looking at why would they want to move to Northern Ireland – they want to meet Professor O’Neill. She’s amazing,” Steve says.“Then there are cyber companies, like B-Secur. The firm specialises in technology which can read your ECG heartbeat as a unique biometric identy verication.“There are other indigenous companies, like Titan IC in cyber-security, Displaynote and ProAxsis. We have great companies that are now making a dent in the world.”And pushing forward with what his predecessor Norman Apsley built, plans are under way to expand and redevelop Catalyst further still.That includes another new building, Pierpont  – which will provide another , sq ft of space – and a revamp and refurbishment of Catalyst’s Innovation Centre, as part of an addition £m investment.“We want to make this the best place to work – improving the environment, the flow around the campus, the accessibility, and the experience, so that you love being here.“We want to refresh some of the buildings on the site. The Innovation Centre will be modernised by March and we will freshen-up our identity.”His big goal is to lead the way in two areas of technology and business at Catalyst – putting Northern Ireland front and centre.“We want to help to incubate two clusters where Northern Ireland leads the world.“How do we build on what ECIT is doing  We take the start-up capability, and ecosystem we have in Northern Ireland and leverage that further.“We want to make it easier for corporations to set up in Belfast and Northern Ireland in order to access amazing research talent. They want to define what the next big breakthrough is.“We can develop something for global companies that they can’t find where in the world. We want to create clusters, that will act as a magnet to attract hundreds of companies.”One of the unique elements of Catalyst is Connect – a network of experienced entrepreneurs, business professionals, top research talent and potential investors who provide their time and experience pro bono to help foster and develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.“It’s helping entrepreneurs to figure out how to build a company around their product idea and providing the support to validate and access the marketplace, capital, investment and or talent,” Steve says.“With the Connect network, we had  early stage companies or entrepreneurs engaged in our programmes last year. There is a lot of exciting and vibrant activity going on at the moment.”And it was Connect, which Steve founded and developed at Catalyst, which first drew him back home to his native Northern Ireland, following years of running and founding tech firms in the West Coast of the US.“I was an entrepreneur in Calornia for a number of years, in San Francisco and San Diego. I was there for the peak of the dot coms,” he said.That included his own start-up business, Kineticom, as well as other tech companies. It was his time in San Diego which resonated strongly with Steve.“Personally, I became obsessed with the San Diego story and the parallels to Northern Ireland. When they started on their journey in , San Diego had a population of . million people, % of their economy was dependent on the public sector. They have an ocean to one side, a mountain range around them and another country to the bottom of them.”San Diego went from the bottom of every league table to the top – with the collaboration of top universities, research and development and entrepreneurship, building the city into the tech stalwart it is now.The Connect  emanated from San Diego – a concept which help shaped the programme in Northern Ireland.“Meeting Norman Apsley at the Science Park was just the most beautul thing ever,” Steve says.The financial and economic impact and contribution that Catalyst has is hard to ignore. It’s estimated the businesses which operate there contribute around £m in GVA each year.“Everything we do is based on the simple belief that innovation has the power to transform our economy. People around the world are all innovating quickly, adapting new technologies, articial intelligence, for example. In Northern Ireland,people are producing goods and services, but are behind in adopting those new technologies, our economy is going to be in trouble as we will not be competitive.“The question is, how does innovation become the foundation on which everything is based ”And as a result of Catalyst’s research into the NI Knowledge Economy, an annual report published later this month, which acknowledges the huge changes to the workplace in the coming year, Catalyst is hosting their second Future of Work summit in May  – aimed at demystying how roles and traditional jobs are changing, right across the Knowledge Economy sectors.Of course, Brexit is still on the horizon. For Steve, the main concern is around the availability of talent. “The tech sector is hungry for talent, but with the uncertainty in the last couple of years, fewer people have been willing to consider moving to Northern Ireland. That places a lot of pressure on the existing employees in the sector.”“Long-term, we have to be optimistic and look at the opportunities which can come out of Brexit. The businesses within the Knowledge Economy are export driven, representing over % of all NI exports. With % of these exports outside the EU, the Knowledge Economy is the sector least dependent on Europe and should be the key for driving growth at this time of uncertainty.”So, for Steve, his level of optimism and dynamism is clear in his new role, one which he says he is “very fortunate” to have.“It’s a position which comes around so rarely, and whoever gets the opportunity is so blessed and fortunate to have the opportunity to lead. We have a talented team of people who are all passionate about what is possible. It’s so exciting. The opportunities and possibilities are endless.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"no deal brexit could cost ni economy bn by ","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s economy could suffer a £bn drop in output by  in the event of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, it’s been claimed. According to the CBI, its analysis of government figures published at the end of last year showsthe UK fails to secure a deal with the EU, by , GVA could be “.% lower than under the UK’s current arrangements with the EU according to government analysis”. The CBI calculates this could amount to an annual loss of output worth almost £bn by , based on today’s prices. It says “manufacturing activity is particularly important in Northern Ireland, and the agri-food sector, which employs thousands, is likely to be severely impacted as it is particularly exposed to the risk of higher tarfs and trade costs”. Angela McGowan, Northern Ireland director of the CBI, said: “CBI members across Northern Ireland are clear:the new approach to finding a Brexit deal continues to be a game of who blinks first, the Northern Irish economy will pay the price. “The deadlock will only be broken by a genuine attempt by all MPs to find consensus and compromise, not stick to rusting red lines and political conditions. Like the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland is not – and cannot be – ready for no deal. “The projected impact on our economy would be devastating and while business will do all it can to reduce some of the worst aspects, a no deal scenario is unmanageable. “The message from the CBI to our politicians is clear – we must see compromise or the whole country faces the unforgivable prospect of a disorderly Brexit which will affect jobs and livelihoods in Northern Ireland for decades to come. It’s time to put prosperity before party politics and dogma.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Air-1.jpg","title":"eight part belfast made airbus passenger jets delivered","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Eight part-Belfast made Bombardier Airbus passenger jets were delivered at the end of last year – bringing the total number to  during .

We tell client’s stories through engaging content written by former journalists – grab their customers’ attention with stunning design, maximise conversions by using the latest digital marketing expertise, and develop websites which are living, breathing, online stores or shop windows. As content director, my role is to bring almost  years’ experience in journalism, political communications, corporate PR, crisis management and digital content crafting to Grofuse. How did the business start and how has it grown The business was created by a fusion of expertise to achieve sales growth, including experienced digital marketers, PR consultants, web developers, software developers, graphic designers, illustrators and motion designers. I co-founded the company with expert digital marketer Denis Finnegan who has spent  years fuelling online lead generation for businesses. Growth has been swt over the last  months. We’ve employed an effective combination of marketing efforts and created fans of our existing clients.What is your background I’m a seasoned hack, having worked in print journalism for almost  years followed by a few years as a political communications adviser. I spent a brief period teaching English and history at secondary level before entering a newsroom. The working environments were poles apart in terms pace, excitement and... language choices. As a school pupil and university student, I worked on building sites, supermarkets, farms, bars, bread delivery vans, a bakery and even a bacon factory kill-line. However, I had never encountered such flurries of expletives as I did in newsrooms. Great places to work. High pressure, tight deadlines and great target-setting – a superb way to fuel productivity in any work environment.What do you do dferently from your competition and what are your strengths Clear communication with our clients is our greatest strength. We listen intently to what our clients’ goals are, take time to learn about their products and gain full understanding of their ideal customers. We start with a blank canvass and devise bespoke digital strategies to fuel each client’s business growth by engaging their target market effectively and delivering genuine sales leads that are easily quantiable.Who are your main customers Our customers operate across a wide range of sectors. We are currently working with clients across the UK and Ireland, US, France and Spain. Do you have a target in mind in terms of where you want the business to grow We are currently focusing the bulk of our efforts on the island of Ireland with a particular focus on Dublin and Belfast. What challenges have you faced The somewhat ‘snake-oil industry’ reputation of digital marketing sometimes poses a barrier to speaking with decision makers who in the past have invested with little . However, once we’re given an opportunity, we like to let the results do the talking. Who most inspires you Those who thrive in the face of adversity and have strong growth mind-sets. The type of person with the right measure of accountability, skill and relentlessness to inspire their teams to achieve targets. It’s a mind-set akin to that of a top athlete whose body is screaming ‘slow down’ in the business end of a race but whose mind interprets that as a cue to go faster. My we Martina – a former operations manager with Lidl Ireland who co-founded and runs leading human resources consultancy, HR Team – has these qualities in abundance. She inspires me in everything I do.Where do you see yourself in the next few years I love living and working in the North West. Whatever people like to call Derry or Londonderry, it’s a very special place with a lot of talent and a big future in driving the cross-border regional economy. With our headquarters at Catalyst Inc and plans underway for satellite offices in Dublin and the UK, we want to ensure our agency plays a part in shaping that economic prosperity with the provision of more high-quality jobs for the area.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
