AMLO was then a member of the PRI party, led by President Enrique Pena Nieto, but quit in the late 1980s.After losing the Tabasco governor’s race twice, he staged protests in an attempt to raise his profile during a time in which there was increasing resistance towards the leading party. However, in 2000, AMLO was elected as the mayor of Mexico City as part of the PRD.With his first bid at the presidency in 2006, he promised to ‘put the poor first’, but his critics branded him ‘a danger for Mexico’, likening him to Venezuela’s President Hugo Chavez. The election was decided by a thin margin and López Obrador claimed it had been rigged.          Mexico City\u0027s main square, the Zocalo, as Andrés Manuel López Obrador delivers his speechAMLO led protests yet again and declared that he was the legitimate president of Mexico. This led to the former Mayor speaking in villages that had not been visited by political leaders for years.One of his aides, Polimnia Romana Sierra said: ‘He spoke with the same energy under a tree in front of 10 people as he did in the full Zocalo. Nobody works the microphone like him.’He formed a new party, the National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) and by 2015, he was regarded as the next election winner. In addition to this, as the PRI became increasingly involved in corruption scandals, López Obrador also grew in popularity.His wife and fervent feminist, Beatriz Gutierrez, also helped to extend his appeal to female voters in Mexico.          AMLO, accompanied by wife Beatriz Gutierrez Muller, delivers his victory speech in MexicoAndrés Manuel López Obrador\u0027s policiesAfter winning the Mexican election, Andrés Manuel López Obrador must now ensure that his promises are fulfilled. Despite critics comparing AMLO to Hugo Chavez and his leftist sympathies could turn Mexico into Venezuela, he took home a landslide victory.According to the BBC, many believe that he shares an authoritarian approach and will ruin the economy, but AMLO has rejected these claims and has said that he will not carry out expropriations and will not seek re-election.However, he has promised to renew contracts awarded by the state oil company Pemex to private companies during the administration of President Enrique Pena Nieto and will check they are not corrupt. He has also vowed to bring economic growth, jobs and social development programmes.‘We will carry out a peaceful transformation, ordered, but profound and even radical, because the word radical comes from root, and what we will do... is, in essence, to root out the corrupt regime,’ he said at one campaign rally.Against what he describes as the ‘power mafia’ of Mexico, he plans to increase scholarships for the young and expand welfare for the elderly, offering ‘good relations’ with the private sector and accusing business leaders of acting ‘like they owned Mexico’.AMLO has also promised to bring peace to the war on drugs, but will not continue the military-led strategy. Notably, he has also said that he would not let Mexico bow down to Trump and asked for ‘friendship’ and ‘mutual respect’ to avoid any trade war.\u0027Soon, very soon, after the victory of our movement, we will defend migrants all over the American continent and the migrants of the world who, by necessity, must abandon their towns to find life in the United States it\u0027s a human right we will defend,\u0027 Lopez Obrador said in a June speech reported by El Universal.US President Donald Trump congratulated Lopez Obrador in a tweet saying: \u0027Congratulations to Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on becoming the next President of Mexico. I look very much forward to working with him. There is much to be done that will benefit both the United States and Mexico!\u0027Who is Morgan Evans?

but added that the French were committed to being \u0027global actors\u0027 alongside the US. Mr Trump will travel to Europe next week for a potentially stormy NATO gathering on July 11-12, before heading to the UK.In the two-page letter, Gen Mattis said \u0027the credibility of the UK\u0027s armed forces\u0027 had been crucial in securing its place on the world stage.David Cameron DID ask Barack Obama to warn that Brexit would...Tory Brexit war catches fire as minister demands \u0027insolent\u0027...Share this articleBut he added: \u0027I am concerned that your ability to continue to provide this critical military foundation for diplomatic success is at risk of erosion, while together we face a world awash with change.\u0027The UK is committed to meeting the Nato target of spending 2 per cent of GDP on defence, but the US hinted that it wants Mrs May to commit more money.Gen Mattis said: \u0027A global nation like the UK, with interests and commitments around the world, will require a level of defence spending beyond what we would expect from allies with only regional interests.\u0027Absent a vibrant military arm, world peace and stability would be at further risk.\u0027Highlighting Mr Macron\u0027s recent pledge to pump an extra £260billion into defence by 2025, Gen Mattis said: \u0027As global actors, France and the US have concluded that now is the time to significantly increase our investment in defence.\u0027Other allies are following suit.\u0027          The letter has been leaked as Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson (pictured left with Mrs May and her husband Philip at an Armed Forces Day event over the weekend) lobbies hard for his budget to be expanded    Mr Trump and French president Emmanuel Macron (pictured together at the White House in April) have struck up a close rapportHe stressed that it was \u0027in the best interest of both our nations for the UK to remain the US partner of choice\u0027 but \u0027in that spirit, the UK will need to invest and maintain robust military capability\u0027.In a reference to the Whitehall rows over funding, Gen Mattis added: \u0027It is not for me to tell you how to prioritise your domestic spending priorities, but I hope the UK will soon be able to share with us a clear, and fully funded, forward defence blueprint that will allow me to plan our own future engagement with you from a position of strength and confidence.\u0027Downing Street tried to play down the row, insisting Britain has the \u0027biggest defence budget in Europe and the second biggest in Nato\u0027.‘I would point to the Nato Secretary General following his meeting with the PM where he said he appreciates Britain’s commitment and leadership in the Alliance,\u0027 the PM\u0027s spokesman said.‘The UK is above the 2 per cent contribution and we have said we will continue to meet that target.‘We, the US and France are close allies and partners willing to take action together in defence of our values.’However, the spokesman refused to state that the UK would continue to have the largest defence budget in Europe.   The week after receiving the letter, Mr Williamson told MPs that US patience over European defence spending was wearing thin.\u0027We can\u0027t continue to expect US taxpayers to keep picking up the tab for European defence indefinitely, nor can we expect US patience to last forever,\u0027 he said on June 20.The Commons Defence Committee has also called for a significant funding boost, moving the level of defence spending up from 2 per cent to 3 per cent of total GDP.A cash injection on this scale would equate to additional funding of around £20billion a year and bring investment in defence to levels similar to those seen between the end of the Cold War and the mid-1990s."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/02/01/4DD407A500000578-0-image-m-64_1530489810496.jpg","title":"Brazen sunbather ruins couples wedding photos refusing move","story":"    The bikini-clad woman had positioned herself on a towel just yards from where the newlyweds had their photographs takenShe had travelled down from south London to attend the wedding of her father\u0027s cousin Mark Ling and Mandy Cripwell on Saturday.The loved up couple were married at Furrough Cross Church in Torquay, which is next to Tessier Gardens -

They\u0027re nice people. It\u0027s a nice atmosphere.\u0027 Because that\u0027s the thing about Wimbledon, it is nice — and gloriously British.Yes the Tube is overcrowded, the streets are seething and the sun is doing its best to shrivel the stunning purple, green and white hanging baskets, but somehow no one is shoving or pushing or being remotely irritable.Even the thousands of hot, sweaty people in the vast, snaking mass who queue from 6am each day — first for a queue pass and then, again, to actually enter the grounds — are in good form, and arresting to look at in floral dresses and sunhats, teeny shorts and cropped tops, sport socks, daringly undone shirts, sandals and floppy cricket hats.          Hundreds  of Tennis fans queue in the sweltering heat on Day One of the Wimbeldon Tennis championshipsMeanwhile, the shops in the High Street have gone tennis-mad. Tennis balls and the green, white and purple tournament livery colours are in every windowEd Savitt opened Dropshot, an independent coffee shop, just three weeks ago and is enjoying his \u0027baptism of fire\u0027. A few doors down, at DeRosier Chocolate \u0026amp Coffee Shop, chocolate tennis balls and chocolate racquets are flying off the shelves.And everywhere you look are dozens of well-heeled and unfailingly polite volunteer stewards sporting bright orange hi-viz jackets, official armbands and a splendid array of Panama hats.There is also an army of professional stewards, which includes Maurice, 68, a retired custody officer. His fluorescent yellow suit is almost too bright to look at as he barks happily at people wandering into the traffic with their noses deep in their phones.Recently widowed Maurice is currently in the middle of summer\u0027s stewarding \u0027season\u0027 and loving it.\u0027I\u0027ve just done Royal Ascot — I did the parking there — 4,000 cars!\u0027 Next he\u0027s up to Scotland for the European golf tour, followed by a trip to Everest Base Camp in October — something he\u0027d always wanted to do — to commemorate his late wife. His fellow stewards are supporting him financially.He\u0027ll be on his feet for 14 hours a day and then home for a long soak in the bath and a huge glass of red wine. \u0027By the last Sunday I\u0027ll be dead on my feet,\u0027 he chirps happily. \u0027I do it every year!\u0027Maurice\u0027s spot, a few hundred feet from the Club, is in the epicentre of Joanna Doniger\u0027s rental empire, TennisLondon.co.uk, a sort of posh Airbnb for people or corporates who can afford £12,000 for the fortnight, want sleek modern properties and Joanna at their beck and call.This year, the heat has bought fresh challenges, including a glass shower cubicle that exploded in the heat (\u0027luckily no one was in it\u0027), and requests for air-conditioning units and top-of-the-range fans.          This year, the heat has bought fresh challenges for tennis fans waiting in line for tickets None of which is demanded by the thousands camping out this week. There isn\u0027t even a shower block in the official camping field.\u0027It\u0027s fine,\u0027 says Rita, from Melton Mowbray, who is here for the full fortnight with friends Gillian, Anne and Maggie. \u0027We\u0027ve got wet wipes and a bucket and we have a strip wash in the loos.\u0027This is their sixth year running and Maggie, 18 yesterday, couldn\u0027t think of anywhere she\u0027d prefer to spend her landmark birthday.\u0027It\u0027s such fun and everyone is kind and friendly,\u0027 she says.Even those who join me at the end of the queue at 12.05pm, where the temperature is 29 degrees and the wait is six hours minimum, are full of the party spirit.No one seems to care that the chances of getting in are minimal. Not even the two ladies I meet who have moved just once (yes, really) since joining the queue at 7.15 this morning.\u0027Time doesn\u0027t exist any more,\u0027 says Chris, from Nottingham. \u0027But we\u0027re having a very nice time.\u0027More than half the campers aren\u0027t even bothering to queue today. They\u0027re just enjoying the scene, reading, sunbathing, playing football, listening to music.Natalie, a 33-year-old events organiser is here for the eighth year in a row. She and her friend Lila, are stripped almost off in teeny bikinis and drinking gin and tonics garnished with strawberries.\u0027Every year I want to see Andy Murray here and every year I\u0027ve failed,\u0027 says Natalie.          Wimbledon fortnight is about so much more than the tennis. It is a rite of passage. Pictured, Tatjana Maria in action on day One of the WimbledonNext door but one, the ladies are drinking Prosecco, bought from McClusky\u0027s, a corner shop decked out in green and purple. \u0027The nicest shop in the world!\u0027 they trill in unison.Eamon McClusky\u0027s family have been running the shop for 62 years, but this promises to be their best yet. He has ordered 50 extra cases of Prosecco, gallons of Pimm\u0027s and is overflowing with ice. He will be open from 6am to 11pm and has a \u0027Wimbledon table\u0027 selling everything from instant porridge to sunhats, sunglasses to sandwiches.But not everyone\u0027s in it for the money. Over the years, residents have raised tens of thousands for charity by renting out their drives, gardens and even homes.Some rabbis running a popular food stall are raising money for a local Jewish outreach programme.And Jack and Chloe, selling Panama hats at £15 a pop outside a vast house on the main drag, tell me the \u0027very, very nice\u0027 lady who owns the house lets them have the spot in return for a donation to Macmillan Cancer Support.Wimbledon fortnight is about so much more than the tennis. It is a rite of passage. A wonderful two weeks where you can leave your normal life behind, work incredibly hard, laugh a lot, make a tidy nest egg — then spend the rest of the year looking forward to doing it all again next time.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/01/01/4DCD041700000578-0-image-a-22_1530406606528.jpg","title":"Gay cure therapy outlawed","story":"    Victim: Dean had two so-called exorcisms before accepting his homosexualityThe Government\u0027s LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender) action plan – backed by £4.5million from Whitehall – also promises to hold a consultation on making it easier for people to legally change their sex.Ministers originally promised to allow adults to change their gender legally without a doctor\u0027s approval last year, but the plan has been repeatedly delayed amid growing criticism.BBC chief stunned as secret staff sex survey reveals 417 of...Eddie Mair hits back at reports he left the BBC after...Share this article\u0027No one should ever have to hide who they are or who they love.

When he outgrew that and was being sent for slaughter, Manor Farm stepped in. ‘He’s a rascal,’ says Di. ‘Having been given lots of attention, he feels it’s his right to demand fuss from visitors, who are taken by surprise when he head-butts the back of their knees!’          Bullied pig called Simon: Partially-sighted and with deformed front legs, Simon was so terribly bullied by the bigger pigs he shared a sty with at another rescue centre that they asked Manor Farm to take him. ‘He was grossly overweight which didn’t help with his movement problems — if he was a human it’s like he’s walking on his wrists,’ says Di. ‘He’s now lost weight and is enjoying life with his friend Brooke. She chivvies him around all day and I give him strawberries and melon which he loves.’          Jack the VERY stroppy Donkey: Jack was the first non-hen to be taken in by Manor Farm rescue sanctuary after it came into being about seven years ago. ‘We bought the land for it with some money left to me by my Uncle Jack,’ says Di, ‘so when a donkey sanctuary asked me to look after a donkey called Jack it seemed meant to be. The only thing is — he’s nothing like my Uncle Jack who was very gentle whereas donkey Jack is quite stroppy!’Less than a decade ago, Di and Alan were both running businesses from their Nottinghamshire village home.Now they’re also running an animal sanctuary that currently cares for more than 100 farmyard creatures. And not just any creatures. They take in the ones no one else wanted, rejected because they were disabled, had health problems, special needs or simply grew too old.Or, in the case of the many rescued from petting zoos, simply because they grew up. ‘People imagine these animals are living a lovely life in the petting zoo until they die naturally,’ says Di, ‘but that’s not so in the majority of cases.Adorable moment Limbani the chimpanzee shrieks with joy and...Fury at female Kentucky hunter who posted sickening photos...Share this article‘Lambs can be bred out of season to be Christmas attractions to be bottle-fed by visitors but once they’ve grown out of the cute stage, they go into the food chain.’What’s more, they often come to her emaciated, neglected and infested with parasites. Then the battle is on to save their lives. That battle costs Manor Farm Charitable Trust up to £100,000 a year — around a fifth of which are vets’ bills.‘Our vets are constantly challenged by the ageing of our animals,’ Di admits.No wonder — it’s rare farmyard creatures live more than a year or two before going to be slaughtered.          Blind Stevie\u0027s a littler wonder: When blind Stevie the Mallard duck came to Manor Farm, they knew he needed a friend to guide him round. ‘I chose a girl called Wanda,’ says Di, ‘because female ducks are louder than the boys and I believed he needed someone noisy to follow around.’ Stevie was found with big scabs over his eyes. ‘We didn’t know at first if he’d been attacked, if they were infected or even if he had eyes. He did — but he was blind.’ Now Wanda’s his guide duck.          Toothless OAP fed on a banana: Life’s left Dolly so scared of human strangers that when summer comes Di can’t call in a shearer —instead she has to do it herself with nail scissors. Dolly, a breeding nanny at a farm park, came to Manor Farm in 2012 when they started neglecting her because she’d become barren. ‘She barely had the strength to hold her head up,’ says Di. ‘But she had an indomitable spirit we could all do with.’ Dolly, who has no teeth, was fattened up with mashed banana and is now in the equivalent of her 90s.          Stumble, duck who live up to his name: Stumble may only have one leg but he’s still the scourge of the female ducks he shares his enclosure with. ‘He’s perfected the ability to jump on to a mate,’ says Di. ‘They all run but they can’t hide from him. Stumble’s leg had to be amputated after getting caught in fishing wire. He’s had a difficult summer because he’s moulted and lost his tail feather and wing tips — which help keep him stable. So he keeps falling over.’ And falling in love.          Goat that costs £3,000 to perk up: Of all the Manor Farm animals, Jo cost the most. So thin when Di rescued him from a petting zoo that he couldn’t hold his neck up, she nursed him back to health in her kitchen. ‘He came up to me as if to say “help me,” ’ she says. Jo was covered in lice and had digestive problems. ‘We nearly lost him several times — he was always the one needing the vet at midnight,’ says Di. But she doesn’t begrudge a penny of the £3,000 he cost. ‘He’s the sweetest creature,’ she says.But it’s not just the vets who have been learning. Di has too. ‘In 2010 I treated myself to four hens as a reward for completing an MA in creative writing and I found it was a slippery slope ,’ she says.A year later, a relative died, leaving her money to buy the six-acre field behind the house. Slowly the brood grew and the dozen or so enclosures now house 64 hens, 27 goats, two donkeys, one pony, two pigs and 30 sheep.Di now employs a full-time member of staff and three part-timers. Every day begins at 6am when she gets the feed ready. It ends at 10.30pm — earlier in winter — when she puts the animals to bed. She also finds time to run her publishing business (and Alan his marketing consultancy firm) which help bankroll Manor Farm.          Ewe with a stiff neck: Born with a twisted neck, Hilda was too deformed to breed and too skinny to slaughter so Di took the tiny ewe in. \u0027We were told she\u0027d never take to humans,\u0027 she eat out of a trough because she\u0027d never seen them before. But within a month she was letting us touch her and gradually she got a lust for life. Now she loves to be cuddled and her tail wags madly like a big dog          A goat the size of a pony: Ronnie, the Anglo Nubian goat, is the size of a Shetland pony. ‘They’re a large breed but he’s a particular giant,’ says Di, ‘and that’s how he ended up here — his elderly owner couldn’t cope with the size of him and was going to have him shot.’ So she did a 135-mile round trip to save him. ‘I knew he was big but even so it was a bit of a shock when I saw him.’Other money comes from corporate and personal donations and the sale of eggs and wool from the animals online. Apart from cash worries, there are other downsides. ‘I’ve had every injury known to man — I’ve lost a nail to a goat horn, been electrocuted by a fence and accidentally injected myself with goat antibiotics,’ says Di.But this pales into insignificance compared to the pain of losing one of their beloved creatures. The sanctuary is full so it’s only with the death of an animal that another can be saved. They come from farm parks, via social media or from other rescue centres.‘It is hard work,’ says Di, ‘but when you see the sheep feeding on the grass and the goats happy in their enclosure, it’s worth it.’          Hen healed in a roasting tray: Buffy the ex-battery hen was doing perfectly well at Manor Farm when she was sat on by another bird and left with a bruised back last winter. ‘One of my biggest joys was that we got Buffy back to health with daily physio,’ says Di. ‘Although I do feel a bit guilty that we kept her in a roasting tray so she could rest her neck on the edge of it. She’s still a bit stiff and walks with a bit of a goose step but is otherwise fine. And she now loves cuddles — every time you pass her she wants you to pick her up.’          Sheep who need a dentist: Dumpy is easy to spot: his teeth have grown so big, his jaw is deformed. ‘But you really couldn’t meet a sweeter sheep,’ says Di. She saved him from the slaughterhouse last year — he was on a trailer bound for it when the farmer’s daughter put out a social media appeal. ‘We all clubbed together to buy him and the farmer said we could have him — as long as we gave the money to Comic Relief,’ says Di. But those teeth keep the dentist busy."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/01/01/4DCD041700000578-0-image-a-22_1530406606528.jpg","title":"Gay cure therapy outlawed","story":"    Victim: Dean had two so-called exorcisms before accepting his homosexualityThe Government\u0027s LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender) action plan – backed by £4.5million from Whitehall – also promises to hold a consultation on making it easier for people to legally change their sex.Ministers originally promised to allow adults to change their gender legally without a doctor\u0027s approval last year, but the plan has been repeatedly delayed amid growing criticism.BBC chief stunned as secret staff sex survey reveals 417 of...Eddie Mair hits back at reports he left the BBC after...Share this article\u0027No one should ever have to hide who they are or who they love.

The way housing works must be changedFor a number of years, cities around the world have been facing increasingly global and aggressive speculation in their property markets – from speculators who see housing in our cities as an asset from which to profit, rather than homes for the people we represent.In many cases, speculators take decisions from thousands of miles away. Yet for us their impact on the life and soul of our cities is very close to home. Our city centres risk being hollowed out as vibrant communities are displaced, local shops are closed, and the cost of housing rises exorbitantly.Our community groups and local government, as the part of civic life closest to local people and the most sensitive to their everyday problems, have often been the first to warn of the risks that these practices bring with them regarding the very survival of our cities.For city leaders to be able to tackle this problem, they urgently need greater resources and powers both to increase their stocks of social-rented and other genuinely affordable housing and to strengthen tenants’ rights.Cities are not simply a collection of buildings, streets and squares. They are also the sum of their people. They are the ones who help create social ties, build communities and evolve into the places where we are so proud to live.That is why we are determined to change the way that housing works in the cities we represent. We are building more social-rented and other genuinely affordable homes, doing all we can to strengthen the rights of tenants, and clamping down on bad practices of developers and landlords wherever we are able to.But we face a complex problem and one that operates at a global level. We still lack the powers and resources that would allow us properly to regulate the housing market, to protect tenants’ rights to remain in their homes, and to make homelessness and rough sleeping things of the past.Meanwhile, our national governments, by contrast seem happy to abandon cities to their fate. We are calling on them to address this problem by providing the resources and powers we need to build all the social-rented and other genuinely affordable homes we need, and to make sure tenants are protected in their homes. Global cities are facing a housing emergency. If we do not ensure that the purpose of housing is, first and foremost, to provide homes for our citizens rather than speculative assets, we will struggle to build liveable cities for our citizens for generations to come.Mayors and local governments of world cities are working together to share knowledge and find solutions to the housing crisis. It is our duty to do everything possible to all citizens improve their lives and participate fully in our communities. We will only succeed if we can make sure everyone in our cities has access to a decent, secure and affordable home.• Sadiq Khan is the mayor of London and Ada Colau is the mayor of Barcelona"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6db3f6431143cc20b2777ca59e62dd9607650769/0_225_4242_2546/master/4242.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd4118fd0936e13e1998994a7c81275f","title":"long tenancies landlords cv rent three year agreements","story":"Proposed three-year agreements do little to change oppressive demands from landlords charging extortionate rentsMost cultures have traditional rites of passage, which mark a young person’s transition to adulthood. One example is the Hamar of Ethiopia, and their bull-jumping. Many young people on the verge of adulthood in the UK endure bullshit-wading in order to earn the “privilege” of renting a home. Westminster is “consulting” on three-year tenancies as standard, which is excellent. If tenants can stay longer, that is wonderful, but equally problematic is the frequently ludicrous, lengthening list of conditions that landlords impose before they bestow the gift of allowing renters to pay extortionate rents.In the good old days, when knights were bold and children were happy with an orange for Christmas (that is, about 20 years ago) life for flat-hunters was simple. Find a flat view it decide you like it maybe grab a quick landlord reference pay one month rent in advance then another month as a deposit and hey presto, in you move.Nowadays pre-occupancy checks are like an episode of The Crystal Maze, so fiendishly complex and detailed is the ordeal by paper imposed. A friend was recently asked for his CV by a landlord. Did he face rejection because of a disappointing 2:2, or had he performed insufficient voluntary work? I am only half-joking, as many housing associations now insist that prospective tenants must demonstrate their benefit to the community. What if to pay the rent you have three jobs, leaving no time for charity work?Tenants get no assurances from mysterious landlords, who could be dangerous criminals or serial bankrupts about to lose the property. Must landlords provide proof that they, too, have never paid a utility bill late? Of course not.Certain landlords require 12 months’ rent up front, even three years’ worth of audited accounts, when precarious workers can’t afford upwards of £400 for an accountant. Character references for guarantors have been mandated, along with insisting that even “elderly” renters (ie those over 75), provide guarantors. Older tenants are increasingly reliant on the private sector, and unlikely to have parents or employers to ask (although with extended working lives, maybe that will change).Oppressive requirements are especially egregious in a world of zero hours and student debt. Who among us has the pristine credit rating deemed essential by most landlords? Some demands are downright sinister, such as the landlord who asked to meet his female potential tenant for a drink “to see how they got along”. Who is good enough to rent now? Only modern saints such as David Attenborough, Mary Berry or that nice Clare Balding stand any chance of securing a tenancy. It’s only a matter of time before landlords insist upon: DNA tests passwords to social media (already mooted in US border control, so don’t rule it out) rights to a kidney payable on demand medical certificate signed by three doctors confirming the applicant is of sound mind and body (given the discrimination faced by those of us with disabilities, that’s not so far fetched) your first-born child (unworkable if only because many impecunious tenants delay having families) annual tribute in gold and an oath of obedience, like the Romans did with vassal kings.The solution is a mass programme of genuinely affordable social housing, with rents at roughly one quarter of average incomes, as in the olden days. This would mean tenants could afford their rent, unlike the current situation where they struggle to pay, not because they buy avocados for all their friends but because rents are stratospheric.If landlords persist in increasing rents, then tenants will inevitably default, no matter what hoops they have jumped through to secure a tenancy in the first place.• Penny Anderson is a writer and artist"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ace808571d82f813bee843e2e1b530de1f9ae00a/0_129_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d89820588a664ac21bb74ba7b8f6eb5a","title":"world cup russia england fans","story":"Fans warned against travelling to the World Cup in Russia for fear of hooligans are missing a treat – the locals have been amazingThis. World. Cup. Is. Good. Having been lucky enough to be at Nizhny Novgorod for England 6 Panama 1 (stick that in your hats), St Petersburg for Argentina 2 Nigeria 1 (Messi’s foot of God) and Kaliningrad for Belgium against England (the game was literally pointless), I get to write in the  to say my personal experience is that Russia is absolutely killing this World Cup, which is a vast improvement on spies in Zizzi*. The organisation of this tournament has been fantastic and you’ll struggle to find anyone who’ll say otherwise, which is not because they’re a double-agent or a Twitter bot, but because it’s true.Newspaper headlines “Bloodthirsty hooligans vow murder”, “Russian Ultras: KID BOOTCAMP” and “Russian hooligans warn England fans ‘prepare to DIE’’’. A BBC documentary called Russia’s Hooligan Army. A Foreign Office warning of “heightened risks of violence”. What do these things have in common? Well, they all sound like things Ross Kemp would mumble in his sleep, but they are also UK media reports that put a lot of English people off having an experience like mine and having the opportunity to experience first-hand which country puts us out on penalties.It’s so trite to say the people have been amazing (it annoys me when people come back from a country and say “the people were amazing”, it’s like, come on, they can’t all have been amazing, there had to be at least one dickhead in Mozambique) but the response of the Russian populace to England fans has been the polar opposite of what we were told to guard against. Mark Roberts, head of UK football policing, warned against taking England flags to Russia for fear of being too imperialistic and inciting violence. He might have felt a little silly in Victory Square, Kaliningrad, with St George’s crosses draped over every inch of the U Gasheka pub, native onlookers cheering along to the Umbro-clad mire of English lager-lads singing adapted Atomic Kitten songs (“Southgate you’re the one, you still turn me on … football’s coming home again”). If flags are universally signals of peremptory intent, tell that to the Russian teenager who asked all the fans he met to sign his with where they were from. Desecrating the sacred colours of the motherland with “Jeff, Grimsby” doesn’t get you put in a gulag, apparently.And if this all sounds too magical to be true, that’s how it felt. When numerous Russians asked why we were being told not to come to their country – once phrasing it heartbreakingly as, “Why don’t you like us?” – I initially worried it was some sort of state edict that Putin had issued into their mind-chips to trick us. But it quickly became obvious that it was I, plagued with worries of being attacked if I donned an England shirt, who had been operating in a fantasy of disinformation. My first Airbnb host said how happy he was to meet an Englishman, as his favourite author was Stephen Fry and described how he’d very much enjoyed the BBC adaptation of War and Peace, and that Russians felt a great affinity for the British as they also had a great empire in the past but are now far less powerful and in somewhat of an identity crisis in the present. I tried to return the compliment but am so poorly read I settled for saying it was great when Andrei Arshavin scored four goals for Arsenal at Anfield.Yes, there are clearly problems in Russia with racism, homophobia and hooliganism that as a straight, white man weren’t likely to impact my trip. For a country avowedly impressed with the British culture of 30 years ago, one wonders where the Russians got such ideas. But those issues seemed as irrelevant to this World Cup as Britain’s plundering of Iraq’s oil or the troubling treatment of migrants were from the 2012 Olympics. The experience of being a football fan in Russia, not just for me but for the Senegalese, Nigerians, Panamanians and BAME people I was tolerating Fifa’s godless fan-parks with, was so surprising and thrilling as to be soul-enriching.Huge congratulations must go to the law enforcement that’s been put in place to stop both the most fighty Russians and the most fighty English from making their presence felt. But those responsible for the headlines with TOO MANY CAPITAL LETTERS should be ashamed. Not just for denying England fans these experiences, but for allowing the Russian people to feel demonised, and indeed for allowing Putin to capitalise on this othering of the Russian people to support his us-against-them narrative. Every English person that has a positive interaction with a Russian person is a step further away from letting the people in power turn us against each other ... is what I drunkenly mumbled into Anastasia’s ear a few minutes before I learned she had a husband, and a few minutes after she’d said there are no good computer hackers in Russia, and about 20 minutes after I’d been singing “Football’s coming home”. We’re all living in our own fantasies I suppose.* Allegedly.

In February the prime minister herself established a review of the future funding of English higher education led by Philip Augar. The cynical view may have been that this was a panicky party-political reaction to Labour’s, probably exaggerated, appeal among young people because of its pledge to abolish fees. But at least it opened up the possibility common sense might prevail.But then the universities minister, Sam Gyimah, exposed the radically destructive tendencies of the drive towards a crude market regime. His speech at the Higher Education Policy Institute’s annual conference last month demonstrated just how much the government has become a prisoner of reckless ideology.Maybe we should be grateful to Gyimah for telling it how it is. In his speech he made three assertions – all morally objectionable, intellectually bankrupt and technically incompetent, but utterly logical in terms of that reckless market ideology.First, he said the value of a degree to graduates can be reduced to their future earnings. This is why he wants to see a “gopare.the.university” website. It is also why he wants to push the crude Teaching Excellence Framework (Tef) ratings over the edge into absurdity by producing subject and course ratings as well as whole-institution ones.No recognition that a higher education is not a finished product to be bought off the shelf but a complex co-creation by students and their teachers (and lots of other people). Or that its value will mature, but can also decay.No recognition that average earnings based on past performance are no guarantee of similar earnings in the future – the standard health warning on all financial products but apparently unnecessary here. No recognition the true value of a university education cannot be reduced to website-ticked value-for-money. No place for wonder, enlightenment, culture – or much room for education.Next he said that graduates who did not earn enough to repay the full cost of their loans were being cheated, because their higher education hadn’t, literally, paid off. But, much more sinisterly, he implied they were cheating the now ubiquitously sovereign taxpayers, because their higher education had had to be subsidised. He seems to give no thought to the discrimination in the labour market against women, students from less privileged backgrounds and – a group one might have expected Mr Gyimah to be especially sensitive about – those from black and minority ethnic communities. No recognition either than we might be paying bankers too much and teachers too little. In his eyes presumably the market can never be wrong, morally or technically.Finally, he warned some universities – and we all know which ones he was talking about – not to recruit students (the wrong kind, of course) on to courses whose past graduates had had low earnings. In a neat Orwellian touch he added these “underperforming degrees” were giving mass higher education a bad name.The logic of Gyimah’s three assertions is clear, if not maybe to him. Students whose higher education does not “pay off” in terms of future earnings probably shouldn’t have been admitted in the first place. And the universities that have done the most to widen access beyond traditional elites should be downsized or closed.That should certainly solve the government’s dilemmas about funding universities. There would be fewer of them to fund and those unfortunate “subsidy junkies” who will never pay back their student loans would be weeded out. It is less clear it would do much for the Conservatives’ appeal among young people, despite the dishonest, drum-beat mantra that the Government is “putting the student first”. It’s not clear either that this is quite what Theresa May had in mind when she established the Augar review. But given the government’s incoherence and evasions and isions about Brexit, it is hardly reasonable to expect sane and sensible public policy anywhere else."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83471c8a3e762d99ebf589b4cfab8f65520604b9/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c2465a8337147f89fe6e968f98c34ed","title":"intensive chicken mega farms feed uk poultry industry head richard griffiths","story":"British consumers eat chicken twice a week. Are large farms the only way forward? Britain will need to build more mega-farms to keep it supplied with chicken, according to the head of the UK’s influential poultry lobby. But the biggest threat to UK consumers, he believes, comes from cheap imported meat – “chlorinated chicken” – produced to lower standards as a result of post-Brexit trade deals. Most Brits eat chicken twice a week. As a result Britain’s poultry sector is among the largest in Europe, contributing more than £3bn to the economy annually and directly employing more than 37,000 people.“Larger farms are probably the most efficient way to go in terms of technology, resources, impact,” Richard Griffiths, chief executive of the British Poultry Council (BPC), told the . He believes that ultimately such farms are “the way that we’re going to feed the country.”But what about animal welfare issues? Pressure groups such as Compassion In World Farming say the spread of “mega-farms” is “cruel and unnecessary” and that farming birds intensively indoors is inherently bad for welfare. Griffiths believes that this is not the case. “Indoor reared birds, on any size of farm, are in a controlled environment that provides good welfare. We operate under science-based legislation, the requirements of which are delivered by professional farmers and vets with high levels of training and experience.” If consumers want free range chicken, it is available, he says. “For consumers who want to emphasise one or two parts of the production chain then an extensive choice is available across the country, and it is this variety of indoor and free-range that is a strength of British poultry meat production.”“It started with questioning whether the practices we were using were the right ones. And that also coincided with a greater interest in farm health and welfare. We were involved with some big work on farm welfare with government at the time. Those two coincided with the mindset of – let’s try to reduce, let’s try to use less. In any given situation, do we have to use antibiotics?” But antibiotic-free poultry production – as some companies in the US are championing – is not currently on the table, he believes. “I don’t think that’s possible, and anybody who says it is, is naive.”Following recent suggestions by the US trade representative that the UK’s animal welfare and food safety standards were “unnecessary and restrict trade”, Griffiths hit back, saying such claims were “insulting”.“British poultry producers don’t dip their chicken carcasses in chlorine as we do not believe in ‘cleaning up at the end’ or taking any shortcuts when it comes to producing safe food,” he said. “Using chemicals to disinfect food at the end of a production process can hide a multitude of sins, but what it can’t hide is the need for their use in the first place.”On a practical level, Griffiths said that, were cheap imports allowed to come in, the UK poultry sector could ultimately lose production capacity, with farms and slaughterhouses potentially forced to close. “My fear is that once we lose capacity it’s never coming back,” he said. Some campaigners fear US meat imports could lead to a “race to the bottom” as UK producers seek to compete with cheaper products, with potential moves to lower standards and increasing pressure to ease UK regulations. Griffiths says he believes this isn’t likely, and said the UK poultry industry is united: “I think we’ve nailed our colours to the mast on this. There’s a lot of political talk about improving standards, but maintaining and improving standards is the mentality that we have. We’re not going to drop standards.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce1b46ad1d802673790dde190c665a5c6952fded/0_46_1935_1161/master/1935.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5589dc994ed8dfbfe98be942d860c2d","title":"botanical life in close up in pictures","story":"Colin Salter’s new book is a selection of extraordinary electron microscopic images of the plant world around us, including seeds, pollen, fruiting bodies, trees and leaves, flowers, vegetables and fruit"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e842c4a0f4c9cd1877b7459384ebecc2d8b063ac/55_86_2672_1603/master/2672.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9fdd0875666351223a47eb061f91f34","title":"arsenal sokratis papastathopoulos borussia dortmund transfer","story":"Arsenal have completed the signing of the Greece international Sokratis Papastathopoulos from Borussia Dortmund for a fee of €20m (£17.7m).The 30-year-old defender, who has won 79 caps for his country, was identified as one of Unai Emery’s prime transfer targets after the Spaniard took over from Arsène Wenger as manager.He has signed a “long-term contract” and becomes Emery’s third completed signing after the purchase of the German goalkeeper Bernd Leno for £19m from Bayer Leverkusen and the arrival of the 34-year-old Switzerland full-back Stephan Lichtsteiner on a free transfer from Juventus.The former AEK Athens defender joins his former Dortmund teammates Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang at the Emirates Stadium. “They said to me the best things about this club, that it is one big family and of course they also called me not every day but a lot of times telling me to come here,” Papastathopoulos said.Papastathopoulos, described by his former manager Thomas Tuchel as “a little obsessed with defending”, made 28 Bundesliga appearances last season having established himself as a mainstay of Dortmund’s defence since joining from Werder Bremen in 2013.Meanwhile, the Uruguay midfielder Lucas Torreira is expected to undergo a medical at Arsenal as he nears the completion of a £25m move from Sampdoria."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/261129f451ef7558ba4788aff96e148eeec56cfc/4_30_2586_1552/master/2586.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e20a5c6902d7aa29d01d7d24b89628d3","title":"gareth southgate england avoid traps colombia","story":"Manager understands the increased excitement back home but says his players should not get carried away by emotionOverall there must have been half a dozen occasions when Gareth Southgate was asked whether he could understand the common perception that England had suddenly found themselves in a position whereby they might have a considerably better chance to reach a World Cup final than many people could have anticipated at the start of this competition.Southgate chose his words carefully to make sure he could not be accused of sounding presumptuous or, worse, of saying anything that might inadvertently end up being part of José Pekerman’s team-talk for Colombia.He made the point that Marcus Rashford was eight years old on the last occasion England won a knockout tie in a World Cup – or any major tournament – and everyone knew why he was saying it.Southgate’s only lapse came when he talked about Tuesday’s encounter being England’s “biggest game for 10 years”. He meant 12 years because, at the risk of being pedantic, England did not qualify for Euro 2008. But yes, it is the biggest game since England played Portugal in the 2006 World Cup, featuring a red card for Wayne Rooney, Cristiano Ronaldo’s infamous wink and yet more evidence that England are not made for penalty shootouts.Southgate prefers to speak in plain English, not clichés, so he refrained from using the age-old phrase about “taking each game as it comes”. That, however, was the gist of it. Very sensible, too, when history suggests England should not get too far ahead of themselves. Reminder: there were members of Roy Hodgson’s staff punching the air when Iceland scored the last-minute winner against Austria that meant they would be England’s first knockout opponents in Euro 2016.Southgate did acknowledge that England had found themselves in the better half of the draw, with the possibility of a quarter-final against Sweden or Switzerland to follow and, beyond that, a semi-final against Russia or Croatia and no way of meeting France or Brazil until the final.England’s base in the pine forests of Repino may be secluded but Southgate is in enough contact with the wider world to understand that the fervour is building back home. “I am not surprised,” he said. “Whenever people say ‘I don’t care about international football’ that tends to be during the season. Then you come to a big tournament and it is not just football fans, it is grandads, it is aunts, everyone, supporting the team. And, for some reason, they like these lads.”His bigger point was that this was not a time to think of any other match apart from the next one. “That was a trap we’ve fallen into in the past,” he said. “I can see everybody is more excited but we have to think separately, otherwise we just get carried away on the wave of emotion and we would not be thinking clearly about what we have to affect. We have to control the bits we have to control. But we would be foolish to focus on longer into the tournament.”Again it came back to the Iceland game and the mistake many people made of assuming England were set for a quarter-final against France in Paris. Hodgson and his assistant, Ray Lewington, did not even bother going to the Iceland-Austria game to make a personal check their next opponents, preferring instead to spend the day sightseeing and going on a boat journey down the river Seine. Even now, two years on, it seems like a remarkable oversight and listening to Southgate it was clear he felt the attitude of the players was wrong, too.“A few of these players, in the last championships, were in a fixture they thought they should win. Then, once they went behind, they suddenly felt that approach wasn’t correct. We won’t fall into that trap again, against a really good team. It is one of many games that we have unpicked because it would be silly not to look at previous tournaments and try to identify what we can learn.”Not to be too presumptuous, for starters. Colombia, after all, are hardly a team that England can underestimate, particularly if James Rodríguez is fit to take his place in a forward line with Radamel Falcao and Juan Cuadrado. England have not kept a clean sheet here and, if they are to make it into the final eight, a lot depends on the three-man backline of Kyle Walker, John Stones and Harry Maguire, how well Jordan Henderson can shield them as the only defensive midfielder and whether Jordan Pickford can look more assured in goal.At the same time England have Southgate’s first-choice XI available, with Fabian Delph the only absentee now he has flown home to attend the birth of his child – or, as Southgate put it, “buying his wife curries and all sorts of other strange things”. Southgate is encouraged by the energy of his team’s performances and did not seem too troubled when it was pointed out to him that it will be 999 days since Raheem Sterling, with two England goals in 40 appearances, last scored for his country.“We have a very difficult opponent – a very good side who we respect –and the level of the game is going up a notch,” Southgate said. “But we think we can cause opposing teams a lot of problems and that won’t change because we are in the knockout phase. We will continue to play in the style we have.“I want the players, more than anything, to continue to attack the tournament as we have. That shouldn’t change in the knockout stage and, if anything, we should feel freer.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc88a1006b34330d888ddc7d0b061d368b620123/110_48_2311_1386/master/2311.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8cff15842d8a01332cf38308d86d034","title":"gareth southgate way england colombia respected","story":"“I don’t know what team can afford to rest players,” Óscar Tabárez told a room full of reporters in Samara last week, the day before Uruguay’s final World Cup group game against Russia. Tabárez’s team had already made it to the last 16 and rumours had spread there would be major changes to his starting XI.In response he fell back on a familiar phrase. “We do not speculate,” Tabárez announced. It is a distinctly Uruguayan note of defiance, a reminder that this is the most fiercely competitive of\u0026nbspfootballing nations, notorious for\u0026nbspits warrior spirit, what Jorge Valdano referred to in these pages as\u0026nbspthe “Garra Charrúa” culture, named after the native tribe which, rather than offering to negotiate, killed and ate their European\u0026nbspinvaders.Resting players, going slow, soft‑pedalling a winnable game: Tabárez and Uruguay refused to contemplate this. Russia were duly dispatched 3-0, ignition for the subsequent defeat of Portugal in the\u0026nbsplast 16. France will provide powerful over-dog opposition on Friday. But Uruguay are ticking now, fired by the thrill of competition. This is a team where nobody sleeps until this tournament is done one way or another.And so on to England and a backstory that has swirled just out of sight around the deliciously well‑matched last-16 tie against Colombia at the Spartak Stadium on Tuesday night. In Gareth we trust. For now. Depending on how things turn out. But it is hard to avoid the sense of contrast here. England, it seems, do speculate at World Cups.With Spain dumped out of the draw by Russia on Sunday afternoon Southgate’s decision not to field his most powerful team in the final Group\u0026nbspG game has begun to look an ever more wildly polarised piece of tactical thinking.So much reasoning in sport is reverse-engineered out of results, which are in turn decided on the tiniest details. History is written, in gloating 10-point headlines, by the\u0026nbspwinners.But this is what Southgate is now facing. The danger is that the effects of a calculated gamble – and probably a wrong-headed one – will\u0026nbspnow be ramped up by subsequent results.Win against Colombia and Southgate will have shuttled England towards near-certain World\u0026nbspCup glory. Lose and England’s manager will be open to accusations of having tried, unsuccessfully, to juke the draw at a tournament and fallen short of the obligation to compete to the maximum in every game, another case in sport of an obvious strength – planning, thoroughness, “owning the situation” – becoming\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspflaw.The comparison might be made with 1950, when England’s selection committee left out Stanley Matthews against the amateurs of the USA in Belo Horizonte, saving their ace for tougher challenges in the later rounds, only to find themselves guilty of the kind of starchy British post-imperial arrogance to which only a slightly wooden Hollywood re-enactment can do justice.With this in mind it is probably a good idea to pack this away now. Southgate was either right or wrong to make eight changes in\u0026nbspKaliningrad.The dumb luck of being sunk by a defensive mistake on Tuesday night, or a fine performance from an opponent, should not change this.And probably there was a slight mis-step here, albeit one made out of good intentions. Judging by Southgate’s obiter dicta at his post‑match press conference it seems England were broadly convinced that the choice for the last\u0026nbsp16 would boil down to Senegal and Colombia. Colombia are ranked 16th in the world, Senegal 27th. Strong opponents both: better to face either one with a fresher first XI.So Southgate will have chosen his team for Belgium the day before the game. The players will have been told. Overnight in Kaliningrad the skies were filled with travelling agents turning up to see their charges make their World Cup bows.Except, two hours before kick‑off things changed. Japan had finished above Senegal in Group H. Suddenly there was a genuine choice. Winning Group\u0026nbspG would dish up a tie against opponents ranked 61 in the world, below Panama. Yes, the other half of the draw already looked easier beyond that stage. But given a straight choice and no preconceptions most England managers would take the Tabárez line. We do not speculate. We play to win.Southgate chose not to strengthen his team. Elements such as loyalty and balance and happiness in the group come into this. It was a measured call. It did not work out. But it will still hover round his shoulders, a blow ready to fall should England slip up in Moscow when they might have been in Rostov playing Japan.Whereas in reality this must all be balanced against a mass of positives on the other side. The comparison with Euro 2016 has been made, when England made six changes for the final group game against Slovakia in Saint-Etienne, drew 0-0, then played against Iceland like a team recently roused from cryogenic storage.But so far it is the contrast that stands out. By the time the Iceland game came round Wayne Rooney had already leaked to the press his anger at being dropped. Senior FA figures had made clear their unhappiness with the manager, his ever more distant hopes of a new\u0026nbspcontract.Compare and contrast the complete absence of leaks or noises off from within the Harry Kane industrial complex. Kane has five goals in two games. He wanted to play against Belgium\u0026nbspB, then Japan, then have a square go at Brazil.He did not want to be rested. His agent wants him to win the Golden Boot. But there has been no suggestion of public disappointment, of anything less than a functioning team at work. This in itself is progress.Plus, there is always another side. Uruguay do not speculate. But they have arrived at the quarter-finals without Edinson Cavani, their top scorer’s hamstring twanged against Portugal after he missed only one minute of the previous three World Cup games.Meanwhile Croatia did rest players for their final group stage match but played their worst game of the tournament against Denmark off the back of it.It is surely better to judge Southgate’s progress on more tangible evidence. And not on the whims, the fury, the fine details of Colombia in Moscow, a game that deserves to stand alone, and to be played out without looking back."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad1d3ed25c29f3523f2012d754f6d3753d55bc24/0_39_2057_1234/master/2057.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c96ae8dc6b67bd9093899e7da6bba5e","title":"marouane fellaini nacer chadli fringes belgium hazard flatters","story":"Marouane Fellaini and Nacer Chadli play bit-part roles at their clubs but proved their worth with goals to beat JapanHearts sank like lost shoes in a muddy field in Manchester when the news emerged last week. Derision, resignation, bafflement: United had a perfect opportunity to rid themselves of Marouane Fellaini but instead they gave him a new contract.If one listened to some of the wailing, it felt as if Fellaini was an irritating house guest, the sort who puts his shoes on the couch and takes bites out of the cheese. The time had come for him to move on but United not only invited him back in for a brew, they made him up a proper bed in the spare room.And then there is Nacer Chadli. It was, to say the least, an eyebrow‑raiser when he was even named in the Belgium squad for Russia: one had to look up where he was playing his club football and, as it turns out, it was still West Brom. Not that he had actually played much: he had spent virtually the whole season out injured, making his call-up even more baffling. This was not Brazil fretting on Neymar’s fitness: this was Nacer Chadli.And yet these two unwanted toys, discarded in the minds of many, were the men who saved Belgium. One could almost hear the snorts when they were introduced, proof that Roberto Martínez was a smooth‑talking snake-oil salesman, not a manager but a motivational speaker with some coaching badges. Fellaini and Chadli? Pah!Shows what we know. Or, it shows that football generally, and this World Cup specifically, is absolute chaos. Nothing can be predicted. Nothing can be planned for.This is a tournament where Russia look like potential champions and Germany are sulking at home for the first time since before the war. A tournament where Thomas Müller and Andrés Iniesta have been virtual irrelevances but Fellaini and Chadli are game-changers.Before the game the talk was about a more conventionally desirable player. On Sunday Eden Hazard was asked about the departure from the tournament of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo and what that might mean to him.It was framed as creating a vacancy for a tournament-defining star, a chance for Hazard to translate his frequent brilliance for Chelsea on to the international stage. “It’s time to shine,” he said, with a sort of dead-eyed certainty.He started as if that was his big aim, the juices flowing from the off. There was a driving run through the middle, a delicate flick with his right foot, a finger‑stinging shot with his left. He seemed more aggressive than usual: not in the tackle but in his movements. Fine skill combined with a point to prove.But as the game progressed he faded, though he did hit a post after Japan’s first goal. He might take it as an insult that Martínez went for the hammer and smashed the emergency glass, reaching for the sinewy tree that goes by the name Fellaini. Insult it might be, but it worked.Perhaps, if nothing else, this game might provide some succour to despairing United fans. Really, they should know what Fellaini is there for by now. He is an impact substitute, a creator of chaos to turn to when order and sound planning have not worked.Assuming he is used in these sorts of circumstance, as the plan\u0026nbspB muscle, he is a perfectly fine option – effective, ugly, not capable of elite football, not capable of much that is recognised as football at all, really, and yet someone who can change matches.Which is what he did here. Japan almost looked cocky in the minutes after they scored their second through Takashi Inui and then, when Fellaini and Chadli were introduced, it was as if they looked to the sidelines and thought: “Is that all they’ve got? This is in the bag, lads.”Well, it was not in the bag. It was very much out of the bag. Thanks to Marouane Fellaini and Nacer Chadli, Belgium’s golden generation live to fight another day. What a world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81c1d8c6ce36a3e096d3bef665d49f4a6156f37f/0_57_4579_2748/master/4579.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17db1afac11c7011b25ca3db5afef8dd","title":"wayne rooney dc united mls","story":"Wayne\u0026nbspRooney\u0026nbspinsists he has not moved to DC United to wind down his career and that he retains the hunger required to succeed in Major League Soccer.The 32-year-old has signed a three-and-a-half-year contract to leave Everton and conclude a decorated career in England.

A steady stream of students and families since then means there are estimated to be more than 40,000 Colombians living in the United Kingdom. The majority are based in the capital, with a large community also north of the river around Seven Sisters.Yet with several restaurants and bars including La Bodeguita – opened 12 years ago by Cali-born Diana Sach – situated around the much maligned shopping centre that was built in the 1960s, there is no doubt that “the Elephant” will be the place to watch the drama from Moscow unfold.“I will be getting here at 4.30 to make sure I can get a table,” says Pablo, a Colombian who moved to London in the 1970s. “We are all friends who have been coming for years. Many Colombian people live in different parts of London but like to come here because it is very exciting. It’s very important for the community.”Sach, having initially opened a kiosk selling traditional Colombian food in 1998, took the plunge when an Italian restaurant in the shopping centre vacated its premises and she and her two brothers moved in.“We were here 24 hours a day at the beginning and it was very hard work,” she says. “But it was great as we saw it gaining popularity. People now come from all over – if they have anything to celebrate, they come to us.”Recent regeneration of the area has resulted in plans to demolish the shopping centre, regularly described as one of London’s ugliest buildings, and there are fears that some independent businesses in the area could be forced out because of rising rents. The demolition has been delayed until 2019 but, despite the best efforts of Latin Elephant – a charity fighting on behalf of local traders – Sach admits she remains concerned over the future for her and the rest of the community.“We don’t know what is going to happen yet but we do know we want to carry on running a restaurant in Elephant and Castle,” she says. “La Bodeguita is my life but it is also a big part of so many other people’s lives here too.” visited La Bodeguita for Uruguay’s victory over Portugal in the last 16 on Saturday and there was no doubt whom patrons were supporting. Both of Edinson Cavani’s goals were greeted with loud cheers from supporters from Peru, Ecuador, Chile and, of course, Colombia. Around 400 are expected for Tuesday’s match, with confidence clearly running high after José Pekerman’s side recovered from losing their opening game to Japan.“I’m pretty sure we will win – we have a better team than England,” says Raul Alzate, who has lived in London for 25 years and whose nephew Steven Alzate plays for Brighton’s under-23s. “We’ve been in this country for a very long time, so I’m a bit torn actually. We usually support England as well! This time I have to support Colombia. It’s in my blood.”Much has been made of Southgate’s decision to field a weakened team in England’s final group stage match, with the defeat against Belgium ensuring they are now on the so-called “easier” side of the draw. They are third favourites with some bookmakers for the tournament after the elimination of Germany, Spain, Portugal and Argentina, although Raul insists Colombia will be no pushovers.“I can see it being a really good game,” he says. “But if England give them time on the ball, then they are in big trouble.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c67dc93e56d85d4ca94435aa6305576af8052c8/0_98_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8a6a88d86c5bb6b7249252eee165768","title":"world cup 2018 england v colombia switzerland v sweden buildup live","story":"Belgium’s spectacular win over Japan was certainly a performance for the ages. It was the first time a team had come from two goals down in a knockout match since Mexico 70, when West Germany avenged 1966 by beating Alf’s England in the quarter-final. That was a story told expertly by Simon Burnton in our World Cup Stunning Moments series. Apologies to anyone old enough to remember the pain of that particular defeat ... but otherwise, enjoy!It’s just as well Gareth rolled the dice, though. Because had England won Group G, we’d never have witnessed last night’s instant World Cup classic between a desperate Belgium team and a Japan side in full banzai mode. Stuart James was at the Rostov Arena to witness history.But should England be playing Colombia at all? Had they sent out a full-strength XI against Belgium, there’s a chance they’d have been paired with Japan last night instead. Here’s Barney Ronay’s expert take on Gareth’s Great Gamble.It promises to be quite the festival of football in Bermondsey tonight. Folk on the Kirby Estate have decorated the whole place in the cross of St George ... though there is a lone Colombian flag fluttering defiantly in the breeze.Hats off for that to Jorge Marmolejo (second right) and his family, enjoying some good-natured fun with their friends and neighbours. The World Cup, bringing us all together in peace, love and harmony. Also, any old excuse to post a picture of a cute puppy.Anyway, England. This evening against Colombia, they’ll be looking for their first win in the knockout stage of a World Cup since 2006. That’s when David Beckham scored the only goal against Ecuador in the last 16, setting up a quarter-final against Portugal, Luiz Felipe Scolari, Cristiano Ronaldo, all that. Here’s Kevin McCarra’s report of that game. Just 24 comments below the line for an England match! More innocent times, eh.There’s more on Sweden-Switzerland in the latest edition of World Cup Football Daily. Olof Lundh is your go-to guy for that Max Rushden and Barry Glendenning are on hand, as always, for just about everything else. Enjoy!Could Sweden win the whole thing? Well, laugh it up if you must, but they’ve already barged their way past Italy and Germany, and they are one of the World Cup’s great over-achievers. For a country with a population of just ten million, their record is nothing short of outstanding. They made the semis in 1938 and 1994, and the final pool in 1950. Best of all, they reached the final itself when hosting the tournament in 1958: here’s how the  reported their eventual 5-2 defeat to Brazil. And this is how a 17-year-old Pele saw it.Of course, they’re no Uruguay (pop: 3m). But then who is?Right. We’ll get onto the subject of England at some point, no doubt. But before their big game against Colombia this evening, Sweden take on Switzerland in St Petersburg. Our man Marcus Christenson runs the rule over a collective that has no stars, and may just be all the better for it.But first things first ... you have been keeping your wallchart up to date, haven’t you? If not, be about your business. Off to the fridge, or wherever you’ve pinned it up, with you. Let’s get up to speed, and then take things from there.Good morning, everyone. You’ve obviously heard there’s a match on today.One final email before I hand over to Scott Murray in London. “I think that people aren’t giving Neymar enough credit,” writes Kári Tulinius. “When he riles up opposition defenders they tend to lose their heads, creating opportunities for others. Yesterday’s opening goal was created because the entire Mexican defence was so focused on kicking Neymar that they forgot about Willian. When they panicked Neymar snuck round the back and stuck in Willian’s cross.” And with that thought deposited in your heads, I’ll bid you adieu, until tomorrow when we will have a final eight of the 2018 World Cup!On the scoresheet from the spot that night in Kiev was one Wayne Rooney (along with Steven Gerrard), who will be watching the Colombia game with interest from his new digs in Washington. When asked if he would be disappointed if England did go on and win it (they won’t), he dismissed the questions as “unfair”. You could label them plenty of other things too, to be fair. England and penalty shootouts – the unhappiest of bedfellows. The pair seem to be inextricably linked when it comes to the knockout stage of major tournaments, and more often than not, it ends badly for England. Of the eight shootouts England have been involved in, they’ve lost seven and won just one – at Euro 96 against Spain (they’d later go out to Germany on pens). The most recent came in the 2012 Euros quarter-finals against Italy, when Ashleys Cole and Young both missed. In case you needed a refresher:The goodbad news is that Young has put his hand up again, should it come to it (it will come to it). “Of course I’ll put my name forward,” he said. “I have the confidence in my ability to step up and take one. I’ll definitely be one to put my hand up. We’ve worked on them in practice and I have confidence in my ability to score more.”After today, the unthinkable – two whole days of no live football while we all prepare ourselves for the quarters, which start with Uruguay v France on Friday. The French seem to be finding le groove just at the right time, with Kylian Mbappé having announced himself on the world stage in the last-16 win over Argentina. But in Uruguay, they will be truly tested for the first time in Russia. More from Eric Devin here:Compare and contrast. The agony and ecstasy of the World Cup in two parts.Vidyanshu Mishra emails: “Wondering if Spain’s football chief’s decision to sack Julen Lopetegui was a good idea? How far you can expect a team to go if you change the manager just before tournament and appoint someone with far less experience and completely different tactics. For sure it conveyed the message that such unethical and disloyal behaviour by a manager will not be accepted but whether it was more important than performance of the team is a point that should be discussed.”This, by Sid Lowe, may contain some answers:From a Swedish dependance to an Australia one – that of outcome dependency. They may be long gone from the tournament, but the Socceroos’ failed campaign is still being dissected. Here, Ante Jukic expresses his fears that, despite the flaws highlighted in Russia, nothing will change once incoming coach Graham Arnold takes over the reins.So what of today’s second game: Sweden v Switzerland? ’s football editor Marcus Christensen is pretty well placed to run the rule over Sweden’s chances of reaching the last eight – it’s all about the collective, rather than the inidual, in this post-Zlatan world.“There are no stars (apart from maybe RB Leipzig’s Emil Forsberg) any more. The two forwards are Marcus Berg, who plays for Al Ain in the United Arab Emirates and Ola Toivonen, who doesn’t play for Toulouse. The key midfielder has been Sebastian Larsson, who was relegated with Sunderland in 2017 and spent last season with Hull City in the Championship (although he is suspended for the game against Switzerland).”Reckon you know who this lot are?Neymar aside, Brazil are beginning to look ominous as other players around him step up their game. Willian is rapidly becoming their strawberry cream, Philippe Coutinho the toffee penny, and Paulinho the vanilla fudge. Nick Ames started the chocolate analogy:“From the Seleção, a selection box of treats. While their rivals falter, beset by rusting parts and in some cases complete mechanical failure, Brazil roll on and their claim to a sixth World Cup now looks more persuasive than at any point in the past four years. The strut of champions-elect is returning and, as players and staff piled on after Roberto Firmino’s far-post tap-in, it did not take an outrageous leap to envisage similar scenes unfolding 13 days down the line when this often bewildering summer party finally winds down.”Sad news from Japan, where the psychic octopus who correctly predicted the nation’s first three World Cup matches has been killed and sent to the market to be sold as food.Anyway, enough of the hatchet job on Neymar. He’ll probably have the last laugh when he lifts the trophy in just under two weeks anyway. “That Belgium goal,” kicks off Daniel Stauss. “The breathtaking thing about that Belgium goal was how Lukaku opened up miles of space on the right for Meunier to run into while de Bruyne was bringing the ball upfield. He was a force of nature the Japanese defender was swept up in his path, the poor guy couldn’t help himself. By the time Lukaku wheeled off into the penalty area, he had completely bamboozled two defenders into closing on him. That run was one of the best off-the-ball offensive moves I’ve seen in a long time, and far and away the highlight of the tournament so far.”It was one of the best breakaway goals seen at a World Cup, for sure. It’s difficult to think of many better, but how about Salif Diao in Senegal v Denmark in 2002 and Ilie Dumitrescu for Romania against Argentina in 1994 for starters?Update: This had passed me by, for reasons that are perhaps understandable, but it appears Neymar actually has a real acting career. According to IMDB: “Neymar was born on February 5, 1992 in Mogi das Cruzes, São Paulo, Brazil as Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior. He is an actor and producer, known for xXx: Return of Xander Cage (2017), Above the Noise (2017) and Shakira Feat. Carlinhos Brown: La La La - Brazil 2014 (2014).” Speechless.“Morning Mike!” It’s actually mid-afternoon in my part of the world, but good morning to you, David Penney! “Did anyone else notice that Layún also stood on the linesman’s foot just as much as he did Neymar’s? I didn’t see the linesman flopping around like a beached fish. It’s instances like these that make football such a laughing stock to fans of other sports.”“You can’t even say Neymar is good at acting,” writes dubod22. “He makes Steven Seagal look like Marlon Brando.” The way the ref simply ignored his shenanigans perhaps proved his lack of acting prowess. Indeed, acting and footballers, with a few notable exceptions (Vinny Jones in Lock, Stock and Eric Cantona are two that spring to mind), should never mix. Juan Carlos Osorio, the Mexico coach, said of Neymar’s attempts to put himself in contention for an Oscar: “I think it’s a shame for football. We wasted a lot of time because of one player. We stopped too often. I think this is a very negative example for the world of football and all the children who are following this game. This is a strong sport, a man’s sport and I think there shouldn’t be so much acting.”The sentiment is, obviously, spot on, if not quite his assertion about football being a “man’s sport”. One can only assume he hasn’t watched a women’s game, in which there is usually little to any playacting, ing, writhing or rolling at all. If anything, Neymar, and other men of his ilk, should take a leaf out of those women’s books, in my opinion, and get up off the floor and just play football. OK, it’s time to talk Neymar. On my TV, they’ve just replayed his antics following the “stamp” on his foot, and I can’t keep quiet any more. What on earth was he thinking? Why the need for such playacting? He’s one of, if not the most, skilful player on the planet. He dances around players for fun. Beat teams with your talent, Junior, not some ridiculous B-grade acting. Of course I might be wrong, and it might have really, really, really hurt. But I’m sure you’ll forgive my scepticism.“Can we just say a big thank you to the Japanese team.” Yes we can, Jacob Vienna. “No time wasting, no dirty tricks, no fouling to break-up play, no overlong substitutions, no arguing with the ref, no rolling four times over for a fake foul, no clutching the back of the head after being hit in the back (some of these may or may not be based on actual incidents).. Japan played with pure sportsmanship. Thank you Japan.”Indeed, there has been a sense of serenity to Japan for the most part at this World Cup, both on and off the pitch. Which, rather ironically, couldn’t have been more far removed from the circumstances of their ultimate demise at the hands of Belgium, as Nick Miller writes:The last time England played Colombia at a World Cup, 20 years ago, Glenn Hoddle’s side prevailed 2-0, thanks to goals from Darren Anderton and David Beckham. Graeme Le Saux was in the lineup that day in Lens and the left-back remembers well coming face to face with the legend that was Carlos Valderama – and his hair.“The funny thing with Valderrama was he had loads of bracelets on. He literally jangled. Every time he received the ball you could hear him. It was like a sleigh because you could hear all his bangles jiggling about. Then his hair had its own sort of gravitational field, so you could sense him coming either by listening or feeling that his hair was somewhere in your vicinity.”Gold star for Ben Aitkenhead, who is first to wade into the James Rodríguez debate with both an email and a comment below the line. That’s the kind of coverage Denmark would be proud of. “Hard to overstate how important James is to this match,” Ben writes. “Imagine the angst if Kane was injured and doubtful. James is The Man for Colombia.” Pekerman is playing down his importance, but of course he has to do that, faced with the prospect of not having his star player to call on.First up, something from yesterday to warm the cockles of even the coldest of hearts. The World Cup will, on some levels, be a poorer place without them. And their fans, for that matter. I haven’t had a chance to listen to this yet, but the blurb says: “Max and co discuss Japan’s last-gasp exit, Brazil’s win, classic play-acting, scoring records, Swedish babies and Ricky Martin.”I have no idea how they get around to Ricky Martin, but such is the joy of the pod. Do yourselves a favour etc...Please, please don’t ever end, you gorgeous thing, 2018 World Cup. After yet more drama – pure, unfiltered, thrilling late drama in the case of Belgium’s game against Japan – we are now just two matches away from a complete quarter-final lineup in what is well on its way to becoming a classic tournament. And the good news is that there is potential for more thrills and spills later today, if you can possibly take any more, with the evenly-matched Sweden and Switzerland vying in Saint Petersburg for a spot in the last eight.What’s that? Oh yes, England are playing Colombia too. But that’s almost certainly not going to be an incident-filled, heart-wrenching banger of a match, one that definitely won’t end in an agonising penalty shootout defeat for Gareth Southgate’s brave Lions and won’t be swiftly followed by industrial-sized vats of tears, a poor unfortunate pariah and the inevitable period of mourning and soul searching and a national inquest. No siree, nothing much to see at Moscow’s Spartak Stadium later on.I’m here for the next few hours to help dissect Belgium’s incredible come-from-behind win over Japan and Brazil’s victory against Mexico, which included an eye-catching performance from Neymar – and no small amount of skill from him on the actual pitch. We’ll also have a look ahead to THE BIG ONE later on. And, perhaps, Colombia v England.Throughout the course of the dayeveningwhatever it is where you are, please do feel free to get in touch on email (mike.hytner@the) or Twitter (@mike_hytner) or below the line.

During these summer weeks, I buy a bag most days. They’re almost always best eaten straight out of the bag, but there are a few recipes where cooked cherries rival fresh. One is this cherry cobbler, an intensely sweet-sour party between cherry and its best friend, almond. The other is a cherry salad, the fruit quickly pickled and roasted, popping against the salad leaves and buttermilk dressing.I make this in peak cherry season, when they are most affordable. At other times of the year, you could use some cheaper frozen cherries, or even some pitted and roughly chopped red plums in place of half the cherries.1kg cherries, pitted1 tbsp amaretto or frangelico (optional)Seeds from 1 vanilla pod or 1 tsp vanilla paste2-4 tbsp honeyZest of 1 unwaxed lemonFor the topping60g almonds, skin on125g white spelt flour1 tsp baking powder50g raw cane sugar or demerara sugar100g unsalted butter, chilled1 pinch flaky sea saltTo serveCreme fraiche, yoghurt or ice-creamHeat the oven to 240C465Fgas 9. First, make the topping. Blitz the almonds in a food processor until they resemble fine breadcrumbs, then add the flour, baking powder and sugar and pulse a couple of times to combine. Cut the butter into cubes and add to the food processor with the salt. Blitz again, until the mixture resembles rough breadcrumbs. Add a tablespoon of water and pulse again until it comes together into a firm dough.Put the cherries, liqueur (if using) and vanilla into a bowl and mix to combine. Grease a 20cm baking dish, and spoon in the cherries, to cover the bottom of the dish. Drizzle over the honey and use a tablespoon to dollop the dough on top, leaving gaps for the juices to bubble through.Bake for 20-25 minutes, until the topping has risen and is a deep gold. Top with a few more toasted almonds, if you like, and serve with creme fraiche and a swirl of honey or some ice-cream.I use red-tipped little gems here, but butterhead, oakleaf, lollo rosso and frisée would also work. If you can’t find buttermilk, use yoghurt thinned with a splash of milk for the dressing. Some goat’s cheese or goat’s curd would be a nice addition, too.For the salad200g cherries, pitted and halvedA few sprigs thyme, leaves pickedZest and juice of 1 unwaxed lemon2 tbsp red-wine vinegarOlive oilSalt and black pepper4 slices good bread4 little gem lettucesFor the dressing125ml buttermilk or thinned yoghurt (see note)1 tsp runny honey2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oilHeat the oven to 200C390Fgas 6. Lay the halved cherries on a baking tray, scatter with the thyme and grate over the lemon zest. Drizzle with the vinegar, then with the oil, and season with salt and pepper. Toss the lot together and roast for 15-20 minutes.Tear the bread into chunks, put on another baking tray and season well. Drizzle generously with olive oil, then put in the oven for the last 15 minutes with the cherries. When time is up, the cherries should have darkened a little, their flavour intensified, and the bread should be crisp on the outside, chewy in the middle and deeply golden.To make the dressing, whisk all the ingredients in a jug, or shake in a tightly sealed jar, taste and season.Wash, dry and quarter the lettuces and scatter them on a plate. Once the cherries have cooled a little, scatter them over the lettuce and bread, and drizzle generously with the dressing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89ed721fbc1f3326b141ad98bca3bc6bd3b756c3/0_442_2048_1228/master/2048.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a47e4bff510a49d07eed0848a477a6f","title":"ba double payment website refund","story":"I was forced to pay twice due to a website error, and I’ve been told a refund will take six weeksAt the beginning of June I used the BA website to book £2,000 worth of flights, but received an email the next day asking me to contact customer services as “something” had gone wrong with the booking.When I called I was told that the e-tickets had not been issued as the payment had not gone through.

It called on ministers to consider remedies such as ending the benefit freeze in place since 2015 and to raise the universal credit work allowance.Despite an inflation-beating increase for the national minimum wage earlier this year – having risen from £7.50 to £7.83 per hour in April – analysis compiled by the Centre for Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University on behalf of the JRF showed families were still falling behind.The report said a single person needed to earn £18,400 a year to reach the minimum income standard, which is a measure of income people need in order to reach a minimum socially acceptable standard of living in the UK, from £17,900 when the requirement was last calculated a year ago. A dual-earner couple with two children needed to earn £20,000 each, while a lone parent with a preschool child had to earn £28,450 – an increase of £2,500 on the previous year.Although the Institute for Fiscal Studies finds middle-class households have fared best in the decade since the financial crisis in a recent study, it found people at the top and the bottom had suffered weaker income growth. According to the JRF, a lone parent working full-time on the minimum wage in 2008 – with help from tax credits introduced under Labour – had a disposable income just £520 a year short of their needs. Following almost a decade of tax credit cuts under Conservative-led governments, people in this situation are about £3,640 a year short.

To our amazement it got to No 8’We were a studio team working with Trevor Horn, producing records like ABC’s Lexicon of Love and Malcolm McLaren’s Duck Rock. But we started playing together in our own time. Trevor had got a new synthesiser from Australia, a Fairlight, which fascinated us. It made it relatively easy to put in a sample of, say, a dog barking, and then play it in different pitches.We wrote a piece of music with lots of different sections and samples. There was a neighbour’s VW Golf stalling, and group members Gary Langan and JJ Jeczalik saying “urgh” , and “money”, which we played backwards. Gary set about editing it all. This was back in the day when you had to literally slice tape with a razor blade. We ended up with something quite quirky but we certainly didn’t think it had legs as a single. To our amazement, it got to No 8.I never wanted to be a pop star. None of us did. We wanted to be anonymous, and if we’d had our own way we’d never have done any TV appearances, but once the ball starts rolling you have to go with it. Top of the Pops was one of the worst experiences of my life. We’d done so many edits of the single I wasn’t even sure what its final structure was. We just stood there behind three keyboards. The director saved our bacon by cutting away to the animated video the record company had commissioned – they hadn’t liked the original one made by Zbigniew Rybczyński, featuring a punkette girl and three blokes in tails dismantling musical instruments with a chainsaw. It was the polar opposite of Duran Duran on a luxury yacht. No one knew how to take us. We were described as techno boffins whereas we had a free-ranging jazz sensibility. Steve Reich and Philip Glass were an influence and we loved the absurdist ideas of John Cage. We didn’t have any pretensions to be doing anything other than exploring interesting sounds and trying to have fun. Close (to the Edit)’s working title was Close to the Edge. We created the music through editing, and so changed the title. Being perverse and provocative I put the brackets in. JJ and Gary would sample whatever was lying around – it all became part of the musical collage. This was before people understood about rights and permissions. For years, every time the phone rang Trevor would freeze, convinced it was someone calling to sue him because we’d sampled them illegally.People didn’t know where we had come from. We were often labelled radical underground dance artists. We even got an award in the US for best black act of 1984. I think I made my excuses. We should have sent the masks to pick it up.A group that made their music in an abstract, mysterious way shouldn’t have been seen actually playing, but we were required to look like a group for TV appearances. We weren’t allowed to have just dancing masks for Channel 4’s The Tube, so we ordered clown suits that were several sizes too small. I did an interview with Jools Holland that consisted of large amounts of silence.I wanted us to be part of a wider musical story. I think we achieved that, as well as anticipating so many things. Daft Punk and Gorillaz have realised our ideas of anonymity and animated performers more fully, and I love to say that we’re the third most sampled group of all time. The proudest for me was the Prodigy on Firestarter. They wanted our “Hey”, the one on Close (to the Edit) – no other would do. The royalties kept me in coffees for many years.• Anne Dudley Plays the Art of Noise is on Island Records.

May, promising to publish the long-awaited Brexit white paper next week, said it would include “proposals relating to customs and Northern Ireland”.It is designed to replace the discredited customs partnership model that was favoured by May and the maximum facilitation model preferred by the Brexiters and the majority of her inner cabinet, both of which had been rejected by the European Union as unworkable.But there were complaints about the lack of detail, with some senior cabinet members saying they were not aware of what was contained in fresh proposals, while Number 10 would not be drawn on who had been involved in its development.Details would be unveiled for the full cabinet to sign off at Chequers on Friday, although there were early indications it would not involve the UK signing up to the EU’s system of common external tariff for goods in a revamped maximum facilitation proposal as some Brexiters had feared.Jeremy Corbyn sought to play up Tory isions on the UK’s post Brexit future in the Commons. Speaking in a debate about last week’s European council meeting, the Labour leader said he “looked forward to the much vaunted third way on customs that the prime minister hopes will unite her cabinet, because the current chaos at the heart of government leaves us facing crucial unanswered questions”.May responded with an emotional appeal for party unity at a ball for party donors in London. Describing the stakes as high, the prime minister said: “We each have a choice to make. Will we come together and stand together as a party, as a government and as a country?“Will we find the boldness, the courage and the discipline to unite as one for the good of our nation and fellow citizens? Or will we be ided and allow the scale of the challenge, the complexity of the questions to overwhelm us?”The prime minister will travel to see Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, on Tuesday and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, on Thursday. Number 10 insisted that neither leader would get an advance briefing on the customs proposal that is intended to break the political deadlock in the Tory party.Meanwhile, the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, was forced to leap to the defence of leading Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg, after the MP for North East Somerset was criticised by party colleagues for warning that May risked splitting her party as Sir Robert Peel did when he forced through the repeal of the corn laws in 1846.As May’s statement to the Commons was concluding, Johnson tweeted: “It’s vital that all MPs are able to air their views on Brexit. Whatever your position, I hope we can all agree that Jacob Rees-Mogg is a principled and dedicated MP who wants the best for our country.”Earlier, two Foreign Office ministers, Alistair Burt and Alan Duncan, publicly rebuked Rees-Mogg. Duncan accused him of “insolence” and said his “lecturing and threatening the PM is just too much”, adding: “The ideological right are a minority despite their noise and should pipe down.”Burt accused Rees-Mogg of being part of an “ideological clique” in a tweet after the article was published. “Just tired of this endless threat and counter-threat,” he wrote. “Why don’t we want the best for the UK than for our own ideological cliques? And there are others in this negotiation as far as I’m aware?”Rees-Mogg, who chairs the European Research Group (ERG) of pro-Brexit Tory MPs, writing in the , said: “Theresa May must stand firm for what she herself has promised. One former Tory leader, Sir Robert Peel, decided to break his manifesto pledge and passed legislation with the majority of his party voting the other way.Nicky Morgan, a former education secretary, urged May not to listen to the “arbitrary red lines” of Brexiters like Rees-Mogg. Speaking in the Commons, to complaints from her own benches, Morgan called on the prime minister to “find a pragmatic, sensible and flexible Brexit which delivers on the referendum result of two years ago but protects businesses and jobs and the economy and entrepreneurs, otherwise we will not be thanked for the mess that we end up in”.Cabinet ministers intend to turn on the charm to justify their post-Brexit strategy, with David Davis, the Brexit secretary, organising a summit for business leaders at Chevening House on 20 July, the week after the white paper is published.It comes after Johnson had reportedly said “fuck business” at a reception in response to corporate concerns about the lack of clarity emerging from the British government, and a desire by business for a soft Brexit deal that would as far as possible replicate the UK’s existing trading relations with the EU.The invitation from Davis said that the idea was to “to use this opportunity to assemble another group of business leaders from across the economy, including some new voices who were unable to join us last time, to continue the dialogue”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e96fc3f681b299a164cce78a58cfb29ded8be065/0_132_2976_1786/master/2976.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82eda57e7d4a771d71d8dd65e00c23c0","title":"business brexit city bcc government uk","story":"BCC tells government to stop ‘squabbling’ as PBSC says it needs assurances on travelBritish businesses have issued Theresa May with a list of Brexit demands after warning firms are losing patience over the lack of progress in talks with the EU.A group of Britain’s leading professional and business services firms has written to the prime minister with a list of requirements they say are essential to preserve the £188bn industry with its 4.6m jobs and “keep the wheels of the British economy turning”.The 42 signatories from the Professional and Business Services Council (PBSC) – which represents law, accountancy, architecture, surveying and advertising firms – said they needed a number of assurances, including that they will still be able to recruit the best talent from overseas.“The UK needs to get the right deal on professional and other services given our relative strengths and current competitive position,” the business leaders wrote.The letter praised a speech by Greg Clark – one that raised the hackles of cabinet Brexiters – in which the business secretary warned that restricting the ability of British workers to travel within the EU could be as dangerous to the economy as a hard trade border.The intervention comes after a chaotic day in Westminster on which Downing Street sources briefed that ministers would be asked to consider a new “third way” on post-Brexit customs arrangements that would differ from the two proposed by the prime minister thus far.Ministers have dismissed as unworkable May’s preferred customs partnership option and the Brexiters’ preferred solution – the “maximum facilitation” model where technology would be used to monitor cross-border trade.Cabinet ministers appeared on Monday to be in the dark as to what the new model would be. No 10 would not supply details ahead of Friday’s Chequers awayday with some cabinet members complaining they had not seen it.May made an emotional appeal for party unity at a speech at the Conservatives’ summer ball on Monday evening.“Will we find the boldness, the courage and the discipline to unite as one for the good of our nation and fellow citizens?” she said. “Or will we be ided and allow the scale of the challenge, the complexity of the questions to overwhelm us?” The British Chamber of Commerce (BCC) has told politicians to stop “squabbling” and put Britain’s economic interests first by reaching agreement at Chequers on Friday. It said time was running out before the 29 March 2019 Brexit date and business patience was “reaching breaking point”.The BCC said the government had made “limited progress” on only two of the 23 issues where clarity was urgently needed so firms can plan their trade following the UK’s departure from the EU. The lobby group said while some assurances had been received on the future status of EU nationals, and the industrial standards regime, urgent questions needed to be answered on subjects including VAT, tariffs, customs and regulation.Over the past fortnight, warnings from firms including Airbus and BMW about the impact of Brexit on jobs and trade were dismissed by Cabinet ministers including Jeremy Hunt and Liam Fox, while Boris Johnson reportedly said “fuck business” when asked about industry concerns.The PBSC called for mutual recognition of professional qualifications and regulatory frameworks after Brexit. It also wants assurances that employees in the sector will be able to fly in and out of EU countries to provide advice and trade across Europe."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5b2c98fb69e68a26019e94333b57c34065e8941/544_1484_3936_2362/master/3936.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78ec7e597aaa6e0c70b9ccfa1a69b336","title":"ed miliband return stand in host jeremy vine show bbc radio 2","story":"Former Labour leader will once again be stand-in presenter of the Jeremy Vine showEd Miliband is to return as a stand-in host of BBC Radio 2’s Jeremy Vine show, as part of his continued push into the world of broadcasting.The former Labour leader also hosts a successful podcast called Reasons to be Cheerful with the former Absolute Radio presenter Geoff Lloyd.His stint as the show’s host last summer was notable for a discussion of lavatories in which the Doncaster North MP asked: “Do you have a vintage toilet you’d be willing to flush live on air?”He also interviewed his brother, David Miliband, with whom he fought it out for the Labour leadership, about refugees.Miliband has transformed his image since losing the 2015 general election, and is now known for his witty Twitter put-downs and miming to Take on Me by A-ha while eating a bacon sandwich on the late-night talk show The Last Leg. “I’m very flattered to have been asked back to present Radio 2’s Jeremy Vine show,” Miliband said. “My death metal career has really taken off since my performance with Napalm Death on the show last year, but I wanted to give something back to the place where it all began.”Miliband will host the programme for three days from Monday 9 July before handing over to the former Conservative leader Michael Howard. Howard, who was once asked the same question at least 12 times by Jeremy Paxman on Newsnight, said he was looking forward to the chance to turn the tables. “As a young man I was offered the opportunity of becoming a disc jockey in the United States, which I regret to say I turned down. Now at last I can fulfil that ambition, as well as seeing what it’s like to be the journalist who forces politicians to answer the questions,” he said.The Jeremy Vine show is the biggest current affairs programme on the BBC and attracts a weekly audience of 7.4 million listeners to its midday-2pm slot.Jeremy Vine recently agreed to take a pay cut to remain the show’s host, but has signed up as the new presenter of Channel 5’s The Wright Stuff, which will necessitate a daily cross-London dash.Phil Jones, the Jeremy Vine show’s editor, said: “Political coverage is the bedrock of the programme and this is a sign of how important politics is to BBC Radio 2, especially at such a key time in the nation’s history.“Each day we will cover the big stories that affect our listeners, and continue to inform, educate and entertain the Radio 2 audience.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa0fcef8f0945eab73876efd84d3a17c905779ea/0_101_5074_3044/master/5074.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ac4a95ad9aaf29f104356fcf6dd7eb1","title":"ivf add on shown to be of no benefit scientists find","story":"£350 procedure known as an endometrial scratch does not help embryos implant, according to large-scale studyA procedure thought to boost chance of a successful pregnancy for women undergoing IVF has been dealt a blow by research that reveals it does not improve the chances of having a live birth.An endometrial scratch involves grazing the tissue lining the womb, as occurs when taking a tissue biopsy, in a process that takes about a minute and is similar to a smear test – but more painful and invasive.Several studies have previously suggested it might offer a benefit in IVF, among them a 2016 study found that while many expensive IVF “add ons” had a dearth of evidence behind them, the endometrial scratch did at least appear to improve the rate of live births. It has been suggested the inflammation triggered by the scratch might help embryos to implant. Many private fertility centres, including those in the UK, currently offer the procedure with costs reaching as high as £350, although it is not routinely offered on the NHS. But the new research, the most comprehensive study to date, found that the scratch makes no difference to the chances of women undergoing IVF having a live birth.With the endometrial scratch previously thought to be helpful for women whose embryos fail to implant, the team also looked specifically at women who were known to have had two or more embryos transferred but did not become pregnant. Again, no benefit was seen.The team also failed to find a benefit when they considered other differences, such as whether the IVF procedure involved fresh or frozen embryos.However they say women found the endometrial scratch uncomfortable. In addition, five women experienced excessive pain and two had excessive bleeding.Cindy Farquhar, postgraduate professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at the University of Auckland and senior author of the research, told the  clinics should stop offering women endometrial scratches.“I think it is unreasonable for clinics to ask for patients to pay for something when there is now clear evidence that there is no added benefit,” she said. “I would hope that it will disappear from the list of add-ons that many clinics have both in the UK and in New Zealand and Australia.”Stuart Lavery, a consultant gynaecologist at Hammersmith Hospital who was not involved in the study, said women who have recurrent implantation failure are hard to treat. “This mini-trauma offered a real potentially exciting way forward and it has become very widely adopted in international practice and in UK practice,” he said. “Now somebody has been brave enough to do a large randomised control trail and shown it has no benefit.”Nick Macklon, medical director at London Women’s Clinic, said in light of the new study endometrial scratching had probably been overused. But he said it is too soon to write off the procedure, adding that work is needed to explore whether it might still hold benefits for some women.“There are different causes of implantation failure: it could be the embryo, it could be the uterus,” he said. “What we need to establish is: in these women is there a uterine problem, and is that problem something that could be treated with this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/269c9486a2bbf73c8d3937236a78f0bef3536b1c/29_58_4830_2898/master/4830.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8156457e9d90e2b98d2c9d64e654552","title":"cameron norrie laim broady britains lack of depth","story":"Then there were two and that it was Aljaz Bedene, back representing Slovenia, who has left the British men’s ranks so depleted is an irony lost on few. Indeed, though he does not compete for Great Britain any more, he revealed the England football captain, Harry Kane, played a role in his first-round victory against Cameron Norrie.This time last year Bedene was celebrating a five-set win against Ivo Karlovic that ignited the home crowd 12 months on and his four-set victory against Norrie has left British hopes reliant on Kyle Edmund and the teenage wildcard Jay Clarke. Andy Murray’s 11th-hour withdrawal has highlighted how fragile the supporting cast is.Bedene used to be among that number but, not permitted to represent Great Britain in the Davis Cup, having previously done so for Slovenia, he switched back after three and a half years competing under the union flag. This victory must have been all the sweeter then against Norrie, born in South Africa to British parents, raised in New Zealand and college trained in the United States.“Against Tunisia he was pulled down and he stayed calm. I would freak out, because it was an important moment. I kept calm, which was good, although it wasn’t easy, because most of the things went against me.”Norrie certainly had his moments, indeed he took the first set, but ultimately on his second Wimbledon he came up short. Bedene was competing for a sixth time here and perhaps that was the decisive factor – he won two tie-breaks in the third and fourth set, showing a touch more composure at the crucial points of an absorbing match, clinching a 4-6, 7-6 (4), 7-6 (4), 6-4 victory. Nonetheless Norrie turned professional only 14 months ago and to qualify outright, rather than rely on a wildcard, suggests a bright future.“I handled the occasion a lot better than I did last year and I’ve grown a lot over the last year as a player but he just played more clutch than me in both tie-breaks,” Norrie said.All is not entirely lost for Great Britain and Edmund, seeded 21st, is expected to beat the Australian qualifier Alex Bolt comfortably on Tuesday but defeat would leave Great Britain’s men’s contingent staring down the barrel of failing to get anyone beyond the first round for the first time in the open era.Liam Broady, another wildcard, was the other Briton to bow out on Monday, competitive for the opening set against the 2016 finalist, Milos Raonic, but ultimately blown away by the big-serving Canadian, going down 7-5, 6-0, 6-1. As he pointed out afterwards, the British ranks would be strengthened were Dan Evans in attendance but Broady stopped short of questioning the decision not to give Evans a wildcard, having returned from his one-year drugs ban in April. “Dan is a fantastic grass court player, he’s a fantastic tennis player full stop and he’s beautiful to watch on the court,” Broady said. “But the All England made their decisions for obvious reasons. I think Dan understands that as well as anybody.”Considering Broady is ranked 173rd in the world, there is little shame in losing to the 13th seed, even if Raonic won 13 of the last 12 games. If the 24-year-old was competitive in the opening set, eventually losing serve at 5-6 down with two consecutive backhands into the net, here was an illustration of the work that needs to be done to qualify on merit, citing Norrie as the example to follow.“I’m hoping to get to the place that Cam’s in now,” Broady said. “He did a great job of it. It took him less than a year to get into the top 100. It definitely gives me heart to know that type of player can do really well.”Norrie undoubtedly did so in a tight first set, edging it 6-4 but he lost a second in which he broke back twice in a tie-break. The third went the distance again but when a Norrie doubt fault ensured it went the way of Bedene, the Briton was always facing an uphill battle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a16e91ca58a8b80bae848b8cd37b4a1c20a1840c/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03a5eb8ba5e19591943f7c7ebf97b4a6","title":"froome slow process lack detail annoy organisers experts","story":"The verdict fell suddenly in the nine‑month saga of Chris Froome’s adverse analytical finding for Salbutamol. Most notably it wrongfooted the Tour\u0026nbspde\u0026nbspFrance organisers, who were expecting a court hearing on Tuesday morning to resolve their attempt, dating back three weeks, to refuse Froome entry to their race on the grounds that with the outcome in abeyance his presence would be damaging for the image of their race.That attempt was rendered irrelevant immediately on Monday morning when a statement from the UCI cleared Froome of any wrongdoing. Crucially, given the length of time the process had taken, there were no hints of a possible appeal. There were also, however, few details from the governing body an explanation came from the World Anti-Doping Agency, which – the UCI made clear – had been involved from relatively early in the proceedings.The Wada statement said, in essence, that Froome had demonstrated the levels of Salbutamol found in his urine samples varied widely enough for the finding to be within a certain margin of error (“demonstrated within‑subject variability in the excretion of Salbutamol”) and that he had been ill and had upped his dosage. It also accepted that in his case a comparative study was not possible because it was impossible to replicate the conditions how the sample had been taken. Crucially, the statement concluded “the sample result is not inconsistent with an ingestion of Salbutamol within the permitted maximum inhaled dose”, mentioning also that there had been “chronic use of Salbutamol at varying doses over the course of weeks of high intensity competition”.The verdict left Froome in the clear to attempt a record-equalling fifth victory in the Tour de France, a double of Giro d’Italia and Tour de France in the same season, and a “quat-trick” of four grand tour victories in a row: Tour and Vuelta 2017, Giro and Tour 2018. Critically, it fell before the start of the Tour de France, eliminating that court case between Froome and the organisers and removing any potential ambiguity over the results of the 2018 Tour. Fans would be able to watch him racing in the knowledge that the case was no longer pending.The Tour director, Christian Prudhomme, was – understandably – frustrated at the way events had left his organisation with egg on its face and he bemoaned the length of time the proceedings had taken. “Above all, it’s a pity that we have had to wait for months, because the lack of answers in all this time has obviously given rise to indecision, doubt and thus to suspicion. That’s where we have ended up.”The one thing lacking in the verdict was a detailed exposition of the nuts and bolts of Froome’s defence, although the cyclist told Sky News that he would be making information public in the next few days. The lack of detail was bemoaned by one anti-doping expert Robin Parisotto, speaking to cyclingnews, said he felt it detracted from the verdict. “It’s now about having full access to the reasoned decision as it’s hard to comment without it,” said Parisotto, a former member of the UCI’s Biological Passport programme. “This is a case where they need to release the report in order to silence the agitators. I’m bamboozled to be honest.”The Froome ruling raised other questions, most notably whether it had established a precedent for further Salbutamol cases. Wada rules – as quoted in the organisations statement on the Froome case – specify that if Salbutamol is found over a certain threshold it “is presumed not to be an intended therapeutic use of the substance and will be considered as an AAF unless the athlete proves, through a controlled pharmacokinetic study, that the abnormal result was the consequence of the use of the therapeutic dose (by inhalation) up to the maximum dose indicated above”.The Froome ruling appears to have departed from that particular part of the rule, because a key factor in the case was the fact that the study could not be carried out in a way that replicated those in which the sample was taken. That will most likely be claimed to apply in other cases. The question of where it left the threshold for Salbutamol was also hanging perhaps Salbutamol would go the way of caffeine, where it proved impossible to regulate the substance by working with a permitted threshold and it was eventually legalised to avoid\u0026nbspconfusion."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7729cc6ad8ddff670046684f8434208447a45fe8/0_123_1991_1195/master/1991.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a87f81224f5022109ed786390e02fd3","title":"hoverboards why they havent got off to a mcflying start","story":"The gadgets inspired by Back to the Future Part II’s floating skateboards have failed to deliverWe could start by saying “they” didn’t promise us hoverboards.

One alarming effort by Airboard originally claimed to be a genuine hoverboard but turned out to be a personal hovercraft, looking more like an industrial floor scrubber you can ride. Essentially a floaty scooter, its noisy internal combustion engine allows it to bob about menacingly on a cushion of air, with a drive wheel on the ground to steer it. Looks fun but it doesn’t hover, isn’t a board, and people just don’t want to be seen on a giant lawnmower. If our hoverboard uses maglev – and we have a few examples of those – it inconveniently requires superconductors, cooled with liquid nitrogen to around -135C. Naturally, it also requires a magnetic surface. But they do look the part. First up, California-based company Arx Pax’s Hendo hoverboard. Watching the demo, it feels ostensibly close to that skateboard ideal – it looks a riot to ride, with whooping trialists gleefully floating about 15cm above the floor. But on closer inspection, it screeches like a defective train and is so hard to control even professional skateboarder Tony Hawk spins like a top until he is flung off. And unfortunately the battery lasts just a few minutes. And $10,000 (£7,500) a pop? Next! But what if this tech were extended to an entire skatepark, as carmaker Lexus has done with its Slide hoverboard? Perhaps the closest example yet to Marty’s machine, this gadget houses a liquid nitrogen-cooled superconductor to float above a hidden magnetic track. It keeps the board in place using “quantum locking” – a property of type 2 superconductors that overcomes the tendency of magnets to wobble off and repel each other, using a sort of magnetic, sticky “vortex”. Slide certainly brings us a mite closer to Marty – it looks the part, glides quietly – but there’s no getting away from the fact that, as with any maglev, it needs a special surface. It might be well hidden but there’s still a magnetic track under that skatepark. And that won’t satiate a public hungry for Marty McFly kicks. What about conventional thrust propulsion? The US company ArcaSpace comes admirably close to the ideal with its ArcaBoard. It’s capable of hovering a foot in the air, by dint of its 36 electric propellers generating 200kg of lift controlled by onboard balancing tech to help stabilise it. You can even control it using an app on your smartphone, which is neat. You might only be able to catch some sweet air on this for three minutes, but it’s surely a great start. The drawback – ah, there’s always a drawback – is that there’s no disguising the fact that it looks like a mattress with fans on it. It hardly radiates skateboard chic, and many may balk at forking out $15,000 for a flying carpet. And there doesn’t seem to be much evidence that the rider can control it. What’s the point of a skateboard you can’t do sick tricks on?Then you’ve got flyboards. These are not so much floaty skateboards as flying platforms. The best known example is perhaps Franky Zapata’s jet-propelled Flyboard Air, which evolved from an earlier invention, those funky-looking water-jetpack gizmos also called flyboards – you may have seen beautiful people enjoying them on YouTube. The Flyboard Air is a jet-powered “personal aerial vehicle” capable of vertical takeoff and landing, and can fly at a height of 150 metres at 87mph. While it has obvious emergency and military applications, it was designed to be flown safely, sans licence, by almost anyone who takes a shine to it. A flight lasts 12 minutes but Zapata anticipates longer trips in the future.Canadian inventor Alexander Duru’s Omni Hoverboard is a similar contrivance, which uses fans to create the requisite thrust. It’s essentially a large, rideable drone – think giant desk fan with bootstraps. Its first iteration wormed its way into the Guinness World Records book in the rather uncrowded category of longest hoverboard flight – 276 minutes – and the firm is working on a consumer version.Both of these, like many of the drone-derived technologies arriving on the scene, look great fun – even practical – but the nagging problem is … they aren’t skateboards. Last but definitely least, are those upright, dweeby, hands-free Segways marketed as “hoverboards” by Swegways, Airwheels and so on, readily available at any Argos. On any given day, one might see poseurs trundling along the pavement on them, upsetting dogs. These may be fun, but the main sticking points here are that: (a) they aren’t boards and (b) they don’t hover. And they have even been known to set your feet on fire. What a let-down. McFly would have spat out his cornflakes. Surely the real test of a genuine hoverboard is, can you do a sweet flipkick on it? If the answer is no, it won’t do. Back to the Future? More like back to the drawing board."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea4e2ca5dc943aa0b2715197019ba4fc1c721525/0_25_2418_1451/master/2418.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17d93aeec221c63779dda8ce6500b376","title":"10 best lesser known lidos open air swimming pools readers favourites","story":"Our recent feature on UK lidos prompted so many readers to share their favourite outdoor pools that we’ve created a follow-up list based on some of the suggestionsThis is such a handsome pool it’s little wonder adam hayton described it as “definitely one of the best”.

There is also a play area, a good mix of shade and open sun for those who like to bask on a sun lounger, and a kiosk serving a surprisingly wide range of hot and cold food. The traditional poolside changing cubicles are supplemented by recently upgraded modern facilities. This is a pretty pool in a pretty spot – and one could easily fall in love with it.• beccleslidoJulie Adams and Colinowl both raved about this “brilliant” pool, which sits right on the beach and is one of the most northerly in the UK. It offers the unusual opportunity of a bracing dip in the sea followed by scampering across the road in your togs then sinking into the warm embrace of the heated, filtered seawater. The pool has plenty of vintage charm and the yellow colour scheme brightens up even the dullest of British summer days. It is also a first-class example of what can be achieved when a community group works closely with a local authority to save and sustain a community asset like this. The super-fast metal water slide and excellent cheesy chips at the smart little cafe are the cherries on a very fine cake.• stonehavenopenairpoolBathurst is a riot of colour, from the bright and cheerful murals that smarten up the otherwise austere brick walls to the vibrant sunshades that fly like flags over the picnic area.

Kimmi851 put in a bid for the baths’ recognition and it’s impossible to disagree. The large pool is cleverly ided to accommodate swimmers, paddlers, a giant inflatable obstacle course and other activities beside. And you only pay for what you want to do, so it’s very good value. The sun loungers and wide range of ice-cream flavours will please less energetic bathers.• lymingtonseawaterbaths.org.ukStrand delivers the wow factor the minute you step through the turnstiles. 24beforemylove recommends this Medway marvel, and quite rightly too. The gleaming white pool surrounds are accented with the brightly coloured bridges, walkways and big pink elephant slides that are a hallmark of this pool. The young, and young at heart, will enjoy zipping down the elephants trunk into the filtered and treated river water below. The freeform pool has a rectangular tank at its heart, which keeps serious swimmers happy, and the whole thing is encircled by the largest lazy river at a UK lido. • strandpool.infoFondly known as Wivey Pool by FiGreen and other lovers of this rural gem, this is a community-run pool whose charm lies in simplicity. The pleasing timber buildings that house the changing and plant facilities are basic, but they blend perfectly into the soft, green countryside that surrounds the pool. It sits at the edge of this pretty village’s recreation ground, and in recent years has opened for a brief spell of heated swimming around Christmas. That is a rare treat outside of London, and is to be savoured. • wiveypool.netSince it was refurbished a couple of years ago this 250-metre salt-water leviathan can rightly claim to be the UK’s largest infinity pool, described by eliska2 as “a slightly left-field, not-quite-lido experience”. Swimming alongside the wall on the seaward side, taking in the view to Clevedon’s historic pier and the south Wales hills on the other side of the Bristol Channel is a seaside treat. The marine lake is free to use and a safe haven from the Bristol Channel itself, a dangerous stretch of water for swimmers with a huge tidal range and strong currents. • clevedonmarinelake Madamadams recommended this little slice of volunteer-run heaven.

It is surrounded by grass that cries out to be picnicked on, and benches are available for bathers who prefer to picnic at a table.

But what is the best way to say sorry? It was Elton John, pop’s wisest banger merchant, who once said: “Sorry seems to be the hardest word,” and Elt and Blue were right about that. It’s especially tricky for celebrities. In a culture that has realised unchecked behaviour that damages others is not cool, more and more famous people have had to issue public apologies for things they’ve done, said or tweeted. In 2016, a group of conflict management researchers found that apologies that adhered to the following five-point structure were most likely to be seen as sincere:➻ An expression of regret – ie the actual “I’m sorry” (but, importantly, not a justification)➻ An acknowledgment of responsibility➻ A declaration of repentance➻ An offer of repair➻ A request for forgivenessUsing those guidelines let’s find out which apologetic celebrities meant it the most …Earlier this year we all remembered Roseanne Barr existed when her sitcom started up again for some reason. Then it got cancelled. A 1.45am tweet about former Obama aide Valerie Jarrett that compared her to “Planet of the Apes” got flagged to ABC who pulled the hit reboot. Barr’s apology was, all told, “very bad”: she blamed insomnia drug Ambien, retweeted almost 100 meme tweets from her followers that seemed to back up her original sentiment, then pleaded, “I honestly thought she was Jewish and Persian-ignorant of me for sure”, which doesn’t really explain or justify the early morning racism at all. Back to Sorry School with you, Roseanne. 15To herald the launch of Arrested Development season five, the cast of the show did a roundtable interview with the New York Times that drew criticism for the way male cast members spoke over Jessica Walters’s emotional retelling of hostile behaviour she experienced working with co-star Jeffrey Tambor. Jason Bateman was particularly mansplain-y in the transcript, and apologised in a series of tweets, starting: “Based on listening to the NYT interview and hearing people’s thoughts online, I realize that I was wrong here.” By the metric, it was a good apology – Bateman said “sorry”, acknowledged he was in the wrong, and offered repair – but it shouldn’t take people online telling you that you should’ve apologised to someone when you were in the room with them crying. 45Jama’s apology earlier this year was one of my favourites of the genre, because it involved apologising for an apology, which is nowhere to be found on the five-point chart. After fans found old tweets from 2012 where the Radio 1 DJ shared a joke at the expense of dark-skinned black women with the caption “Looooooooool”, Jama quickly tweeted “My genuine and sincerest apologies go out, not just to dark-skinned women but to ALL women,” which was a real zero out of five. A follow-up explained how what she did was bad, but not much by way of repair or asking for forgiveness. Work to do. 35In 2017, Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme made headlines after kicking photographer Chelsea Lauren during a gig and putting her in hospital for the night. The ensuing apology was, by a chart I am beginning to begrudge, good: Homme said sorry, explained without justifying, did some forward-looking to a time where he doesn’t kick photographers in the camera so hard it hits them in the face (“Yeah, I’m gonna have to figure out some stuff I think”) and even went so far as to apologise to his wife, brother and children. Hate to have to say this about a man who kicked a photographer in the face but: good apology. 45Rita Ora’s entire career is a performance art piece about how you can achieve success by being loved and loathed by the same number of people at the same time. With the release of hit banger Girls, that theory was proved correct: some camps called it an anthem, while others – including queer artist Hayley Kiyoko – criticised lyrics that presented same-sex feelings as something you catch after a good bottle of wine. Ora’s ensuing iPhone-notes-screenshot apology won a number of fans over, but others labelled her soft coming out – “I have had romantic relationships with women and men … this is my personal journey” – as cynical. Once again, Ora’s Theory of Universal Balance comes through. 55Exemplary form from the Full Frontal host: after calling Ivanka Trump a “feckless cunt” in a monologue about the missing migrant children story that has dominated headlines, Bee backpedalled when critics and fans called her out for using a gendered insult. “It is a word I have used on the show many times, hoping to reclaim it,” Bee explained. “This time, I used it as an insult. I crossed the line.” She then went on to apologise, explain, make good for the future and throw in a joke about Ted Cruz, before finishing on: “I should have known that a potty-mouthed insult would be inherently more interesting to them than juvenile immigration policy.” Watch and learn, Roseanne. 55"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e5144459c9440bc210df5c186e605152ef70b54/0_167_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51b76a79b239663ff2423e3855387ecf","title":"tuesdays best tv shades of blue colombia v england","story":"Jennifer Lopez and Ray Liotta return for a third season of crime-busting, while Gareth Southgate’s boys face Falcao et alOnly Jennifer Lopez’s most dedicated fans (true JLovers) will have stuck with this ludicrous corrupt-cop melodrama for a full two seasons.

Others have painted him as a Donald Trump-style Latin American populist with a big ego and a distinctly dictatorial bent. Even some supporters admit they fret about Amlo’s authoritarian tendencies and whether he is truly a man of the left.But most analysts believe Amlo has more in common with Brazil’s former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a pragmatic one-time union firebrand who led his country from 2002 until 2011. Like Amlo, Lula spent years trying to become president before succeeding at his fourth attempt.During his victory speech on Sunday night Amlo shed some light on how he plans to tackle perhaps the most urgent problem facing Mexico: the growing drug-related violence that this year has claimed an average of 88 lives per day. Amlo vowed to change the “failed strategy” his predecessors have used to tackle insecurity – a heavily militarized 11-year “war on drugs” which has claimed 200,000 lives. On 10 December 2006, president Felipe Calderón, launched Mexico’s war on drugs by sending 6,500 troops into his home state of Michoacán, where rival cartels were engaged in tit-for-tat massacres.Calderón declared war eight days after taking power – a move widely seen as an attempt to boost his own legitimacy after a bitterly contested election victory. Within two months, around 20,000 troops were involved in operations across the country.The US has donated at least $1.5bn through the Merida Initiative since 2008, while Mexico has spent at least $54bn on security and defence since 2007. Critics say that this influx of cash has helped create an opaque security industry open to corruption at every level.But the biggest costs have been human: since 2007, around 230,000 people have been murdered and more than 28,000 reported as disappeared. Human rights groups have also detailed a vast rise in human rights abuses by security forces.As the cartels have fractured and ersified, other violent crimes such as kidnapping and extortion have also surged. In addition, hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced by violence.\u0026nbspImproved collaboration between the US and Mexico has resulted in numerous high-profile arrests and drug busts. Officials say 25 of the 37 drug traffickers on Calderón’s most-wanted list have been jailed, extradited to the US or killed, although not all of these actions have been independently corroborated.The biggest victory – and most embarrassing blunder – under Peña Nieto’s leadership was the recapture, escape and another recapture of Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, leader of the Sinaloa cartel.While the crackdown and capture of kingpins has won praise from the media and US, it has done little to reduce the violence.Mexico’s decade-long war on drugs would never have been possible without the huge injection of American cash and military cooperation under the Merida Initiative. The funds have continued to flow despite growing evidence of serious human rights violations.\u0026nbsp“More than the use of force, we will deal with the causes from which insecurity and violence originate,” Amlo said. “I am convinced that the most effective and humane way of fighting these ills involves combating inequality and poverty. Peace and tranquility are fruits of the justice.”Amlo isn’t just Mexico’s new president – he’s also a bookworm and author with no fewer than 14 titles to his name. His tomes include Don’t Say Goodbye to Hope, The Mafia That Took Possession of Mexico and The Mafia That Robbed Us of the Presidency about his first failed presidential bid, in 2006.The book was recently published in English with the title: A New Hope for Mexico: Saying No to Corruption, Violence, and Trump’s Wall.Amlo’s friends include an influential British leftist: the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, with whom he reportedly spent part of his 2016 Christmas holiday.The pair are said to have met through Corbyn’s Mexican wife, Laura Álvarez, a former human rights layer who now runs a fair-trade coffee business in the UK. Corbyn, who has longstanding ties to Latin America, has spoken out against human rights abuses in Mexico and last week denounced the killing of more than 130 Mexican politicians during the election campaign.Amlo reportedly once gifted Corbyn a selection of jipi hats. “Jeremy loved them,” one member of Amlo’s campaign told the Times.Amlo’s political awakening is said to have come during the late 1970s when he worked as a representative of Mexico’s National Indigenous Institute in his native state of Tabasco.“He went to live in a shack just like the ones the indigenous families lived in,” José Agustín Ortiz Pinchetti recalls in a flattering new biography of his friend. During the six years he spent living with the Chontal Maya people, Amlo and his family slept in hammocks and endured “African temperatures of over 40C” with nothing but a single fan to keep them cool.“López Obrador took on that role as if it was his destiny, with a missionary’s spirit,” Pinchetti writes.

After the Singapore summit, Trump tweeted that: “There is no longer a nuclear threat” from North Korea, but in recent days, multiple leaks from the US intelligence assessment have suggested that the regime’s work on its nuclear and missile programme is not just continuing, but accelerating.The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that North Korea had expanded a factory for manufacturing solid fuel ballistic missiles in Hamhung, based on satellite imagery analysed by the Middlebury Institute of International Studies (MIIS) at Monterey, California. The Diplomat cited intelligence officials as saying Pyongyang was also continuing work on mobile launchers for one its latest generation of ballistic missiles. This follows a report by NBC News, also quoting multiple intelligence officials, saying that work had been stepped up at secret uranium enrichment sites. North Korea has acknowledged running one enrichment plant at its nuclear complex at Yongbyon. However, in 2010 US intelligence found a site at a place called Kangson which it believes to be a covert parallel site. A third site is said to have been discovered more recently. Officials from the Defence Intelligence Agency were quoted by CNN as saying they believe Kim has no intention of disarming, at least for the time being, and would seek to hide much of its programme.Pompeo is expected to present the Pyongyang leadership with a demand for a full inventory of its nuclear and missile programmes and then a timetable for dismantling them. Speaking to CBS News on Sunday, the national security adviser, John Bolton, said the US had a plan for full disarmament within a year.“I’m sure that secretary of state Mike Pompeo will be discussing this with the North Koreans in the near future about really how to dismantle all of their WMD and ballistic missile programs in a year,” Bolton told the programme Face the Nation.Most observers are sceptical that pace of disarmament is feasible even if Kim was willing to disarm, which they doubt.“It is unhelpful when Trump administration officials set arbitrary timelines for the denuclearisation process, which is going to be a long-term process that is going to require reciprocal US actions,” Kelsey Davenport, the director for non-proliferation policy at the Arms Control Association in Washington, said. “The speed at which North Korea is willing to take steps is dependent on what the US puts on the table in return.”“Kim has not said he would disarm at any point in this process,” said Jeffrey Lewis, the director of the East Asia Nonproliferation programme at MIIS. In Singapore, Kim signed a joint statement with Trump committed to “complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula”, but that has been the North Korean position since 1992 and does not necessarily mean the regime is ready to disarm. “What it means to them is a formal process in which the US give up its nuclear weapons and then North Korea goes along,” Lewis said. “What we want is disarmament but we started using their phrase in the misguided belief it would cause them to get confused and give up their weapons by mistake.”Jim Walsh, an expert on the North Korean nuclear programme at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that North Korea’s total disarmament is the wrong benchmark to judge the success of diplomatic engagement.“Hey, I’d love to have denuclearisation. But it’s the wrong frame,” Walsh said. “The issue is whether we are safer or more insecure. Is a conflict that could lead to the use of nuclear weapons more likely or less likely?” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75df84081f7703bac9f9ef6ebce0eefdfb97a305/0_19_5216_3128/master/5216.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c05fcbea094d002ed9b1ceaf662874b8","title":"uk to appoint lgbt health adviser national action plan","story":"Theresa May promises ‘real and lasting change’ following huge nationwide surveyThe government will appoint a national LGBT health adviser and take measures to end so-called conversion therapy as part of a plan to deliver what Theresa May has promised will be “real and lasting change”.The proposals form part of an action plan published by the Equalities Office on Tuesday. It follows a UK-wide survey of LGBT people that had more than 108,000 responses, billed as the largest study of its kind.The 30-page plan contains a series of pledges, including to improve the police response to LGBT hate incidents, more support for LGBT students and teachers and improvements to gender identity services for transgender adults.The proposals, which will receive an initial £4.5m in funding, were welcomed by the campaign groups Stonewall and the LGBT Foundation.Ruth Hunt, Stonewall’s chief executive, said she was “really pleased that the government is listening to the thousands upon thousands of LGBT people who responded to this survey”.The online poll, which ran from July to October last year, sought views from LGBT and intersex people about their personal experiences and interactions with public services.In comments released with the plan, the prime minister said the survey had highlighted where more efforts were needed.“I was struck by just how many respondents said they cannot be open about their sexual orientation or avoid holding hands with their partner in public for fear of a negative reaction,” May said.The plan promises to end these practices, with the Equalities Office to look into various legislative or non-legislative ways to do so.The techniques, sometimes called “cure” therapies, are based on the idea that being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender is a mental complaint that can be reversed. They are often modelled on mainstream methods of psychotherapy, and sometimes prayer, and are known to be harmful.One man who underwent such a process and then took part in sessions to “cure” him said the experience left him suicidal. He told ITV News he underwent a combination of confession and prayers, supposedly to rid him of a gay “demon”.He then took part in sessions for others, but became depressed and prayed to die. “I wanted God to remove me from the world to lessen my suffering and to lessen the suffering of those around me,” he said.“At the time I believed this was a demon being cast out of me. And I remember the next day waking up and thinking, I don’t really know what that means now. Does it mean I’m a straight man now? Is that demon gone? Did that demon really exist?”Penny Mordaunt, the minister for women and equalities, said: “Our action plan is a step towards everyone, regardless of their sexual orientation, gender identity or sex characteristics, being able to live safe, happy and healthy lives where they can be themselves without fear of discrimination.”May is to host the annual Downing Street LGBT Pride reception on Tuesday evening. Among the guests for the first time will be Peter Tatchell. The veteran campaigner said May had invited him after he was “banned” previously.In a separate statement, Tatchell called the action plan a “welcome start”, but said it fell short on issues such as the deportation of LGBT refugees to countries where homophobia was widespread. The £4.5m budget was “derisory and insulting”, he added.Paul Martin, the chief executive of the LGBT Foundation, said his organisation had worked with the Equalities Office on the survey and he was “delighted that the government has listened”.The study and announcement are separate to government plans to amend the 2004 Gender Recognition Act, making the process by which transgender people can change their legal gender easier.

Photograph:  Frank MillerJust three nurses have been recruited so far this year as part of the HSE’s relocation package.The “Bring them Home” campaign was put in place by the HSE in July 2015, offering Irish nurses working in Britain a relocation grant of €1,500 to return to the Irish public health service.Since April 2017, an additional €1,500 is paid after a period of 12 months employment and subject to a commitment to remain in that employment for a further year. Last year, it was decided to extend the package beyond Britain to include nurses from any overseas location.There were 15 nurses recruited last year, down from 82 in 2016 and 20 in 2015, according to figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.The HSE said upon its announcement three years ago it was hoping to attract up to 500 staff under the initiative.Irish Midwives and Nurses Organisation general secretary Phil Ní Sheaghdha said that while it was important to have packages to incentivise Irish nurses to come back, the current offering was insufficient.“The figures demonstrate that it doesn’t go far enough, it has to be much higher. In addition, the incentive to stay also has to be included,” she said.“What we found is some who availed of the first part of the incentive left after six months. Recruitment is only one part of the story – retention is an even bigger part. The rate of pay is too low within a global market where you can get better rates.”The HSE said it could not provide a comment on the figures at this time but pointed to the health service employment report published last May, which showed a 4.6 per cent increase in the number of nurses employed over the previous year, from 36,474 to 38,139."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Varadkar and Coveney attend Ireland\u0026rsquos formal launch for UN Security Council seat in New YorkSix people injured when two cars collided in Co Limerick on N20 on Monday morningProgrammes measured on personal development, educational experience, and career developmentWoman found husband\u0026rsquos body in pool of blood after coming home from workPatients will be able to \u0026lsquoremotely\u0026rsquo carry out IVF with donor egg, says companyIreland has been without a US ambassador since Trump came to office at the start of 2017Modern technology and social media has led to huge increase in material that must be disclosed at trialDublin consumption peaked last week at 50 million litres above normal levelsSenior Fianna F\u0026aacuteil figures believe Varadkar is keeping option of autumn election openTaoiseach says important for Ireland to have a place where \u0026lsquoimportant decisions are made\u0026rsquoPassengers on 46a route among those who will be forced to get two buses instead of oneMay says \u0026lsquosome real differences\u0026rsquo remain between UK and European Commission around BorderHealth professionals warn of sunburn and sunstroke as country sizzles in the heatJudge praises \u0026lsquocourage\u0026rsquo of young man and woman who came to aid of seriously injured friendIssues concerning handling of widow\u0026rsquos estate by Declan O\u0026rsquoCallaghan were \u0026lsquodisquieting\u0026rsquoTaoiseach\u0026rsquos criticism based on \u0026lsquofalse facts and inaccurate jabber published in the papers\u0026rsquoLower salaries for newer employees has \u0026lsquopoisoned morale\u0026rsquo and led to staff shortagesTaoiseach rejects claims of complacency by Minister of State Finian McGrath"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3551477.1530552756!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"no end to the heatwave in sight says met %C3%A9ireann","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEnjoying the good weather at the Forty Foot, Sandycove, Co Dublin, on Monday.

He had decided not to attend before the recent controversy over the children of migrants, his office said.A spokeswoman for the co-leaders of the Social Democrats, Róisín Shortall and Catherine Murphy, said that both had been invited, but neither would be going. She said the issue about which they were most concerned was the separation of immigrant children from their parents at the US border.Sinn Féin did not respond to queries about leader Mary Lou McDonald’s attendance at the event.A Fine Gael spokesman said TDs had not been offered any guidance on the event.A spokesman for the Minister for Children Katherine Zappone (who is originally from the US) said she would not be attending as she has Dáil and constituency business on Tuesday evening.Ireland has been without a US ambassador since Donald Trump came to office at the beginning of 2017 and dismissed all Obama administration appointees. The Department of Foreign Affairs does not expect an appointment this year.An intention to appoint Irish American businessman Brian Burns to the post was abandoned last year after Mr Burns withdrew owing to health concerns.In the American system the embassies are staffed by civil servants from the State Department, but the ambassador is a political appointment which usually goes to supporters and fundraisers for the incumbent president. In the absence of an ambassador in the embassy in Ballsbridge, the event on Tuesday is being hosted by Reece Smyth, the deputy chief of the US mission.A spokesman for the US embassy declined to comment on any acceptances or refusals.

Photograph: Simon CarswellU2 frontman Bono gave his full-throated support to Ireland’s bid for a UN Security Council seat saying that “storytellers” were needed to explain the future importance of the 193-nation body. Swapping a stage of musicians for political leaders, an activist and a diplomat, the singer was the headline act at the Government’s formal launch of its campaign at UN’s headquarters in New York City on Monday night.He appeared alongside Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Tánaiste Simon Coveney, former Irish president Mary Robinson and Ireland’s ambassador at the UN Geraldine Byrne Nason at the high-profile event on the UN’s North Lawn. The Government is pitching for one of the 10 non-permanent seats on the 15-nation council for the 2021-22 in a campaign that will run up to a secret ballot the 193-state UN in June 2020.Addressing UN ambassadors at an event celebrating Irish food, music, heritage and culture, Bono referred to political turmoil, saying an international order based on shared values and rules was “facing the greatest test in its 70-year history.”Mr Varadkar told an audience of several hundred people that the UN was “stronger acting together” and that “in these troubled and uncertain times” Ireland “as a global island” wanted to “play our part in defending, supporting and promoting its values.”Ms Robinson said she endorsed her country’s commitment “to do the difficult thing” and seek membership of the security council which was “not easy.”“It is a hard, hard labour of love if you really love what the UN stands for and I think Ireland really does,” she said.Mr Coveney said that with Ireland the UN knows what it would get: “a small country with big thinking, a country that listens and a strong independent voice.”In an emotive speech next to a sculpture by Dublin artist John Behan depicting Irish emigrants disembarking from a ship in New York in the 19th century, Bono evoked Ireland’s history of colonialism, conflict, famine and mass migration as experiences that make the country well placed to serve on the UN’s most powerful body. “If you look at the agenda of what the Security Council will be called on to address over the coming years: doesn’t it look a lot like us?” he said.The Irish had “not forgotten what it’s like to live in danger and desperation,” he said. “It is the air we used to breathe, even in the Dublin of my youth in the 60s and 70s.” Bono paid tribute to the UN but warned of the dangers it faced as countries such as the United States, which last month withdrew from the UN Human Rights Council, are stepping back from multilateralism.The singer said the choice was not about a seat on the security council, but about the UN as a whole.“It’s about its future and indeed whether it has one, whether its values still matter - and they better whether peace is still possible and who will speak for those normal ideas when the heat is on,” he said. Speaking on a sweltering Manhattan night, Bono said that “standing here, in that heat, the heat of a moment suffused with possibility and peril,” the UN needed “storytellers” because words mattered and that one word mattered in particular.“The word is compromise because that’s how you achieve peace and compromise is a word that the Irish people understand very, very well, It is part of our story, our recent story, and we are storytellers,” he said. “So your honorable peace activists, if you need some storytellers to describe what’s really important about this place… let us tell the story.”He urged the UN to “all become storytellers of a future we want to share” and that the story needed to be told “with imagination and passion and conviction.”“We are storytellers but this is the best story ever,” he said of the UN. Ireland faces stiff competition for the council seat from Canada and Norway, two countries with formidable records at the UN, if it is secure the required 129 votes out of 193 if it is win a seat. Bono joked that “the worst thing” he could say about Canada was that they are “nice.”“And Norway?” he said. “Who can ask for a better neighbour, a more committed peacemaker? Here’s the worse thing I can say about them: they are tall.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3551648.1530562674!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar no vanity behind irish bid for un security council seat","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar laying a wreath at UN Building in New York to Irish who died on UN peacekeeping missions. Photograph: Simon CarswellTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said there was “no vanity” in Ireland seeking a seat on the United Nations Security Council the motivation was to protect institutions such as the UN in a changing world, he said.Mr Varadkar was speaking at the UN in New York as the Government formally launched a campaign to win a non-permanent seat on the council, the UN’s most powerful body, for a two-year term in 2021-2022.“The UN is an important place where important decisions are made this is where decisions are made about where peacekeepers should serve,” the Taoiseach told reporters outside UN headquarters in Manhattan after laying a wreath to the 88 Irish peacekeepers killed over the past 60 years on UN missions.“It is where decisions are made on sanctions, it is even on occasion where decisions are made on whether or not the world should go to war. This is no vanity here this is serious stuff.”The Government has drawn criticism for applying diplomatic resources to the efforts to win a seat in the face of intense competition from Norway and Canada as a “vanity project”.Mr Varadkar told reporters that his plan to put Ireland “at the centre of the world” after Brexit meant “embracing a much wider world out there” where power was shifting to the east and south.“For Ireland to do well in this changing new world, we need to protect institutions that stand for multilateralism, institutions like the UN,” he said.Without these institutions, he added, “the big powers call all the shots”.Mr Varadkar considered the campaign to be “a good investment”. Ireland had diplomats in 80 countries but none in the another 100 countries.“This is where we meet those countries,” he said of the UN. “I think we have a really good and really important role to play in that.”Ireland’s two-year intensive campaign of lobbying will culminate in a secret ballot at the UN in June 2020, where the 193 member states will vote on the security council membership. If victorious, it would be the fourth time that the Irish have held a seat at the table, the last being in 2001-2002.Former Irish president Mary Robinson, who is helping the Government launch the bid, said that it was “probably Ireland’s most difficult attempt” to be elected on to the council.UN ambassadors were invited to U2’s concert in New York on Sunday night as part of the charm offensive behind the bid said it was a “very good soft power stroke”, as they rarely come together, she said.“Everybody’s aware that it is a very tough contest,” she said, noting that it was important for Ireland to see a council seat again “at this particular dangerous time in the world”.Mr Varadkar was joined by Vice-Admiral Mark Mellett, chief of staff of the Defence Forces, and a colour party for the wreath-laying ceremony on the 60th anniversary of Irish peacekeeping for the UN.The Taoiseach said that almost everyone in Ireland knows somebody who has taken part in an UN mission and peacekeeping was “very much part of our national identity”.“I really believe that the blue helmet, which is the symbol of UN peacekeeping, is every bit as much a symbol of Irish identity as the shamrock or the harp,” he said.The ceremony was attended by Irish UN peacekeeping veterans Jim Casey (71) and Michael Colton, who escorted the bodies of the nine Irish soldiers killed in the Niemba ambush in the Congo in 1960.“It was the worst journey I ever made,” said Mr Colton.Mr Casey said that it was “very important” that the slain peacekeepers be remembered.“A lot of people in Ireland don’t know what happened on those missions,” he said. “It should be brought to their attention and they should know what’s going on.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3551501.1530554138!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"may calls on eu to show more flexibility in brexit negotiations","story":"British Prime Minister gives a statement on Brexit in the House of Commons. Video: Parliament TV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May said a White Paper to be published next week would set out “detailed proposals for a sustainable and close future relationship” between Britain and the EU. Photograph: AFPGetty ImagesTheresa May has called on the European Union to show more flexibility in negotiations over Brexit, warning that parliament would reject the withdrawal agreement unless it was accompanied by clarity on a future trading relationship.Updating MPs on last week’s European Council meeting, the British prime minister said a White Paper to be published next week would set out “detailed proposals for a sustainable and close future relationship” between Britain and the EU.“I warned EU leaders that I did not think this parliament would approve the withdrawal agreement in the autumn unless we had clarity about our future relationship alongside it,” she said.“The EU and its member states will want to consider our proposals seriously. We both need to show flexibility to build the deep relationship after we have left that is in the interests of both our peoples.”Ms May has called her cabinet to an all-day meeting at Chequers on Friday to agree a common position on key issues surrounding Brexit, including customs and Britain’s future relationship with the single market. Downing Street on Monday declined to comment on reports that the prime minister had a new proposal for the customs relationship after Brexit.Earlier, Conservative ministers and backbenchers rounded on Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg after he warned the prime minister that she risked splitting her party as Robert Peel did over the Corn Laws in the middle of the 19th century.Writing in the Daily , Mr Rees-Mogg suggested that his fellow Brexiteers in the backbench European Research Group (ERG) would vote against the final exit deal if Ms May abandoned her negotiating red lines.“Any attempt by the EU to impose its laws and court on the UK, either directly or indirectly, must be rejected. Any EU agreement that restricts the country’s ability to make trade agreements with other states, restricts our ability to control our migration policy makes us pay to trade or interferes with our fishing waters could not be accepted. Indeed MPs would vote against such propositions in parliament,” he wrote.Foreign office minister Alan Duncan said Mr Rees-Mogg risked debasing “government, party, country and himself” by his insolence in lecturing and threatening the prime minister.“The PM must be given maximum latitude and backing,” Sir Alan tweeted. “The ideological right are a minority despite their noise and should pipe down.”Backbench MP Simon Hoare accused Mr Rees-Mogg of hectoring and blackmail and warned that he risked opening the way to a Labour government under Jeremy Corbyn. Another backbencher, Vicky Ford, said there was no majority in parliament for the hard Brexiteers’ vision of Brexit.“If this becomes a binary choice between staying in the single market and customs union or no deal, then I do not believe there is a majority for no deal,” she told the BBC.On Monday evening, foreign secretary Boris Johnson offered support for Mr Rees-Mogg in a complimentary tweet.“It’s vital that all MPs are able to air their views on Brexit. Whatever your position, I hope we can all agree that Jacob Rees-Mogg is a principled and dedicated MP who wants the best for our country,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

public transport has become much more expensive and bus services have been cut so that transport costs take up nearly a fifth of minimum household budgets.Bus travel is 65 per cent more expensive in 2018 than it was in 2008 so for a single person the minimum transport budget has risen from £17 to £37 a week, said the report.The average cost of food rose by just over a quarter between 2008 and 2018, but a minimum food budget for a single person rose from £29 to £44 a week, a rise of just over 50 per cent, while energy bills are over 40 per cent higher than a decade ago.Childcare costs have risen sharply, with the average price of a full-time nursery place for a two-year-old rising by more than 50 per cent in the past decade to £229 a week.The report also found that the gap in living costs between older people and working people has closed, as pensioners spend more on smartphones, computers and new clothes. A typical pensioner couple now spends more than their working-age counterparts on culture and socialising and alcoholic drinks, and almost as much as them on clothing and food.  Abigail Davis, research fellow at the Centre for Research in Social Policy, told the Daily  that some pensioners in the original cohort could still remember rationing, while younger pensioners saw items such as technology as a necessity rather than a luxury.  Campbell Robb, chief executive of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: These figures show just how precarious life can be for low-income households.People who live below the minimum standard say that they shop around to get the best deals and juggle to pay the bills, but the soaring cost of transport, energy and childcare means millions of families are still locked in a daily struggle to make ends meet.Some working parents are actually further away from reaching a decent living standard because tax credits to top up low wages have been falling at a time when families need them most.The Government must put things right by allowing families to keep more of their earnings. This would ease the constraints the crippling cost of living places on their ability to build a better life and ensure everyone can reach a decent standard of living.Please review our commenting policyPlans to raise fuel and alcohol duties branded an attack on \u0026#39white van man\u0026#39 by  Tory MPsCheryl insists her mother had \u0026#39nothing to do\u0026#39 with Liam Payne split as she attacks social media criticsAustria \u0026#39ready to protect southern borders\u0026#39 amid tension over German migrant dealAustralian Archbishop Philip Wilson who covered up child abuse could serve sentence at homeHomes evacuated as firefighters battle mile-long wildfire in Wales\u0026#39MI6 conman\u0026#39 on UK\u0026#39s most wanted list found living in luxury Swiss flat with wife and childrenComment: The NHS social contract has been broken – by children refusing to look after their own parents With no easy way out and more rain on the way, challenges mount to save boys from flooded Thai cave270,000 Syrians \u0026#39displaced by fighting in the southwest\u0026#39Thailand cave rescue: Junior football team found by British ers could remain underground for monthsWatch: The moment British ers found 12 boys and football coach trapped in Thai caveThailand cave rescue: Meet the heroic volunteer British ers who are the best in the world\u0026#39Pint scam\u0026#39 as major restaurant chain caught serving beer in special glasses 8.1ml too smallAngela Merkel back from the brink with migration dealPerfect World Cup prophecies not enough to save Japan’s  ‘psychic octopus’ from the dinner table Women freeze their eggs to allow men to get ahead in their careersNational measles warning after five-fold rise in cases in England Outrage at photos of American woman posing with giraffe she shot dead in South Africa Targets and \u0026#39blame culture\u0026#39 stop older people getting proper careMoD must not become a \u0026#39jobs club\u0026#39, Johnny Mercer says as he calls for reform of Britain\u0026#39s armed forces We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"mexicos leftistlopez obrador course election victory ruling","story":"digitalservices@telegraphdigitalservices@telegraphVeteran Leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has been elected president of Mexico, winning the largest landslide in his country\u0027s recent history in a remarkable routing of what he terms “the mafia of power”.Promising to combat corruption and drive down record crime rates, Mr Lopez Obrador captured 53 per cent of the vote, according to preliminary results - a historic victory for the party he created.Voters decided in their millions to turn their backs on the two parties which have ruled Mexico for almost 100 years, and finally give him a chance - sending his supporters into a frenzy.Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the new president of Mexico, addressing supporters in Mexico City on Sunday nightDonald Trump, the US president, was quick to congratulate the 64-year-old, who has charted a careful course of not antagonising his northern neighbour, but vowing to put Mexico first.I look very much forward to working with him,” said Mr Trump. “There is much to be done that will benefit both the United States and Mexico!Less welcome to Mr Lopez Obrador’s team, perhaps, was the swift congratulations send by Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro – leader of a country which Mr Lopez Obrador’s critics said would be his model. “May the wide avenues of sovereignty and friendship between our people be opened,” he said. “With him, truth triumphs over lies, and hope in the great motherland is restored.”The result is, for Mr Lopez Obrador, the stunning culmination of a decades-long dream. Indeed, Mexicans joke that “AMLO”, as he\u0027s known, mayor of Mexico City from 2000 to 2005 and a household name, has been campaigning for the presidency for 18 years.Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador: Mexico\u0026#039s Jeremy Corbyn to battle \u0026#039the mafia of power\u0026#039“It’s a triumph for all the world, all the people,” he told his fans, gathered outside his home in the early hours of Monday. “It’s of millions and millions who are fed up with this regime of corruption and privilege, and who decided today to vote for a real change.“I’m going to do it. I won’t fail you.”Jose Antonio Meade, 49, candidate for the ruling PRI, conceded defeat with lightning speed, announcing shortly after the first exit polls were given, at 8pm in Mexico City, that he had lost.An experienced and well-respected politician, he was severely handicapped by representing the party of despised President Enrique Pena Nieto.Jose Antonio Meade gives a thumbs up after voting on Sunday. He was the first to concede defeatRicardo Anaya, from the conservative PAN, conceded 45 minutes later, saying he had already phoned the winner to wish him well.I recognised his triumph, I congratulated him, and I wished him success, the 39-year-old said.Once his victory became clear supporters streamed towards the Zocalo plaza at the heart of Mexico City, cheering and chanting: It is an honour, to be with Obrador.The plaza was completely full by the time he arrived to give a victory speech in which he underlined his long-time claim that he would head the biggest transformation of Mexico since the 1910 revolution - though he also stressed three times that the transition would be both peaceful and ordered.Nothing to create an economic crisis, he pledged, vowing to respect the independence of the central bank, keep taxation at its current level, and promote business.I will not let you down, he said, to wild cheers from the crowd. We are going to be ruled by three basic principals. No lying, no stealing, and no betrayal of the people. Thousands of supporters of Mr Lopez Obrador crammed into the Zocalo square in Mexico CityA thousand miles to the north, in the border city of Ciudad Juarez – from where he launched his campaign in April - cars were honking their horns as they passed his party’s headquarters, and drivers sped by waving flags, leaning out of their cars and cheering.The long-time friend of Jeremy Corbyn has been the front runner from the start, but has made an extra effort to win over the sceptical northern states. Making his third attempt at taking the presidency, he promised to defeat “the mafia of power” and usher in a new era of corruption-free rule, in which the most marginalised come first.His platform includes promises to sell the presidential jet, slash his presidential salary in two, and turn the presidential palace into a cultural centre. He has campaigned with the pledge of doubling pensions for retirees, increasing scholarships for students, and boosting production and employment in the impoverished south.How he will pay for this remains unclear – his team speak vaguely of corruption reductions freeing up millions of dollars.And he has been remarkably unspecific in his plan for dealing with Mr Trump, Nafta and the surging violence – only talking about rooting out the causes of organised crime, such as poverty and a lack of opportunities among the young, and floating a plan for an amnesty for cartel members.Mr Lopez Obrador in Ciudad Juarez on April 1, to kick off his campaignNevertheless, his message has resonated in a country exhausted by endless corruption scandals and a failure to reduce the incessant violence. As the results were announced in Ciudad Juarez two policemen were shot and injured not far from the headquarters, in another grim sign of the deteriorating security situation which both the PAN and the PRI have failed to calm, and which has driven the city to support Mr Lopez Obrador for the first time.May has been the worst month for murders in the city in seven years, and, dependent on trade with the US, the election has set residents on edge.Mr Lopez Obrador’s candidate for mayor of the city, Javier Gonzalez Mocken, who by midnight on Sunday had a narrow edge over his opponent, told The  his party was going to work on reducing the causes of cartel violence.“Lopez Obrador is looking at the reasons – the poverty and lack of hope,” he said, inside the chaotic party headquarters as the votes came in. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, casting his vote on Sunday morningHe admitted he did not agree the suggested amnesty for cartel members.“In the strict sense of the word, no, I’d not be in favour of that,” he said. “Not if they have killed people. But he’s talking about how lots of people are driving into working for the gangs through lack of opportunity. He talks about scholarships, and universities. That is good for the city.”And he said he was confident Mr Lopez Obrador would establish a working relationship with Mr Trump.He\u0027s a very serious man, he said. Both sides want a deal on Nafta, as businessmen in the US and Mexico are concerned by this uncertainty.We\u0027ve definitely been taken aback by the treatment from Mr Trump - it\u0027s been worse than any other president. We\u0027re concerned by him. So we have elected Mr Lopez Obrador to improve our relations with the US.Mr Pena Nieto addressed the nation on state television, promising to work with Mr Lopez Obrador for a smooth transition.Mr Lopez Obrador will take over on December 1.Please review our commenting policyPlans to raise fuel and alcohol duties branded an attack on \u0026#39white van man\u0026#39 by  Tory MPsCheryl insists her mother had \u0026#39nothing to do\u0026#39 with Liam Payne split as she attacks social media criticsAustria \u0026#39ready to protect southern borders\u0026#39 amid tension over German migrant dealAustralian Archbishop Philip Wilson who covered up child abuse could serve sentence at homeHomes evacuated as firefighters battle mile-long wildfire in Wales\u0026#39MI6 conman\u0026#39 on UK\u0026#39s most wanted list found living in luxury Swiss flat with wife and childrenComment: The NHS social contract has been broken – by children refusing to look after their own parents With no easy way out and more rain on the way, challenges mount to save boys from flooded Thai cave270,000 Syrians \u0026#39displaced by fighting in the southwest\u0026#39Thailand cave rescue: Junior football team found by British ers could remain underground for monthsWatch: The moment British ers found 12 boys and football coach trapped in Thai caveThailand cave rescue: Meet the heroic volunteer British ers who are the best in the world\u0026#39Pint scam\u0026#39 as major restaurant chain caught serving beer in special glasses 8.1ml too smallAngela Merkel back from the brink with migration dealPerfect World Cup prophecies not enough to save Japan’s  ‘psychic octopus’ from the dinner table Women freeze their eggs to allow men to get ahead in their careersNational measles warning after five-fold rise in cases in England Outrage at photos of American woman posing with giraffe she shot dead in South Africa Families need £40,000 a year for a decent standard of livingTargets and \u0026#39blame culture\u0026#39 stop older people getting proper careWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"watch moment british divers found 12 boys football coach trapped","story":"digitalservices@telegraphdigitalservices@telegraphDramatic footage was released early on Tuesday of an emaciated and bedraggled Thai youth football team crammed onto a wedge of dry ground surrounded by water deep inside a cave that had held them captive for nine days.The group, mostly seated and with baggy football shirts pulled over their knees, asked for food and to leave the cave immediately, according to the video shared on the official Facebook page of the Thai Navy SEALS.The first voice the young group heard was that of John Volanthen, an expert British er who discovered them along with compatriot Rick Stanton.How many of you? he asked.

The vote for Brexit was a cry for greater opportunity from those who feel that they and their children are mired in lives that offer little hope. \u0026nbspBrexit is a done deal, and the exact parameters of exit from the European Union will have limited and short-term bearing on the UK’s economic performance.The basic facts are uncontroversial. Britain will trade somewhat less than before, at least until British businesses redirect some of their trade away from the EU to more dynamic Asian and US economies.The expected decline in the extent of international trade will, for a while, reduce Britain’s overall economic welfare. But, as the Harvard economist Dani Rodrik has repeatedly emphasized, citizens’ economic welfare changes only modestly when countries with extensive trade relationships increase or decrease the extent of their international trade.Estimates of large (sometimes very large) costs of Brexit rely on the wildly unreasonable assumption that British productivity will decline precipitously and permanently.True, the UK\u0026nbsphas been growing slower than other advanced economies since the Brexit vote but that slower growth is almost entirely explained by senseless fiscal austerity being pursued by Prime Minister Theresa May’s government while other countries have neutral or even expansionary fiscal policy.There has been much handwringing about the depreciation of the pound triggered by the Brexit vote. Currency depreciation normally makes citizens poorer: they pay more for foreign products and receive reduced prices for their exports. But the UK was running a large (and growing) current account deficit.Put simply, the UK was not richer it was living beyond its means. Prolonged current account deficits would eventually have caused a sharper and, therefore, potentially more disruptive exchange rate depreciation. For now, the depreciation has helped narrow the deficit (precisely by making British exports less expensive for trading partners – stimulating demand for British goods – and making imports dearer for British consumers). Britain is on a more sustainable growth path.Moreover, as I noted at the time, the pound’s depreciation reflected an abrupt decline in “hot money flows” into the UK\u0026nbspThese foreign funds were being used by Russian oligarchs and Indian billionaires to bid up prices of property in London. After the Brexit decision, the rate of rise in London property price increases slowed markedly recently prices have actually dropped.Since the modest trade costs of Brexit are at least partially offset by favourable developments, it is crucial to recognise what is really at stake. The Brexit vote expressed the anxiety of those who felt that their prospects of rising up the income ladder were vanishing. In her October 2016 address to the Tory party conference in Birmingham, Theresa May seemed to understand that the vote was a plea for greater opportunity and fairness. But she seems to have lost track of that insight.As my student Rachel Lurie and I find in ongoing research, those who voted against Brexit were predominantly low-skilled workers stuck in dead-end jobs or unemployed in Britain’s rust-belt areas. As former Prime Minister Gordon Brown wrote in the days after the Brexit referendum, unable to face Asian competition, British manufacturing “collapsed,” and industrial towns “hollowed out,” leaving semi-skilled workers “on the wrong side of globalisation.”But rust-belt parents had a deeper reason to worry. They were bequeathing poor education and work opportunities to their children. Thus, not only were they themselves stuck, they also felt powerless to create more opportunities for their children and grandchildren.The children, for their part, are as dispirited as their parents. Commentators commonly point out that young British citizens voted more so than their elders to remain in the EU. This ignores the large numbers who did not vote: these were young citizens typically unemployed in socially dysfunctional urban communities.For example, in Greater London, the voter turnout was 79 percent in affluent Kingston upon Thames borough but only 65 percent in Hackney, where large pockets of deep poverty and alienation persist. The non-vote of the young living in bleak urban areas was as much a sign of hopelessness as the exit vote of older rust-belt citizens.Theresa May’s early reading was right: UK\u0026nbspcitizens were indeed pleading through their vote (and non-vote) for a fair shot at the future. They were urgently calling on British leaders to revitalize decaying industrial areas and bring hope to failing urban communities in which they were trapped.The message of the Brexit vote – and of similar protest votes in other western democracies since – was that if citizens do not feel economically secure at home, they will reject international commitments.That crucial message has been lost amid the frenzied Brexit negotiations. Until it is heard, it will continue to haunt, and be repeated again and again.Ashoka Mody\u0026nbspis Visiting Professor of International Economic Policy at Princeton University and former deputy director of the International Monetary Fund’s European and Research Departments.

The setting is spectacular, at the eastern end of Lake Geneva, on the edge of the Swiss Alps. Palm trees line the promenade, there are snowcapped peaks above. You can sit and look at it all day, but when the sun goes down the town shuts down. The vistas here are heavenly, but there’s not a lot to do.Yet for a fortnight each summer, this torpid paradise is transformed. Lighting rigs and big amp stacks spring up along the lakeside. Grizzled musos replace prosperous OAPs. A tax haven for wealthy pensioners becomes the centre of the world music scene, as the Montreux Jazz Festival comes to town.The Montreux Jazz Festival has always been a bit of a misnomer. It started as a jazz festival in 1967, the brainchild of Swiss impresario Claude Nobs. Keith Jarrett played the first festival, Nina Simone played the second, but it’s always doubled as a rock fest, ever since Ten Years After played here in 1969.Since then, Montreux Jazz Festival has become increasingly eclectic. During the 1970s, there were shows by Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry, Carlos Santana, Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Ella Fitzgerald, Aretha Franklin and Roberta Flack. James Brown came here in the 1980s. Miles Davis played here 11 times between 1973 and 1991. In the Noughties, Montreux hosted Stevie Wonder, David Bowie, Leonard Cohen, Run-DMC and Radiohead.This year’s line-up is similarly erse: Rag ‘n’ Bone Man, Nine Inch Nails, Jamiroquai, Massive Attack, Jamie Cullum, John Cale, Iggy Pop, Nick Cave, Steve Winwood, Van Morrison… and the band that put Montreux on the hard-rock roadmap, heavy metal veterans Deep Purple.Even at their headbanging peak, Deep Purple were never really fashionable. They lacked the mystique of other hard rock bands like Led Zeppelin or The Doors. However, in Ritchie Blackmore they had a lead guitarist to rival Led Zep’s Jimmy Page, and in Jon Lord they boasted a keyboard virtuoso the equal of The Doors’ Ray Manzarek.Montreux started as a jazz festival in 1967, but has doubled as a rock event since 1969 (Claude Nobs Archives)Blackmore left the band long ago, and Lord died in 2012, but the three other core members are still going strong: vocalist Ian Gillan, bassist Roger Glover and drummer Ian Paice (the only ever-present since the band started out, 50 years ago). Along with Lord and Blackmore, this trio recorded Deep Purple’s most famous track, in Montreux in 1971, with one of the most familiar riffs in rock history – “Smoke on the Water”.Blackmore’s immortal riff would have been enough to ensure the song’s longevity, but like all the best rock songs it also tells a story. Thankfully, unlike a lot of heavy metal anthems, there’s nothing mystical about it. Instead, it’s a straightforward account, almost journalistic in its brevity, of how Deep Purple recorded their finest album, Machine Head, in Montreux.Formed in 1968 in Hertford, Deep Purple enjoyed some success with their first two albums, but it was when founder members Ritchie Blackmore, Jon Lord and Ian Paice brought in Ian Gillan and Roger Glover that the band took off. Their Concerto for Group and Orchestra (recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall) attracted heaps of publicity, and their fourth LP, Deep Purple in Rock (with its iconic Mount Rushmore cover, featuring the anthemic “Child in Time”) made their name.Cale and Nick Cave (Emilien Itim)Yet for Deep Purple, like so many bands before and since, this breakthrough album brought a different set of problems. Recording sessions for their fifth album, Fireball, had to be fitted in around a busy schedule of live dates, from the autumn of 1970 until the summer of 1971. The album wasn’t as successful as its predecessor, and was widely regarded as a sideways step.Consequently, the band resolved to record their sixth album without any interruptions or distractions. Montreux Casino would be empty for three weeks that winter, and Nobs had offered them the use of it. All the recording equipment they needed they could take with them, in a mobile recording studio (borrowed from The Rolling Stones).With Swiss punctuality, Deep Purple arrived in Montreux, ready to start recording. Frank Zappa and his band, The Mothers of Invention, were playing the Casino that afternoon, and then the venue would be theirs. It couldn’t have been any simpler. What could possibly go wrong?Great music documentaries to watch nowGlastonbury is taking a fallow year but if you’re still craving your Pilton fix, look no further.

He saw a man in the crowd behind him wielding a couple of roman candles. Gillan wasn’t too perturbed – compared to most fireworks, roman candles are usually fairly harmless – but then the bloke chucked them into the air, and they lodged in the rafters. In no time at all, the building was ablaze. “There’s a fire, please stay calm and make your way out,”\u0026nbspannounced Zappa from the stage.The band retreated to their hotel, and watched the fire from the bar. At first, it looked like the blaze might spread to the surrounding buildings, and set the entire town alight, but thankfully the wind blew the flames towards the lake, sending smoke billowing out across the water. It was like a special effects scene from a movie. They sat up late, watching the Casino burn to the ground.The title came to Glover the next morning, as he woke up in his hotel bedroom, but the other band members laughed it down – they said it sounded too druggy. But then Blackmore came up with a riff, that riff, on the spur of the moment, and they had the beginnings of a song.However, right now, their most pressing problem was finding somewhere – anywhere – to record. Mercifully, no one had been hurt, but the Casino was a smoking ruin. Nobs found a vacant theatre called The Pavillon, which seemed fine, but the sound-proofing was useless. They’d just started playing “Smoke on the Water” when the police arrived to shut them down. Luckily, the roadies kept them out, as the policemen hammered on the doors.There was only one thing wrong. There wasn’t quite enough material. They’d recorded six classic tracks, including “Lazy”, “Highway Star”, “Pictures of Home” and “Space Truckin’”, but it still came up a bit short for a full LP. Then they remembered the demo they’d recorded at The Pavillon, just before the Swiss police threw them out. And so belatedly, “Smoke on the Water” ended up on the LP, almost by accident. Today, it’s not only the most celebrated song on the album, but the most celebrated song they’ve ever played.Léon Francioli played Montreux in 1971 (Claude Nobs Archives)Yet even after it scraped onto the LP, “Smoke on the Water” still took a while to become a classic. The main single from the album was “Never Before”, which only reached number 35 in the UK singles chart and never became a live staple. Only in 1973, when “Smoke on the Water” was released as a single in the US and started getting airplay on American radio stations, did it finally begin to break through.But although “Smoke on the Water” has now acquired legendary stand-alone status, it still sits best amid the album for which it was intended, as track five (if you’re listening to it on a CD or some other rubbish modern format) or – far better – as the first track on side two, if you’re listening to the proper vinyl LP. It tells the story of the album, and that’s where it ought to stay.Deep purple: There are hellebores- and then there are Rodney Davey’sDeep Purple looks ready to rock old star DenmanDeep Purple made some fine LPs before and some fine LPs thereafter, but they never made anything quite as good as Machine Head. So what made it click? The tight timeframe was one factor – adversity was another. Far from home in the dead of winter, in a quiet resort in low season, there was an element of “all hands to the pump”\u0026nbspas everyone mucked in together.This no-nonsense attitude was reflected in the production. Sound engineer Martin Birch did a brilliant job. The sound he created was clean and sparse, never overly ornate or fussy. He gave each instrument room to breathe. There was very little overdubbing. It was such a palaver getting out of the hotel and into the mobile studio that they often didn’t bother listening to the playback. By modern standards, this was virtually a live album.Nobs died in 2013, after a skiing accident, aged 76. The Jazz Festival is his enduring testament (he also gets a shout-out as “Funky Claude”\u0026nbspin “Smoke on the Water”). The Casino was rebuilt on the same spot, but sadly they didn’t recreate the Belle Époque splendour of the original structure. The modern replacement is a Seventies eyesore. Just think: if it hadn’t been for that idiot with the roman candles, that beautiful building would still be there. But, then again, we’d have never heard “Smoke on the Water”.Montreux Jazz Festival runs\u0026nbspuntil 14 July and Deep Purple play on 4 July (mjf.ch)Smoke on the waterEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But can he be converted?\u0026nbspClick to followThe Independent OnlineI’ll give her this: she is a star. The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in rapturesThree hours of Public Enemy: that’s what I got when I let my son have his choice of music in the car recently. Amid his vast collection of Pokemon trading cards is a set featuring the members of Queens of the Stone Age. And one of my favourite moments as a dad was his overjoyed reaction when I told him I’d got us tickets for Metallica. He’s a music-loving father’s dream.\u0026nbspBut what’s good for the goose has to be good for the gander. Or the other way around. So when Taylor Swift announced that her reputation stadium tour was coming to Wembley, it was a case of fair’s fair. It was my daughter’s turn, even if it meant this Metallica Dad agreeing to a descent into musical purgatory on a Friday night instead of catching up with Game of Thrones.\u0026nbsp“On no, you’ll love it, you’ll have such a good time. I’m so jealous!”That was the response of a shockingly large number of female friends and acquaintances, many of whom volunteered to accompany my seven-year-old daughter Rheya\u0026nbspwhen I expressed trepidation at the prospect of an evening in the company of 100,000 screaming Swifties.\u0026nbspThe ersity of those it came from took me aback: people I just couldn’t imagine would be fans were saying it.\u0026nbspThere were culture vultures and rock fans. Twenty-somethings, thirty-somethings, and forty-somethings. Some with no children, others with a hatful, whose daughters, like mine, they were taking. I sometimes found myself saying, “what, you too?”Taylor Swift seems to hold a good chunk of the female population in her thrall. And not a few men too. Quite an achievement for a onetime country singer.\u0026nbspIt seems to be Swift’s particular way with words that has drawn them in. Nashville is renowned for its story tellers. But Swift’s stories have resonated with a far wider constituency than is usual for singers coming from out of that milieu. \u0026nbspRheyaAt her Wembley show, she likened what she does to the opening up her diary. The chronicling of the ups and downs of her love life, her biting back at bad boyfriends, her reflection on experiences many of those who count themselves her fans will have had, speaks to them.\u0026nbspSelina Mills, a writer friend of mine, and one of those who had me saying “what you too?”, says she serves up “emotional truths” with that diary.\u0026nbspAnother friend, Karen Attwood, who runs Nine Media Training, says: “She’s as good with an acoustic guitar as she is with a big pop anthem and I just love her lyrics. She is having a conversation they’re gorgeous, often very funny and sarcastic.”\u0026nbspIt never hurts if you can make ’em smile. Swift does it for her fans in the same way that a cutting rhyme from rapper Chuck D does it for me. Hey, whatever floats your boat.\u0026nbspFrom beef to BFFs to beef again: Kanye West and Taylor SwiftNEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 13:   Kanye West (L) jumps onstage after Taylor Swift (C) won the Best Female Video award during the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards at Radio City Music Hall on September 13, 2009 in New York City.

Right now, it’s them against us. This shit is ugly to the core. When it comes to the poor, no lives matter!” Now that’s the sort of the conversation I want to have.\u0026nbspFeeling suitably purged and, yes, a little self-righteous, I felt able to spend an afternoon in the company of Taylor. But after the first half hour I almost felt like saying “look what you made me do”\u0026nbspto Rheya. And my editors, because I didn’t find listening to her latest missive any easier than her fans might find sampling Slayer.\u0026nbspIt’s not that I can’t recognise a good pop song. Everyone has their guilty pleasures. But reputation’s hooks seemed swamped in a sea of expensive production. Here a backing singer trills, there a rapper rhymes, as the vocals tail off into electronic distortion. Meanwhile\u0026nbspSwift reflects on the trials and tribulations not so much of being a teenager, but of being an uber-famous member of the 1 per cent, a bona fide mega star, with the requisite stable of hip hop style feuds.\u0026nbsp1989, her first “official”\u0026nbsppop record, I found more approachable, and memorable. I confess, I already had some familiarity with that album on account of indie troubadour Ryan Adams covering the whole thing. He somehow managed to put a wistful and melancholy sheen on an upbeat and feisty pop record, widely recognised as the highpoint of her career to date. Moving further back, Nashville becomes progressively more noticeable, and Swift’s stories more innocent and easier to hear.\u0026nbspBut what about the show designed to showcase it all? If not the hottest ticket in town, it was certainly the priciest, part of an effort, it has been argued, to neutralise the scalpers who would have profited handsomely through gouging fans had Swift left money on the table.\u0026nbspI have to admit: a part of me was intrigued. I’ve been going to gigs for more than 30 years now (it makes me shudder to have to say that) and I’ve seen almost everything. Metal, indie, jazz, rap, soul, punk and more besides. I’ve been to decaying fleapit clubs, massive arenas, festivals and, yes, even great big stadia.\u0026nbspBut what I’d never experienced before my evening with Swift was one those bona fide pop mega tours the sort of thing featuring a cast of thousands, that takes several planes, and a fleet of trucks to move the thing from to venue to venue, and turns over the GDP of a small country.It was a world apart from the stadium shows I’ve previously been to. The Stone Roses, for example, needed only their songs, together with the odd inflatable ball bouncing up and down in the crowd, to make for a thoroughly memorable occasion last summer, one worth the price of tickets that weren’t exactly cheap themselves.\u0026nbspA Swift show, by contrast, majors as much on spectacle as it does on music. There were, at Wembley, enough huge snakes to send an ophidiophobic fan running for a\u0026nbsptherapist. Apparently their presence stems from an insult the Kardashian married to Kanye West lobbed at her, and they’ve since become something of a trademark. One’s probably pending.\u0026nbspThere was fire, and fireworks, and films. There was the obligatory army of dancers. Everyone was given a light bracelet on their way in, which seemed to change colours at the command of someone armed with an iPad backstage. The effect was actually rather pretty, if not exactly environmentally friendly.\u0026nbspThere was even a sort of floating cage of lights to ferry Swift between the three (count ’em) stages and, at the end, a bloke whom I’m reliably informed was once in One Direction, came on to perform a duet. Neither me nor my daughter were quite sure who he was, although his presence seemed to delight the crowd. \u0026nbspAs for Swift herself? Well, I’ll give her this. She is a star. The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in raptures.\u0026nbsp“Thank you for joining us on the reputation stadium tour,” she said. It was a line she repeated several times. I could almost hear the business manager whispering in her ear: “Don’t say anything that could be considered controversial, but make sure you reference the brand at least once every 15 minutes or so. It’s good for T-shirt sales.”In the middle of this assault on the senses I was again left wondering whether Swift isn’t in danger of losing that connection she has forged. But then, about halfway through, with her occupying stage number two, she produced an acoustic guitar and just sang. She did the same with a piano later on. It worked too. Whatever Swift is, she is no manufactured talent, incapable of surviving without studio trickery, and solely reliant on others to play the instruments. It made me wonder if all the extra stuff was really necessary.\u0026nbspThe reputation\u0026nbspalbum may not have done the business 1989 did, and Swift may have strained her connection with some, but her still loyal fans lapped up everything she did.\u0026nbspCrucially, so did my daughter. All my criticisms started to pale before her sheer unabashed joy. It would have made any parent melt, and the zone of protection I thought I’d established by wearing my Metallica tour T-shirt, with a suitably gruesome design, was breached. In a world that seems to grow grimmer by the day, I couldn’t help but be uplifted at my child’s innocent delight. I even found myself enjoying myself, if vicariously.\u0026nbspAttwood says part of Swift’s appeal, as a parent, is that “among all the hyper sexualised pop stars she is a fantastic role model for my daughter”.\u0026nbspTaylor Swift brings Robbie Williams on stage to sing ‘Angels’ Taylor Swift launches UK ‘reputation’ tour in ManchesterTaylor Swift marks Pride Month with heartfelt speech in ChicagoIs Taylor Swift off-loading her Beverly Hills property portfolio?And I get that.

Since getting one of those Amazon Echo Dots, my chip-off-the-old-block son has been constantly playing what he tells me are Geometry Dash composers. They play electronic video game music that leaves me cold.My daughter, meanwhile, has developed an obsession with Metallica’s Master of Puppets, to the extent that sometimes she’s even had me saying “can’t we have something else on?”.\u0026nbspIt means I might have to enjoy our next live experience vicariously.

The planet is roughly three\u0026nbspbillion kilometres from the central star, about the same as the distance between Uranus and the Sun.The dark region that can be seen in the middle of the photo is because of\u0026nbspa coronagraph –\u0026nbspa mask that blocks the blinding light of the central star and allows astronomers to detect its much fainter disc and planetary companion. It is that mask that allows the planet to be formed, since otherwise the bright light of the star would overwhelm any light coming from the planet itself.These discs around young stars are the birthplaces of planets, but so far only a handful of observations have detected hints of baby planets in them, said\u0026nbspMiriam Keppler, who led the team who found the still-forming planet. The problem is that until now, most of these planet candidates could just have been features in the disc.As the first planet for scientists to get a confirmed view of,\u0026nbspPDS 70b will serve as a useful test of theories about how planets come to exist.

No one should ever have to hide who they are or who they love.“We can be proud that the UK is a world leader in advancing LGBT+ rights, but the overwhelming response to our survey has shone a light on the many areas where we can improve the lives of LGBT+ people.”While describing the plan as a “welcome start”, including the proposals on conversion therapy, the prominent LGBT+ campaigner Peter Tatchell, who is due to attend a Downing Street Pride reception on Tuesday, said it fell short on key issues such as the deportation of LGBT+ refugees and described a £4.5m fund in the plan as “derisory and insulting”.“The biggest fail is the lack of any pledge to end the detention and deportation of LGBT+ refugees fleeing persecution in violently homophobic countries like Uganda, Iran, Russia, Egypt and Jamaica,” he said.He continued: “Another big omission is the absence of any commitment to compensate gay and bisexual men who were convicted under past anti-gay laws. They suffered greatly frequently being hit with huge fines.“Some were jailed and beaten in prison. They often lost their job, income and home. Many suffered mental breakdowns. Their lives were wrecked for decades. The government’s unwillingness to include compensation in its action plan is a huge let down.”UK news in picturesFloral tributes left at Gorleston beach in Norfolk where a girl was fatally thrown from an inflatable A firefighter carries a water hose past sheep close to scorched moorland as it burns during a moorland fire at Winter Hill, near Rivington,People march in central London to mark the 70th anniversary of the NHS.People look at the damage to the outside of a high-rise block in Wellington Way, Mile End, in east London, after a fire broke-out in a 12th floor flat.Prime Minister Theresa May holds up a Belgium football shirt given to her by Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel, center left, during a round table meeting at an EU summit in Brussels.

Attitudes have changed but there are still pockets of society where we’re far from safe.She continued: “We’re really pleased that the government is listening to the thousands upon thousands of LGBT+ people who responded to this survey and are investing funds in areas where LGBT+ people face some of the harsher inequalities, such as health care.“We now need people in all of Britain’s communities to also come out for LGBT+ equality and to stand up against the hate and abuse we face daily.Labour’s shadow equalities minister, Dawn Butler, said she was “glad “ the government was paying more attention to LGBT+ issues, but added: “Much of this plan is yet more reviews and consultations”.She continued: “Cruel and inhumane conversion therapies have been allowed to spread fear and hatred in our society for far too long. Unfortunately, this report does not commit to legislative change. We call on the government to bring forward legislation which proposes nothing short of a full ban.“With one in five LGBT+ people experiencing a hate crime in the last year, we are disappointed that the government has not met Labour’s call to make these crimes an aggravated offence, the same as hate crimes based on race and faith.“It’s exasperating to see the government reannounce an announcement they made a year ago about consulting on the Gender Recognition Act. Labour is calling for the Act to be updated to ensure greater protections for trans people, and we urge Theresa May to finally work with us to make it law.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The Central Bank of Venezuela, which did not immediately respond to request for comment, has not independently released inflation figures in at least a year.\u0026nbspVenezuelan president, Nicolas Maduro, has passed blame for the roiled economy onto others, including opposition activists and officials in Washington. At a campaign rally in May, he blamed hyperinflation on criminal mafias.But economists point out that Mr Maduro runs the unorthodox policies they say have pushed the country into economic crisis. The socialist leader has repeatedly refused international aid to Venezuela.It\u0027s internal, Professor Hanke said. Government spending continues to accelerate and the sources of revenue start drying up.The government has defaulted on a majority of their outstanding bonds, which economists estimate add up to about $60 billion (£45 million). Foreign exchange reserves have fallen by about $2.5 billion ($1.9 million) in the last three months, according to analysis by Capital Economics.\u0026nbspAs state-run oil industry PDVSA falls apart, economists say a rise in global oil prices is adding to the pain. Brent crude oil is up more than 64 percent this year. And as President Donald Trump cracks down on Iran via zero-tolerance oil sanctions, the international benchmark has rallied more than 8 percent\u0026nbspthis week.Production at PDVSA\u0026nbsp- which accounts for 95 percent of export earnings in the country and a quarter of gross domestic product - was cut in half from January 2016 to January 2018, according to the US Energy Information Administration. And as the crisis deepens, operations are continuing to wane.Those conditions, Professor Hanke said, have all but killed investor sentiment.\u0026nbspThere\u0027s an expectation part of it, too, Professor Hanke added. Everyone who has a bolivar wants to get rid of it like a hot potato because they expect it\u0027s not going to be worth anything tomorrow.The International Monetary Fund estimated in January that Venezuela\u0027s inflation rate could rise as high as 13,000 percent for all of 2018. Professor Hanke was unsurprised by the discrepancy, saying no one can accurately forecast the course or the duration of a hyperinflation.In pictures: The crisis in VenezuelaA girl scavanges for food in the streets of CaracasA man scavenges for food next to girls in the streets of Caracas.

A recent university study found that about 90 percent of civilians were living in poverty last year and most of those surveyed had lost an average of 25 pounds in body weight.\u0026nbspThe hyperinflation is devastating the economy, said Andres Abadia, a senior economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He expects the economy to contract in 2018, for a fifth consecutive year, and sees no turnaround in the near-term.Mr Abadia said Venezuela is a disaster area and that as long as Mr Maduro is in power, the economy will continue to collapse. But Mr Maduro reaffirmed his\u0026nbsptight grip on power last month, easily winning\u0026nbspanother six-year term in what was widely condemned as a fraudulent election.\u0026nbspMr Maduro tripled wages earlier in June to 3 million bolivars per month, which Reuters reported at the time was equal to just more than a dollar at the black-market exchange rate.When asked if the wage increase might improve living conditions in Venezuela, Professor Hanke replied: No, it\u0027s a joke.

Since then Johnny has seen his life spiral out of control.He admits to struggling with drugs and depression and he’s lost much of his £459million fortune.He’s embroiled in court battles over money and was pictured recently looking incredibly thin and pale.When I interviewed him at the end of last year he was clearly “well refreshed” and virtually incoherent.Maybe having to face up to his child’s health problems could actually be a turning point for Johnny.His family need him right now and he will have to step up to the mark. ONE of the feel-good ­stories of the week was the kind students who raised enough money to send Bristol University cleaner Herman Gordon to visit his family in Jamaica.Herman was beside himself with happiness and cried tears of joy when he opened his gift envelope to find it stuffed with cash for the trip.He’s clearly a very ­special man and much loved by the students, who said he brightened their lives and they simply wanted to give him ­something in return.Herman was part of the Windrush generation and can’t afford to go back to Jamaica too often.But now he and his wife can have a wonderful visit.This little shaft of light gives me hope for the future and shows there is still a lot of decency in the world.Herman also now knows that he makes a real difference and is greatly valued – and you cannot put a price on that. A HUGE thank you to everyone at Edinburgh Napier University, which presented me with an honorary arts doctorate this week.It was so moving to see all the young, hard-working students come up on stage at the Usher Hall to receive their degrees in front of beaming parents, family and friends.Two years ago I saw my daughter Rosie awarded her honours degree in journalism on the very same stage.I was so proud of her I could have burst.It was lovely to be able to follow in her footsteps and it really was a day to remember.  DESPITE not having watched a frame of Love Island, I’m obviously well aware of the show that has divided the nation.But what really strikes me is how similar they all look in the promos and newspaper photos.It’s no wonder the girls bounce from one chap to another when they are merely identical hairless Ken dolls.The same goes for most of the girls. The hair colour and bikinis might be a different hue, but they have that heavily browned, slightly startled, puffy-mouthed look of a sex doll.Which I suppose is the point.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Last October, this column urged Mrs May to get the Cabinet to Chequers and not let them leave until they had agreed on the final deal with the EU they should be aiming for.This delay in setting out what the UK wants is one of the many mistakes that have handed the initiative in these negotiations to the EU.In an attempt to prevent any walkouts at Chequers, the Prime Minister will spend the next few days seeing senior ministers individually. “She’s peeling off people one by one,” I’m told.But I understand there has still not yet been a “model that has been selected to go forward for adjudication by the Cabinet”. I am told the approach at the meeting will be “to rule things out rather than rule things in”.Cabinet Brexiteers, though, are already nervous about getting bounced — of being presented with a done deal they will have to either accept or resign over.One of those co-ordinating the Brexiteer response tells me: “She’ll have to show her hand before Chequers. The idea of bouncing people with papers they haven’t seen is completely unrealistic as to where we are.It might have been possible six months ago, it is not possible now.”Brexiteers are worried about Downing Street’s direction of travel.One tells me: “They’re prepared to give away things, but they don’t understand what they are giving away.”The expectation is that the Government will essentially propose staying in the single market for goods.But what won’t be addressed is what this means for immigration.The EU will — at least initially — demand free movement in exchange for the UK staying in the single market for goods.I understand the current plan is for the white paper to say the UK acknowledges that labour mobility deals normally go alongside trade deals. But there won’t be much more detail than that.Sajid Javid, the new Home Secretary, takes the view that the Government shouldn’t put immigration on the table in these talks until it knows what it wants.He is also of the view that if the EU want a deal on immigration then they should have to ask for it.As a former banker, with experience of commercial negotiations, he — unlike too many people in the Government machine — understands the difference between bid and offer.Among Cabinet ministers there is a growing view that they will all be back at Chequers in September to discuss how much they are prepared to move on immigration.But any attempt to get the UK to allow any EU citizen with a job to come here will encounter resistance.“If you can come if you have a job, that’s basically free movement,” one ally of Brexit Secretary David Davis tells me.Getting the Cabinet to agree at Chequers, though, is only the first challenge for Mrs May.The next — and even more difficult one — is to get the EU to engage with what she is proposing. CONCERNS are mounting in Whitehall about the Nato summit, and what Donald Trump might say and do.Compounding the issue is that Trump will go straight from the summit to a dinner in Britain to mark the start of his visit here – meaning Theresa May won’t be able to avoid having to say what she thinks of his comments.One well-placed Government source insists to me that the Trump/May relationship is better than it is portrayed.But this source admits his telephone manner can be rather surprising.I am told that, in reference to Brexit, he regularly starts their conversations with: “Are you out yet?Mrs May hosts his UK visit on July 13, right after he’s laid the law down at the Nato summit and before he flies out to meet Vladimir Putin. She must stress that lives are at stake. That the West’s security has relied on Nato for 70 years.And that it would be a disaster for the President to undermine it now, with Russia an increasing global menace.THE restoration work at the House of Commons has hit a snag.Some of the oil paintings, which need to be moved, are too big to go through the doors of the rooms they are in.This means that the oil will need to be rehydrated, a complex process, before the canvases are rolled up so they can be moved.This is another reminder of how difficult it will be to do these restoration works without going way over budget. MICHAEL GOVE has ripped up Theresa May’s plan for a new customs partnership with the EU.To the surprise of officials present, Gove tore the document in two at a meeting on Wednesday.After the Brexit inner Cabinet couldn’t reach a consensus on what customs relationship to have with the EU after Brexit, it was split into working groups to look at the two options.Gove was looking at the new customs partnership, which is Theresa May’s preferred model and would see the UK collecting tariffs on the EU’s behalf.Nearly all Brexiteers, including Gove, see this model as bureaucratic, unworkable and fear it will make Britain a far less attractive country to do a trade deal with.Gove and Liam Fox, the two Brexiteers on the three-man working group, had made these points repeatedly in the six weeks of meetings they have had on the subject.But on Wednesday night, when they were presented with the civil service summary of their discussions, they found these points had been downplayed to almost nothing.Instead, the document implied the group thought the new customs partnership was workable.Gove was livid about this and physically ripped it up to show he wasn’t prepared to accept the document as a summary of their discussions.This flash of anger shows that Downing Street would be making a very big mistake if it assumed Gove will accept – and sell to fellow Brexiteers – any deal with the EU, no matter how flawed it is and how much it tied the UK’s hands for the future.Customs will be one of the biggest bones of contention at Chequers.I understand there is talk the model favoured by Brexiteers MaxFax might be altered to include tariff alignment with the EU.But if that’s the case, then Britain WON’T be able to have a proper, independent trade policy.One of the Brexiteers close to the discussions warns this is the “breaking point of what people are prepared to accept”. THERESA MAY is making it clear to everyone in government that she intends to stay on as Prime Minister after Brexit day, March 30, 2019.Yesterday afternoon, Downing Street summoned the Government’s political advisers and told them to start working on measures to be included in the next Queen’s Speech, to take place in spring and after Brexit day.A Downing Street source tells me: “As you would expect, the Government is focusing on a comprehensive programme of domestic legislation for the next session of Parliament.This will include new plans for the country’s future outside the European Union.”This Queen’s Speech will be huge for Mrs May.It will be her last best chance to show her party she has a domestic agenda that justifies her staying on as Prime Minister.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

To which the EU’s Michel Barnier will inevitably reply: “No. It’s full single market membership, including free movement of migrants, or nothing.”Then what? What else has No10 got?There are red lines Theresa May must not cross: free movement, independent trade deals, our courts’ supremacy. She won’t survive conceding on any of them.We weep for Downing Street’s tactics.They seem ­terrified that the PM might have to walk out of talks. Why? If the EU continues to demand everything on its terms, she must do exactly that.They’ll call back.GOBBY Irish PM Leo Varadkar has no idea how much damage he does with every Brexit utterance.His latest salvo revealed a patronising, pompous arrogance as misplaced as it was sickening.The mighty EU won’t change its rules for little Britain, Varadkar sneered.“We’re 27 member states — the UK is one country,” he said. “We’re 500million people, the UK is 60million. That basic fact has to be understood.”The Sun has some more basic facts:Ireland’s population is 4.8million. The UK’s is 66.5million.Ireland’s economy relies on us so heavily that a “no deal” is forecast to throw 2.5 per cent of its workforce on the dole. It is far more exposed than any other EU country, or the UK.Our billions bailed out broke Ireland in 2010. Has Varadkar forgotten?Is he happy to sour relations with millions of UK customers with long memories, who may take against Irish goods?A wiser man would have acted as peacemaker, constructively helping both sides forge a historic deal in all our interests, including those of his country and its wonderful people.Instead he chose another role . . . as the snivelling suck-up egging on the playground bullies.THERESA May must seize her crucial opportunity to save Nato next month.Donald Trump is rightly berating Europe’s major powers for failing, unlike Britain, to fund their defence. But Nato is not some unfavourable trade deal he can abandon at a stroke.Mrs May hosts his UK visit on July 13, right after he’s laid the law down at the Nato summit and before he flies out to meet Vladimir Putin. She must stress that lives are at stake. That the West’s security has relied on Nato for 70 years.And that it would be a disaster for the President to undermine it now, with Russia an increasing global menace.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They must also achieve an outcome which allows the UK to take back full control over our laws, our borders and our money.Any wavering or compromise that keeps Britain as a cash cow for Europe, and our people and businesses subjugated to EU laws that hurt our interests, would be a spectacular own goal.Instead of pandering to those who want to keep Britain in the EU, the Single Market and Customs Union, the team at Chequers must now stand firm and not back down.Their strategy and game plan must be to stand up to the EU and stop letting their negotiating team walk all over us.So far we have been negotiating with the EU in good faith and we have conceded too much ground for little in return.We have pledged a divorce settlement totalling £40billion and while we have advanced a package to ensure that the rights of EU citizens currently in the UK are protected, the rest of the EU have made alarmingly little progress on protecting the rights of British citizens living elsewhere in the EU.Conceding further ground to the EU now will leave Britain exposed at the back and will let the greedy undemocratic EU leaders take advantage of our open goal.The country also decided to take Britain on a new path to future prosperity.Outside of the EU the world is growing at a fast pace.Expanding consumer markets present new opportunities for exciting trade and investment partnerships. Technological change and innovation happens worldwide and the EU’s place in the global economy is falling fast.Ministers must not allow Britain to slip in the world trade league by being chained in any way to Brussels as the EU sinks.Without the straitjacket of EU rules Britain will stand out as a strong place for businesses to invest.While an out-of-touch elite who want to keep Britain in the EU continue to spread fear and doom and gloom, in the real world our economy is doing well.We have some great foundations and since the referendum Britain has seen a surge in foreign direct investment to record levels which shows the high degree of confidence investors have in Britain.They see that outside of the EU Britain will be successful and everyone in the Cabinet should stop playing defensively and commit to that vision too.We are at a crucial moment in our history and Cabinet members need to understand the magnitude of the decisions   they are making.Now is not the time for grandstanding or for egos to get in the way. Ministers need to tighten ranks and play as a united team to achieve victory.The future of our country is far too important to leave to chance and if the Cabinet gets its act together this week then we will be in control of our own destiny.In years to come, people will look back at the decisions we make today and judge members of this Government on whether they have advanced the cause of freedom, prosperity and democracy with a well-executed match- winning plan . . . or left our country to the fate and uncertainty of a penalty shoot-out.Priti Patel is a Conservative MP, representing  Witham in Essex. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Way better, in fact, without wanting to sling mud, than many other commentators who — regardless of their gender — can barely string two words together.Because, of course, whether or not you are good at your job has got absolutely nothing to do with your gender, right?Until, that is, you are a woman in football, or some other realm that men consider belongs to them.Then, it turns out, it’s a problem. For some men at least.Just to be clear, the idea that football is a “guy thing” is totally outdated. More women watch football in the UK than watch EastEnders (and that’s when there isn’t a World Cup on).And that’s just watching it. I’ll get on to playing it in a minute.Still, Simon Kelner, the former editor of the Independent, wrote in a column this week that women talking about World Cup games “is like getting a netball player to discuss major league basketball”.Then former player Jason Cundy gave his five cents worth, saying that women are unsuited to commentate on football matches because “their voices are too high”.And — although I had to watch it from behind a cushion because I was cringing so much — former Manchester United defender Patrice Evra gave Eni Aluko an actual round of applause for her analysis of one match. . . because he was so surprised that women, you know, know stuff about football too.(Her face when he did so was priceless: Withering look personified.)In case you didn’t know, Eni Aluko has more than 100 caps for England as a player. She also has a first-class degree in law. She is super brainy, bright and articulate — and she knows an awful lot about football.I am full of admiration for her. She is such a strong woman. She is also more than qualified to comment on a football match.Sadly, “more than qualified” is often what women need to be to get ahead in a male world.Eni Aluko is a high-powered lawyer, a professional sportswoman who adds serious value to the commentary of any match.Patrice Evra must know her credentials. But some men, when they feel threatened by a woman, respond by patronising her. They try to put her down. Diminish her. Banish her back into her box.As a woman working in sport I am familiar with this.Lots of men who think women in football are encroaching on “their” territory do the same to me. The number of suggestions I’ve had to get back in the kitchen — and far worse — are too many to count.It doesn’t bother me. But it is tedious and annoying.Men who respond to women in this way can’t quite accept that a new generation of women are coming to the fore and using their voice.They really can’t get their heads around the changes that are happening so quickly — the emergence of women who are using their voice, taking “their” jobs.Luckily, they are a dying breed, these men who want to keep women in the Victorian ages.Plus, it is beginning to dawn on them that we aren’t going back into the box.And they’d better get used to it because it’s not just women commentating on football who are being taken more seriously. It’s women who are playing it too.I’m proud and excited to say that West Ham is one of 11 clubs with new Women’s Super League licences.This really is going to change the face of women’s football.Tier one, the Women’s Super League, starts next year and West Ham is part of that.And the Super League is going to mean a lot more money, professionalism and structure for women in football.So to anyone who is worried about female match commentators all I can say is: Hold on to your hats, boys.REBEKAH Vardy got slammed this week for speaking out about being in Russia.She said that she took the role of supporting her husband – and being there for him before a match – very seriously, saying: “I would be mortified if I was pictured leaving a bar absolutely p***ed, knowing that my husband was going to play one of the biggest games of his life the next day.”Of course, some wasted no time laying into Rebekah’s version of feminism since it included being present for her husband which – according to comments I read – undermines feminist values.I have to say I really disagree.Whoever said that you can’t be a feminist and also stand by your man?I LOVED reading about Christine Lampard, who is pregnant, saying she, “couldn’t care less” about putting on weight as long as everything’s OK inside.In an age when many pregnant women barely look like they are expecting, only to “snap back into shape” within days of giving birth, that’s such a refreshing attitude. I felt the same way and allowed myself to eat what I wanted.I know some women crave chalk and coal when they are pregnant but my craving was for Wagon Wheels.At one point I was on about 12 a day. Those were the days.JOOLS Oliver says that being a stay-at-home mum is ten times harder than Jamie’s job running a multi-million-pound cooking empire.She described her role as “brain numbing” and “hell on earth” and said no one respects her in the household. I’m sure lots of eyes will roll at that idea, but I have to say that I agree.The brief run-in I had with being a stay-at-home mum left me full of nothing but admiration and respect for those women who do it on a daily basis.And it made going back to work feel like a walk in the park.LET’S congratulate New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, for being only the second woman ever to give birth while in such senior office.Some people have questioned whether Jacinda can do the job as a new parent. Would that same question ever be asked of a man?WELL this is exciting. Scientists are apparently closer than ever to inventing an invisibility cloak.I’m sure it’s intended for use by top secret agents intent on saving the world.But all I can think about is what a great accessory it would be for any party at which there are people you don’t fancy talking to.Or for eavesdropping on Apprentice candidates.Or spying on the half-time huddle of any team West Ham is playing.In fact, the possibilities are endless.HONESTLY there is no pleasing some people. The number of moans I have heard this week about people who think it is too hot.Just cast your mind back to the past couple of years when it rained solidly for most of June and July – and count your lucky stars.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

which is unprecedented in its bluntness - has been leaked to The Sun.In it, former US Marine Corps general Jim Mattis says Washington DC is “concerned” that Britain’s military prowess is “at risk of erosion”.With threats around the world spiralling, America now expects the UK to hike its cash to the military to help counter them “beyond what we would expect from allies with only regional interests”.In an ominous threat, the general also makes it very clear that while Britain may want to “remain the US partner of choice”, France is already boosting its defence spending - and is waiting in the wings to replace us.President Trump wants an answer from the UK by the time he arrives in Europe next week for the NATO Summit, Mattis adds.The letter’s revelation today is a deep embarrassment to Theresa May, and plunges her into a fresh political crisis.Defence Secretary Mr Williamson, backbench MPs and British generals have all pleaded with her to hike the MoD’s budget and fill its £20bn blackhole.But the PM is adamantly refusing, alongside Chancellor Philip Hammond.The letter from highly respected General Mattis - nicknamed “Mad Dog” when he was in the Marines -  was sent on June 12, three days after he held talks in London with Mr Williamson while his guest at Trooping the Colour.In the two page letter, General Mattis argues that Britain’s position as a leading world power “has been the credibility of the UK’s armed forces”.But he adds: “I am concerned that your ability to continue to provide this critical military foundation for diplomatic success is at risk of erosion, while together we face a world awash with change”.For the first time in the letter, the senior US politician also gives a firm hint that Washington now wants Britain to go beyond  the NATO minimum of spending 2% of GDP on defence, which the government only just about meets at the moment with the inclusion of pensions.Mattis adds: “A global nation like the UK, with interests and commitments around the world, will require a level of defense (sic) spending beyond what we would expect from allies with only regional interests.“Absent a vibrant military arm, world peace and stability would be at further risk”.Purposely highlighting Paris’s recent pledge to pump an extra £260bn into bolstering its armed forces by 2025, Mattis adds: “As global actors, France and the US have concluded that now is the time to significantly increase our investment in defense.“Other allies are following suit.”And dropping the hint that the Special Relationship is now in peril with France in ther wings, Mattis goes on: “It is in the best interest of both our nations for the UK to remain the US partner of choice.“In that spirit, the UK will need to invest and maintain robust military capability.“It is not for me to tell you how to prioritize your domestic spending priorities, but I hope the UK will soon be able to share with us a clear, and fully funded, forward defense blueprint that will allow me to plan our own future engagement with you from a position of strength and confidence.“In advance of that, the President and I look forward to hearing details of the progress you have made with your Modernizing Defence Programme at the upcoming NATO Summit.”Generals are calling on Mrs May to increase the MoD’s budget to 2.5% of GDP a year, which would see a cash increase of £6bn-£7bn.In comparison, the US spends 3.6% of the biggest GDP in the world on its military.But Mrs May has infuriated Tory backbenchers by repeatedly refusing to commit to maintaining the UK’s status as a Tier One military power, saying only that the UK would be a “leading nation” instead.Former Chief of Defence Staff Lord Houghton warned on Saturday: “US observers have come to realise we are living a lie.“President Trump is not remotely impressed by our national pretension to be America’s greatest ally.”The letter will also be seen as more evidence that Mrs May’s relationship with Donald Trump is under increasing strain.Fears are mounting in Downing Street that the President will use next week’s NATO summit in Brussels to announce a major US drawdown unless more members states step up their military funding.The letter – leaked to The Sun by military sources – has been copied to the Chiefs of the three armed forces, as well as No10, and National Security Advisor Sir Mark Sedwill.Senior Tories last night called on Mrs May to urgently act on  Mr Mattis’s warning.Former  defence minister Mark Francois MP told The Sun: “For many months, the Defence Committee has been arguing that we must increase our defence spending, not least to remain a credible ally of the Unietd States.“This letter is a real wake up call that we need to invest to maintain our leardership in NATO, and I hope the Prime Minsiter takes urgent note.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

To her we will be eternally grateful.Long recovery process ahead. Hes lucky to be alive.Police confirmed they are investigating the crash and are appealing for CCTV of the incident.Detective Inspector Paul Raikes said: “This was a shocking incident that has left one man with a very nasty leg injury and understandably overwhelmed by what has happened.“A full investigation is underway to identify and arrest those responsible.“We would appeal for anyone with information to come forward and would also like to hear from anyone who may have CCTV , dashcam or mobile phone footage of the incident.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000356955835.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"daily aspirin could help to stop alzheimers in its tracks scientists believe","story":"Tests on mice showed the over-the-counter medicine destroyed rogue proteins which build up in the brain.These clump together into plaques which stop brain cells communicating with each other — leading to the memory loss and confusion typical of the disease.Aspirin is already used by millions to reduce inflammation in the body, the process which triggers most major life-threatening illnesses.The US team has found the painkiller also boosts a chemical which cleans up cells of plaques, including those made of the amyloid beta proteins  in the brain which are linked to Alzheimer’s.They are hopeful the mice results will also be found in humans, and that an aspirin pill a day could prove a new way of fighting the dementia.Prof Kalipada Pahan of Rush University Medical Centre in Chicago, said: “At present, there is no effective treatment for preventing or halting the disease.“Oral administration of a low dose of aspirin decreased amyloid plaques in male and female mice.” About 850,000 Britons live with Alzheimer’s and dementia.Prof Kalipada Pahan of Rush University Medical Centre in Chicago, said: “At present, there is no effective treatment for preventing or halting the disease.“Oral administration of a low dose of aspirin decreased amyloid plaques in male and female mice.”About 850,000 Britons live with Alzheimer’s and dementiaOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We have been very clear that has to be on the basis that the whole of the UK leaving the EU as one.Mrs Mays statement in the Commons today came as she prepared for a summit at Chequers on Friday where Cabinet ministers will finally sign off on what they want from the final Brexit trade deal.Ahead of the crunch showdown, pro-Brexit Tory MPs have launched an increasingly bitter war with their Remainer colleagues in a bid to stop the PM backsliding on her red lines.Jeremy Corbyn said: The Prime Minister is stuck in the middle of two warring factions, but she now needs to pick a side.Eurosceptic Conservative Desmond Swayne asked: Will Brexit be recognisable as Brexit?Mrs May replied: There has been much jocularity around the term Brexit means Brexit - but it does mean Brexit.But ex-minister Nicky Morgan urged her not to listen to the arbitrary red lines set out by the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg, adding that she should aim for a pragmatic, sensible and flexible Brexit.And Mrs May refused to rule out extending the Brexit transition period or adopting the same goods tariffs as the EU.The Government today faced fresh chaos as it was claimed ministers are considering a new third way on customs different to all previous proposals - but Brexit Secretary David Davis claimed to know nothing about it and was seen visiting Number 10 for talks on the issue."},{"url":null,"title":"thorpe park stuck tidal wave rides broken heatwave","story":"Riders were stranded at the top of Tidal Wave ride at around 2pm, after multiple rides broke down.Visitors at the Chertsey theme park became irate after staff were flirting with each other instead of fixing the three different rides that had broken down.Footage from the Chertsey theme park shows a group of visitors appearing exhausted still as they wait for help.A witness who filmed the incident said: Tidal Wave ride at Thorpe Park breaks down leaving riders stuck at the top in 30-degree heat.Theyve been up there a good 20 minutes now with a member of staff climbing up then down 120 minutes queues for the ride. A member of staff can be seen walking along the ride to try and solve the apparent mechanical issue.Complaining on Twitter, Rebecca Thorpe said: Ive now queued for 3 different rides that have broken while in the queue, and the rides we have been on all the staff are too busy flirting with each other that we ended up sitting on rush for 5 mins waiting to get off... ridiculous.It comes after passengers were trapped on a Thorpe Park roller coaster, after it was halted mid-ride in 2016.Staff shut down the 100ft tall Colossus ride after a passenger stuck their legs out of the carriage on a huge incline.Rescue teams launched into action after staff spotting one rider putting their leg outside of the cart on CCTV.The pictures show guests being cautiously escorted down the stairs at the side of the track while others remain pinned to their seats.The Sun Online asked Thorpe Park about issues regarding other broken rides.A Thorpe Park spokesperson said: We can confirm that Tidal Wave did briefly stop at the top of its lift today.Our on-site engineers immediately attended and the ride was back up and running within ten minutes.We ensured that any affected guests were given water and free ride access passes.

Not Piers, who went on to issue a further challenge: “On Thursday night, you can watch England destroy Belgium, then watch me destroy Love Island straight after.”So I did. No further comment is needed on the first bit of Piers’ equation. But, hell on TV earth, I can’t ignore the second.A “one-off special” called Good Evening Britain which attempted to cash in on the breakfast magic and must have seemed like a great idea until England v Belgium became a loser-takes-all non-event, the wardrobe department shoved Susanna Reid into a Spanish Flamenco dancer’s outfit and someone lost control of the guest list.’Cos all of the pre-publicity for this one assured me there’d be just three present: Danny Dyer, the Labour Party leader and a slightly spooked Pamela Anderson, who set the first alarm ringing by claiming: “When they told me Jeremy Corbyn’s going to be here I thought this was going to be a serious political ­programme.”Why the hell a dissembling old fool like Corbyn would make anyone think that is a bit of a mystery, but ­serious was the last word you’d use to describe Good Evening Britain.They weren’t alone either. The joint was jumping, in fact, with David Ginola, Amir Khan, Ed Balls, Tory MP James Cleverly, Harry Redknapp, BGT comic Daliso Chaponda and live feeds from a reporter in Russia and Andi Peters at Emmerdale’s Woolpack pub.As GEB quickly demonstrated, of course, the reason chat shows don’t invite nine guests to appear is that you instantly have nine chaotic voices clamouring for attention and often talking at cross-purposes.All it then takes is one guest to throw a spanner in the works and the whole vibe collapses, as it duly did when Piers and Susanna started asking Pammie about her French footballer boyfriend, Adil Rami, who she claimed was “doing really well”.Susanna: “He’s not played yet.” I haven’t been watching, I’ve been looking after my father who’s just had a stroke.” When someone drops a bombshell like that, clearly, you need to steer the conversation away pretty sharpish which, in fairness, Piers did by asking Amir Khan: “Do you have a sex ban before fights?”Only with his wife, I’d imagine, Piers, but thanks for asking. It set the perfectly awkward tone for the entire evening. For GEB to be classed as a true TV disaster, though, it still needed three other things to happen.The first were technical glitches, which duly arrived when the satellite link to a bunch of drunk England fans went down. The second was Andi Peters referring to Emmerdale as “Coronation Street”. Check.The third and most important, however, was for one of the guests to get a bit sweary and lairy. Enter Danny Dyer who ensured GEB will enter TV folklore, when he launched into Brexit, asking: “What’s happened to that t**t David Cameron? He’s in Nice with his trotters up. He should be held to account for it . . . t**t.”The far more pertinent bit of his ­contribution, though, was the moment he addressed the host: “Just stop talking, Piers. Just talkin’ talkin’, ramblin’ on.”Breakfast TV would be a hopelessly dull, molly-coddling chore again without Piers’ ego and all his boastful predictions, which just for the record, ended with the following score, on Thursday.Good Evening Britain — 2.91million viewers. Love Island — 3.2million. Boom.Martin Keown: “When you play in midfield you’ve got to have legs.”Guy Mowbray: “We haven’t seen anything of Di Maria in Argentina’s first three games. Although he only played in two of them.”Alan Shearer: “Portugal were very much like Portugal.”And Lee Dixon: “We’ve had five balls that have gone flat. Three times that’s happened.”(Compiled by Graham Wray).WHATEVER our differences elsewhere, I hope there’s one thing on which we’re all agreed.The greatest quiz show in television history is Bullseye.An opinion confirmed when I tapped those magic eight letters into my Sky Planner’s search engine last week, and its back catalogue unfurled before me, including episode one of series one, which, for a TV critic, is like finding the source of the Nile.I don’t expect you to watch every episode, obviously, but if you have time for one, make it episode eight of series two. It’s as funny, heart-warming and brilliantly formatted as you remember. But the most remarkable thing is, hardly any of it would now be considered fit for broadcast.For not only is Jocky Wilson smoking a fag as he attempts the 301 or more challenge, Jim Bowen, can’t help drawing attention to a facial scar on a contestant’s face.“You’ve obviously had an accident, tell us how.” “I was 11 years old, it was a petrol can blew up on a building site.” “Lovely to be able to talk about that, smashing.”Broadsheet newspaper columnists, right-on comedians and other handbag-clasping s of the nation’s morals will, of course, say: “Well thank goodness we’ve moved on since then.” Which is precisely the reason none of them will ever create a show as beautiful as Bullseye or say anything remotely as funny as the bellowing climax to the prize board, on show eight.Bully’s special prize?“What every woman dreams of. A full-length Scandinavian mink coat.”RANDOM TV irritations: Jeremy Corbyn’s insanely annoying habit of giving a triumphant little sniff every time he thinks he’s made a good point.BBC presenters turning Aneurin Bevan into the L Ron Hubbard of their NHS cult. News ­reporters describing everything that’s happened quite a lot as being: “On an industrial scale.”Over-familiar BBC continuity announcers suddenly greeting me with a: “Hi, I’m Russell.” (Don’t care.) And a bite massage therapist from Hollywood called Doctor Dot failing to provide the necessary health and safety warning before she told This Morning’s Eamonn Holmes: “Ruth’s going to be biting you tonight.”’Cos she’d have bitten off more than she could chew if she did.The Chase USA, Brooke Burns: “Alphabetically, what day of the week comes first?” Andy: “Tuesday.”The Chase Australia, Andrew O’Keefe: “In which decade of the 19th Century was the Crimean War fought?”Simon: “The 1950s.”Andrew O’Keefe: “TV series Twin Peaks is set in which fictional town?”Dan: “Transylvania.”“No, Twin Peaks.” NHS cultists gathered last week to applaud, grovel, sing, dance and grin like madmen in its honour.I exaggerate a bit, obviously. The singing and dancing doesn’t begin until tomorrow night on ITV.It was still an unsettling experience though, watching BBC2’s NHS At 70: Live, from The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, in Birmingham, hosted by Anita Rani a level eight cultist from The One Show, Nick Robinson and Helen Skelton, who was in the maternity unit warning that we may “hear screaming”.As well as the massed ranks of staff, there were also NHS bigwigs and former patients who were encouraged to stand, clap and thank nurses, doctors, ambulancemen, chemists, the woman on reception, everyone.The nasty suspicion is, of course, that all this BBC worship, which makes Kim Jong-un’s birthday celebrations look really half-ar*ed, carries a political edge and is designed to shut down every single argument apart from the ones that say:A)The NHS needs more money. Or B) the NHS needs a s***load more money.As righteous as it might make them all feel, however, deep down they know it makes for wretchedly dull television.Hence the presence, on this one, of Britain’s Got Talent winner Lost Voice Guy, who not even the resuscitation unit could help with gags like: “Laughter is the best medicine.

Without a Parliamentary majority and with a Cabinet that has ­forgotten Lord Melbourne’s definition of collective responsibility “it is not much matter which we say, but mind, we must all say the same”, nonetheless she carries on.Perhaps the vicar’s daughter is inspired by the hymn “Jesus good above all other, gentle child of gentle mother, in a stable born our brother, give us grace to persevere”.It is certainly a grace she has been given in abundance and it is also her great strength.As the Cabinet prepares to assemble in the Buckinghamshire countryside it may choose to reflect on what we have already done and it should consider what unity and determination can deliver.The European Communities Act will be repealed next March. The country is now leaving the EU in its own domestic law, just as the UK was already leaving the EU in international law under the relevant treaties.The United Kingdom has irrevocably set a new course. One where the nation will be free to make its own laws and conclude its own trade agreements, free to take back control of its immigration policy and no longer obliged to pay “Eurogeld” in return for the dubious privilege of following EU laws.The question for the Cabinet at Chequers is what to do with the freedom the British people want reinstated.Does it seize this great opportunity to do things better, to forge new trade relationships, to have better laws, regulations and policies, or does it follow the managers of decline to place a once proud country in a tremulous state that sees Brexit as mere damage limitation?This is a historic decision and one the Prime Minister is well placed to make. Theresa May has the vision and has put the law in place to leave the EU. However, there are political challenges ahead.There is a need to overcome a fear of the future. In leaving the EU, the UK will have a new relationship with it based on trade without political convergence. Trade between two friends and partners who respect each other’s internal legal authority.This is the case for the majority of world trade. Yet there are still those who advocate the vassal state, with the UK accepting the domestic application of EU laws as a price of trade — something no other trading partner agrees to.Then we need to call the Irish bluff. There is no insurmountable problem concerning the Northern Ireland border and any solution which would split the UK in two is outrageous. That the EU suggested it is offensive.This fake alarum should be seen for what it is: Domestic Irish politicking in advance of a general election, with Dublin being gullibly exploited by Brussels.The Irish government, if not the European Commission, thought that Dublin had “cast-iron guarantees” which suited them last December, then again last March, and they had hopes of finally getting them in June.They have been disappointed each time by their friends on the continent. Ireland is being used by the EU to put pressure on us. The Taoiseach’s announcement that he is supporting Belgium over England might get cheered in Irish pubs but it is not getting them anywhere in Brussels.What ought the Cabinet to decide on Friday? Above all it must maintain the clear negotiating line set out at the beginning: No deal is better than a bad deal, and plenty of bad deals are on offer.Fortunately, David Davis, with his titanium-plated spine and his ministers in the Department for Exiting the European Union, have ensured that preparations for a “no-deal” scenario are well advanced.There can be no sensible argument that we have to take a bad deal because a “no-deal” outcome has not been prepared for. This is simply incorrect, primarily thanks to the Brexit minister Steve Baker.The Cabinet should agree that if there is to be a deal, it has to be agreed in detail prior to our departure.There is no legal reason to pay £39billion to the EU on our departure and if there were no guarantee of a trade agreement, it is something I would strongly oppose in any vote in the House of Commons.Likewise leaving the EU into the purgatory of a perpetual transition would be foolish.If a bad trade agreement should be rejected, what exactly is a respectable one?It must be judged against the UK’s economic interests but there are some things that no independent nation could agree to.Any attempt by the EU to impose its laws and court on the UK, either directly or indirectly, must be rejected. Any EU agreement that restricts the country’s ability to make trade agreements with other states, restricts our ability to control our migration policy, makes us pay to trade or interferes with our fishing waters could not be accepted. Indeed many MPs would vote against such propositions if brought to Parliament.In this regard Michael Gove was right to tear up any form of the idiotic customs partnership. The Prime Minister commands the support of Brexit-backing MPs, Conservative Party members and Brexiteers in the nation at large.This is why her opinion poll ratings remain so high. Yet the metropolitan establishment of fashionable society and the beau monde is still against her. Theresa May must stand firm for what she herself has promised.One former Tory leader, Sir Robert Peel, did decide to break his manifesto pledge and passed legislation with the majority of his party voting the other way so leaving him dependent on opposition votes.This left the Tories out of majority office for 28 years, 1846 to 1874. At least he did so for a policy that worked.At Chequers the Prime Minister must stick to her righteous cause and deliver what she has said she would. She must use her undoubted grace to persevere.It is incredible to watch Europhile Tories savage Jacob Rees-Mogg simply for insisting, as he does on this page, that Theresa May should keep the promises she has repeatedly made.Of course she must. The future of her Government and our democracy hinge on it. Yet her top aide Oliver Robbins reportedly intends on Friday to demand that the Cabinet signs off what amounts to a betrayal of the referendum vote.His strategy, to stay in the EU’s single market for goods, already looks fatal to regaining full control of immigration, freeing ourselves from the sway of the European Court of Justice and striking our own trade deals.And that’s before Brussels formally rejects it, as it will. Michel Barnier will then demand full single market membership, with free movement, and kill our ambition to trade independently too.What will Mrs May do then?The Sun has always believed her pledges to take back control of our ­borders, laws and money. We still agree that “no deal” is better than a bad one. But the EU is now clear that a bad deal is our only option — and Barnier admits he’s not even negotiating.Will the PM ever say enough is enough and honour her “red lines”? Or will she cross more of them? How is Robbins’ plan Brexit? It’s not.Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, David Davis and Liam Fox must not stand for it. Nor must sensible Cabinet Remainers.Voters are not dumb.

I was struck by just how many respondents said they cannot be open about their sexual orientation or avoid holding hands with their partner in public for fear of a negative reaction.“No one should ever have to hide who they are or who they love “This LGBT action plan will set out concrete steps to deliver real and lasting change across society, from health and education to tackling discrimination and addressing the burning injustices that LGBT people face.”LGBT hate crime had been experienced by 40 per cent of those surveyed, with more than nine in 10 of the most serious offences going unreported.The plan aims to look into the scale of LGBT abuse online, improving mental healthcare, combating bullying in schools, and increasing awareness of the services for victims of sexual assault and domestic abuse.Laura Russell, of the LGBT campaign group Stonewall, said it was “heartbreaking” so many people had been offered conversion therapies.She added: “Our 2015 Unhealthy Attitudes report revealed that one in 10 health and social care staff across Britain witnessed colleagues express the dangerous belief that someone can be ‘cured’ of being lesbian, gay or bi.”Human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell backed the move on conversion therapy.

I was later told I had tonsillitis.Its so unfair on all of us. I had a really good holiday but at the end I just wanted to get home.Nobody should have been in that situation.Im still in a lot of pain today and will be going to the doctors later.I would never use Thomas Cook again.One passenger told Sun Online they saw many people having panic attacks while others reportedly stripped to deal with the unbearable heat.Pregnant women and babies were apparently left to their own devices, while passengers claim two people were rushed to hospital.Desperate holidaymakers say they broke into chanting in a bid to leave the overheated aircraft, with temperatures said to reach up to 48C in the back of the plane.The 214 people on flight MH1805 were expecting to fly to Stansted airport at 2pm, and were initially told the delay was down to the plane needing to be refuelled.They say they were repeatedly told they were taking off in a few minutes, and forbidden from leaving the grounded plane.Lee Palombo was on the plane with his wife Flordelise, a nurse who rushed to assist a pregnant woman who was struggling to breathe.The 43-year-old from Papworth, Cambridgeshire, said passengers begged for water but were denied it.“I can’t fathom why they didn’t give us any drinks, he said. Someone could have died on that plane.“I’m very concerned that they would keep people on the plane in that boiling heat, I’m healthy so I was okay but people were getting really ill.Diabetic passenger Isabella Wright said she nearly passed out from the heat and lack of food and described their treatment as horrific and a breach of human rights.The nightmare continued off the plane, as exhausted passengers were finally sent to hotels after the flight was eventually cancelled.A pregnant lady was said to have been taken to different accommodation and told to stump up cash, and ended up spending the night in workers accommodation without air con or a shower.Isabella Wright added that her hotel room was dirty and unhygienic and had no clean spaces for her to carry out injections vital for her diabetes.A Thomas Cook Airlines spokesperson said they would be looking into the individual claims, and confirmed passengers had departed Zante at 9am local time this morning - 19 hours after the scheduled departure.They added that passengers were taken to a number of different hotels where they could get rooms, and all passengers were given welfare and dinner in addition to a hotel.We tried to fix the issue so that we could get customers on their way as soon as possible, but we recognise that we should have disembarked the aircraft earlier."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000304336002.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"britain poorest need major income raise","story":"Alarming research by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation found transport, childcare and energy costs are up to two thirds more expensive than a decade ago - but earnings have barely risen in real terms.It found families on low incomes were facing bigger barriers to meet rising costs than a decade ago - despite tightening their belts and shopping around online for better deals.The JRF’s Minimum Income Standard (MIS) calculator found a single adult needs to earn £18,400 to buy the basic costs of living, each parent in a working couple with two children needs to earn £20,000 and a lone parent with a pre-school child must earn £28,450.The MIS is a model created by the Centre for Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University as a barometer of living standards in the UK.Since 2008, the cost of a minimum basket of goods and services has risen by 35 per cent for a single adult and by 30 per cent for a couple with two children compared to a 25 per cent increase in the Consumer Prices Index measure of inflation.The outlook is bleakest for pensioners - who have faced a 50 per cent rise in the cost of their basic living costs since 2008.JRF called on the Government to allow families to keep more of their earnings by increasing the Work Allowance under Universal Credit.This would help three million working families on low incomes reach a decent standard of living, said JRF.The report said public transport has become much more expensive and bus services have been cut so that transport costs take up nearly a fifth of minimum household budgets.Bus travel is 65% more expensive in 2018 than in 2008 so for a single person the minimum transport budget has risen from £17 to £37 a week, said the report.The average cost of food rose by just over a quarter between 2008 and 2018, but a minimum food budget for a single person rose from £29 to £44 a week, a rise of just over 50%, while energy bills are over 40% higher than a decade ago.Childcare costs have risen sharply, with the average price of a full-time nursery place for a two-year-old rising by more than 50% in the past decade to £229 a week.Campbell Robb, chief executive of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: “These figures show just how precarious life can be for low-income households.“People who live below the minimum standard say that they shop around to get the best deals and juggle to pay the bills, but the soaring cost of transport, energy and childcare means millions of families are still locked in a daily struggle to make ends meet.“Some working parents are actually further away from reaching a decent living standard because tax credits to top up low wages have been falling at a time when families need them most.“The Government must put things right by allowing families to keep more of their earnings. This would ease the constraints the crippling cost of living places on their ability to build a better life and ensure everyone can reach a decent standard of living.”A Government spokesman said: “We recognise some families face real challenges with livings costs and that is why we are helping them earn more and keep more of what they earn.“Our increases to the national living wage have put £2,000 more into people’s pockets, we are backing families by providing 30 hours free childcare and have cut income tax for 31 million people.”Labour’s Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Margaret Greenwood said: “By cutting social security while the cost of essentials is rising steeply, the Tories are making a conscious choice to push low income families into poverty.“For all Theresa May’s talk of helping the ‘just about managing’, her Government has made life more difficult for people across the country.“Labour would halt the roll-out Universal Credit, which is clearly causing great hardship, and introduce a £10 Real Living Wage to ensure that work pays.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In the letter Mr Verhofstadt also raises concerns about how an independent monitoring authority to guarantee EU citizens’ rights will work in practice.And he calls for a “dense network” of information centres to be set up across the country where people can get help filling out their applications.Euro MPs also want the Government to commit to ruling on whether or not people can stay within a short window of as little as two days.

Nor must sensible Cabinet Remainers.Voters are not dumb. They will smell a sellout instantly.It would be a national calamity — suicidal for the PM, her Government and party.“It’s not negotiation - it’s a capitulation.”Senior Eurosceptic Tories confronted the PM in the Commons yesterday to angrily demand the PM scotch other rumours that she wants the UK to join the European Economic Area alongside Norway – the ultimate soft Brexit.Sir Bill Cash branded EEA membership for Britain as “preposterous” and that it would “undermine democracy if that were true”.Mrs May replied: “The EEA would not deliver on the vote of the British people.”Sir Desmond Swayne asked Mrs May if Brexit could still be “recognised as Brexit”.To laughter from Opposition MPs, Mrs May quoted her own catchphrase to insist: “There has been much jocularity around the term ‘Brexit means Brexit’, but it does mean Brexit”.Arch Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, exploded rivalries by warning Mrs may she would split the Tories in two as Sir Robert Peel did in 1846 if she gave up her Brexit red lines to strike a deal with Brussels.The Somerset MP also called for Theresa May to stand firm for what she herself has promised.He was savaged by a series of Tory moderates, including foreign office minister Sir Alan Duncan.Accusing Rees-Mogg of “insolence”, Sir Alan accused him of “lecturing and threatening the PM”, adding: “The ideological right are a minority despite their noise \u0026amp should pipe down”.Grandee Sir Nicholas Soames: told him to “shut up” and “put a sock in it.But Sir Alan’s own boss in the Foreign Office, Boris Johnson, leaped in to defend Mr Rees-Mogg.Some pro-EU politicians want Britain to stay in the customs unionafter Brexit - but that has been ruled out by Theresa May, because it would stop us striking any new trade deals with the rest of the world.Last year, the PM set out two possible paths for the future customs relationship between Britain and Europe.One option is the customs partnership - which would mirror many aspects of the existing customs union.It would see the UK collect tariffs on behalf of the EU for any goods which enter Britain on their way to the continent.The advantage of that would be no border checks would be needed between the UK and EU, particularly on the key Irish border, but Brexiteers worry it would tie us too closely to Europe.The alternative is known as maximum facilitation - a hi-tech arrangement where automated systems check goods as they flow across borders in a way which helps business trade freely.But EU bosses have cast doubt on whether the right technology exists to make that solution work.While the row may seem technical, many Brexit backers regard it as crucial for the UK to take total control of our trade and customs arrangements, or risk making our EU departure pointless.Theresa May faces a major challenge finding a solution which is acceptable for both hardline Eurosceptics and the pro-EU Tory rebels.The Foreign Secretary tweeted: “ It’s vital that all MPs are able to air their views on Brexit.“Whatever your position, I hope we can all agree that Jacob Rees-Mogg is a principled and dedicated MP who wants the best for our country.”Mrs May was due to address rich Tory donors at the party’s annual summer fundraiser at the posh Hurlingham Club in West London.She will also travel to the Netherlands today to explain her latest thinking to Dutch PM Mark Rutte, and Berlin on Thursday to see German boss Angela Merkel.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Children are frequently reported to experience panic attacks, bed wetting and altered behaviour when a parent is detained.The criticism comes in the wake of family separations in the United States, where images of imprisoned children screaming for the parents has prompted widespread condemnation. In the UK, Home Office regulations state that children are neither split from both their parents nor placed in detention for immigration purposes.But in less than two years Mr Beales says BID has dealt with several cases in which Home Office enforcement has meant children being taken into care.Among them are the four children of Kenneth Oranyendu, who was detained when he reported to the Home Office after dropping them off from school in March.His wife was in Nigeria for her father\u0027s funeral at the time, and the 45-year-old begged immigration authorities to allow him to pick his children up from school. But he was referred to an immigration detention centre 200 miles away, and his children placed in care.Within a few days of his arrest Mr Oranyendu\u0027s wife was able to return to the UK to collect the children, and the family are now together after he was released on bail.But he still has to report to the Home Office every two weeks, and fears he could be detained again. His children, aged between six and 17 and all British citizens, have been \"shattered\" by the separation.\"Every time I go out of the house they are afraid I\u0027m not going to come back,\" he said. \"They are terrified we will abandon them, and suffer from panic attacks. They wake in the middle of the night to check if their mum and dad are still there.\"Mr Oranyedu has a conviction for drugs smuggling - a crime he denies - and was detained by immigration detention after he served his sentence.

The culture created a ‘callous system’, which led to long standing lawful residents losing their NHS treatment.  The Home Affairs Select Committee demanded a ‘root and branch reform of the Home Office’s culture, policies and approach to immigration following the Windrush scandal .  MPs carrying out the probe have called for a more speedy response to help those whose lives have been torn apart by the Home Office’s mistakes.  They said it was “unacceptable” that the government was yet to come clean about how many people have been unlawfully deported and detained. The specialist taskforce has so far been contacted by 8,000 people who arrived in the UK as long ago as the 1950s, with more than 2,000 receiving documents confirming their right to stay in Britain. But the cross party committee says the department’s response does not go far enough calling for passport fees to be waived for Windrush cases and a compensation scheme which recognises emotional as well as financial hardship. They expressed dismay that the government seemed to have ruled out their suggestion for a hardship fund for those struggling with debts incurred trying to prove their right to stay in the UK. More widely the committee called for a an end to the net migration target which “creates perverse incentives”. And they urge a rethink of the so-called hostile environment policy which they say is “irresponsible” without checks in place to stop abuses. Committee chair Yvette Cooper said: “Time and again we heard evidence about the culture of disbelief that has developed in the Home Office in recent years, about people feeling they were being set up to fail, and a complete lack of proper checks or safeguards to prevent injustice. She added: “Oversight in the Home Office that should have caught these problems completely failed. “The Windrush generation, who have contributed so much to Britain, have been badly let down. “The Home Office has a responsibility to make sure nothing like this can ever happen again. “In the words of Paulette Wilson, wrongly detained and threatened with deportation, ‘You cannot keep treating people like this.” "},{"url":null,"title":"cash strapped councils cant afford","story":"NewsBin collections \u0027on brink of collapse\u0027 as councils grapple with £8billion black holeLocal authorities may no longer be able to afford core services such as running libraries, fixing potholes or even collecting rubbish by 2025\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByAndrew GregoryPolitical Editor22:14, 2 JUL 2018Updated07:37, 3 JUL 2018NewsBin collections are “on the brink of collapse” (Image: Huddersfield Examiner)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBin collections are “on the brink of collapse” as councils face a \u0026pound8billion funding black hole, council chiefs will warn today. Local authorities may no longer be able to afford core services such as running libraries, fixing potholes or even collecting rubbish by 2025 because of the cash crisis. It will leave services like the pick-up of household waste from millions of doorsteps “damaged beyond recognition”, experts say. The Local Government Association says Chancellor Philip Hammond’s next spending review will be “make or break” for councils. In the decade to 2020, councils will have suffered cuts in core funding from the Government of \u0026pound16billion. And authorities face an alarming funding gap of \u0026pound7.8billion by 2025, according to a report. The LGA issued the warning at the start of its annual conference, in Birmingham.  Cash-strapped councils are now dipping into their reserves and many are in danger of running out of cash. And because of the desperate bid to keep social care services running, other services including weekly bin collections are now under threat. LGA chairman Lord Porter said: “We’ve reached a point where councils will no longer be able to support our residents as they expect, including our most vulnerable – let alone help the country to prosper. “More and more councils are struggling to balance their books and others are considering whether they have the funding to even deliver statutory requirements. If the Government allows the funding gap... to reach almost \u0026pound8billion by the middle of the next decade, our councils and local services will be damaged beyond recognition.

Simon Stevens told MPs it was very concerning that products marketed as healthy often contained large amounts of sugar. On average children are having the equivalent of three sugar lumps at breakfast. For poorer children that is often much worse. That is obviously contributing a lot to the childhood obesity epidemic, he said. The Government\u0027s childhood obesity plan published last month set out a range of measures - including a ban on supermarket check-out promotions involving sweets and fatty snacks - intended to halve childhood obesity in England by 2030.  But Mr Stevens told the committee they also needed to look at the ingredients that went into products such a breakfast cereals. Calorie labelling, traffic-lighting, changed promotional approaches in the retail sector - they have all got to play their part, he said. But I think we are going to need to see much greater action on food reformulation over the next several years in the way that we have begun to see on sugar, sweet and beverages.

Launching the report, committee chairman Lord Bew said: “A majority of MPs do not hold remunerated outside interests, and a number of MPs hold outside interests which would be considered within ‘reasonable limits’. “However, where a small number of individuals have taken up outside interests beyond what might be considered reasonable, it risks undermining trust in Parliament and parliamentarians. “We are therefore recommending a package of important reforms to address issues concerning MPs’ capacity to fulfil their parliamentary duties and responsibilities to their constituents and to mitigate the potential for undue influence on our political system. “To demonstrate high standards, Parliament needs to be more transparent with the public about the registration and declaration of interests.” "},{"url":null,"title":"theresa may im proud britain","story":"NewsopinionTheresa May: I\u0027m proud Britain is a world leader in LGBT rights - but we can do betterOur LGBT Action Plan sets out the concrete steps to help improve lives for LGBT people and eliminate the discrimination and inequality they face\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByTheresa May00:01, 3 JUL 2018Updated09:22, 3 JUL 2018NewsopinionTheresa May says there is more to be done to safeguard the LGBT community from discrimination (Image: PA)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThis summer thousands of people will be celebrating Pride at more than 80 events across the country, from Manchester to London, and Brighton to Aberdeen.

But I know that, in 2018, many LGBT people still have to deal with discrimination, hatred and even violence and I’m determined to do something about it. Last year we launched the first national LGBT survey which attracted more than 108,000 responses, making it the largest survey of its kind anywhere in the world. Some of the findings make for difficult reading. I was shocked to learn that two-thirds of people avoid holding hands in public with same-sex partners for fear of a negative reaction.  That so many people fear the consequences of this simple gesture shows that a society in which we are all treated equally and fairly is still some way off. Two in five of the people surveyed had experienced verbal harassment or physical violence simply because of their sexuality. Worse still, 90% of those people felt they couldn’t report it because “it happens all the time”. It’s for reasons such as these that we’re publishing our LGBT Action Plan, setting out the concrete steps to help improve lives for LGBT people and eliminate the discrimination and inequality they face. We are going to appoint a national adviser on health inequalities, so the specific needs of LGBT people are at the heart of the NHS. We will continue our investment in programmes to tackle homophobic, biphobic and transphobic bullying in schools, protecting LGBT students and confronting hatred in all its forms.

Then it’s probably time to upgrade your stereo to something with more features and better performance…\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByHolly Thatcher17:29, 28 JUN 2018Updated17:13, 29 JUN 2018Advertorial\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWhen you think back to the family car journeys from your childhood, there’s a good chance that many of them were spent listening to the crackle and whine of a sporting event played out on an old-fashioned medium wave radio. Given how much the technology in our homes has advanced, it’s surprising how many of us are still using a last generation radio– particularly as DAB upgrades and wireless connectivity for cars are so affordable. If you think it could be time for an upgrade, here\u0027s some helpful tips for choosing a stereo, and some specific recommendations. Upgrading for sound   Depending on the age of your car, even a modest update could improve the sound. Even if your car came with a digital radio, it might even be worth upgrading to one that supports DAB+ for even better digital quality and more stations. What can your car handle?   Car stereos are usually sold in two sizes: either single or double DIN. As a rule, a double DIN stereo will be able to offer you a bigger screen. It’s far easier to create a stereo that offers built-in navigation in a double DIN socket, and with many modern stereos offering video playback when you’re stationary, it’s useful to have the extra screen size. What to look for in an upgrade   If your car stereo doesn’t have Bluetooth built in, then upgrading will give you access to the music on a Bluetooth-equipped phone. That means you\u0027ll be able to listen to music streamed from Spotify or Apple Music while you drive. Many car stereos have a 3.5mm line-in (headphone jack style), while some now offer USB ports. So even if your phone isn\u0027t Bluetooth enabled, connecting an iPhone, iPod or Android phone will allow you to play music over the USB connection and keep your phone charged at the same time. The Sony MEX-N4200BT offers all of the above and costs just \u0026pound99. There’s even a CD player here for your retro music (so the kids can say, what’s that funny silver circle?). Apple CarPlay and Android Auto   One of the greatest upgrades you can get for your car is to add support for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Stereos that use these are designed to make your phone an important part of your entertainment system - they allow you to navigate, communicate and play music, with intelligent voice control via Bluetooth (Siri with Apple CarPlay or voice control with Android Auto). You’ll need a recent phone to use either system. CarPlay works on the iPhone 5 and newer, while you need Android Lollipop (version 5) on your phone to use Android Auto. But not all Android phones support Auto, so be sure to check before buying anything. Some stereos support both CarPlay and Android Auto while some only offer one or the other. Again, it’s wise to check before you buy - Halfords experts can help you choose the right stereo for both your car and phone. Once connected to either system, you’ll be presented with a selection of apps: Google Maps for navigation on Android or Apple Maps on an iPhone. You can also access your music and podcasts through the clear and intuitive interface. Many systems will also give you hands-free calling and voice-activated features like Siri. Touching your phone while driving is now illegal, but upgrading allows you to still use your phone while staying within the law. Being able to change songs using Siri or say “OK, Google, send a message to Mum,” is really great if you’re running late and don’t want to stop to safely use your phone.

Wales Online reports that the blaze destroyed a trampoline, bikes and a paddling pool which belonged to her children, all aged under 12.   Danielle said firefighters told her it was fortunate the wind blew the flames away from the house or the damage could have been far worse. It started at about 3.15pm but it burned for about two hours, Danielle said. My kids were watching it through the window before they were evacuated from the house. If the wind didn\u0027t change when it did, the fire brigade said it could have been much worse. The family live with their gardens backing on to a large open field in Rumney.

And the heat is forecast to remain through the second half of July and August, computer models show. Britain is hotter than 29C Barbados.

Heavily-pregnant Marlo Rankin, 40, panicked and struggled to hold back tears when she was told her daughter Mabel had a rare condition which could kill her. After a \u0027normal\u0027 33 weeks of pregnancy, she was left unsure whether Mabel would live or die after the infant\u0027s organs shifted into her chest while she was in the womb. The mum and her partner Jeff Bush, 42, were told their daughter\u0027s organs were restricting the growth of her left lung - and that her heart had also grown on the wrong side of her body. At 34 weeks pregnant, Jeff and I were devastated to find out that our baby had a 50% chance of survival, Marlo told . Hearing the \u002750/50\u0027 was a shock and a constant reminder that either side was possible. The weeks leading up to her birth were the most terrifying of our lives.  There were no guarantees that she’d survive. It was hard trying to stay positive, knowing the reality that we could have lost her.  Little Mabel was diagnosed with congenital diaphragmatic hernia ( CDH ), a condition where a hole in the diaphragm results in the intestines - and sometime the stomach - entering the chest cavity and preventing lung growth. In the lead-up to the birth, and the weeks that followed, Marlo said the world just stopped as she and Jeff desperately hoped their precious girl would make it. She described the time as your worst nightmare full of shock, fear and heartbreak as they worried about the worst case scenario - losing their child. She also said watching their daughter struggle for life while hooked up to tubes was the darkest moment of your life, because you have no control. But Mabel, a fighter from the start, defied the odds and has recently celebrated her first birthday - an occasion which will forever be emotional for the family because of what they went through.  Marlo, from Upminster in Essex, said that everything was completely normal with her pregnancy until 34 weeks. The agro business economist for the UN was sent for a routine growth scan at Queen\u0027s Hospital, Romford, in January 2017. But the scan showed something was wrong. Her heart was pushed to the other side of the body, on the right, Marlo said. There was a hole in her diaphragm, which usually separates the lower intestine and spleen from the lungs. The mum was told the hole meant those organs were able to move to the chest cavity, preventing the lungs from developing.  I was panicked, terrified and in tears, trying to get hold of Jeff who hadn\u0027t come with me because we thought it was just a routine appointment, she said. Mabel was our second child and we had no problems with Joey. The whole world stops when that assumption (that there\u0027d also be no problems) goes out the window. It was horrifying. It\u0027s your worst nightmare. You\u0027re under the assumption everything is fine and you are growing a healthy baby - especially that far into the pregnancy.  Marlo said she phoned Jeff crying, telling him you have to come, something is wrong with the baby, prompting the dad-to-be to also break out into tears. Doctors told Marlo her baby needed to be seen by a neo-natal specialist. They waited an hour and a half for the specialist, but Marlo said it felt like forever. The worst case scenario goes through your mind that we might no longer have a healthy baby, and we don\u0027t know what\u0027s wrong, she said.  Marlo and Jeff were told their baby had a congenital diaphragmatic hernia, the cause of which is unknown and occurs in about one in 2000 babies. The couple had never heard of the condition and didn\u0027t know anyone who had. Marlo said the consultant told them their baby\u0027s right lung was developing but the left lung was smaller. They were advised their baby would have to be born somewhere with the highest level of care for infants. Marlo said the consultant told them babies that do survive tend to catch up, but that the early years can be complex. She described her and Jeff going for a coffee after hearing the news, saying: We were both crying and thinking \u0027what will it mean?\u0027 We were thinking of the worst case scenario, that we would lose our baby. Or if it did survive, would it have a disability? We didn\u0027t know. It was a lot of shock and fear.  The next stage was a referral to the King\u0027s College Medical Institute for more detailed scans to determine exactly which organs had moved. It was just a few days until the parents had their appointment, but Marlo said the weekend felt like an eternity. She considered how it would affect their little three-year-old boy, Joey, and all of them as a family. And while they waited for things to become clearer, Mabel kicked so much, she was trying to tell us she was strong, Marlo said. She added: Jeff and I were a really good team. We would both talk to her and say how strong she was. The day of the appointment at King\u0027s was one of the most difficult and exhausting days of Marlo\u0027s life, full of scans and blood tests. Marlo said a consultant spoke to them and said \u0027do you know what the condition is\u0027 and \u0027do you know what the odds are, there is a 50/50 chance of survival most of the time\u0027.  The parents were told that in their case the odds were better, and their baby had a 67% chance of living. But they were warned it would be difficult to tell what would happen until their baby was born. They said as far as they could tell the heart was functioning, but the lower intestine and spleen had moved into the chest cavity and was restricting the growth of the lungs, Marlo said. The left lung had not been able to grow to its normal size. Marlo said a consultant explained to her that she would need to give birth in a special neo-natal unit and that she would be induced. Tests also ruled out genetic abnormalities and Down\u0027s Syndrome at this stage. Speaking about how she felt, Marlo said: We were exhausted but trying to be hopeful that the odds were in our favour. We were trying to stay positive but there\u0027s that fear and that heartbreak. There are people out there in the same situation whose babies didn\u0027t get a favourable outcome.  A week later, they were at the Royal London Hospital where scans confirmed Mabel\u0027s lung had now developed to a reasonable level. They found out the sex of the baby, and Marlo said knowing helped her feel more connected. But being showed around the neo-natal unit was an extremely challenging moment for the mum. You just see babies hooked up to machines, looking helpless and alone, she described. For Jeff it was reassuring because you could see the high level of care they were getting, but for me it was distressing. When the time came for Marlo to be induced at 38 weeks, she got to hold her baby just briefly before Mabel was immediately taken away to be intubated. She was crying and she was pink - and we were thrilled, Marlo told. At least she had enough lung capacity that she could do that. It was an incredible moment and felt like the best start for her. I was in a state of euphoria that she\u0027d been born that the shock of her being taken away didn\u0027t hit until later. Jeff went with Mabel while Marlo was being cared for and sent her photos of their new baby to show she was doing OK. She was lying there, a tiny little thing with all those wires, Marlo said.  But they were constantly reassured and given updates by the team at the Royal London Hospital, who were phenomenal. Nearly four hours after Mabel was born on March 1, 2017, Marlo was finally able to go and see her. She said initially their newborn appeared to be quite strong, but sadly her condition deteriorated throughout the day. The first 24 hours can be critical, Marlo was told, and Mabel was having a lot of trouble breathing. Marlo said: At 15 hours old, one of the consultants said \u0027it\u0027s not looking good\u0027. They were struggling to stabilise her and weren\u0027t sure she was going to make it. I said \u0027what else, what else can you do\u0027. She was struggling for life. There was a team of about 10 people around her helping her. I was so exhausted from the trauma. I remember the two of us sitting, crying, and just hoping she would make it through the night.  It took about 10 days for Mabel to be strong enough for surgery and Marlo described surgeons cutting 3cm on a tiny little body. The operation on March 10 was to move the organs that had gone into the chest cavity and close the hole in her diaphragm so her left lung could develop. Her heart had naturally moved back into its correct position on the left side of the body. Before surgery, we said goodbye to her and prepared ourselves for the worst, Marlo told. But three hours later the surgeon said everything went well. It was a rollercoaster. Although she had been weaned off the sedation, Mabel didn\u0027t wake up until April 1 and doctors couldn\u0027t work out why. Her mum would sit by her bedside everyday holding her little hands and doctors\u0027 advice would be she\u0027s fragile but she\u0027s stable. She even became known as stable Mabel. I\u0027d read and sing to her but it was just so sad, Marlo said. I felt all along that she knew I was there.  While Mabel was in hospital in London, her family was offered free accommodation run by The Sick Children\u0027s Trust and the family were overwhelmed by the kindness the charity offered them.   Marlo said: The Sick Children\u0027s Trust were a life saver for us. Mabel was in hospital for three months overall, in London for nine weeks. For that entire nine week period we had a room provided by the Sick Children\u0027s Trust that was big enough for our little boy to stay with us as well. It meant we were always able to be there with her at her bedside, she was never on her own. On April 7 doctors performed another procedure to drain fluid found in Mabel\u0027s chest that was making it impossible for her to breathe on her own. After this procedure she lifted her arms above her head for the first time, a sign she was going to be OK. She started improving rapidly and was eventually able to be taken off her ventilator and given nasal oxygen by the middle of the month. Then when she was eight weeks old, on April 23, Marlo walked in to see her little girl in her cot breathing on her own.

Mark Acklom, 45, was apprehended at a luxury apartment in Zurich where he had been living under a false name after more than two years on the run, the National Crime Agency has said. The suspected conman left his alleged victim Carolyn Woods in emotional and financial ruin after promising to marry her, it is claimed. A European Arrest Warrant was issued for Acklom and he was believed to be at large in Spain, having been released from a Spanish prison over a \u0026pound200,000 property fraud.  In May last year he was spotted in Geneva, where he was believed to have been with his family. Ian Cruxton, head of international operations for the NCA, said: Like many fugitives, Acklom believed he could remain at large by travelling around Europe, but our international reach means there is no safe place to hide. He was arrested late on Saturday night after the apartment where he was living under a false name was identified.  Ms Woods claims he pretended to be an MI6 spy and lured her into giving him her \u0026pound850,000 savings during a year-long romance in Bath.  She told Sky News last year : I was completely devastated, he left me destitute and destroyed my life. I felt as though I had fallen in love. He told me he had never felt this way about anyone and we must get married.  I\u0027ve still got the wedding dress I never wore. It was all a charade. At the time I actually wished he had killed me. I was suicidal.  He faces trial for fraud by false representation against Ms Woods. Acklom\u0027s alleged web of lies began when he first met Ms Woods, claiming he was Mark Conway - a Swiss banker visiting the UK to buy an airfield.

People on board included pregnant women and mothers with young children who began to \u0027melt\u0027 as the air conditioning unit failed and temperatures soared to as high as 40C, it was claimed. One person even suffered a panic attack, a witness said. Flight MH1805 was expected to depart from Zante, Greece, for London Stansted airport at 2pm on Sunday. Travellers say they were originally told the plane needed to be refueled resulting in an initial one hour delay to the flight. They were then trapped inside for three hours without adequate water supplies resulting in many passing out and throwing up.  Kerry Shippey said: “Nobody minds a delay, things happen, but keeping people in a tin can in 40 degree heat so that people are passing out and throwing up is taking things a little far don’t you think?” Dan Chapman, 22, told the Mirror: “It was very dangerous as there were some very old and pregnant women, as well as babies on board. “Two people passed out and an ambulance had to be sent out for them. “It is illegal to treat animals like this let alone people. “People were very agitated after we were refused from exiting the plane for reasons I am unsure about. I\u0027ve also lost a days work today, as have many others. “It was easily the most uncomfortable experience of my life.”  An 18-year-old travelling abroad for the first time with a group of friends, who wished to remain anonymous, said: “There were only six bottles of water given out to the whole plane, which were supposedly meant for the cabin crew and passengers. Once this had run out cabin crew melted down ice for extra supplies. “I saw one young woman around the age of 17 suffered a panic attack and needed oxygen and was taken away in an ambulance. “I was travelling with a group of nine 18-year-old girls and it was our first time travelling on our own for all of us. It was fairly traumatic and stressful for all involved.  Videos posted online showed restless passengers dripped with sweat and fanning themselves with safety instruction cards. The nightmare continued off the plane, as exhausted passengers were finally sent to hotels after the flight was eventually cancelled. Another holidaymaker told us how she “arrived at our accommodation to find cockroaches on the walls.” She added: “We were told a transfer would pick us up from the hotel at 6am but this didn’t arrive. “We later found out that us and another hotel down the road had been forgotten about. We finally boarded the plane home, 12 hours later.

Little Reginald Fields was hoping to raise cash for candy over the summer, so set up Mr Reggie\u0027s Lawn Cutting Service alongside his siblings and cousins. And they began doing odd gardening jobs in the Ohio neighbourhood. But when the 12-year-old and his team unintentionally cut some grass on a neighbour\u0027s property the police were called over the \u0027trespassing.\u0027 Cops arrived to the shock of other residents.  “If they would have been four white children, the police would not have been called,” said neighbour Lucille Holt-Colden who filmed the children\u0027s hard work.

However, Reggie\u0027s plight has been met with an outpouring of support and money which has given him the encouragement to carry on - and now his business is booming with requests for his services. More than $36,000 has been raised over the last two days through a GoFundMe page , which initially had a target of $1,000.  Reggie is hoping to use the money to buy new equipment.

Lee Ann Jarrell spent an hour perfecting her look on the maternity ward - even contouring while having contractions - and only paused when the pain became too severe. The 22-year-old has defended her decision to film herself applying make-up in her hospital bed before 8lb 2oz Olivia arrived. Instead of making her look vain, she insists the video would show her daughter, now six months, the importance of loving yourself enough to want to look good.  Lee Ann, of Mandeville, Louisiana in the US, said: I just wanted to look glamorous in the pictures of me giving birth - to look picture perfect. “Even if I was sweating, I knew if I saw myself in the mirror, I would think, ‘You look good\u0027. Before the birth on December 14 last year, Lee Ann could never leave the home she shares with her lawyer husband David Jarrell, 36, without make-up on.  She also got up at 5am every day to put her face on, conducting her two-hour regime before her husband woke. Lee Ann, who uses a 14-step make-up regime, said: “I felt ugly without it. I would worry when we were out that my make-up might wear off, too, so I\u0027d try not to sweat or sometimes even smile, to make it last longer.” Even though David insisted she looked gorgeous bare-faced, she refused to believe him.  She added: “He said I was beautiful the way I was and didn’t need to cover up all the time, but I felt a real pressure from girls looking so perfect on social media to look the same.” Hours before being induced at 2am at St. Tammany Parish Hospital in Covington, Louisiana, Lee Ann started on her eyebrows at home. She said: They always have to be asymmetric and just perfect. Afterwards I packed my make-up bag, laden with 20 brushes and all the products I needed to get me looking good.  And at 4am she got to work on her delivery look. Lee Ann, who was a week past her due date, said: “Some people did look at me like I was doing something wrong. But I got my mirror and camera out and began. I wanted to create a natural look and it was a good way to distract me from the painful contractions which had started, too.” Then Lee Ann, who is originally from the Philippines, embarked on her intricate 14 step make-up regime.  Starting with primer, she then applied foundation, followed by concealer, setting powder and face powder. Then she sculpted her cheekbones by contouring, before applying blusher, a highlighter and creating a smoky-eye, using eyeshadows, then applying mascara, lip-liner, lipstick, more setting powder and finally additional face powder. The mum, who met her husband online nearly five years ago, said: “David was sat beside me holding my hand the whole time, telling me I looked great and it was going to be ok. “I kept having contractions throughout and even had to pause doing my make-up on the video, while I dealt with the pain.  Birth is a beautiful thing for a woman, the most natural thing in the world, but there is nothing wrong with wanting to look good yourself, wanting to add some sparkle. Finally, an hour after she completed the look, Lee Ann’s waters broke and she gave birth to Olivia at 12.44pm. Ironically, despite her insistence on having flawless make-up during labour, after her daughter was born, Lee Ann finally learned to love her natural face. She said: “I realised I should be confident being natural and bare-faced.

The youngsters, aged 11 to 16,from the Wild Boars football team, can be seen with beaming smiles in the snaps - believed to be from a previous caving trip - which were shared by an overjoyed relative. Rescue workers at the site were also pictured cheering after hearing the good news while relatives even held a mass prayer session. The rescue mission began when the boys\u0027 bikes and football boots were found at the mouth of the Tham Luang caves, in the northern province of Chiang Rai.  The boys team were trapped by rising waters inside the cave network deep inside a mountain. They are: Chanin Wiboonroongrueng, 11, Duangphet Promthep, age unknown, Phornchid Kamluang, 16, Prachuck Sutham, 14, Somphong Jaiwong, 13, Peerapat Sompiengjai, 16, Ekkarat Wongsookchan, 14, Panumart Saengdee, age unknown, Pipat Phothai, 15, Nattawoot Thakamsai, 14, Adul Samon, 14, Mongkol Boonpium, 13, and coack Ekkapol Chantawong, 25. Nearly 900 soldiers and rescue workers, including members of an elite military diving unit, were drafted in to search the cave system. All 12 boys and their coach were today found alive, according to the regional governor, and an operation to bring them to the surface has begun.  Thai Navy seals have found all 13 with signs of life, Governor Narongsak Osottanakorn told reporters. For around half a mile, the cave is wide open with spectacular limestone rock formations. But deeper in, the the network narrows and signs warn visitors not to venture further during the rainy season, which usually begins in July, because it is prone to flooding.  A national park ranger alerted authorities when he found their footwear and bikes near the entrance to the cave, but no sign of the children. Thai Navy Seals experts swam three miles into the cave network looking for the children before finding them through a previously murky and inaccessible cavern. A Royal Thai Navy commander overseeing the search previously said he was hopeful the boys and their 25-year-old coach would be rescued.

This converted Catholic church is a picture of a bustling, and clearly successful, town centre food market. But just four years ago the Sint-Amandskerk in the Belgian town of Roeselare was lying largely empty, no longer home to services yet maintained by the council with public money. It is just part of the radical transformation of the town - inspired by a British businessman’s plan to revamp local high streets. Bill Grimsey’s report on how we could save town centres was largely ignored in the UK when it was released five years ago. But in this corner of West Flanders, a city of 63,000 people decided he had the right idea on how to turn back the decline of their town centre. And on Wednesday Roeselare will be praised as an example of how towns can prepare for the future in Mr Grimsey’s second report.  So how did they do it? In 2013, like many British towns, Roeselare’s high street found itself in decline. With fewer people, spending less time and money in local shops. “Five or six years ago we saw the challenge presented by the internet and how it could change our city,” Mayor Kris Declercq says. “We knew that if we didn’t put political effort into changing the situation then our town centre would be dead. “With Bill’s report, we saw a way to transform the town and to make sure that we could make Roeselare a place people wanted to live, to raise their children.” The radical plan saw the council rethink its entire approach to how they organised the town centre. “It wasn’t about focussing on shops,” said the city’s economic director Vanessa Dehullu, “but making the town a place people wanted to spend time.  “If we increased the number of people and the time they spent here we knew the retail would follow.” The council drew up an ambitious plan to transform the city centre - building an entirely new public square with a library, renovating the Sint-Amandskerk and the surrounding area into a small green space and renovating the area around the train station. But it wasn’t all big regeneration projects - they redesigned the city’s main shopping street, the Ooststraat, introducing free ‘speedy parking’ for people spending just half an hour in town. Squares like the grand Groote Marte that were once filled with parked cars are now filled with outdoor tables from local bars and restaurants. The entire town centre is covered by free wifi. Mayor Declercq says now, five years after they launched the project, they are seeing the benefits. “People are spending more time in town - they come and they may shop for an hour. But then they are going to the library to see a concert and then they might go for a drink. “So we make the town a meeting place - people come for leisure, for culture or for dinner. But they also come to shop.” Throughout the city centre children are encouraged to play in the areas reclaimed from parking spaces - the cars are now in a nearby underground car park.  The streets are lined with flower beds and water features. “If the town is a nice place, with playgrounds and places people want to be the shops will fill themselves,” Ms Dehullu said. In the middle of a sweltering summer heatwave, people sat under shaded umbrellas enjoying a cold drink or doing some last minute shopping. And when asked about the transformation, locals were overwhelmingly positive. Madina Adamovich, 22, said the changes had restored confidence to the town. “I used to be kind of depressed about how ugly and empty it was around here - but it isn’t anymore. “The atmosphere has become a lot nicer in the city centre, it is a lot greener. “People want to come here now and come from other places - it is totally different.”  It was a view shared by Nancy Lemaitre, 42. “It is nicer to come here to do your shopping now. They put a lot of effort into making the city more attractive and it has paid off. “ But despite the herculean effort, it is not a perfect picture. On the main run of shopping streets, a number of retail units lie empty and Mayor Declercq admits there is more to be done. He said: “Dealing with vacancies is difficult, for everyone shop that opens it can feel like another closes. “We still see that there are some shops that are empty - and so we have to start again and rethink what we’ve done before.” It is this smart approach which gives Roeselare its unique feel. By offering subsidies to local businesses to move into the city centre and fining landlords who leave their property empty, they are fighting back against the decline of big chain shops.  “We don’t have a Starbucks, I have no problem with them, but I don’t think they will open here,” Ms Dehullu said “We have local coffee shops who are just as good. “Local farmers sell their products directly to consumers and we use it as a chance to teach children about agriculture and nutrition. It is about a sustainable economy .” It is this approach that attracted Nancy Windels and her husband Geert Vancayzeele to open their specialist furniture shop Vida Design in the town centre. “Without the help from the council, we would never have been able to take the risk and be able to do this,” Geert said. Standing beside him Vanessa beams with pride. “It is totally possible for towns in Britain to replicate what we have done,” she says. “In fact, I would tell them doing nothing out of fear isn’t an option.”  But she says to make it work councils must have access to cash support from central government and they must focus on delivering a project - even when people question if it is worth it. She said: “It costs money to do this. I am not naive and I know that there were questions about if this was going to be money well spent. It is our job in local government to think further ahead than tomorrow and now in Roeselare, we are seeing the fruits of our labour.” Back in the church people are sitting down for a drink, bags bulging with local fruit and veg. The once empty church is filled with the sounds of shopping and laughter. “It is simple,” says the market’s manager Melanie Vanstaen, “we gave this space back to the community and now they use it.

The 12 boys and their football coach were found alive at the bottom of the cave on Monday, following a nine-day ordeal. But the group will have to bear their ordeal for longer while rescuers work out how to bring them safely out, the governor of Chiang Rai province said on Tuesday. The youngsters, aged 11-16, and their 25-year-old coach, disappeared after going on a hiking trip in the cave shortly before it was hit by flash-flooding, leaving them trapped underground. Nearly 900 soldiers and emergency personnel, including elite military divers and British rescue workers, were called in to find the children. The boys appeared nervous and frightened as they are discovered by the rescue team. A video shot by rescuers in flickering torchlight revealed boys clad in shorts and red and blue shirts sitting or standing on the rock above an expanse of water .  How many of you are there - 13? Brilliant, a British diver tells the youngsters. You have been here 10 days. You are very strong. Thank you, one of the boys says. One of the boys asks when they will get out of the cave, to which the rescuer answers: Not today. You have to dive. Two British divers, John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, were first to reach the boys, having had strong experience in cave rescues, according to Bill Whitehouse, the vice chairman of the British Cave Rescue Council (BCRC).  They found the group along with a team of Thai navy SEAL divers. Rescuers had been focusing on an elevated mound, which cavers have named Pattaya Beach, in the cave complex\u0027s third chamber, knowing that it could have provided the boys with a refuge when rains flooded the cave. The SEALs reported that ... they reached Pattaya Beach which was flooded. So they went 400 metres further where we found the 13 ... who were safe, Narongsak told the cheering group of reporters.  Rescuers now have to decide how best to get the group out in their weakened condition. They have been given energy gels to sustain them while a plan is worked out to bring them to safety. Options considered included waiting until water levels subsided, or teaching the group to use diving gear to navigate the flooded cave. If you ask me now while we are still assessing all sides then I don\u0027t think they will be home soon, Chiang Rai governor Narongsak Osottanakorn told reporters.  The group\u0027s health was assessed overnight by medical teams which will continue to check the health of the group on Monday, said Narongsak, explaining that the boys had sustained light injuries. We categorized their health condition as red, yellow or green, red being the most severe injuries, yellow being mild and green being light. Yesterday, unofficially, we assessed that most are in the green category, said Narongsak. Narongsak said rescue workers would now focus on the rescue phase and then a handover to medical teams waiting outside the cave.  The children vanished with their coach a week ago on Saturday. They are: Chanin Wiboonroongrueng, 11, Duangphet Promthep, age unknown, Phornchid Kamluang, 16, Prachuck Sutham, 14, Somphong Jaiwong, 13, Peerapat Sompiengjai, 16, Ekkarat Wongsookchan, 14, Panumart Saengdee, age unknown, Pipat Phothai, 15, Nattawoot Thakamsai, 14, Adul Samon, 14, Mongkol Boonpium, 13, and coack Ekkapol Chantawong, 25.  The youngsters, from the Wild Boars football team, were later seen with beaming smiles in photos taken by military divers who found them. The rescue workers can also be seen cheering and relatives even held a mass prayer session after hearing the good news. The rescue mission began when the boys\u0027 bikes and football boots were found at the mouth of the caves.  The boys were trapped by rising waters inside the cave network deep inside a mountain. Thai Navy seals have found all 13 with signs of life, regional governor Narongsak Osottanakorn told reporters. For around half a mile, the cave is wide open with spectacular limestone rock formations.  But deeper in, the the network narrows and signs warn visitors not to venture further during the rainy season, which usually begins in July, because it is prone to flooding. A national park ranger alerted authorities when he found their footwear and bikes near the entrance to the cave, but no sign of the children. Thai Navy Seals experts swam three miles into the cave network looking for the children before finding them through a previously murky and inaccessible cavern.

I had always planned to go to the farm to see him but never got round to it so it was amazing that he came to me.“People driving past must have thought I was mad having a donkey in my garden. It was just fantastic – I couldn’t have wished for anything more for my birthday.“We also went out for dinner and visited friends to celebrate but Donkey Bond was an extra special surprise.”Scott said he knew he had to do something special to mark the occasion.“I have been with Sandra for about two and a half years and I was stuck about what to get her for her 50th birthday,” he said.“I was really struggling because she couldn’t tell me anything she wanted and I knew I needed to do something big and a bit different.“My friend’s aunt owns the farm and when we found out there was a donkey being hand-reared in their house because his mother had disowned him, we just thought it was amazing and he was so cute.“Donkey Bond – who is named in honour of James Bond actor Sean Connery – has his own Facebook page and I thought, ‘I wonder if they would bring him to surprise Sandra?’.“We both absolutely love animals anyway and had been following all his social media posts so I knew Sandra would love it.“It was also the first time that Donkey Bond had ever come out for a birthday surprise like this and he was absolutely fantastic.”Scott added: “Sandra is still speaking about it now and I think she will be for the next 10 years.“It really is something for her to remember and I am really glad she liked it.“I also got her a voucher to go up to the farm and walk the alpacas which will be fabulous.“It is even better because I wanted to do it as well so I will able to go along with her.”Nicky said: “Sandra’s reaction when she opened the door was amazing – absolutely brilliant.“Scott got in contact with me because he wanted to do something different for her birthday and he knew my aunt owns Balnuith Farm.“He is a very cute donkey – he lives in the farmhouse kitchen and is toilet-trained like a dog.“There is no chance that Sandra will forget her 50th.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b39ef603b912.jpg ","title":"dundee is football crazy i want to earn my shirt says new united keeper siegrist","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe mix of ambition and expectation is why Benjamin Siegrist jumped at the chance to up sticks and join Dundee United.The giant Swiss keeper wanted to quit Swiss football for a new challenge and believes the Tangerines tick all the boxes.“Obviously the expectations here are high, but I believe it is good to be part of something when expectations are high,” said the 26-year-old, who was an U/17 World Cup winner with Switzerland.“The gaffer is very ambitious and very focused on details as well. I like that about him.“When I knew I was moving, these things were very important to me and that’s why I came here.“The tradition of the club I know and I’ve heard good things about it as well. It should be in the top division and I want to be part of helping the team to go up.”Siegrist confirmed a chat with his team-mate at last club Vaduz, Thomas Konrad, was a big help in him making up his mind to move to Scotland.Where he does disagree with the former Dundee defender is which is the No 1 outfit in his new home city.“I’ve played alongside Thomas for the last two years, so when I did make contact here I called him and asked him about the city.“It’s always good to get some information. He has told me some nice things about the city and he was very complementary about the place.“He tried to tell me the other team was the big one, so I didn’t listen. Obviously he played for them, but it’s all good.“He told me about some derbies but I believe he got sent off in one and did well in others. That’s him.“He did tell me that everyone is football crazy here and, when I arrived in the city myself, I couldn’t believe the stadiums are literally across the road from each other.“It’s good to be in a city where football is really a big thing.”With Slovakian goalie Matej Rakovan also signing up, Siegrist’s first challenge is to claim the No 1 jersey.It’s something he’s up for and believes having two keepers battling for a place in the team will prove a good thing for both men.“You come into a new club and you have to prove yourself. You’ve got to do all you can to earn the shirt. We’ve got to make it as hard as possible for the gaffer to pick one of us.“It’s his decision at the end of the day but I will be putting everything I can into making sure I play.“Everywhere you go you have to have competition. Especially the goalie position, there is only one who can play and, in every time you go, that’s how it is.“It is good to be on your toes, it’s good to have someone pushing you either way, so it makes you train that little bit harder.“It’s a long, tough pre-season and obviously my ambition is to be the No 1 goalkeeper and that’s Matej’s ambition as well. That’s how it should be.”Whether he’s between the sticks or on the bench, his focus is already on what every United fan wants to see – the team getting promotion in the coming season.And after a week working with the new-look squad, he’s feeling optimistic about that.“The main focus of the club is promotion. The first few meetings I had with the gaffer, it’s all about getting promotion.“It’s a hard task, obviously it’s a hard league to get out of, but it’s good to be part of an ambitious club that wants to achieve something.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee lift firm acquires competitor","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee’s Caltech Lifts has announced the acquisition of Coupar Angus-based competitor Scotlifts Scotland for an undisclosed sum.The cash deal means the Dundee firm will maintain more than 1,000 lifts across the UK.Caltech was founded in 1978 by engineer Howard Renwick and is now run by his sons Andrew and Fraser.Scotlifts Scotland owner Scott Murray will join the management team as Caltech’s new installations manager.Scotlifts’ 50 contract clients, employee and company assets will also transfer to the Dundee firm.Caltech managing director Andrew Renwick said: “Over 15 years Scott has built Scotlifts Scotland into a highly-regarded company.”Based at Stannergate Road, Caltech Limited’s clients include the public and private sectors and cover local government, health, construction, oil/energy, renewables and property.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/AB8U9280.jpg-582x564.jpg ","title":"dundee new boy nathan ralph happy to complete switch but wanted his move sooner","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee new boy Nathan Ralph has revealed if he’d had his way he’d have been at Dens Park at the turn of the year.Back in the January window, the Tele reported the Dark Blues were keen on the left-back after being impressed by his performances at National League South outfit Woking.So, too, were several English league outfits but when he heard there could be a chance to head for the Scottish Premiership, the 25-year-old wanted to jump at it immediately.Rather than take the huff when it didn’t materialise, the former Ipswich Town kid, resolved it would happen this summer.“The thing happened in January when Dundee were interested and I said to my manager at the time, look I want to play higher,” he explained.“I don’t think at the time they were keen on me going, so I just thought if I can get a good season under my belt, hopefully, it will still be there at the end of the season. Thankfully, it was and I’m here now.”Over the past week he’s been getting to know his new team-mates in pre-season training.He’s liked what he’s seen of them and is loving the workouts under his new boss Neil McCann.“I’m enjoying it a lot. The training has been very good. Sometimes you feel you are just running and running during pre-season but, to be fair to the manager, he’s had us doing ball work straight away.“With running as well, of course, but it’s been with the ball and match specific stuff so I am really enjoying it.“You can get that hard work when you have the ball as well and it is important because, at the end of the day, we are footballers.“We need to control the ball and things when we are tired in games, so, to me, it makes perfect sense to be training this way.“And I’ve only been here a few days now but already I’ve been impressed with the players. Technically, and in terms of the morale of the squad, they are very good.”While he wouldn’t claim to be an expert on the Scottish Premiership yet, what he’s already realised is that it’s a good place to be right now.With top English Premier League boss Brendan Rodgers already at Celtic and Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard taking the reins at Rangers, he knows it’s a league that’s being noticed.“I don’t know too much about the Premiership up here yet but what I do know is that it’s a good standard and it’s something I’ve been really looking forward to being a part of.“I’m stepping up and it will be a challenge, for sure, but I don’t think I will be out of my depth and I am looking forward to playing in it.“I’ve been told it’s definitely a good time to be coming to this league. There are a lot of good players and a lot of attention with what’s happened at Rangers.“Even without that it is still a good standard and a top league and this has all the makings of a good season for me.”Fans will got their first chance of a first look at Ralph last night when Dundee’s friendly programme kicked off with the short trip up to Brechin.Having finished playing at Woking back in April, he can’t wait to get back to a game situation.“I’m very keen to get started with the games and I’m looking forward to them, that’s what I came here for.“The Betfred Cup is coming soon but I feel with the fitness work we’ve been doing and, with the friendly games coming, we will be ready for them.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people hundreds turn out for familyfun in the sun","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBroughty Ferry Gala Week kicked off on Sunday as hundreds of people turned out for the fete, which took place at Castle Green.There was plenty to keep youngsters entertained, from face painting to traditional games.Also popular were the mods and rockers, who put on a bike display, and the craft fair.The beer tent and barbecue helped keep attendees fed and watered."},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people job opportunities","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA local manufacturer has several positions available.Due to the steadily increasing demand for its products, the firm is looking to recruit city and guilds qualified bench joiners and wood machinists/CNC operators.Applicants who can demonstrate relevant experience of working in a joinery workshop environment may also be considered.The firm is also also seeking to appoint an experienced project coordinator to take responsibility for the preparation of the documentation necessary to enable manufacture to take place.

Stuart has done both during his time there.”Armstrong added: “Southampton seems a really good fit for me. Watching from afar, I really enjoy the attractive football that they play and I’m very happy to be here.“Every season, I put demands on myself to create and score goals. I hope going forwards from here that it will be the same this term at St Mary’s.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b39efdddc2bd-846x564.jpg

how important libraries are to everyone in our communities and we are working with Dundee City Council to have an accessible toilet with baby changing facilities on the ground floor and lift access to the upper floor.“A new meeting room is to be built which will provide a private space for our health, social care and employability partners.“Coldside Library will be more accessible and enable us to

players has cost dundee united dear","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSince relegation from the top flight in 2016, Dundee United have seen a massive 86 transfers in and out of Tannadice.The remarkable turnover of players just shows what the price of failure is – by the club as a whole and those players, some of whom have been and gone with very little success.And, with business still to be done over the next couple of months in re-shaping the current squad, that total is expected to rise even further before too long.Since the departure of Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven at the end of January 2015 – the point where United’s downfall from cup finals and European football towards the second tier can be traced back to – the complete lack of continuity is an obvious factor in the club’s failure over recent seasons.Add in four managerial changes in that time and that’s a recipe for a whole lot of trouble.The number 86, obviously, includes a few players twice – i.e. they were transferred in and then transferred out – but since relegation the Tangerines have signed a huge 42 players in the past two years.Manager Csaba Laszlo has lifted the lid on how unorganised the club were last season and the number of ins and outs only strengthens that perception.This summer, Csaba, with help from chief scout Paul Sturrock, has brought in nine players already – with more expected.The big hope is this completely revamped team can finally get them back to the Premiership – something the 33 signings before them have distinctly failed to do.The pressure is on Nicky Clark, Callum Booth, Sam Wardrop, Fraser Aird, Craig Curran, Frederic Frans, Benjamin Siegrist, Matej Rakovan and Christoph Rabitsch to be the men that fire the Tangerines back up and have Arabs watching top-flight action come 2019/20.Last summer, 19 players were brought in by then manager Ray McKinnon and 13 the previous one immediately after suffering the drop.Of those 32, only 10 remain at the club and a few of those probably have a short future. They are Lewis Toshney, William Edjenguele, Stewart Murdoch, Fraser Fyvie, Deniz Mehmet, Billy King, Paul McMullan, Tam Scobbie, James Keatings and Sam Stanton. How many of them play a meaningful role in the push for promotion this coming season, however, is certainly up for debate.In the past two campaigns under McKinnon and Laszlo, United haven’t been a million miles away from getting themselves up through the play-offs.Add in a bit of continuity through their playing squad and around it surely can only help the club get back to where they feel they belong.A list of those 86 transfers, who have arrived, departed or done both: Harry Souttar, Darko Bodul, Eiji Kawashima, Chris Erskine, Michal Szromnik, Callum Morris, John Rankin, Paul Paton,

found resulting in extra costs of £82,000 and bringing the total cost to more than £250,000.The schedule for the work has also slipped and it is now due to be completed in late August or early September.Andy Wilson, a member of the Damacre Centre residents’ committee, said: “This is the latest stage of what’s been a shoddy process all the way.“Damacre was built in the 1800s so there’s no surprise there’s a lot of asbestos in the building.”Fellow committee member Jill Scott also hit out saying: “This shows a complete lack of planning, all of which costs the taxpayer money.“I’m at a loss to see how this additional asbestos was not known about and wonder if demolition would have been agreed if the true costs were known.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"man ran at cop in dundee while

changes to a funding formula which he claims leaves busy urban routes at a serious disadvantage.Milton Crescent in Hilton is to be completely resurfaced at a cost of \u0026pound100,000 and the work is

in.But Ness-side councillor Ron MacWilliam has called for a rethink on the way damaged roads are prioritised.At present, funds are allocated according to a formula which gives more weighting to length of road than traffic volumes.As a result, Mr MacWilliam said roads in Inverness were having less money spent on them than rural roads in the far north of Sutherland. He also said more needed to be done if city drivers were going to notice any significant difference.\"The fact the council is now looking to repair roads within the city is a start, but there are a lot of routes \u0026ndash particularly in areas such as Hilton and Lochardil \u0026ndash which are still very bad,\" he told the Courier.\"The roads budget is woefully inadequate.

McInnes said: “Sometimes you need those forward players to make the difference to turn one point into three.”On a positive day for McInnes, summer signings Stephen Gleeson and Lewis Ferguson also delivered solid debuts.Centre-back Mikey Devlin finally made his debut six months after signing on at Pittodrie.Devlin had been out for more than a year with a cruciate ligament damage but cruised through the game against Cobh.But it was Forrester who stole the show with the vital goal.McInnes said: “In terms of his touch and his passing ability the reason we brought Chris here was because he can be the difference.“I think Chris can be that for us either through his assists or his goals.“It is something that is important to him, to be more relevant in the final third rather than just be seen as a good passer.“Against Cobh Ramblers he was the difference with a lovely finish with his left foot.“He just shifts the ball on to it and gives us that bit of quality.“He scored a good goal and it was one that we deserved as we were the better side.”Dubliner Forrester was introduced on the half-hour mark at the Fota Island Resort.With the mercury hitting close to 30 degrees it was decided by both teams to split the match into three half-hour sections.McInnes said: “Chris is a confident boy and has to get used to the demands of us as well.“There were moments when you could see his quality.“His touch is so true, he plays with his head up and the crispness of passing is there.“Chris has some work to do to make sure his game is that bit more rounded for us.“That is the demands we are going to put on him.”Striker Stevie May and Sam Cosgrove were both left out of the team for the friendly having picked up knocks in training.McInnes is confident both will be fit to face Falkirk on Wednesday at Arbroath’s Gayfield stadium.The manager said: “Stevie and Sam are fine.“The ground was rock hard and maybe we over-worked them on Thursday.“Both have worked extremely well and looked sharp in the football work we have done.“It was just at the tail-end of the work on Thursday when we pushed them a wee bit.“The physios have guaranteed they will be good to go for Falkirk.”Aberdeen faced Ramblers just nine days after returning for pre-season training.In contrast the Cork-based side are midway through their domestic league.McInnes was impressed with the centre-back partnership of Devlin and Scott McKenna who never looked troubled by Cobh.However, he accepts the Reds, who hit the post through Adam Rooney, needed to be sharper up front.McInnes said: “There was a lot of good from that game.“It is a step towards where we want to be and we want to make those gradual improvements as we go along.“There was some sloppiness as you would expect.“Even though we were against a team who we were expected to beat you could see they were a bit sharper to the ball.“You could see they were a team in mid- season.“We have to make sure that we make those little steady improvements as we go along.“I can’t be disappointed as a clean sheet was never really in doubt.“We defended well and worked hard enough.“When you make so many changes in a game sometimes it upsets the fluency.“It has been a strong week for some and there is more work for some to get up to where we want.“In terms of what the players have given us since we came back in I am really pleased with their fitness levels.“I was just looking for that wee bit more quality and goal threat from the game.

from the world’s most powerful offshore wind turbines which, with each rotation at full power, will generate enough energy to power a home for 24 hours.“Once the test and demonstration site is fully operational, not only will this help the offshore wind sector to further reduce its costs through lessons learned during operations, but the output from EOWDC will itself add significantly to Scotland’s renewable electricity generating capacity, building on figures announced last month that showed installed capacity reached a record 10.4GW in the first three months of 2018 and which also

Wakeham, writing in last week’s Advertiser, for his questions regarding the nesting colony and status of common gulls within the former oil depot, currently the Mid Argyll hub and museum construction site.I am happy to address these questions.Historically, this species was first named in the 1700s and thought by many to come from their association with grazing or ‘common land’ and in the more recent past the name ‘uncommon gull’ may be more apt.In the UK they are essentially restricted as a breeding species to Scotland where numbers continue to decline, with this being reflected in Argyll, principally due to predation by the American mink, as pointed out.Studies at the Lingerton landfill site have shown that, unlike the larger gull species at the tip, Common Gulls do not scavenge there, as was perhaps claimed, but use the tidal mud flats of Loch Gilp and surrounding fields to find invertebrates, fish and vegetarian foodstuffs. As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade.

This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

Her new book, Rebel Without A Clue, is a sci-fi dystopian novel about a male alien from a female-dominated planet landing in Glasgow.\u0026#8216There’s actually not a lot of sex in my books,\u0026#8217 says Kerrie. \u0026#8216Except maybe nobody having any.\u0026#8217The story starts out as a reversal of The Handmaid’s Tale, with women of this planet no longer needing men to reproduce and evolves, through a plot described as \u0026#8216mad\u0026#8217, into an outsiders perspective of Glasgow.\u0026#8216The male alien Legless goes down to earth and goes around fertilising all these women, and doesn’t understand this world where he’s in charge.\u0026#8216Most of the time I was the only woman living in a culture different from my own. I began to see stories in outsiders.\u0026#8217Being an Australian in Scotland \u0026#8211 and on top of that marrying into a Bangladeshi family \u0026#8211 would give that outlook, of everything being familiar but just off a little. The language is the same, with the accents different. The rural community is the same, only with less terrifying monsters to deal with in Argyll. This is the outlook Legless finds himself in as a dominated man in a world of dominant men.Such an off-the-wall plot with no clear message makes the book an ink blot test \u0026#8211 you take what you’re looking for from it. Maybe you even see something else with another look.Kerrie explained: \u0026#8216Originally I wanted it to be all humour. I suppose I’m driven about power and control and it’s really fascinating when you start to think about it because people dominate in quite small ways.\u0026#8217So maybe the point was to gain the women’s perspective for men to relate to?Kerrie is currently working on her fifth book, the sequel to her dystopian sci-fi named Rebel Without A Bra, and she will keep belly dancing around Lochgilphead.\u0026#8216At the beginning you just write, and you just open up your mind and stuff comes out and you’ll find that all this stuff comes out that you didn’t realise you were thinking about. It’s amazing. You actually discover so much about yourself.\u0026#8217Author and Ardrishaig resident Kerrie Noor entertained a library full of book lovers on Wednesday June 20.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dunadd share the spoils with ardnamurchan","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 29/06/18, 7:30 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.The two teams in joint first position in the league shared the spoils in a hard fought match in Strontian.Dunadd went into Sunday\u0026#8217s game with high hopes of securing a win. However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"its gonna be a close shave gavin","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 29/06/18, 7:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowIt\u0026#8217s been eight months in the making, but it\u0026#8217s getting hairy now.The razors, however, will soon sort that out for Gavin Allan.He has been growing his flowing locks and bushy beard since October last year, but Gavin will be shorn for charity on Saturday June 30.Gavin\u0026#8217s head and beard shave is being carried out in aid of Motor Neurone Disease (MND) research and the Doddie Weir Foundation.Former Scottish rugby international lock forward Doddie Weir revealed in June 2017 he was suffering from MND, a degenerative condition affecting the nerves in the brain and spinal cord that tell your muscles what to do.

Collapsing ceilings and water leakage have led to a further deterioration in the fabric of the Victorian pile.  Now it is understood South Ayrshire Council bosses want to step in before it is too late. It is believed a last minute paper may go before councillors at full council in County Buildings on Thursday. The paper would ask politicians to approve the repair work. The council slapped a Dangerous Building Notice on the hotel in March, which gave the owners 21 days to respond. There are fears Ayr train station could end up shut if no action is taken. And it has been slammed a risk to the public. The Post revealed earlier this month how the hotel has been bought by new Malaysian owners from Eng Huat Ung.  Station Hotel Action Group founder Esther Clark believes the hotel could be turned into a community centre and accomodation. She said it should be “split up and dispersed” but must generate an income. She has uncovered research, which reveals the hotel was built to a “high standard” with luxurious materials. One idea mooted by Ayr Renaissance is for a part of the building to be demolished and a new train station built. Others folk have called for the council to adopt the landmark for offices. It was hoped a big hotel group would step in and carry out refurbishment but it has failed to attract interest so far. Network Rail carried out scaffolding work on the building to safeguard the operation of the station and line in 2015. The hotel, a Grade 2 listed building, has remained shut since it closed suddenly in 2013. Glasgow and South-Western Railway Company built the hotel, designed in the style of a French chateau, at a cost of \u0026pound50,000.

And one glance around a packed Troon Town Hall said everything about the young woman Vanessa Riddle had become. Her impact was deep, her reach was far. “Vanessa would wonder why everyone was here for her,” said dad Chris. “That’s just the kind of person she was.” Friends, family, school pals and members of the community all touched by Vanessa’s courage joined for the special service.  Her battle with neuroblastoma had been one that ensured she will never be forgotten by all lucky enough to know her. Speaking to more than 400 people at her memorial service, Chris said: “She lit up our world. “And in her short life, she packed in so much happiness. “Vanessa was a thrillseeker with a soft side – great with old and young alike. “She had the Midas touch.” And he added: “No words can describe how utterly proud we are to have been your father, mother and sister.  “This is not the end for you, you have now moved on to something new.” The emotional speech came as the Town Hall paid tribute to Vanessa, of Loans, who lost her brave battle just days short of her 18th birthday. Some of Vanessa’s closest childhood friends took their feet to recount memories of happy times of the girl with a smile for everyone. And Vanessa’s infamous parking skills and ability to make everyone laugh were just two of the themes to strike a chord. Graham Hobson, deputy head at Marr College, was another to speak warmly of an immensely popular pupil. Chris said afterwards: “I thought the speeches were great, especially Vanessa’s friends, who at only 18 spoke so eloquently and passionately about Vanessa - they belied their age doing this.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12713526.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_070618ecrepont_10JPG.jpg","title":"talented youngster finn ecrepont walking","story":"NewsTalented youngster Finn Ecrepont is walking on AyrDubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:00, 18 JUN 2018NewsAyr United\u0027s Finn Ecrepont (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMost success stories in football start with a rejection somewhere along the line. And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded. I know for a fact he wouldn’t let me get big-headed so I couldn’t thank him enough for that. “I’ve been asked before where I see myself in five years, but the honest answer is I don’t know. “For all I know I could get injured tomorrow and break my leg. “I have been told many times that I haven’t made it, and I know that. “My hard work starts now, so I just need to take everything as it comes and take each day on its own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"bins-set-alight-outside-hawick-shop","story":"WITNESSES are being sought after two bins were set alight near a shop in Hawick.\nThe fire happened at around 3.25am on Friday, June 22 on the town\u0027s High Street.\nTwo large metal wheelie bins were set alight at the rear of The Card Factory store, however quick action of the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service mean the fire was extinguished before the flames could spread.\nAs a result, the outer wall and a window sustained damage, while one of the building vents was also destroyed.\nNo one was injured and inquiries are ongoing to identify whoever was responsible.\nInspector Kevin Harris from Hawick Police Station said: \"Had this fire spread then a number of homes and businesses could have been affected.\n\"We are keen to hear from anyone who remembers seeing anything suspicious within the High Street during the early hours of Thursday morning, or who can help us trace the culprits.\n\"Anyone with information should contact police immediately.\"\nThose with information can contact Hawick Police Station via 101 and quote incident number 426 of June 22.

Before that, in December 1828, Peebles Town Council had agreed that if a gas company was set up, it would be allowed to open up and lay pipes in the streets and if that proved successful, it would then have the street lamps lit by gas.\nInitially a site for a gasworks on the Old Town Green (now Greenside) was chosen, but it proved to be unsuitable. A site was found on the area of ground lying to the west of the Parish Church. Today the site is still visible and forms part of the parkland and walkways close to the modern swimming pool.\nOne of the factors which made the development of a gasworks feasible was the great improvement in major roads serving the town following the Turnpike Acts. That allowed coking coal to be brought to the town from the coalfields of Lanarkshire and Midlothian.\nTo begin with gas was produced for only ten months of the year and the street lights were lit for only about a third of the year, during the darkest winter months.\nBy the end of the 19th century, the demand for gas had greatly increased and as well as street lighting, was beginning to be used for household appliances such as gas cookers. In 1898 the assets of the Peebles Gas Company were acquired by the Town Council. Within a few years demand was outstripping supply and in 1905 it was decided to build a new gas works at Eshiels as the existing site, which also served as the council yard, was too restricted to allow for expansion. By then the existence of railways made it possible to import coal directly to the Eshiels site.\nIn 1948 the Town Council starting converting all street lighting to electricity. The gas works at Eshiels became part of the national system and continued in operation until the advent of North Sea gas in the late 1960s.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"were-so-proud-of-him-parents-of-galashiels-scout-with-adhd-hope-to-inspire-others-to-join-group","story":"THE parents of a Galashiels Scout with ADHD hope others will be inspired after the youngster won a prestigious award.\nAfter weeks of working hard to complete an array of challenges and tasks, Blair Valentine took home the Reiver Award at the Gala Scout Group annual general meeting last month.\nThe 10-year-old, who attends St Peter\u0026rsquos Primary School in Galashiels, received the award in recognition of his hard work after being nominated by numerous members of the Scouts.\nProud parents Dave and Mandy now hope their son\u0026rsquos success story will inspire other parents of children with ADHD.\nThe youngster was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in July 2013 at the age of six.\nBlair\u0026rsquos mum Mandy told the Border : \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore so proud of him, Blair has worked very hard to get where he is, and we want others to know that just because a child has ADHD, it shouldn\u0026rsquot hold them back from going on to do great things.\n\u0026ldquoBlair gets especially inspired when hearing that celebrities have the same condition as him.\n\u0026ldquoUntil we looked into it, we had no idea just how many well-known people were also affected by it.

SS took his portion of fish after his family were fed and satisfied.\nLater that same day, SS returned with more fish and he was certainly making up for lost time.\nHe began to feed the youngsters himself while Mrs O was preening. The chicks were visibly stronger and more energised than the day before when they were hungry.\nAfter the first chick was full it lay down on its side while the other chick fed and when it had had enough to eat, chick number one would get up and come back over for seconds.\nThe week progressed into warm weather and scorching sunshine and the chicks ranged from being sleepy and still, to being far too adventurous, toddling about the nest using their budding wings as little stilts to enable them to clamber around.\nThese little excursions led them to venture too far to the edges and the parent birds used distraction with fish to bring them away and back into the middle.\nThey also began to pay more attention to the nest construction, by moving sticks around and building up the edges, like little safety barriers to prevent any toppling over the edge.\nSadly, for one osprey family in the Borders, two chicks did fall to their death from the nest during the recent high winds.\nBut the attentive Mrs O and SS seem to have metaphorically red taped the danger zone by building stick walls just high enough to prevent any earnest climbing from a curious young osprey wanting to peer over the side.\nvar panels = panels || []var panel = {    name: \u0027RelatedArticles\u0027,    target: \u0027related-articles\u0027,    params: {ns: \u0027redesign\u0027, \u0027article_ids\u0027: \u002716329068,16329035,16329016,16328910,16327639\u0027, \u0027more_articles_heading\u0027: \u0027More articles\u0027}}panels.push(panel)\nBy now, the young ospreys have grown stronger and the fluffy down is spotted with the onset of growing feathers.\nThey no longer look feeble and weak and their fortunes have rapidly turned around since the fish supply has picked up.\nWe finally have news of PX1 (Paxman\u0027s bird) whose satellite tracker alerted us to the fact that he had died in the north of Scotland near to the Helmsdale River.\nThe carcass and tag have been recovered and it seems that his neck was broken, we believe, from colliding into newly erected deer fencing along the side of a forestry plantation.\nIt is such a terrible shame to lose this wonderful, healthy, two-year-old male osprey.\nJeremy Paxman was very saddened to hear of the loss of this bird and we are very grateful to him for his interest and support for the Tweed Valley Osprey Project.\nHe has agreed that his involvement will continue in the future, through the tracking of further ospreys.\nThe volunteers for the osprey project were invited to attend the ringing of goshawk chicks this week in Tweed Valley Forest Park and they were privileged to witness them being fitted with red darvic rings with white letters of JP and PL, by Tony Lightley, after Eve Schulte climbed the fir tree to lower them to the forest floor.\nRhona Anderson took some great photos of these magnificent birds and she has also been filming pine martens in the forest.\nThe captured footage of the whole pine marten family together and the antics of the three little kits with their mum and dad can be viewed in the video above or at \nhttps://www.flickr/photos/borderslass/28099626057/in/photostream/\nRead the latest Tweed Valley Osprey News every week throughout the summer in the Border  and Peeblesshire News newspapers\n"},{"url":null,"title":"500-mile-cycle-across-scotland-raises-20k-for-charity","story":"AN INNERLEITHEN man has cycled 516 miles in five days \u0026ndash raising \u0026pound21,000 for charity.\nMountain biker Kevin Marshall recently completed the mammoth challenge around the north Scottish coastline \u0026ndash all in aid of a cause close to his heart.\nThe idea to take on the challenge originated during a mountain biking trip to Glencoe last August, when Kevin, and his friend Steve, both agreed they wanted to do something to support the charities Macmillan and Friends of Anchor, who helped Steve\u0026rsquos mum and dad, and Kevin\u0026rsquos mum, before they passed away.\nKevin said: \u0026ldquoWe agreed that the North Coast 500 (NC500) was a suitably tough challenge, both to raise awareness and hopefully raise a reasonable amount of cash.\n\u0026ldquoThe team that completed the ride with me are all very close friends, the majority of us met when we were 18 when we started university in Aberdeen and have been close friends ever since.

The route starts in Inverness, weaves along the west coast to Applecross and then northwards towards the towns of Torridon and Ullapool.\nFrom there, the team ventured to some of the most northerly coastal points in Scotland, passing by Caithness and John o\u0026rsquo Groats before heading south again through Dingwall and back to Inverness.\n\u0026ldquoDay one was probably the most challenging followed closely by day three, Kevin added.\n\u0026ldquoIt included 2,200 metres of climbing, eight hours of riding, and a top temperature of 27 degrees. However, the highlight was riding up the Bealach na B\u0026agrave.

window as children relax, enjoy the outdoors and get stuck into their favourite hobbies.Asthma UK is launching a campaign urging parents of children with asthma to make sure they take their usual preventer medicine and keep up a routine over the school break.The medicine builds up over time so will help to protect their child from an asthma attack during the summer holiday and once they return to school.Every 10 seconds someone has a potentially life-threatening asthma attack in the UK and three people die from an asthma attack every day.In September, children are nearly three times more likely to be admitted to hospital because of an asthma attack than in August, partly due to seasonal triggers such as cold and flu viruses.If a child hasn’t kept up their preventer medicine routine over the school holidays, they will be at greater risk of reacting to these triggers.The good news is that by taking a few simple steps, parents can help their child to avoid asthma attacks and enjoy the summer as much as anyone else:Keep up your child’s usual preventer medicine routine, usually a brown inhaler.Make sure your child has an up-to-date written asthma action plan, which you can download from Asthma UK’s website, and share this with anyone who will be looking after them as using one means they’re less likely to end up in hospital for their asthma.Track your child’s asthma symptoms using a diary or a symptom calendar.Prepare for going back to school by arranging for your child to have an asthma review with their GP or asthma nurse to check your child’s medicines and make sure your child has spare, in-date reliever inhalers to take into school.Parents whose children have asthma can access support through our nurse helpline.Last year we helped nearly 1,000 parents who called on behalf of their child with asthma.For information and support on how to manage your child’s asthma during the summer or to download a written asthma action plan visit

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

Colin Beattie stressed that \u0026ldquoradical thinking needed to be done to create a solution, highlighting a possible extension of a tram or light rail system out to Musselburgh.  During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":null,"title":"in-pictures-prestonpans-childrens-gala-day","story":"              Prestonpans Children\u0027s Gala Day went ahead yesterday as families braved the stormy weather to enjoy the fun.

Brave Ruth Quilietti-Bird \u0026ndash who at one point was the most ill person \u0026ldquoin the whole of the UK, according to her husband \u0026ndash moved hospital several times to receive specialist treatment for multiple organ failure, spending her 40th birthday in intensive care rather than on a planned holiday.  She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.  The family have also received support from the charity \u0026lsquoFinding Your Feet\u0026rsquo, which helps families affected by amputation or limb difference.

North Berwick\u0026rsquos Law Primary School P6 pupils were looking forward to the trip to Yellowcraig, by Dirleton, where one class was due to camp out tonight (Wednesday) and another tomorrow (Thursday).  Two of the school\u0026rsquos four P6 classes had already taken part in the one-night camp last month.  In total, 54 youngsters were expected to camp out this week.  However, Jill Wareham, the school\u0026rsquos headteacher, contacted parents on Monday to say that a decision had been taken to cancel the overnight stays after \u0026ldquoa group of people camped near the field they use.  The school is still going ahead with the daytime activities planned as part of the camp but asked parents to pick up their children from Yellowcraig at 7pm.  Mrs Wareham told parents in an email: \u0026ldquoYou may be aware that there is a group of people camped near the field at Yellowcraig where we usually hold our camp out. This has various implications for our risk assessments for the trip and, having taken advice from a number of sources, we have decided not to stay overnight at the site this week.  \u0026ldquoWe realise this will be disappointing news and apologise for any inconvenience, but we will look into the possibility of the pupils having a night in tents at another venue after the summer.  The camping trip is usually held in a field on the left of the road leading into the car parks at Yellowcraig.  An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWhile the pupils will be taking part in all of the planned activities, arrangements are being made for them to be picked up at 7pm instead of camping overnight.  \u0026ldquoThis decision has been taken as the school understands there may be a number of people already using the area.

A study is being launched to examine how the six secondary schools could work together to ensure they all start and end at the same time and follow a common timetable.  A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos cabinet heard that high schools had historically been given considerable autonomy in planning their school days and \u0026ldquocurricular arrangements. But this had resulted in \u0026ldquosix different structures, length of the school day and different levels of access in terms of experience and opportunity. And there was \u0026ldquosignificant variation throughout East Lothian in the range of Advanced Higher and Higher courses offered and the number of qualifications available in S4.  The report, backed by councillors, said the feasibility study would aim to lead to the creation of \u0026ldquoa common secondary school day and a common curricular structure.  The move would also see a change in hours for primary schools to match the new secondary day, with proposals to extend P1 and P2 pupils\u0026rsquo week from 22.5 hours to the same 25 hours that their older school-mates follow. A failure to synchronise primary school start and finish times to match the high school changes would cost the council an estimated \u0026pound190,000 in additional transport costs.  A public consultation will now be launched with the schools to establish the best standard timetable, with options for a 27, 32 or 33-period week. A 33-period week, for instance, could see secondary students\u0026rsquo first period of the day start at 8.30am, with a finish time of 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.55pm on Fridays.  The council said a common school day would lead to joint delivery, mutual support, sharing of best practice and collaborative professional development opportunities, as well as meaning greater equity of resource and opportunity for young people across East Lothian and barriers to travel would be reduced.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokesperson for education, said: \u0026ldquoThese proposals are all about improving inclusion, wellbeing and equality. We\u0026rsquore always keen to look for new ways of raising attainment and improving positive destinations for our children and young people.  \u0026ldquoThere are a number of potential practical benefits associated with such changes. It\u0026rsquos important that we listen to the views of staff, pupils, parents, carers and other stakeholders. That\u0026rsquos why I\u0026rsquom pleased cabinet has agreed that the council will hold a consultation and carry out a feasibility study. This will be launched in due course.

They say they are being overlooked by customers at the supermarket car park who can see through the fence into the communal garden area in front of their ground-floor properties at Mill House on Eskmills Road, which is managed by Dunedin Canmore Housing Association.  Margaret and Keith Morris moved from a Dunedin Canmore property in Bathgate last September into the phase two of Mill House \u0026ndash an amenity housing development for residents aged 55 and over.  Mrs Morris said: \u0026ldquoThere is no privacy whatsoever.  \u0026ldquoPeople who park in the car park have been waving in.  \u0026ldquoThere were two young guys in a van and I was hanging out my washing and one was nudging the other.

Mrs Morris said that although there were some trees along the boundary, they shed their leaves in the autumn, leaving the area bare.  She claimed that she and her husband had called on the housing association for permission to fill in the gaps in the fence to allow more privacy but claimed they had been told they couldn\u0026rsquot as another resident liked it that way.  \u0026ldquoWe wanted to get these slats which are only 94p. We would pay for them and fill in the spaces, she added.  She said they also called for a fence to be installed to stop people using an area past their flats as a shortcut to Tesco, claiming they were dumping rubbish including cans and bottles en route.  Neighbour Fiona Wilson said that motorists ate and slept in their vehicles and let their dogs out of cars.  \u0026ldquoWe are entitled to some sort of privacy, she added.  \u0026ldquoWe can\u0026rsquot go out \u0026ndash everybody\u0026rsquos looking at us.  \u0026ldquoMy bedroom is also to the front.

The operation at the site off Edinburgh Road took place last Thursday.  Sculptor Michael Johnson\u0026rsquos work, called \u0026lsquoMemory and Reflection\u0026rsquo, is 12ft high and 6ft feet wide.  The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.

Iceland\u0026rsquos reverse vending machine will accept Iceland\u0026rsquos empty plastic beverage bottles and repay customers with a 10p voucher for each recycled bottle to be used in store.

It has been confirmed that the much-loved facility for older people will continue as it is in its High Street home.  Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.

Councillor McMillan said it had been a great honour to be joined by veterans from East Lothian at the flag-raising ceremony which took place on Monday morning.  He told those in attendance: \"Today is an opportunity to recognise the enormous contribution made by service personnel - past and present - and pay tribute to those who very sadly paid the ultimate sacrifice.  \"This November marks a century since the end of the First World War. A large number of residents left East Lothian in service of their country \u0026ndash many of whom, tragically, would never return.  \"Sadly, in the 100 years since, the world has seen all too many conflicts \u0026ndash some on a large scale, others more confined. In war, and in peacetime, our armed forces have promoted peace and security, confronted terrorism, and delivered aid to those in need.  \"That\u0026rsquos why, as Provost of East Lothian, I value occasions such as Armed Forces Day. A chance to give thanks, remember, reflect and look ahead.\"  Mr McMillan also paid tribute to the role of women in the military and in times of conflict, noting that 2018 was also the 100th anniversary of the first women being given the vote.  He said: \"Women played a significant role in the war effort, taking on work such as farming, transport and munition production, and the perseverance of Suffrage activity subsequently led to women being given the right to vote.  \"For a number of years now women have deservedly been playing a full and active role in our Armed Forces \u0026ndash reflective of the increasingly inclusive society in which we all live and are so keen to protect.\"  Veterans who attended the ceremony on Monday were invited to enjoy refreshments after the event."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7979931.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"scotlands-best-black-pudding-made-in-east-lothian","story":"              A NORTH Berwick-based butcher is celebrating after it was judged the makers of Scotland\u0026rsquos finest black pudding.

The debate during Health Question Time at Holyrood last Wednesday followed a recent public meeting which was organised by East Lothian MP Martin Whitfield and Lothian MSP Kezia Dugdale (both Labour) at the Fisherrow Centre, which attracted more than 200 people.  Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"              VIKTOR Krum, Percy Weasley and Malfoy\u0027s sidekick Goyle are all heading to Musselburgh this summer to join in the fun as Harry Potter\u0027s \u0026lsquoSchool of Witchcraft \u0026amp Wizardry\u0026rsquo arrives in the town.

WE ALL know that tadpoles turn into frogs. Searching for frog spawn and wee tadpoles is often a key childhood memory. But there are things we know about without really knowing about them.  This thought came to me as I searched for tadpoles and wee frogs in a pond last weekend with a group of parents and their children.  I love nature and believe it is a powerful part of all of us, which is why going to the woods or the beach, or just the general \u0026lsquocountryside\u0026rsquo, is an antidote for the stress of life.  But the truth is we don\u0026rsquot really have to go far to reach nature it\u0026rsquos all around us.  The spider\u0026rsquos web on the hedge, the birds on the roof that wake us in the mornings, the self-seeded flowers which grow in places all around our towns, the trees which blossom then turn our streets green, the wee beasties in our garden soil, the list goes on and on.  Yet it is so easy to rush past all the magic which is just on our doorstep.  And as I watched the wee frogs swimming in the pond last week, I discovered just how much I don\u0026rsquot know and have missed.  That\u0026rsquos the joy of having young children, I think: they are a passport for you as a \u0026lsquogrown-up\u0026rsquo to explore the world with a sense of fascination that we all once had, and can be rekindled.  You see, I\u0026rsquod never actually thought about how a tadpole changes into a frog.  In the day-to-day living of life I suppose it\u0026rsquos understandable it is not an issue we will spend too much time thinking about.  But as I watched the wee frogs come up from the mud to the surface to breathe, then swim down again, I realised we were looking down on a simple but fascinating miracle of nature.  Then a wee frog literally jumped from a stone onto my son\u0026rsquos hand.  He could have squashed it or even been frightened by it, but instead he said \u0026ldquowow.  The wee creature jumped from his hand onto mine, obviously looking for a way back to the safety of the water.  Carefully, and a bit reluctantly, he helped the wee \u0026lsquobaby frog\u0026rsquo back into the water where it swam back down to the mud.  That\u0026rsquos when I realised I knew about the process without knowing about it.  There were some frogs which looked like late developers compared to their cousins, for they seemed to be more tadpole than frog, still swimming about with a tail between their developing frog legs.  The whole spectacle was, honestly, fascinating. I found myself being in awe at the process that we all know about but don\u0026rsquot really know about.  And so as summer has reached us, I am determined to make it a Safari of Discovery on our doorstep.  I will share this journey with you the places, stories and folklore attached to them. And while I cannot claim to be an expert on nature, I know its spiritual importance and I think that is a good beginning.  My first port of call will be the wood of what my kids call the \u0026ldquoserpent trees.  Where is that? You\u0026rsquoll find out next week!  In the meantime, I will have to keep this week\u0026rsquos page short as it is my daughter Manja\u0026rsquos ninth birthday and I have mermaid tails to connect. . ."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7697530.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"council-calls-for-rejection-of-substation-plans","story":"              SCOTTISH Ministers are to be urged to refuse planning permission for an electrical substation on the former Cockenzie Power Station site because it could prejudice future development there.

In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.  The reporter is due to visit Cockenzie on Monday as part of her investigation into the application."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7994954.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"glory-days-of-golf-remembered","story":"              MUSSELBURGH\u0026rsquoS \u0026lsquoglory days\u0026rsquo in the history of golf are shared with visitors to the town\u0026rsquos museum this summer.  Musselburgh Museum on High Street is hosting an exhibition called \u0026lsquoMusselburgh \u0026ndash Cradle of Golf\u0026rsquo which is aimed at reasserting the Honest Toun\u0026rsquos importance in the sport\u0026rsquos rich heritage.  Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.  Organisers say the display shows Musselburgh\u0026rsquos leadership in developing golf and exporting it.  The museum is open on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays from 10.30am to 4pm each day."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8006789.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"coast-road-closed-after-car-overturns","story":"              THE A198 has been closed and emergency services are at the scene after a car accident near Gullane.

A retail development with four units and a \u0026lsquodrive-thru\u0026rsquo coffee shop are proposed at the site to the west of the town, close to the Oak Tree Junction of the A1.  The land had previously been owned by Sainsbury\u0026rsquos who had permission for a new supermarket there but their long-stalled plans were finally ditched when they sold the land earlier this year.  A public exhibition took place at the town\u0026rsquos John Gray Centre last Tuesday where those behind the plans were on hand to answer local residents\u0026rsquo questions.  Alex Mitchell, director of Zander Planning, admitted there had been a \u0026ldquomixed reaction from the people who turned up.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have had a great turnout \u0026ndash some people have been supportive and think that it will be of benefit to the town but others are worried about what it will do to the town centre.  Alastair Dickie, development director at Ediston Real Estate, which are behind the plans, added: \u0026ldquoI think there have been a lot of valid comments.  The names of the businesses looking to move into the site have not yet been revealed but it is hoped that their identities will become public by the time a planning application is submitted to East Lothian Council.  Mr Mitchell hopes a detailed planning application will be lodged before the end of the summer. He said: \u0026ldquoIf we can get an application in by about September then we\u0026rsquore probably looking at six months for planning [approval]. If we get [that] we could be on-site in spring 2019.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure retailers would want to be open before Christmas but that is probably a bit tight so we\u0026rsquod be looking at early 2020.  Mr Mitchell also attempted to allay fears over the volume of traffic on the road by adding: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore looking to create a filter lane so people coming in [to the new retail park] would not cause queues for people getting into the town.  Paul Darling, one of the planning liaison officers at the town\u0026rsquos community council, attended the exhibition.  He said the buildings proposed were \u0026ldquougly but added: \u0026ldquoI am not against the plans, I just think the buildings have to be more in-keeping with the rest of the town.  \u0026ldquoI think that it could actually bring people to the town but it is a bit of a worry what could happen to the shops in the town centre.  The site had long been earmarked for Sainsbury\u0026rsquos after it won a lengthy battle with Tesco to build on the site in 2013."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8009220.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"dunbar-student-heading-off-to-the-olympics-of-tech","story":"              A COMPUTER arts student will fly halfway round the world as part of a three-person team taking part in the finals of an international Microsoft competition.  A games development team, made up of students from Abertay University, will take on the best in the world at the Microsoft Imagine Cup in Seattle.  The competition \u0026ndash dubbed the Olympics of Tech \u0026ndash seeks out the most innovative and potentially world-changing software solutions and comes with a first prize of $100,000.  Among those representing the Dundee university is Emily Peterson, from Dunbar.  She said: \u0026ldquoThey are sending the first and second place teams out to Seattle for the competition, which is in the last week in July.  \u0026ldquoIt is quite exciting, I\u0026rsquom just the artist on the team.  \u0026ldquoI do the models and particular effects and textures.  The team, who make up Blacklight Games, created Firepoint \u0026ndash a first-person mixed reality simulator which aims to bring a new level of realism to firefighter training.  Using HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality technology, the game allows trainees to see through the eyes of a firefighter as they make their way through a multi-storey training ground tackling a variety of different issues.  It is hoped the simulator can eventually be used at open days or recruitment fairs.  The former Dunbar Grammar School pupil told the Courier the idea had evolved over time before resulting in the final product.  Originally, proposals looked at creating a game involving a maze.  However, a discussion with a firefighter saw the focus of the project, which is the work of eight third year students, change.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoMatthew McAuley, from our team, had a friend who worked for the fire service.  \u0026ldquoI think he got the initial from there and said why don\u0026rsquot we come up with that.  \u0026ldquoWe had been making the initial concept like a maze and it is something you can still see in the final build of the game.  In April, the team from Abertay University took part in the UK finals of the Microsoft Imagine Cup in London.  A team from Manchester University was crowned the overall UK winner with Abertay finishing as the runner-up.  Now, both universities will send teams to the final.  The Abertay team are focusing on making the simulator better before they head to Washington.  Twenty-year-old Emily\u0026rsquos involvement in the project is the latest step as she attempts to land her dream job.

North Berwick Youth Project is keen to carry out work to the run-down shelter to give their members a place to spend their time.  A post from the youth project said: \u0026ldquoOver the past three years, young people have been looking at youth provision in North Berwick and have been shocked to learn just how much has been lost and never replaced.  \u0026ldquoThe team have been working hard to receive advice from East Lothian Council on what can be put in place to ensure a safe environment for all, as well as actions which can be taken to discourage anti-social behaviour. The young people would like to re-build the shelter with wider community involvement.  But Kathryn and Douglas Paul, who live at Glasclune Gardens, would prefer to see the shelter demolished.  Mrs Paul said that, while she was not against giving young people a place of their own, she felt the shelter \u0026ndash which sits to the rear of the home the couple have lived in for 18 years \u0026ndash was not the right location.  The couple told the Courier they had experienced long-standing anti-social behaviour from youngsters who already gather at the shelter.  Mrs Paul said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had bottles thrown into the garden \u0026ndash they are loud and they get up to all sorts. It\u0026rsquos been going on five or six years.

Lauren Cowie, project manager at North Berwick Youth Project, insisted plans were \u0026ldquostill at a very early stage.  She added: \u0026ldquoWe are committed to working with the entire community and in particular those who live near the proposed shelter. As the project moves forward, the community and the residents will be consulted at every stage, including the design.  She also stressed that the group hoped the refurbished shelter could be used \u0026ldquofor the whole community, adding: \u0026ldquoWe hope that by taking a collaborative approach we will be able to deal with the concerns that have been raised."},{"url":null,"title":"the-rahs-make-waves-across-the-world","story":"              INDIE rock band The Rah\u0026rsquos new single is being played on radio stations around the world after making the playlists of some of the most influential stations.

The Dublin-based carrier said more than 1,100 flights were cancelled for the second month running due to air traffic control strikes over four weekends in June, as well as staff shortages in the UK, Germany and France.  This compared\u0026nbspwith just 41 cancellations in June last year.  The low-cost group repeated its call for action from Europe to help tackle disruption from the strikes.  Chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs said: \u0026ldquoRegrettably, over 210,000 Ryanair customers had their flights cancelled in June because of four weekends of ATC (air traffic control) strikes and repeated UK, German and French ATC staff shortages.  \u0026ldquoRyanair calls for urgent action by the EU Commission and European governments to ameliorate the effect of ATC strikes and staff shortages in the UK, Germany and France from disrupting the travel plans of millions of Europe\u0026rsquos consumers this summer.

Air traffic control strikes are costly for airlines and hugely disruptive for passengers, especially in France, as many UK flights need to use the country\u0026rsquos air space or fly longer routes to avoid it.  But ATC action has become a regular headache for the industry in recent years, with 2017 said to be a record for strikes, with 41 days affected.

Picking a favourite Scottish album from such a packed field was always going to be a tough task, and so it proved when we asked readers to do just that.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  We were inundated with hundreds of votes from across Scotland, the UK and as far afield as the Netherlands, Sweden and the US, and our quest got folk talking and reminiscing in offices, pubs and on social media, revisiting and celebrating the music that has been the soundtrack to their lives.  So, here we have it: Scotland\u0026rsquos top 10 favourite albums.  10 \u0026ndash Raintown, Deacon Blue, 1987    The band\u0026rsquos debut is packed to the rafters with sheer quality and from beginning to end simply never lets up. Dundonian singer-songwriter Ricky Ross showcased his talent, intent and also a keen political and social awareness across 13 songs, among them Scotland\u0026rsquos other national anthem, Dignity.  9 \u0026ndash High Land, Hard Rain, Aztec Camera, 1983    Could Roddy Frame really only have been 18 when he recorded Oblivious, Walk Out to Winter and We Could Send Letters? East Kilbride\u0026rsquos boy wonder emerges fully formed on this astonishing debut album from 1983, having soaked up the pop, soul and punk influences of his prodigious musical youth and reimagined them as perfectly-crafted jangle-pop. The sound of young Scotland has rarely sounded this fresh.  8 \u0026ndash Strange Kind of Love, Love and Money, 1988    Though Love and Money\u0026rsquos particular brand of literate, glossy soul-pop looked to America for inspiration, lyrics about \u0026ldquoraining on Jocelyn Square were resolutely, affectionately Glaswegian. In another place, another time, Love and Money could have been the biggest band in the world.  7 \u0026ndash If You\u0026rsquore Feeling Sinister, Belle and Sebastian, 1996    Second albums are supposed to be difficult but Belle and Sebastian arguably never surpassed the stunning collection of songs that comprised their sophomore effort, giving a masterclass in how to mix melody, melancholy, nostalgia and humour.  6 \u0026ndash Bandwagonesque, Teenage Fanclub, 1991    The album that thrust Teenage Fanclub into the indie big league. From opening track The Concept to the closing echoes of Is This Music?, it is jam-packed with all the qualities fans have come to love about Bellshill\u0026rsquos finest four-piece: Byrds-influenced, melody-rich songs delivered in an endearing, gently shambolic fashion.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  5 \u0026ndash Heaven Or Las Vegas, The Cocteau Twins, 1990    Elizabeth Fraser\u0026rsquos otherworldly voice set over Robin Guthrie\u0026rsquos ethereal soundtrack is one of Scotland\u0026rsquos greatest musical pleasures and treasures, and this most accessible of Cocteau\u0026rsquos albums is simply awash with blissed-out grandeur. Could they really have been from Grangemouth? Oh yes.  4 \u0026ndash A Walk Across the Rooftops, The Blue Nile, 1984    Sounding nothing like anything else that came out of Scotland, the UK or indeed anywhere else in 1984, this debut fused spare synth precision with exuberant vocal sincerity to stunning effect. Tinseltown in the Rain, that bittersweet slice of cinematic perfection, remains the ultimate ode to Glasgow.  3 \u0026ndash The Midnight Organ Fight, Frightened Rabbit, 2008    Since Scott Hutchison\u0026rsquos untimely death in May, listening to the music he and his bandmates created has been a particularly sad and difficult task. But this album is simply too good to stop listening to. Revisiting is painful but cathartic, and like all of the \u0026nbspHutchison\u0026rsquos work, it makes you feel like it\u0026rsquos okay to be sad.\u0026nbsp  2 \u0026ndash I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything, The Trashcan Sinatras, 1993    From post-Smiths jangleism on their debut the Ayrshire gang blossomed to reveal an emotionally rich and enduring marriage of musicality and lyrical nous never before seen within spitting distance of Irvine or anywhere else, crowned by flawless performances by one of Scottish pop\u0026rsquos most devastating singers, Eddi Reader\u0026rsquos younger brother Frank.  1 \u0026ndash Hats, The Blue Nile, 1989    Only seven songs in length, Hats is a masterpiece of love, loss and redemption writ large over a lush, soulful and at times overwhelmingly beautiful soundscape, inseparable from the city of its birth, Glasgow. For almost 30 years it has offered endless inspiration and comfort. \u0026ldquoWhen all the rainy pavements lead to you, sings a heartbroken Paul Buchanan on From a Late Night Train. The rainy pavements of Glasgow will always lead to Hats.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  Here\u0027s what you said about Hats:  Christine Gardner, Rotterdam: Head and shoulders above the rest. A magnificent album that I continue to listen to regularly after almost 30 years. It is quite simply a masterpiece. It continues to draw you in, delight your senses, touch your emotions and somehow mirror your own very personal experiences. And yet it is also essentially Scottish \u0026ndash maybe something to do with our collective psyche, despite all our individual differences.  Martin McCarthy: Hats has so many layers, from dreamy songs like Over the Hillside and Let\u0026rsquos Go Out Tonight to more upbeat songs like Headlights on the Parade and \u0026ldquoThe Downtown Lights.  Saturday Night is just a sublime song, I love the pitch perfect bass, the stunning keyboards and Paul Buchanan\u0027s emotional voice. This was played at our wedding to a full dancefloor and will always be so special. The songs on Hats convey love, beauty, pain and loss, and can push me to tears of utter joy and euphoria.  Alex Watkins: It\u0026rsquos the album I always return to just something about the memories and emotions it always conjures up.  Kevin Jackson: Hats is the best album ever recorded anywhere by anyone. It touches you in a way that others must stand back in awe and adoration of. It is a thing of perfection. When some of the finest innovative talents of our time see it as one of the greatest albums ever, it is because it has no peers.  Peter Morgan: I\u0027m going to plump for Hats, that lush, aching, bruised and battered homage to love and loss.  John Reader: I listen to a lot of music, including lots of new stuff but always have Hats on at some point every week. Still hooks me in with its lush simplicity. I remember saying to someone more than 25 years ago that of all the music around at that time I reckoned I\u0027d be listening to Hats for the rest of my life. Not wrong so far.  Colin Lunn: I love A Walk Across the Rooftops, the best first album by any group, not only in Scotland but worldwide. However, Hats was probably a better, more perfect album although it didn\u0026rsquot have the same influence. Tough, tough choice but I\u0026rsquoll go for Hats by a very, very fine margin.  Here\u0026rsquos what you had to say about some of the other music on the list:  Kyle Wallace: I\u0027ve Seen Everything by the Trashcan Sinatras is part of the soundtrack to my life. Listened to it through my dad\u0027s death and the college years. So many great songs associated with great memories.  John Richards: This was a very difficult choice. Scottish groups (I\u0027m Welsh) have a disproportionately large place in my music collection \u0026ndash particularly those who came to prominence in the 1980s. My top 20 regularly features the work of the Blue Nile, Danny Wilson, Aztec Camera, Deacon Blue and Love \u0026amp Money. However, it\u0027s got to be an album from the year I turned 19, when I went to university and the myriad possibilities that life had to offer opened up before me. The song (and album) that soundtracked that life-changing period is still my favourite Scottish album: Strange Kind of Love by Love \u0026amp Money.  Stuart Duncan: My vote is for The Midnight Organ Fight by Frightened Rabbit. An album that, as your writer said, \u0026ldquomakes it feel it\u0026rsquos OK to be sad. The lyrics hit home more than any album I\u0026rsquove ever listened to. Scott Hutchison gave me a feeling that everything was going to be OK, that I would get through things. I\u0026rsquod say he helped changed me as a person. It still hasn\u0026rsquot stuck in that he\u0026rsquos no longer here [Hutchsion took his own life in May] but my vote would be the same regardless of the circumstances.  Danny Tennyson: My favourite album by a Scottish band \u0026ndash or any other band for that matter \u0026ndash has to High Land Hard Rain, by Aztec Camera. The fact that Roddy was probably only 15 or 16 when he wrote most of the tracks for the album makes it all the more remarkable. He continues to be a genius to this day.  Shane Brown, Illinois: Why is it that I live in the centre boring part of America (the states you fly over to get somewhere else interesting), and should by location and birthright be a huge fan of Slipknot, but instead find myself with a vast collection of Scottish indiepop? From the Cocteaus to the Fannies, Belle \u0026amp Sebastian to Teen Canteen, Scottish indiepop has been the soundtrack to my life. How and why the music of your land speaks to me, I\u0027ll never know, but no album speaks to my soul more than Cake by the Trashcan Sinatras \u0026ndash a record I find as comforting as a cup of coffee on a cold winter morning. I really, really love it to this day, and why those lads aren\u0027t universally revered as musical genius is beyond me to this day. I\u0027ve travelled hundreds of miles to see them live and I\u0027ll continue to do so as long as they grace us with the occasional American tour.

The \u0026pound100 million investment would see the creation of Glasgow Harbour Lifestyle Outlet, including retail space, a cinema, restaurants and cafes.  The proposal to rejuvenate the site was granted Planning Permission in Principal in 2008, but Peel Lifestyle Outlets - which owns outlets in Manchester and Gloucester - has now submitted a further application.  Managing Director Jason Pullen said: \u0026ldquoShopping has evolved to become a major leisure activity. We are creating the next generation of outlet destination by delivering a balanced combination of exciting leisure and entertainment with a strong retail offering.  \u0026ldquoOur Lifestyle Outlets are 4th generation outlets and far removed from soulless factory outlets.

Figures show locum GPs are being paid more than \u0026pound100 an hour to keep Scotland\u0026rsquos health service up and running.  It comes as Gordon Brown warned the NHS would be \u0026ldquoin trauma within a decade if Scotland became independent.  The former prime minister said the NHS would be a \u0026ldquodiminished service after separation, and repeated his claims that the SNP\u0026rsquos latest independence blueprint would lead to austerity.  Statistics reveal GPs charged as much as \u0026pound1,400 per day for cover in Orkney in 2016/17, the latest year for which figures are available, while in NHS Lanarkshire charges were as high as \u0026pound1,132 per day.  Average daily rates for locum GPs varied across Scotland, from just \u0026pound90 in Dumfries and Galloway to \u0026pound851.52 in Lanarkshire. Five health boards \u0026ndash including Greater Glasgow and Clyde and the Lothians \u0026ndash failed to provide information.  Earlier this year, it emerged NHS spending on agency workers had reached more than \u0026pound300 million for the first time ever.  Scottish Labour, which obtained the latest figures through Freedom of Information laws, insisted it was \u0026ldquoutterly shocking that the SNP GP crisis has created a situation where locum costs are over a thousand pounds a day.  Shadow health secretary Anas Sarwar said: \u0026ldquoThe reality is the SNP has underfunded primary care for over a decade and as a result family doctors are left over stretched, overworked and under too much pressure.  But a spokesman for new Health Secretary Jeane Freeman accused Labour of talking down the NHS instead of celebrating its achievements as it turns 70.  He said: \u0026ldquoInvestment in our health service is currently at a record high, and we aim to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over ten years to ensure a sustainable service that meets increasing demand.  Writing in The Scotsman, Mr Brown argued Scotland\u0026rsquos health service is currently \"under-staffed, under-equipped and under-financed\", despite Theresa May recently announcing a \u0026pound20 billion funding boost, translating to an extra \u0026pound2bn north of the Border.  He wrote: \"The NHS at 80 years old would, sadly, be in trauma if independence should ever happen.  \"What has become clear from the SNP\u0027s Growth Commission blueprint \u0026ndash what Nicola Sturgeon calls the foundation for independence \u0026ndash is that public spending would rise less than under Tory austerity and that even then, any new money there is would be eaten up by massive interest rate payments on what would be almost \u0026pound100 billion of new Scottish debt.\"  Mr Brown previously warned austerity will be \u0026ldquohere until doomsday under the SNP and its proposals for independence."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8011733.jpg?type=article-full","title":"glasgow-school-of-art-cranes-move-in-and-workers-ready-to-remove-the-mack-piece-by-piece","story":"              IT has stood at the heart of the city for more than a century acting as a testament to its designer\u0026rsquos genius, regularly drawing visitors from across the world to marvel at his working masterpiece.  But preparations have been finalised to start dismantling the world-renowned Charles Rennie Mackintosh designed Glasgow School of Art (GSA).  Structural engineers David Narro Associates and the contractor, Reigart, have prepared plans for the work that will need to be undertaken on the Mackintosh Building.  Plans have been shared with Glasgow City Council Building Control and Historic Environment Scotland.  Bosses for the GSA said work had been carried out over the weekend to assess the condition of the Mackintosh building, with further drone footage collected.    Final preparation work for the dismantling of the elements of the building that have been deemed dangerous begin today. The main crane has been relocated to the corner of Sauchiehall Street and Dalhousie Street, and a second crane is expected to join it tomorrow.  The work to begin dismantling the south fa\u0026ccedilade will start as soon as possible following approval of the methodology by Glasgow City Council Building Control. Work is needed following a devastating fire that ripped through the building \u0026ndash known as the Mack \u0026ndash on June 15.  For more than a century this majestic building which sits on a hill above Sauchiehall Street has been the beating heart of Glasgow\u0026rsquos cultural life.  It survived two world wars and one almost catastrophic fire four years ago.  Now, large sections of the Mackintosh building will be \u0026ldquodismantled starting today following a second inferno two weeks ago, with fears it will never be rebuilt with the bill estimated to be as high as \u0026pound200 million.  No-one could have predicted the turn of events which led to the almost-renovated building being destroyed in a fire, with new pictures yesterday revealing the full extent of the damage.  It was late on a Friday night when the fire was spotted by a passing policeman. Within an hour, it had spread like wildfire with the flames carrying over to the adjacent O2 ABC where the roof soon caved in Today, there is both physical and mental turmoil.  People have been unable to return to their homes in the area around Garnethill and Sauchiehall Street since the devastating blaze. Businesses have been locked out, with owners and staff facing penury.  But council bosses have condemned people who breach the GSA cordon as \u0026ldquodeeply stupid.    The words come as locals claim to still be seeing people climbing the fence \u0026ndash despite warnings the Mackintosh building is at risk of imminent collapse. A member of Gartnethill Community Council told how one man brazenly walked up to the fence mid-afternoon and tried to pull it down.  Other locals said they saw men climb the fence in the early hours of both Saturday and Sunday.  Ian Khan, of the community council, said he had to chase away a man who tried to enter the cordon on Sunday at around 4pm. He said: \u0026ldquoWe had a meeting on Sunday afternoon and then walked around to the front of the Mackintosh building to take a look. There was a man walking up Renfrew Street with headphones in. He walked right up and started trying to pull away the fence.  \u0026ldquoI said to him, \u0026lsquoWhat are you doing?\u0026rsquo and he said, \u0026lsquoI\u0026rsquom just going in.\u0026rsquo \u0026ldquoWe told him he couldn\u0026rsquot do that but he ignored us and went in anyway.  \u0026ldquoThe cordon around the art school is not good enough.  The blaze ravaged the Mackintosh building on June 15, as well as spreading to the O2 ABC venue and Campus nightclub.  There have previously been arrests after individuals tried to breach the safety cordon put up in the wake of the fire.  Art school bosses have said the site is extremely dangerous with brick work at risk of collapse.  A council spokesman said: \u0026ldquoThe exclusion zone exists for one reason \u0026ndash to protect life and limb. Anyone entering the area, other than a trained and accredited expert, is not only putting their life at risk but also deeply stupid.  Meanwhile, council leader Susan Aitken has said it is likely to be weeks, rather than months, before residents evacuated from their homes by the fire can return.  She said council bosses are in contact with the Association of British Insurers to smooth out issues for the now homeless residents.  This week there will be a clinic hosted by legal firm Harper Macleod to provide information to businesses on certain insurance and legal issues."},{"url":null,"title":"we-invested-our-life-savings-in-top-end-housing-scheme-and-lost-everything","story":"              CLAIRE Wilkinson and Paula Tatters love Bellside Brae. After all, they paid for it.  The two 70-somethings are visiting the new-build housing scheme in Cleland, North Lanarkshire, for the first time, chatting in the sunshine as they wander past five-bedroom detached homes behind freshly laid lawns and drives full of spotless BMWs.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom really impressed, Ms Tatters tells Ms Wilkinson. \u0026ldquoThis is really top-end. Ms Wilkinson agrees: \u0026ldquoIt is just as I imagined it would be.  Ms Tatters, 71, is a businesswoman from Elgin. Ms Wilkinson, 74, is an actor from Sussex. The pair are among more than two dozen small investors who put up some \u0026pound1.2 million to get the Bellside Brae scheme off the ground. Their money has gone. They want to know where. So do politicians.  Ms Tatters and Ms Wilkinson and their fellow Bellside Brae investors were among hundreds of people to put money through a UK business called Cavendish Moore.  Now closed, this firm hit the headlines back in 2011 after Britain\u0026rsquos financial services watchdog launched a probe into its conduct. Cavendish Moore had placed adverts in the press offering returns of \u0026ldquoup to 50 per cent in two years in land and property investments. \u0026ldquoCan you afford to miss out? its publicity asked.  Cavendish Moore insisted it was different to so-called land bank scams \u0026ndash schemes where investors, often elderly, are enticed to invest in plots which had still to get planning permission. Instead the firm said it specialised in finding investors for land that was ready to be developed. And it grouped together investors into limited liability partnerships or LLPs to carry out individual projects.  The old Financial Services Authority (FSA) thought this amounted to an unlawful collective investment scheme. Its successor body, the Financial Conduct Authority by 2014 did a deal under which Cavendish Moore had to pay some of its investors back just 10 per cent of their money. Some of those who did get cash were already dead.  The firm is now being wound up. Its liquidator, Paul Allen of FRP Advisory, late last month said he had discovered a number of large transactions carried out by Cavendish Moore before it was shut down. In a formal report filed at Companies House, he said: \u0026ldquoI have thus far been unable to establish the ultimate beneficiaries and/or the rationale for a number of such transactions..  The investors in Bellside Brae were just one group of many who formed an LLP called Cicada under the guidance of Cavendish Moore.  After payments to Cavendish Moore, this firm representing 27 investors in 2009 put \u0026pound700,000 into a joint venture with a developer called Clydebrae Developments to put up the homes now called Bellside Brae.  Matt Blair, a retired Scottish engineer who now lives in England, was as impressed as Ms Tatters and Ms Wilkinson with the new homes.  He said:It is slightly better than I expected. The finish is fabulous. They have done a great job. But we have been excluded from benefiting from this project. I think it is inconceivable that you can build quality homes on a site like this and that your money could disappear.  \u0026ldquoWhen you make an investment you know there is risk. You might not get all of your money back, but to lose all of it?  The problem for Mr Blair and his fellow investors is that Clydebrae Developments went under before the project was finished. The business was struck off in 2015. It had no assets. Clydebrae was owned by another 70-something man, Robert Kirk of Helensburgh. The land it was developing, it turned out, did not belong to Clydebrae, it was held by a business registered in the British Virgin Islands called Crannoch Investments, in trust, according to lawyers for Cicada, for Mr Kirk.  The Herald asked Mr Kirk if he could explain what had happened to the investors\u0026rsquo money. Speaking at his sandstone home in the leafy west end of Helensburgh, Mr Kirk said he could not say. He added: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom retired and I have been out of it for seven years. I don\u0026rsquot know what the situation is now. \u0026ldquo  Mr Kirk had more to say in a letter last year to a lawyer hired by the investors, most of whom lost \u0026pound35,000 in the scheme. He said he did not have any interest in the offshore firm Crannoch and that Clydebrae had made no profits and owed the investors nothing.  He said money from the joint venture had gone to complete groundwork at the site.  Bellside Brae, he added, was \u0026ldquounsuccessful for a number of reasons, predominately market related. Clydebrae was forced to sell its right to develop the land by its secured creditors, he explained.  Rights were bought by another business called Calder Developments. One of its former directors, Mark Thompson, had also served as a director of Clydebrae. The Herald was unable to reach either Calder or Mr Thompson for comment.  Mr Kirk wrote: \u0026ldquoI did not benefit financially from [this] transaction. I have lost a significant sum of money. I do not own my home as a result and am living in rented accommodation.  Ms Wilkinson, who featured in the 1960s soap Compact, is also now renting, a single room. \u0026ldquoI thought I was going to get a little flat. That has all been taken away from me. Now I live on benefits.  Aberdeen North MP Kirsty Blackman said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom concerned that those who invested in Bellside seem to have lost significant amounts of money, and there is almost no ability to seek redress, or even to get information about where their investment has gone."},{"url":null,"title":"cheryl-denies-mother-was-involved-in-liam-payne-split","story":"              Cheryl has responded to claims her mother was involved in her split from Liam Payne, insisting she had \u0026ldquoabsolutely nothing to do with it.

Scientists showed the common pain killer stimulated cellular machinery that acts as a waste disposal system to keep the brain \u0026ldquoclean.  Genetically engineered mice given the drug had reduced levels of a key hallmark of Alzheimer\u0026rsquos in their brains, sticky clumps of beta amyloid peptide.  Impaired clearance of the protein building block from the brain is thought to be one of the main causes of the disease.  A US team led by Professor Kalipada Pahan, from Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, found low-dose aspirin stimulated the formation of lysosomes \u0026ndash\u0026nbsptiny sacs in cells filled with digestive enzymes that help break down and clear away unwanted or harmful material.  The scientists wrote in the journal JNeurosci: \u0026ldquoStimulation of lysosomal biogenesis and reduction of amyloid plaque\u0026nbsppathology by low-dose aspirin holds promising therapeutic potential for treatment of AD (Alzheimer\u0026rsquos disease).  However British experts urged caution.\u0026nbsp  Professor Tara Spires-Jones, deputy director of the Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences at the University of Edinburgh, said: \u0026ldquoWhile this work is scientifically interesting, it is at very early stages.  \u0026ldquoThe amyloid reducing effects of aspirin were shown in cells in a dish and in a single mouse model of Alzheimer\u0026rsquos disease with relatively few mice per group.  \u0026ldquoFurther, the study did not show whether aspirin helped the brain function in this disease model.\u0026nbspMore work will need to be done in order to know whether low-dose aspirin could help prevent or treat Alzheimer\u0026rsquos.  Rob Howard, Professor of Old Age Psychiatry at University College London, added: \u0026ldquoClinical trials of aspirin have already been performed in patients with Alzheimer\u0026rsquos disease.  \u0026ldquoThe drug had no beneficial effects on outcome measures and was associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal haemorrhage.  The American researchers pointed out\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspmechanism appeared to be dependent on a protein called PPAR-alpha, levels of which fell significantly with age.  This might explain why trials looking at the effects of aspirin on elderly Alzheimer\u0026rsquos patients had produced disappointing results, they said.  Dr Sara Imarisio, from Alzheimer\u0026rsquos Research UK, said: \u0026ldquoAspirin is a commonly taken medicine for a number of health conditions, but there has been little research to examine potential benefits for Alzheimer\u0026rsquos disease.  \u0026ldquoThis early-stage research suggests aspirin may help improve how the brain removes amyloid, a protein known to build up in Alzheimer\u0026rsquos. The study reveals important insights into the mechanisms through which aspirin may impact brain health, however this is a small study in mice so it\u0026rsquos too early to draw conclusions about whether aspirin could be used to treat Alzheimer\u0026rsquos in people."},{"url":null,"title":"queen-formally-welcomed-to-edinburgh-at-start-of-holyrood-week","story":"              The Queen has taken part in an ancient ceremony to formally welcome her to Edinburgh at the start of Holyrood week.

It was the driest June on record in south-east and central southern England, with just 6% of expected rainfall across counties like Essex and Dorset, the Met Office said.  Scotland also enjoyed its highest ever temperature, with 33.2C recorded in Motherwell on June 28.  The sweltering spell has continued into July, with many parts enjoying temperatures around the mid-to-high 20s.  Tennis lovers looked set for plenty of action as Wimbledon began on Monday, with stars kicking the tournament off on sun-drenched courts.  Meanwhile, utility companies have been pumping billions of extra litres of water to try and keep pace with demand, which has risen by as much as 30%, Water UK said.  But there is no risk of drought, as above-average rainfall in the Spring means water levels are in a healthy position, it added.  There are currently no restrictions in England, but Thames Water says it is funnelling an extra 450 million litres per day as it deals with \u0026ldquorecord levels of demand and many suppliers are warning their customers to use water sparingly.  Some households in Berkshire, Wiltshire and Gloucestershire may see low-pressure hit their water supplies during peak hours, it added.  In the Republic of Ireland, a month-long hosepipe ban took effect in the greater Dublin area on Monday as demand continues to outstrip supply across the country.  The weather has been dry since late February in the country, with authorities saying rainfall has been similar to 1976, when a major drought took hold, Irish Water said.  It follows the ban introduced across Northern Ireland last Friday with the public asked to limit tap water use to drinking, cooking and washing.  The bookmakers Ladbrokes had the UK at 4/6 to see 35C during the week.  The heat is an example of \u0026ldquoextra volatility facing food producers, with some arable farmers seeing no recordable rainfall in a key month for their crops, the National Farmers\u0026rsquo Union said.  Across the country, council staff and social workers are making extra calls and visits on the vulnerable and elderly, who are more likely to struggle in the heat, the Local Government Association (LGA) said.  It is part of an \u0026ldquoannual heatwave plan, developed after more than 2,000 people died in England owing to extreme temperatures in 2003, it added.  A level three heatwave health alert was issued by the Met Office for the South West and South East, which is set to last until 9pm on Tuesday.  Izzi Seccombe, Chairman of the LGA\u0026rsquos Community Wellbeing Board, said: \u0026ldquoThe hundreds of deaths caused by high temperatures each year are avoidable.  \u0026ldquoCouncils are determined to reduce the toll as much as possible, but they cannot do it alone.  \u0026ldquoLocal people can make a massive difference by helping us identify other residents who might need some advice or practical help."},{"url":null,"title":"compromise-reached-in-german-government-migration-stand-off","story":"              Chancellor Angela Merkel and her rebellious political allies have reached a compromise in a row over immigration that threatened to bring down Germany\u0026rsquos coalition government.  Mrs Merkel has been at odds for more than three weeks with interior minister Horst Seehofer over his insistence that migrants who have sought asylum elsewhere in the European Union should be turned away at Germany\u0026rsquos borders.  Mr Seehofer leads the Christian Social Union, the sister party to the chancellor\u0026rsquos Christian Democratic Union.  Mrs Merkel was equally steadfast in arguing that such a unilateral action would cause other countries to close their borders and jeopardise the passport-free movement that is a hallmark of Europe\u0026rsquos Schengen zone.  But the two emerged from about five hours of talks saying they agreed to establish \u0026ldquotransit centres on Germany\u0026rsquos border with Austria where asylum-seekers would be evaluated and, if it turned out they had already applied for protection in another EU country, sent back to that country.  Individuals who are rejected by those countries will be pointed back into Austria \u0026ldquoupon agreement with Vienna, according to the deal that Mrs Merkel called a \u0026ldquovery good compromise.  \u0026ldquoThe spirit of partnership within the European Union is protected, and at the same time it\u0026rsquos a decisive step to regulate and organise secondary migration, she told reporters without taking questions.  It was not immediately clear whether Austria had already agreed to the provision. Whether the two conservative parties would be able to get Mrs Merkel\u0026rsquos junior coalition partner, the centre-left Social Democratic Party, to agree was also an open question. The Social Democrats previously rejected the idea of transit centres.  While the deal sounded very similar to one offered by Mrs Merkel and rejected by Mr Seehofer last week, the interior minister said he was happy with it, saying the compromise would have a \u0026ldquovery clear lasting effect on the future.  Mr Seehofer offered his resignation both as interior minister and leader of the Bavaria-only CSU at a party meeting on Sunday. He agreed to put it off until after one more round of talks with Mrs Merkel and said on Monday he would remain in both posts.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom happy we were able to achieve this compromise, and it shows that it pays off to fight for your convictions, Mr Seehofer said.  Mr Seehofer and Mrs Merkel have long had a difficult relationship and sparred over Germany\u0026rsquos approach to managing immigration on and off since 2015, when the chancellor welcomed refugees into the country."},{"url":null,"title":"number-of-children-calling-helpline-over-loneliness-up-by-more-than-a-third","story":"              The number of children who called a helpline because they were experiencing feelings of loneliness has risen 37% in the past year, new figures show.  Childline delivered counselling sessions to 272 children in Scotland who felt lonely in 2017/18, up from 199 the previous year.  The charity said that mental health issues, bullying and social media are all contributing towards a growing number of young people struggling with feelings of isolation and loneliness.  Across the UK, the NSPCC-supported service delivered 4,636 counselling sessions to children for loneliness in 2017/18 - a 14% rise on the previous year.  Teenagers accounted for most of the sessions, with the youngest person being just 10.  The NSPCC\u0027s Are you there? campaign is calling on the UK Government to provide funding to Childline so it can help more children and teenagers struggling with mental health issues.  Childline founder Dame Esther Rantzen said: \"Loneliness needs to be taken seriously because it is potentially damaging to children\u0027s physical and mental health.  \"The crucial question is what is causing this rise among the young?  \"Are we all too busy to make space and time for our children? Is it that we have lost the habit of eating together?  \"Or is it the illusion created by social networks that everyone else is liked, popular and enjoying a far more exciting life, so they feel lonelier than ever?  \"Whatever the reason, it\u0027s crucial that young people know they can always contact Childline to speak to someone who will listen and care about them.\"  Two of Childline\u0027s 12 UK bases are in Scotland and both of them carried out more counselling sessions with young people experiencing loneliness in the last year.  Glasgow\u0027s Childline base answered 817 calls from children across the UK who were feeling lonely, up from 693 the previous year, while the Aberdeen base carried out 202 counselling sessions with UK children, up from 164.  Almost eight in ten of the calls were from girls, some of whom highlighted the harmful effects of social media use.  They said that comparing themselves to others online or watching people they thought were friends socialise without them made them feel increasingly isolated."},{"url":null,"title":"ryanair-cancels-1100-flights-in-second-month-of-strike-turbulence","story":"              Budget airline Ryanair has revealed another month of travel misery as it said air traffic control strikes left more than 210,000 passengers facing flight cancellations in June.  The Dublin-based carrier said more than 1,100 flights were cancelled for the second month running due to air traffic control strikes over four weekends in June, as well as staff shortages in the UK, Germany and France.  This compared\u0026nbspwith just 41 cancellations in June last year.  The low-cost group repeated its call for action from Europe to help tackle disruption from the strikes.  Chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs said: \u0026ldquoRegrettably, over 210,000 Ryanair customers had their flights cancelled in June because of four weekends of ATC (air traffic control) strikes and repeated UK, German and French ATC staff shortages.  \u0026ldquoRyanair calls for urgent action by the EU Commission and European governments to ameliorate the effect of ATC strikes and staff shortages in the UK, Germany and France from disrupting the travel plans of millions of Europe\u0026rsquos consumers this summer.  Fellow airline easyJet has also revealed the impact of the strike woes in recent weeks, cancelling nearly\u0026nbsp1,000 flights in May, as widespread thunderstorms also took their toll.  Air traffic control strikes are costly for airlines and hugely disruptive for passengers, especially in France, as many UK flights need to use the country\u0026rsquos air space or fly longer routes to avoid it.  But ATC action has become a regular headache for the industry in recent years, with 2017 said to be a record for strikes, with 41 days affected.  Despite the strike action, Ryanair said it still flew 7% more passengers last month, at 12.6 million.

Clients, who suffer from a range of respiratory issues, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and allergies, spend their time relaxing in one of two treatment rooms where the walls and floor are clad in salt. A specialist machine then finely grinds medical grade salt that is released into the air at prescribed concentration levels for the duration of each session.                                                    The therapy, also known as halotherapy, dates back to the ancient Greeks who sought the benefits offered by naturally occurring salt caves for improved health and wellbeing.

Scottish Conservative Mr Clark said: “The Oil \u0026amp Gas Technology Centre in Aberdeen is a major promoter of STEM subjects.“Does the Minister agree that it is essential to prioritise the take-up of STEM subjects if we are to have the engineers and technicians that we need for the future?”Sam Gyimah MP said the English school system had welcomed 17% more entrants to STEM A-levels since 2010, adding:“However, there is clearly a lot more to do, which is why we are focused on doing a lot through careers and through the university system.”                                                                                                        The UK Government is investing an additional £406 million in skills, including maths and digital, including an advanced maths premium, and an £84 million programme to improve the teaching of computing.After the session, Mr Clark said Scotland is behind England in science, maths and reading.He added: “There is also a shortage of STEM teachers in Scotland and it risks undermining children’s opportunities, including at Inverurie Academy in my constituency.“We have to catch up with England and re-establish the world-class education system we once had.                                                                                                        “That’s why it’s disappointing the SNP have deprioritised its education Bill.\"                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"encouraging prospects for beef and sheep markets","story":"\t\tThe transformation in the weather since mid-May and the consequent quick growth of grass has given Aberdeen and Northern Marts\u0026#8217 sales of breeding stock a massive boost in recent weeks.\t\t\t\tThe average price of heifers with calves at foot at the latest sale at Thainstone Centre was £150 up on the first seasonal sale at the beginning of May and £350 higher than last year, ANM head of livestock, John Angus reports.                                                    “It is encouraging that we have had more buyers round the ring at the May breeding stock sales and good quality heifers with calves at foot have been making £2,400 to £3,000 a unit,” said Mr Angus.                                                    “We had very little grass growth at the time of the first sale but the situation had completely changed by the time of the next sale three weeks later.”        Mr Angus said the strong trade indicated that confidence was returning to the beef industry and it was good to see herds replacing breeding stock on the back of buoyant prices for store cattle and a measure of stability in the prime cattle market.Highlights included a record price of 13,000gns for a Simmental bull at the spring bull sale at Thainstone and a heifer and calves selling for up to £5,200.“The prospects for the beef market for the second half of the year are looking good, but there are real concerns about the rising cost of fodder and straw due to the diversion of distillery co-products into the energy market and the switch to ryegrass on some farms to feed anaerobic digesters,” he said. “We could do with some rain to make sure silage crops bulk up although some farmers have been cutting grass early for silage out of fear of grass burning up.”Although some older farmers were tending to cut back breeding cow numbers to make life easier for themselves, there were fewer suckler herd dispersals this spring and very few cows and calves have been coming on the market.                                                                                                        Prime and cull cattle manager, Tim McDonald, expects the steady trade for prime cattle to continue and perhaps strengthen in the next few weeks and reports a particularly strong trade for fleshy cull cows. He is looking to England’s involvement in the World Cup in Russia, coupled with the forecast of good weather, to stimulate barbecue parties south of the border and boost the burger market.“The cull cow market has shown a big lift since April when farmers were too busy trying to catch up with drilling and the late spring. Demand for good, fleshy cows for the processing market is particularly strong and we have seen prices hit a top of £1,830,” said Mr McDonald.He also suggests it would be worthwhile for dairy farmers to consider feeding cull dairy cows to put on more flesh rather than marketing them in lean condition at the end of lactation.“The auction system is leading the way in cull cow prices and dairy farmers have the opportunity of making more money from well-fleshed cull dairy cows to supplement their income from milk,” he said.                                                                                                        The first real marker of the new season will be the show and sale of store cattle at Thainstone Centre on Friday, July 13, and as always some of the top suckled calves and stores from the summer shows will be on offer at the annual Spectacular show and sale on August 24.Turning to the sheep market, the phenomenal market for old season lamb continued right through the spring and ANM’s weekly sale at Thainstone Centre was still attracting up to 2,000 head right to the end of May.Prices peaked on April 5 when 4,782 head averaged 284.3p/kg (£126.21/head) with record numbers the following week attracting a massive entry of 7,952 to average 250.5p (£109.72/head).“The strongly rising market saw the auction ring come into its own as prices increased week after week,” said deputy livestock manager, Colin Slessor. “The level of prices achieved would never have been attained without the auction system leading the way and resulting in the strongest spring market for sheep we have seen for many years.“Those hoggs will have been bought in the trough of last autumn’s store trade when prices were down £5/head on the year. Finishers have enjoyed the double benefit of a lower purchase price and a high sale price which will have boosted margins and should augur well for this year’s autumn store lamb sales.”                                                                                                        Trade is being driven by a combination of strong demand, both on the home market and for the export market to Europe, and reduced imports from New Zealand.This season’s prime lamb market has started off on a high with some lambs hitting £130 - £140/head, and the cull ewe trade also rising sharply, peaking at £200 with pure Texels and Suffolks realising £170 - £190/head.The prospects remain encouraging and numbers will start building up from July onwards. Again, the auction system will be a vital element in ensuring producers achieve the best price available on the market.Despite weather problems during lambing, many farms are reporting a good lambing and good lamb numbers. The fantastic weather through May has transformed the performance of lambs as grass growth has taken off and lambs are set to reach the market early and in good order.The availability of grass has also triggered the market for ewes with lambs at foot with prices up around £10/head. Mule hoggs with single lambs have been making up to £140/head.“The strong prime market will hopefully impact positively on store markets which were in the doldrums last autumn,” says Mr Slessor.“The store lamb trade has been buoyant and prices have increased significantly, with finishers achieving good margins on last year’s lambs. Lamb producers in the Highlands and Islands certainly need a lift in price to give them a much needed boost following last year’s disappointing autumn trade.”With more ewe lambs being culled this year, rather than retained for breeding, trade and demand for gimmers is also likely to be stronger.Aberdeen and Northern Marts’ auction staff look forward to meeting customers at the forthcoming summer shows. The mart will have stands at the New Deer, Caithness, Turriff, Black Isle and Keith shows where auctioneers and field staff will be present to discuss the prospects for the autumn trade.

By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin.

He will be succeeded by Ian Ross, the former East Sutherland and Edderton Highland councillor.Sir Anthony\u0026rsquos decision to step down ends a long association with the area which started in 1993 when he was appointed as chairman of the then UK Atomic Energy Authority. He later chaired AEA Technology and in 2004 took on the role of leading the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) which was responsible for decommissioning Dounreay.In 2008, the then local MP John Thurso asked Sir Anthony to chair Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership. He took on the role and says it has been \u0026ldquoan honour and a privilege to do it.\u0026ldquoI have enjoyed all my time here in my various jobs, he said. \u0026ldquoI do think the partnership has made a major contribution.\u0026ldquoTen years ago the mood was pretty depressed. People were very gloomy. I would say the mood now has changed and is pretty optimistic, although there are challenges. That will always be the case.\u0026ldquoThe big advantage we have here is that it will be a number of years before Dounreay is closed so we had an opportunity to plan for the future. If it had been a car plant it would have been closed in three months.Sir Anthony highlights positive developments such as the improvements at Scrabster and Wick harbours as well as the pioneering MeyGen tidal energy project and the Beatrice offshore wind farm.The North Coast 500 is also making an impact and bringing economic opportunities to the area. The Nucleus archive across from Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport is another plus for Caithness, he adds. Sir Anthony played a part in bringing the facility to the county during his time as chairman of the NDA.Engineering and environmental courses at North Highland College UHI can also help regenerate the Caithness economy. \u0026ldquoThere are real opportunities here, he declared.Improving infrastructure and transport links in the far north are key to helping the area\u0026rsquos economy. Good schools and hospitals are another factor.\u0026ldquoI think the partnership has made a real contribution in the last 10 years, Sir Anthony said. \u0026ldquoWe have worked with other agencies to help create around 1000 jobs over that time but we all had to work together to do it. I am very pleased to see progress being made.Sir Anthony feels it is important to make Caithness as \u0026ldquoattractive as possible for people to come and work in the area.\u0026ldquoThere are still issues to be addressed but, overall, I think significant progress has been made. We played a part but it has always been a contributory role. The partnership is an enabler. The Scottish government has said this area could be an example for other places to follow.Sir Anthony says there is an expertise at Dounreay which \u0026ldquoa lot of places would give their eye teeth to have and it could be used to help the local economy.Caithness strengths are its people, their skills and the natural beauty of the place, but access to the area needs to be improved.Asked about any disappointments during his time as chairman of the partnership, he replied: \u0026ldquoI hoped MeyGen would have got the Contract for Difference \u0026ndash it covers an agreement on the price for the electricity generated \u0026ndash from the UK government, but they did not. That was disappointing. They will now have to find another way forward but are looking at opportunities.Sir Anthony decided to retire as he felt 10 years as chairman was long enough. \u0026ldquoI wanted to leave before people wanted me to, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was time for a change.\u0026ldquoI am delighted with the choice of Ian Ross as my successor. I have had discussions with him and would be willing to help him in any way I can.Sir Anthony, who is 80, will keep a watchful eye on what is happening in Caithness and plans to stay active with his many other interests and hobbies. He enjoys opera, and swims five times a week.He started his career as a systems engineer with IBM in 1962 and went on to become its chief executive and chairman.Sir Anthony and his wife Jennie live in London and have a son, Paul, and a daughter, Caroline.Tuesday 3 Jul 2018 9:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Subsea 7 order hailed as very good news for Caithness","story":"A MULTIMILLION-pound order that has been won by Subsea 7 and will create up to 130 jobs was described yesterday as \u0026ldquovery good news for Caithness.The company has been awarded a contract by Shell for a development at its Penguins field which lies 150 miles north east of Shetland.Subsea 7, which has yards at Wester and Hastigrow, will build two pipeline bundles in Caithness as part of the deal. One is 4.6 kilometres long and the other 2.7 kilometres.They will be used by Shell to develop the potential reserves in the Penguins field.Subsea7\u0026rsquos local site manager, Willie Watt, said: \u0026ldquoWe would be looking to make a start on this project by the autumn of next year and launch in the late spring of 2020.\u0026ldquoThis is very good news for the site and for Caithness. It is a testament to the capabilities of the people and the product that major companies keep coming back to us.The confirmation of the latest contract comes just months after Subsea 7 won an order from Statoil for its Snorre oil and gas field in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. Its total value was said to be between \u0026pound150 million and \u0026pound300m.Work on that contract is expected to get under way in September with three launches due to be completed by November next year.The orders will see the company\u0026rsquos local workforce increase from around 30, at present, to up to 160.\u0026ldquoThis will give us continual work in Caithness until 2020, although there will be peaks and troughs along the way \u0026ndash but this is great news all round, Mr Watt added.Jonathan Tame, company vice president for the UK and Canada, said: \u0026ldquoWe are pleased to have the opportunity to bring our extensive expertise to a project of this importance.\u0026ldquoIn doing so it demonstrates Shell\u0026rsquos confidence in our value-adding solutions, and continues a successful North Sea collaboration that has been in place since 1984.The Penguins field was discovered in 1974 and first developed in 2002.The three pipeline bundles for Statoil will involve the largest diameter pipe assembled in the far north.The bulk of the fabrication will be done in Caithness, with design and project management work due to be undertaken at Subsea7\u0026rsquos premises in Aberdeen and at Stavanger in Norway.At the time that order was announced in December last year, Mr Watt said: \u0026ldquoIt is good to have Statoil back. The last bundle we did for them was in 2003.\u0026ldquoIt is an important project and shows pipeline bundles are the preference for developing the North Sea sector. It is the right product at the right time.The Statoil order will include pipeline bundles and control umbilicals required for the development.The Snorre field is sited within the Tampen area of the Norwegian North Sea.Since the last pipeline was launched in Caithness in March last year, the company has refurbished the rail track which is used to transport the bundles to the sea and on to the tugs before being taken to their destination.Tuesday 3 Jul 2018 9:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116401.jpg","title":"Sunny conditions set to continue all week in Caithness","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCAITHNESS and other parts of the north are set to enjoy more dry and settled conditions under gin-blue skies coupled with virtually unbroken sunshine for the remainder of the week and beyond.On Sunday afternoon the air temperature in Wick peaked at 21.6C (70.9F).\u0026nbspLast Thursday morning the town witnessed a high of 22.5C (72.5F), making it the warmest day in the burgh for any day in June since 2011.The highest temperature recorded in Wick since 1910 is currently 26.7C (80.1F), witnessed on June 6, 1939.

The move would save \u0026pound300,000.Five of the proposed closures were in Caithness and included Thurso harbour, the Camps at Wick, Halkirk, Keiss and Lybster.The council hoped nearby local businesses would adopt the Highland Comfort Scheme and provide public toilets at their premises in exchange for a monthly fee.But there was widespread opposition throughout the north to the closure plan which was seen as damaging to the area and its tourism industry.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay backs the reprieve.\u0026ldquoI absolutely welcome this, he said. \u0026ldquoThis review will give us the opportunity to look at local needs and those of the tourists. It may also give us an incentive to reintroduce the comfort scheme and think about other ways of running the public toilets.\u0026ldquoIf we could get a fixed rate for things like electricity and get development trusts or local communities to look after the toilets that would be a great help. I am pretty confident we could get people throughout the county to help out.\u0026ldquoElectricity companies make huge amounts of money and a little consideration from them would go a long way.Highland Council announced the review after it listened to feedback from communities across the north.Councillor Allan Henderson, the chairman of environment, development and infrastructure, said there is \u0026ldquono quick fix to the problem.But he added: \u0026ldquoThis is about working with communities and potential Highland Comfort Scheme providers to enable a different public toilet delivery model that is sustainable and affordable in local communities.The decision means the toilets under threat of closure will now remain open until the end of October.The controversy over the proposed toilet closure plan has led to local MP Jamie Stone writing to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.In his letter he stresses the contribution tourism makes to the local economyHe describes the plan as \u0026ldquoa backward step which will lead to \u0026ldquogreat inconvenience for locals and visitors alike and said it is being driven by the need to make budget savings.The Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross MP asked the First Minister if additional financial support could be provided to keep the toilets open.\u0026ldquoAny help that can be afforded by the Scottish Government would be very gratefully received by the Highland Council and the people of my constituency, he said.Meanwhile, Highland Council has agreed to review its car-parking policy.The local authority\u0026rsquos redesign board has recommended a new \u0026ldquovision for parking that will addresses traffic management, integrated transport and local economic growth and tourism.

When this work was completed in 1996, the ship was taken out of service.An initiative was later launched to preserve the vessel as a floating cultural monument.This ship is representative of a type of specialised vessel from a unique period in the history of Norwegian lighthouses and is open to the public today, Wednesday, afternoon 2pm-6pm, the again from 10am-Noon and 2pm \u0026#8211 6pm on Thursday.More details about the visit of the ship in The Orcadian next week.\u0026nbsp            \u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

His first order of priority, however, must be the unfinished business of implementing cheaper ferry fares on ferry routes serving Orkney and Shetland.“Having already waited a decade since the government first introduced RET on west coast routes, people in the Northern Isles should not have to wait any longer.“The First Minister promised RET in the first half of 2018. That means Michael Matheson must deliver before parliament rises for the summer recess at the end of this week.”Mr Halcro Johnston says that the Northern Isles have been left in limbo by the RET uncertainties, adding that he has written to Mr Matheson in a bid to see the RET commitment delivered.He said: “The new transport secretary has just days to implement RET for ferry fares to Orkney and Shetland, in line with commitment made by his predecessor and after years of promises from the SNP.“The constant delays we have seen regarding RET have caused real uncertainty in the Northern Isles and have left residents and visitors unable to plan journeys knowing what the eventual costs will be.\u0026#8221            \u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

All we are now waiting for is confirmation that it’s fully legal and then we can get on with implementing it. Our lawyers have told us that because we are a commercial operation and currently receive no subsidy whatsoever, we have to be 100 per cent sure that this scheme complies otherwise our whole business is at risk. We are not sure why it is taking so long to get simple confirmation.“Although not one penny of the proposed subsidy comes to us, it goes directly to the passenger, we would be forced to pay it all back if it doesn’t comply, that could ruin us and we can’t take that risk. All we are asking for is for the Scottish Government to check that it’s legal with the EU and UK and then we can get on with it. We have written to the new Minister Michael Matheson MSP and invited him to visit the island and meet our staff so we can share our concerns with him directly and hopefully he will visit soon so we can get this unlocked.“We have also today asked for a meeting with our local MSP Liam McArthur to see if he can do anything to get things moving forward on our behalf. This is extremely frustrating but as a family run, fully commercial Orcadian business, employing 70 people and with exciting expansion plans, we cannot put at risk our business until we are certain the Scottish Government’s proposal fully comply.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Pam\u0026rsquos paintings are absolutely fantastic and we hope this event is a great success.\"Since the age of 63, Pam\u0026nbsphas painted hundreds of pictures, been a member of art groups and exhibited locally.Until recently she also\u0026nbspknitted clothes for infants in the special baby unit at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness and was a puzzle enthusiast, winning the Ross-shire Journal crossword at the age of 99.She celebrated her 100th birthday surrounded by friends and family at the Church of Scotland Hall in the village last year after a neighbour of 36 years\u0026rsquo standing, Joyce Fraser, decided to organise something special to mark the milestone event.Mrs Foster was also joined by friends from the local WRI and art group, along with\u0026nbspstaff and residents of the care home she was about to move to.

Her husband passed away in January 2012.Asked the secret of her long life, she said: \"I\u0026rsquove been asked this before and I always say \u0026lsquopure living\u0026rsquo, but of course it\u0026rsquos not!

It also found that 62 per cent of posts are in professional occupations.Eilean Siar, Glasgow and Highland are the three areas with the highest number of jobs in which Gaelic is considered essential, together accounting for 93 per cent of the Scottish total.The study was welcomed by Deputy First Minister, John Swinney, who commented that the growth in desirable and essential jobs making use of Gaelic language would provide young people with a wealth of exciting career choices.\"I hope that this report will encourage more people to consider learning Gaelic,\" he added.As well as looking at the demand for Gaelic language skills, the report looks at Gaelic education, analyses the opportunities and challenges, and suggests future action.Damien Yeates, chief Executive of SDS, said: \"Developing a detailed evidence base of current and future skills demand is essential for all parts of our economy, and the Gaelic language labour market is no exception.\"Last year SDS published the second edition of its Gaelic language plan, and this study was one of the key commitments contained in that plan.\"The evidence will help inform future investment aimed at promoting the Gaelic language and culture.\"Shona MacLennan, chief executive of B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig, commented: \"B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig is clear that growing the number of Gaelic-essential jobs and jobs which use Gaelic is important in ensuring that Gaelic is used more often, by more people and in a wider range of situations.\"The key challenge is to ensure that the flow of people with high quality Gaelic language skills entering the labour market is matched to the demand from employers across the public, private and third sectors, and from across Scotland.\"\u0026nbspFuture actions proposed in the report include forming a national group with responsibility for Gaelic language skills, and increased monitoring and evaluation of the activities supporting the language.Charlotte Wright, Chief Executive of Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE), said: \"Gaelic is fundamental to HIE\u0026rsquos unique remit which integrates economic and community development throughout the Highlands and Islands.\"Our support has helped numerous organisations which enable Gaelic to flourish, and we look forward to continuing to work with businesses, social enterprises and community organisations that can add value through using Gaelic to help realise its full potential.\"Tuesday 3 Jul 2018 9:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

She added that Scottish Schools for the Future funding was welcome but added that current levels of funding from Holyrood are \"simply not enough to adequately invest in our schools\".She urged the Scottish Government to provide funding levels which recognise the unique challenges facing the Highlands, \"and in particular the very large number of schools, many of which are smaller schools, requiring urgent investment\".And she called for it to consider capacity pressures when allocating funding.\"If Kate Forbes wants to help Highland schools, then she should support our asks from government.\"Tuesday 3 Jul 2018 9:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4762286.1530442869!/image/image.jpg","title":"in pictures liam gallagher closes day 2 of trnsmt festival","story":"\t\tTens of thousands of music lovers once again flocked to a sold out Glasgow Green for day two of Scotland\u0026#8217s biggest music festival, and as TRNSMT fans bathed in glorious temperatures - with Glasgow reaching higher temperatures than Madrid \u0026#8211 acts like Gerry Cinnamon, Kyle Falconer, Courteeners and Krept and Konan took to the stage.\t\t\t\t• VIEW THE FULL GALLERY HERE            Kicking things off on the Main Stage were Glasgow’s very own The LaFontaines with frontman Kerr Okan delighting the crowd as the band made their second consecutive appearance at the festival.            Addressing the audience, Kerr Okan, said: “Glasgow you look so good in the sunshine! Thanks for watching us, you are part of this band!”Shed Seven followed with hits including ‘Disco Down’ and ‘Going for Gold’ as well as a cover of Stone Roses ‘I Am the Resurrection’ Krept x Konan, the London-based hip-hop duo who have seen a gradual rise to prominence over the last few years, took to the stage before the arrival  of possibly the most anticipated performance of TRNSMT’s first weekend - Gerry Cinnamon’s Main Stage set. Just one year ago the local star took to the King Tut’s Powered by Utilita Stage, now a year later thousands of fans displayed their adoration for the one man show with just an acoustic guitar the singer-songwriter from Castlemilk once again had the crowd eating out of his hands.             Fans over on the King Tut’s Powered by Utilita Stage were also treated to a strong line-up of both promising and established acts throughout the day, including openers The Night Café, BAS, The Academic, Scottish natives The Snuts and Kyle Falconer, who provided an insight into his upcoming solo album. Ramz and IAMDDB continued the party into the early evening, before The Sherlocks closed proceedings with their straight-down-the-line indie sound.As the evening rocked on, Wolf Alice’s performed hits such as ‘Silk’ and newer material including ‘Don’t Delete the Kisses’, before the Courteeners took the Main Stage.Ten years on from the release of their, now iconic, debut album St Jude, Courteeners wowed their fans with tunes like ‘Not Nineteen Forever’, ‘Notion’ and ‘Cavorting’.            Headline act Liam Gallagher then arrived stating: “So this is the famous Glasgow Green then? I’ve heard a lot about it.” The former Oasis frontman’s performance then documented his 25-year career as one of the country’s most popular figures, with solo tunes such as ‘Wall of Glass’ and ‘Greedy Soul’ tucked between Oasis classics such as ‘Morning Glory’ and ‘Wonderwall’.Geoff Ellis, Festival Director said: “Today has had so many highlights from the mass Shed Seven singalong to the absolute class of Liam Gallagher’s set. One of the biggest moments for me was watching local boy Gerry Cinnamon completely command the Main Stage in front of his biggest ever crowd. This felt like a real tipping point performance that people will be talking about for years to come. A future TRNSMT headliner was born.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4762402.1530517494!/image/image.jpg","title":"brian monteith another referendum looms just so the snp keep power","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...\t\tNicola Sturgeon will instigate another divisive vote for good or ill, all to keep her party in government, writes Brian Monteith.\t\t\t\tFor those that have not read my columns before, let me state what to others is obvious. I am a unionist with a lower case “u”.             By that I mean I am not committed to any one unionist party and am willing to give non-unionist parties a fair hearing if they apply liberal, low tax, small government policies in Scotland, because I believe these are what will most likely deliver as harmonious and prosperous a Scotland for the vast majority of its people as is practicably possible.            Nor do I support unionism because I think an independent Scotland could not succeed one just has to look at other smaller countries to see that if Denmark or Norway can do well then surely so could Scotland – if it lived within its means.No, I am unionist because I am at home with being Scottish and British. It was in my mother’s milk that I suckled on it was in my rearing through infancy and schooldays and my travelling around the UK as a youth and then an undergraduate. I have rejoiced in our rich and diverse cultural history during my British holidays, just as I enjoy the internal home nations’ rivalries or competition between Scotland’s cities or the Highlands and Lowlands. I can see the good in them and the faults in them, but I do see and feel a tangible unifying oneness, a bond that I cannot let go of.So when I see the bitter divisions that came out of the first independence referendum – the splitting of families, the loss of friends and the rising tide of implied or discreet threats, sometimes with genuine menace – then I fear what another independence referendum could do to our country. At the age of 60 this year, I do not think the psychological wounds of 2014 will be healed before I leave this Earth – were there to be a second referendum then I have absolutely no doubt it will be ugly and the scarring divisions that much greater. Yet I have to tell you I also believe there will be another and it will not be pretty, and whatever the outcome it will need real leadership to bring about a healing. Sadly, there are few leaders of any humility or calibre that I think could achieve such a highly desirable role.I believe there will be another independence referendum because all the signs point to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon wishing and now needing it to be so, and for good or ill she will instigate it.             The original SNP strategy was that if, when in government, it could show a SNP-run Scotland was no worse or maybe even slightly better than the Labour-Liberal Democrat administrations before, then independence might not seem such an undesirable leap. On many issues this meant the SNP actually did very little it promised for instance, the council tax was not abolished in favour of a local income tax, nor were students loans written off.When in 2011 the SNP won its overall majority it still did not seek to frighten the horses for fear of losing potential supporters for independence. Other than centralising institutions (under the mistaken guise of saving money), public service reform was studiously avoided. Scotland was in stasis while the independence White Paper, Scotland’s Future, was published, and following the 55-45 defeat no ­serious public service reform has followed.The SNP is essentially averse to challenging the vested interests in health and education, for to do so must force some people to be against them when they need to build a coalition for Yes (or more likely “Leave”) the second time round.After 11 years of SNP government we are therefore at a point where, under its watch, education is much worse with falling numeracy and literacy and collapsing international rankings expose the truth of this the Scottish NHS too is failing with the worst cancer treatment times in history and four health boards now requiring emergency loans totalling over £70 million just to get by meanwhile the iconic Queensferry Crossing yet again requires further remedial work that will disrupt traffic all summer and our public roads now have more craters than the surface of the Moon.             These are just some examples, for when you turn over any Scottish Government stone the problems come crawling out like clipshears and wood lice.Last week Sturgeon had a shambolic ministerial reshuffle that was bad on two counts. Firstly, she appointed a narcissist tweeter with a criminal conviction as Justice Secretary, when the role requires a solemn and judicious politician with a character, like Caesar’s wife, that is beyond suspicion. Secondly she not only retained her financial secretary, Derek Mackay, who has presided over a growing black hole that no quantum physicist can explain, she actually added to his brief. Ultimately this void will swallow up her government. Then she retained her Education Secretary, John Swinney, when by the evidence of his own inactions he has utterly failed to deliver the necessary reforms for what is claimed to be her “number one priority” of schooling.That was before the wheels came of the reshuffle tea trolley with the withdrawal of Gillian Martin as education minister.             The strategy for a second independence referendum was originally to use any and every grievance with Westminster – and where none existed, to create some – so momentum for a referendum could then be held. That is clearly not working. Nor by 20,000 leagues is the original model of demonstrating competence.All that is now left is for Sturgeon to take us into a second referendum – with or without Westminster’s necessary legal consent – so she can polarise the country and thus galvanise personal support to have any chance of the SNP remaining the largest party after the next Holyrood elections in 2021.Glorious victory – or more likely, glorious defeat whatever the cost to Scotland – is worth it if it means remaining in control of government. No longer is a second referendum about winning independence, it is about retaining power. Scotland will be thrown to the wolves to whip up division so in the aftermath disappointed supporters will flock to the SNP. Sturgeon cares not for the country’s harmony, prosperity or public services – she cares only for the SNP being in position to have a third tilt at independence.Such is the sorry state of our nation.

I’m so tired I could cry. \u2028In the morning, we’re taking my son to Thomas The Tank Engine Land and we decided to drive down on Sunday evening to avoid the traffic.             I don’t want to have to work on what should be the first day of a family holiday, which means pulling an all-nighter, so I can file without missing quality time with my children.            This time last week, I was in another hotel in London. The week before that, Edinburgh. Or was it Salford? Or Dundee? It’s hard to say, if I’m honest. The workload has fried my brain to the point I often cannot recall the prior day’s events when asked what I’ve been up to. I feel like I am losing my mind. Every day bleeds into the next, with no respite in sight. But complaining about the fact I feel like I am on the cliff-edge of a mental health crisis seems utterly futile because, from the outside, it appears I am enjoying wonderful, unprecedented success. Success for which I ought to be grateful.Of course, I am grateful. If anything, I am in a state of permanent disbelief about what is going on. The truth is I haven’t had a minute to reflect on or even savour anything that has happened since November last year when the publication of my book began a chain of events that culminated, last Monday, in being awarded the coveted Orwell Prize.More people than ever seem to want to speak to me, for different reasons. Some just want to say, “well done” and others want to share their stories. Some want to me to come and visit their projects and others want to buy the film and TV rights to my life story.             I did some business in London last week that will make your eyes bulge out of their sockets when its announced, yet somehow, in this haze of physical and emotional exasperation, nothing feels real. I don’t even feel real.READ MORE: Scotsman columnist Darren McGarvey wins Orwell Prize for political writingPeople love a good rags-to-riches story. Hell, I know I do. But imagine how surreal it feels when you become the centre of one. You are suddenly inundated with requests, calls, offers and correspondence, without any frame of reference for what is going on. It’s incredibly disorientating and sometimes frightening, if I’m honest. But there is rarely an opportunity to express that truth, because you are always being prompted to describe how it feels to become “successful”. People want to hear a specific story. The story about a diamond in the rough, escaping poverty, surviving neglect and abuse to become an award-winning author. People are less interested in what it took to get into this position.             The fact I am struggling mentally and emotionally is even less interesting. The details about my cluster migraines, abscesses and insomnia are met with looks of confusion, as people instinctively attempt to direct me away from what I want to say and back to the “narrative”: my capitalist hero-journey. They don’t want to hear about the thousands I’ve spent on hotels, trains and flights, travelling this island by myself, with a heavy bag over my shoulder and a box of books under my arm, literally selling hand-to-hand. The hundreds of books I’ve purchased with my own money, to sign and post all over the world to plug gaping holes in my finances. They don’t want to hear about the anxiety attacks I often experience as notifications flood my devices or the fear I suffer every time I give an interview to a newspaper or broadcaster. Nobody cares that I live in constant dread that I will misspeak on a sensitive issue and become a target for people online. Nobody is interested in me describing what it feels like to come home after weeks of being on the road, to find my two-year old sitting with his back to me – his way of letting me know he isn’t pleased with my absence. I haven’t made a penny off my book yet. I am living off advances. But any time I try to express that these overwhelming mundanities – and not the successes – are what currently consume every moment of my waking life, I feel the weight of other people’s expectations bearing down on me.

I haven’t had a minute to take anything in. I run around like a mad-man, I fall asleep somewhere, and I wake up and do it all again. Every. Single. Day. No matter who I speak to, my constant refrain – that I am in urgent need of rest and fear I may be heading for a fall – never seems to be heard. The only thing I haven’t been offered in the last seven days is a good night’s sleep. I feel obligated to so many people, for different reasons, that my own needs fall to the bottom of the hierarchy of concern. My problems are marked as low-priority and so must remain hidden, revealed only in late-night social media outbursts when I feel trapped on Scotland’s decrepit public transportation network.All I need is a few days where I am not expected to do anything. Where I am not obligated to speak to anybody. Where I can gather my thoughts and rejuvenate after two years of non-stop, high-pressure work, couched in constant financial insecurity and stress. Anybody getting any ideas that I’m too far removed from the working class to write about it, ought to refer to my seven-day-a-week schedule for proof that I am more working class now than I ever was – with no holiday entitlement.

He has warned they will not sign up to anything short of a clean break, prompting fellow Sir Alan Duncan, a fellow Tory MP and Government minister, to criticise Rees-Mogg’s “insolence”. “The ideological right are a minority despite their noise and should pipe down,” he tweeted.

If the UK cannot decide what it wants, it will end up getting exactly what they want. Politicians of all parties need to realise the old fault lines do not apply on this issue and that, for the sake of the nation, they must form an ad hoc ‘national coalition of the sensible’ to secure a Brexit deal that will outrage the hardliners but save the economy from disaster.READ MORE: Lesley Riddoch: Doomsday report exposes Brexit vulnerability"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4762976.1530605815!/image/image.jpg","title":"paris gourtsoyannis media is doing its job over brexit dark money","story":"\t\tDUP Brexit spending raises concerns about the law, not about how it was reported, writes Paris Gourtsoyannis.\t\t\t\tIn the final days of the EU referendum campaign, the Democratic Unionist Party paid for a wrap-around advert in the , calling on voters to “take back control”.            The message reached far beyond Northern Ireland, where the  isn’t even sold, and should have been far beyond their means – an advert like that costs more than a quarter of a million pounds. The DUP spent less than £100,000 on an entire devolved election campaign in 2016.            In fact, the party that now keeps the Conservatives in power spent an incredible £425,000 on Brexit, buying a lot besides newspaper advertising. How they came into that money might have remained a secret, but for intense political and media pressure.Electoral rules in Northern Ireland did not, until recently, require parties to declare where they had got their money from – a legacy of the Troubles. We might never have found out that the DUP’s Brexit campaign was bankrolled by the Constitutional Research Council (CRC), a shadowy group headed by a former Scottish Conservative Party chairman and parliamentary candidate, Richard Cook.The CRC doesn’t file accounts and has no public face. We have no idea where it gets its money – and the only person who knows, Cook, isn’t saying. Meanwhile, his own business dealings have come under intense scrutiny.READ MORE: SNP calls for investigation into ‘shady business’ of Vote Leave fundingAll of this has been reported over the past 18 months. The journalists Peter Geoghegan and Adam Ramsay, writing for Open Democracy, have been the most dogged, but they’ve been abetted by other outlets.            The latest revelations about Cook’s previous activities were the product of an investigation by BBC Northern Ireland, and were picked up and reported by BBC Scotland. Cook is an elusive character, but was doorstepped by Channel 4 News and challenged to reveal where the CRC’s money came from. When the CRC was first named by the DUP, the news was splashed on the front page of the Herald, and the story had also been reported by its sister paper, the Sunday Herald, and other publications, including The Scotsman.The DUP donation has been linked to wider claims of cooperation between different Brexit campaigns in breach of electoral spending law, stemming from the widely reported Cambridge Analytica controversy. The central allegation is that money was passed to different groups to avoid legal spending limits – a claim that has been denied, but which is under investigation by the Electoral Commission.The facts are that the DUP spent £32,000 with data firm AIQ, which also received 40 per cent of the official Vote Leave campaign budget, as well as nearly £675,000 from another campaign group, BeLeave. When the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Chris Wylie told MPs he was “absolutely convinced” the spending represented a breach of electoral law, that was reported in The Scotsman.All this serves as a lengthy run up to this: when Nicola Sturgeon echoed the Twitter hordes by saying she was “surprised there aren’t more media questions being asked” about what the SNP is calling ‘dark money’, I shared her surprise.            Engaging with people who question the how, why and why not of stories in the Scottish media is usually pointless – they are almost always motivated by political partisanship, a deep attachment to conspiracy theory, and a lack of understanding about how the news today works. Those traits shouldn’t be encouraged.If critics want to see what is a complicated story delved into more deeply, then they have to accept that the biggest problem with the so-called ‘mainstream’ media in Scotland is that there isn’t enough of it – that sort of work takes resources, mainly time. Many of the wounds of the media industry were self-inflicted. It doesn’t help for elected politicians to keep punching them. Above all, the details already uncovered in the story of the DUP’s Brexit cash have amply demonstrated that rules around political donations lack transparency, particularly in relation to Northern Ireland. In a world were ‘calling out’ something is seen as akin to political action, the media’s critics have somehow convinced themselves the problem is that not enough is being written. Actually, it’s that not enough is being done.

An action plan published by the Scottish Government says shops should be stopped from providing “triggers” that encourage customers to indulge in food high in fat, salt and sugar.            Around a fifth of the average Scottish person’s daily calorie intake comes from so-called “discretionary foods” with little or no nutritional value, it adds.

READ MORE: In Pictures: 16 sweets you’ll remember if you grew up in ScotlandAs well as banning multi-buy deals on unhealthy foods, restrictions could also be placed on unlimited refills of sugary drinks and the offer of incentives such as a free toy or loyalty points.             Lunchtime meal deals, which see shoppers encouraged to buy a drink and crisps or snack alongside a sandwich for a fixed price, could also come to an end as a result of the plans. However, the action plan says restrictions will only apply to foods with “little or no essential nutrients”, meaning that popular foods such as pizzas may escape the ban. Being overweight or obese ‘the norm’ The document warns that being overweight or obese is now “the norm” for Scottish adults, with almost two-thirds (65 per cent) in this category – a figure largely unchanged in the last decade.             It says Scots live increasingly sedentary lifestyles and are “bombarded” by messages encouraging them to eat unhealthily, adding that simply relying on people to change their habits themselves is not enough. It proposes the creation of an advertising code of practice which would restrict junk food advertising at bus shelters, train stations and on public transport. The new strategy also focuses on children and early years, with plans for a pre-conception campaign to encourage women to start pregnancy at a health weight. “Far too many people in Scotland face serious risks to their health linked to poor diet and unhealthy weight,” said public health minister Joe Fitzpatrick. “This is unacceptable and it’s largely avoidable. Scotland has a proud history of taking decisive action on public health and this is the next step in that journey.”             The plans were welcomed by healthy eating campaigners, but Cancer Research UK said it was “vital” that they led to enforceable laws so supermarkets were compelled to take action. The Scottish Conservatives also welcomed what it described as a “U-turn” from ministers on banning two-for-one pizza deals. “That was ill-thought through and would have hit families simply trying to buy an affordable meal that adults and children can enjoy,” said the party’s health spokesman Miles Briggs.This story first appeared on our sister site iNews."},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers. But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 19 ","story":"Shetland’s young sports competitors retained their hold on the Stuart Cup at the weekend, with the margin of victory, in the end, being fairly comfortable.\nGoing into the last event of the junior inter-county, the netball, Orkney had to win by 32 points to overhaul the visitors’ lead. Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct. It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"kia pro ceed ","story":"3dr Kia pro-ceed sr7, 4 year warranty remaining, one owner, full Kia service history, VGC inside \u0026amp out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve. My line-up is: Russia v Portugal, Spain v Uruguay, France v Argentina, Croatia v Denmark, Brazil v Sweden, Belgium v Japan, Germany v Switzerland and Senegal v England.\n: : : : : : : :\nThere has already been a healthy entry for our competition to name Shetland’s greatest football team of the past 60 years, but potential selectors still have a week and a half to make their minds up.\nThe main prize, a return trip for two people with car and cabin courtesy of NorthLink Ferries, is definitely not to be sneezed at. And there are also leather footballs from Cee \u0026amp Jays Intersport for the runners-up.\nSo whether you are a subscriber to the theory that the best players all hung their boots up decades ago, or you believe the standard of today is much better than yesteryear, get your thinking caps on and have a look at the details above. If the price of a stamp puts you off just email your entry to editorial@shetlandtimes\n: : : : : : : :\nEven those who detest cricket most may have raised a modest eyebrow last week when the Scottish team shocked England with victory in a one-day match at Edinburgh.\nReaders, whether they follow the game or not, may be interested that there was actually a player in the home side’s ranks with Shetland connections.\nA glance at the Scottish team sheet may suggest possible contenders – how about Michael Leask, Mark Watt or even Dylan Budge for instance?\nBut it was none of those. The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"health board in talks for better airport waiting area in aberdeen ","story":"NHS Shetland has been in talks to look at an alternative waiting area for patients flying back from Aberdeen Airport – rather than what has been described by a councillor as \u0026#8220a drafty corridor\u0026#8221.\nHealth board chief executive Ralph Roberts raised the issue during a Zetland Transport Partnership meeting on Tuesday afternoon.\nMr Roberts said there had been discussions with Loganair to look an alternative and he was having more talks about the matter on Friday.\nHe said there had been a suggestion that NHS Shetland should be obliged to pay for a lounge for passengers, but added in his own view it was a matter for all passengers travelling to Shetland.\nMr Roberts argued if the waiting area were adequate for all passengers it would be adequate for patients too.\nZetTrans chairman Ryan Thomson thanked Mr Roberts for bringing it to members\u0026#8217 attention.\nMr Thomson added \u0026#8220it\u0026#8217s a drafty corridor\u0026#8221, the issue had been raised at other transport meetings and Loganair was aware of the issue.\n\n \u0026raquo\nYet again, this is just so typical.

The wooden boat was taking in water in rough seas in the Roost.\n into Lerwick harbour.\nShetland Coastguard watch officer Alex Dodge said: “The 14 on board were all safe and well. The skipper handled the situation extremely well.”\nThe 40-year-old converted fishing boat, with an all-female crew and female passengers, was heading to Shetland for a diving trip, and will be in the isles for the next few weeks.\n since January last year and has 22 years experience as a power boat instructor, said she called the coastguard as a precaution.\n was [originally] a fishing boat and well able for the conditions.”\nThe problem started when the boat began taking in water from the rudder gland and a deck hatch, she said. The boat was equipped with a three bilge-pump system but one of the pumps had failed, meaning they only had one as back-up. Ms Weaver said: “We try to be two failures away from a problem.” Also, she said, she had to “err on the side of caution” because the boat was carrying 12 passengers.\n was able to proceed “under her own power and pumping under her own power” into Lerwick. She is currently in the small boat harbour.\n and two sunken klondykers.\n is used for various types of dive trips, including recreational and wreck diving in locations in Orkney and Shetland, including Scapa Flow and Fair Isle as well as in northern Scotland and Faroe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}]
